{"title": "Sweden", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *s(w)e, meaning \"one's own\", referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period [16] [17] [18] The native Swedish name, Sverige (a compound of the words Svea and rike, first recorded in the cognate Swƒìorice in Beowulf), [19] translates as \"realm of the Swedes\", which excluded the Geats in G√∂taland.\n\n\nHistory\nSweden's prehistory begins in the Aller√∏d oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, [23] with Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania This period was characterised by small clans of hunter-gatherers who relied on flint technology [24]\n\n\nPrehistory\nSweden's prehistory begins in the Aller√∏d oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, [23] with Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania This period was characterised by small clans of hunter-gatherers who relied on flint technology [24]\n\n\nVikings\nThe Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard The Swedish Vikings, called Rus are believed to be the founders of Kievan Rus' [29] The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings saying:\n\n\nKingdom of Sweden\nThe actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown [34] Determining its age depends mostly on whether Sweden is considered a nation when the Svear (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the Svear and the G√∂tar (Geats) of G√∂taland were united under a single ruler In the former case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way The epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the sixth century.\n\n\nSwedish Empire\nSweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in multiple conflicts [52] During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631 [53] Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor, ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he was killed at the Battle of L√ºtzen in 1632 After the Battle of N√∂rdlingen in 1634, Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded [53] These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden and Wismar From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and Denmark-Norway fought the Torstenson War The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe [53] The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 granted Sweden territories in northern Germany.\n\n\nModern history\nThe Swedish East India Company began in 1731 The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden's west coast, the mouth of G√∂ta √§lv river is very wide and has the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city [78]\nBetween 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s [79] It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States [80] Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise [79] [81]\n\n\nWorld War I and World War II\nSweden was officially neutral during World War I However, under pressure from the German Empire, they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers ‚Äì most notably, mining the √òresund channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies [85] Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the White Guards against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied √Öland in cooperation with the German Empire.\n\n\nPost-war era\nSweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe [90] Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in co-operation with trade unions and industry The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations [91]\n\n\nRecent history\nA bursting real estate bubble caused by inadequate controls on lending combined with an international recession and a policy switch from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies resulted in a fiscal crisis in the early 1990s [95] Sweden's GDP declined by around 5% In 1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500% [96] [97]\n\n\nGeography\nSituated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from Norway Finland is located to its north-east It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the √ñresund Bridge Its border with Norway (1,619 km long) is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures; autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter The northern parts of the country have a subarctic climate while the central parts have a humid continental climate The coastal south can be defined as having either a humid continental climate using the 0¬†¬∞C isotherm, or an oceanic climate using the -3¬†¬∞C isotherm.\n\n\nVegetation\nSweden has a considerable south to north distance which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places Sweden is divided into five major vegetation zones These are:\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" (Folkr√∂relser), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979 [133]).\n\n\nConstitutional framework\nSweden has four fundamental laws (Swedish: grundlagar) which together form the Constitution: the Instrument of Government (Swedish: Regeringsformen), the Act of Succession (Swedish: Successionsordningen), the Freedom of the Press Act (Swedish: Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen), and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (Swedish: Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) [137] [138]\n\n\nElections\nFor over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag‚Äîthe Social Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Left Party‚Äîbefore the Green Party became the sixth party in the 1988 election In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the Christian Democrats and New Democracy It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the Sweden Democrats, gained Riksdag seats In the elections to the European Parliament, parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the June List (2004‚Äì2009), the Pirate Party (2009‚Äì2014), and Feminist Initiative (2014‚Äì2019).\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSweden is a unitary state divided into 21 regions (regioner) and 290 municipalities (kommuner) Every region corresponds to a county (l√§n) with a number of municipalities per county Regions and municipalities are both local governments but have different roles and separate responsibilities Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by regional councils Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities Gotland is a special case of being a region with only one municipality and the functions of region and municipality are performed by the same organisation [163]\n\n\nJudicial system\nThe courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts (allm√§nna domstolar) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts (allm√§nna f√∂rvaltningsdomstolar) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities [164] Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThroughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war [90]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe law is enforced in Sweden by several government entities The Swedish police is a Government agency concerned with police matters The National Task Force is a national SWAT unit within the police force The Swedish Security Service's responsibilities are counter-espionage, anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.\n\n\nEconomy\nSweden is the twelfth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance Sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration [175]\n\n\nEnergy\nSweden's energy market is largely privatised The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%) At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%) Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh [197] Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes.\n\n\nTransport\nSweden has 162,707¬†km (101,101¬†mi) of paved road and 1,428¬†km (887¬†mi) of expressways Motorways run through Sweden and over the √òresund Bridge to Denmark Sweden had left-hand traffic (v√§nstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as Dagen H.\n\n\nPublic policy\nSweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France, and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and Belgium [208] Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the ninth-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education [209] On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest [210]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn the 18th century, Sweden's scientific revolution took off Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.\n\n\nWaste management\nSweden is known for its efficient waste management system Only 0.7% of the total household waste is disposed, and the rest is reused [234] Around 52% of its waste is used for energy production (that is burnt) and 47% recycled [235] [236] About two million tonnes of waste are imported from neighbouring countries to make profitable recycling products [234] As of 2023 report, Sweden generated 1.7 billion euros in 2020 (the highest so far was 1.98 billion euros in 2016) from recycling waste [237] The works are mostly executed through the public organisation, Swedish Waste Management (Avfall Sverige) [234]\n\n\nTaxes\nSince the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries Sweden has a two-step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20‚Äì25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year Payroll taxes amount to 32% In addition, a national VAT of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages In 2007 [update], total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006 [238] Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce) Spending on transfers is also high On average, 27% of taxpayers' money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security [239]\n\n\nPensions\nEvery Swedish resident receives a state pension Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension There are several types of pensions in Sweden: occupational and private pensions, and national retirement A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe total resident population of Sweden was 10,377,781 in October 2020 [6] The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday 20 January 2017 [240] [241]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Sweden is Swedish, [1] [2] a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population, [248] and Finnish is recognised as a minority language [2] Owing to a 21st-century influx of native speakers of Arabic, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish However, no official statistics are kept on language use [249]\n\n\nReligion\nBefore the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping √Üsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished and Lutheranism became widespread Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593, and it became the official religion During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially Calvinist Dutch, the Moravian Church and French Huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated [253] The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\nHealth\nHealthcare in Sweden is mainly tax-funded, universal for all citizens, and decentralised, [266] although private health care also exists The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by regional councils and municipalities A total of 21 councils are in charge of primary and hospital care within the country.\n\n\nEducation\nChildren aged 1‚Äì5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public kindergarten (Swedish: f√∂rskola or, colloquially, dagis) Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average [271] After completing the ninth grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (gymnasium), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university The school system is largely financed by taxes.\n\n\nCulture\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the \"sexual revolution\", with gender equality having particularly been promoted [280] [281] Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its \"registered partnership\" laws and fully replaced them with gender-neutral marriage [282] Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples Cohabitation (sammanboende) by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as older couples, is widespread.\n\n\nMusic\nHistorical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites The instruments used were the lur (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums Sweden has a significant folk-music scene The joik, a type of Sami music, is a chant that is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality Notable composers include Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald.\n\n\nArchitecture\nBefore the 13th century, almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift soon began towards stone Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the countryside This would include the Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm√∂ and Helsingborg.\n\n\nMedia\nSwedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper The country's main quality morning papers are Dagens Nyheter (liberal), G√∂teborgs-Posten (liberal), Svenska Dagbladet (liberal conservative) and Sydsvenska Dagbladet (liberal) The two largest evening tabloids are Aftonbladet (social democratic) and Expressen (liberal) The ad-financed, free international morning paper, Metro International, was founded in Stockholm, Sweden The country's news is reported in English by, among others, The Local (liberal) [289]\n\n\nLiterature\nSweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including August Strindberg, Astrid Lindgren, and Nobel Prize winners Selma Lagerl√∂f and Harry Martinson In total seven Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded to Swedes.\nThe first literary text from Sweden is the R√∂k runestone, carved during the Viking Age c.‚Äâ800 AD With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the Middle Ages, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin Therefore, there are only a few texts in Old Swedish from that period Swedish literature only began to flourish when the language was standardised during the 16th century This standardisation was largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541 This translation is the so-called Gustav Vasa Bible.\n\n\nHolidays\nApart from traditional Protestant Christian holidays, Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition They include Midsummer celebrating the summer solstice; Walpurgis Night (Valborgsm√§ssoafton) on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or May Day on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations The day of giver-of-light Saint Lucia, 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.\n\n\nCuisine\nSwedish cuisine, like that of the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Finland), was traditionally simple Fish (particularly herring), meat, potatoes and dairy products played prominent roles Spices were sparse Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam; pancakes; pyttipanna, a spiced fried hash of meat and potatoes originally meant to use up any leftovers of meat; lutfisk; and the sm√∂rg√•sbord, or lavish buffet Akvavit is a popular alcoholic distilled beverage, and the drinking of snaps is of cultural importance The traditional flat and dry crisp bread has developed into several contemporary variants Regionally important foods are the surstr√∂mming (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and eel in southern Sweden.\n\n\nCinema\nSwedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sj√∂str√∂m In the 1920s‚Äì1980s, the filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and actors Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman became internationally noted people within cinema More recently, the films of Lukas Moodysson, Lasse Hallstr√∂m, and Ruben √ñstlund have received international recognition.\n\n\nSports\nSport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities The two main spectator sports are football and ice hockey Second to football, horse sports (of which most of the participants are women) have the highest number of practitioners Thereafter, golf, orienteering, gymnastics, track and field, and the team sports of ice hockey, handball, floorball, basketball and bandy are the most popular in terms of practitioners [292]\nThe Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as Tre Kronor (English: Three Crowns), has won the World Championships nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in 1994 and 2006 In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year The Swedish national men's football team has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994.\n\n\nSee also\nPublic sector\n\n\nNotes\nPublic sector\n\n\nReferences\nPublic

the west, Finland to the east, and Denmark to the south. It is the 55th largest country in the world by area and the 23rd most populous country. Sweden has a long and varied history, with evidence of human presence dating back to the Mesolithic era. The country has a rich cultural heritage, with a mix of Viking, medieval, and modern influences.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name for Sweden is generally agreed to derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *s(w)e, meaning \"one's own\", referring to one's own tribe from the tribal period. The native Swedish name, Sverige (a compound of the words Svea and rike, first recorded in the cognate Swƒìorice in Beowulf), translates as \"realm of the Swedes\", which excluded the Geats in G√∂taland.\n\n**History**\n\nSweden's prehistory begins in the Aller√∏d oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, Scania. This period was characterized by small clans of hunter-gatherers who relied on flint technology.\n\n**Vikings**\n\nThe Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the eighth century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly traveled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Black Sea, and even as far as Baghdad. Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids. The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard. The Swedish Vikings, called Rus, are believed to be the founders of Kievan Rus'.\n\n**Kingdom of Sweden**\n\nThe actual age of the kingdom of Sweden is unknown. Determining its age depends mostly on whether Sweden is considered a nation when the Svear (Swedes) ruled Svealand or when the Svear and the G√∂tar (Geats) of G√∂taland were united under a single ruler. In the former case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. The epic poem Beowulf describes semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars in the sixth century.\n\n**Swedish Empire**\n\nSweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the reign of king Gustavus Adolphus, seizing territories from Russia and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in multiple conflicts. During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states and defeated the Imperial army at the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. Gustavus Adolphus planned to become the new Holy Roman Emperor, ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he was killed at the Battle of L√ºtzen in 1632. After the Battle of N√∂rdlingen in 1634, Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded. These German provinces broke away from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and Wismar. From 1643 to 1645, during the last years of the war, Sweden and Denmark-Norway fought the Torstenson War. The result of that conflict and the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War helped establish postwar Sweden as a major force in Europe. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 granted Sweden territories in northern Germany.\n\n**Modern history**\n\nThe Swedish East India Company began in 1731. The obvious choice of home port was Gothenburg at Sweden's west coast, the mouth of G√∂ta √§lv river is very wide and has the county's largest and best harbour for high-seas journeys. The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city. Between 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s. It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States. Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.\n\n**World War I and World War II**\n\nSweden was officially neutral during World War I. However, under pressure from the German Empire, they did take steps which were detrimental to the Allied powers ‚Äì most notably, mining the √òresund channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies. Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight alongside the Germans for the White Guards against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied √Öland in cooperation with the German Empire.\n\n**Post-war era**\n\nSweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside NATO and Warsaw Pact membership during the Cold War, but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability, and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe. Sweden received aid under the Marshall Plan and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the Swedish Social Democratic Party largely in co-operation with trade unions and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.\n\n**Geography**\n\nSweden is situated in Northern Europe, west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long coastline. It forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. To the west is the Scandinavian mountain chain (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from Norway. Finland is located to the north-east. Sweden has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. It is also linked to Denmark by the √ñresund Bridge. Its border with Norway is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.\n\n**Climate**\n\nMost of Sweden has a temperate climate, despite its northern latitude, with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is manifested only through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures; autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The northern parts of the country have a subarctic climate, while the central parts have a humid continental climate. The coastal south can be defined as having either a humid continental climate using the 0¬∞C isotherm, or an oceanic climate using the -3¬∞C isotherm.\n\n**Vegetation**\n\nSweden has a considerable south to north distance which causes large climatic differences, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that naturally can grow at various places. Sweden is divided into five major vegetation zones.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nSweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" (Folkr√∂relser), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the women's movement, and the intellectual property pirate movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw corporal punishment of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979).\n\n**Constitutional framework**\n\nSweden has four fundamental laws (Swedish: grundlagar) which together form the Constitution: the Instrument of Government (Swedish: Regeringsformen), the Act of Succession (Swedish: Successionsordningen), the Freedom of the Press Act (Swedish: Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen), and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (Swedish: Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen).\n\n**Elections**\n\nFor over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag‚Äîthe Social Democrats, the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party, and the Left Party‚Äîbefore the Green Party became the sixth party in the 1988 election. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the Christian Democrats and New Democracy. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the Sweden Democrats, gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the European Parliament, parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the June List (2004‚Äì2009), the Pirate Party (2009‚Äì2014), and Feminist Initiative (2014‚Äì2019).\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nSweden is a unitary state divided into 21 regions (regioner) and 290 municipalities (kommuner). Every region corresponds to a county (l√§n) with a number of municipalities per county. Regions and municipalities are both local governments but have different roles and separate responsibilities. Health care, public transport, and certain cultural institutions are administered by regional councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care, and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a region with only one municipality and the functions of region and municipality are performed by the same organisation.\n\n**Judicial system**\n\nThe courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts (allm√§nna domstolar) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts (allm√§nna f√∂rvaltningsdomstolar) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities. Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent. There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation. While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.\n\n**Economy**\n\nSweden is the twelfth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and has a high standard of living. Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry, and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world. Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration.\n\n**Energy**\n\nSweden's energy market is largely privatised. The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat, etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.\n\n**Transport**\n\nSweden has 162,707 km (101,101 mi) of paved road and 1,428 km (887 mi) of expressways. Motorways run through Sweden and over the √òresund Bridge to Denmark. Sweden had left-hand traffic (v√§nstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as Dagen H.\n\n**Public policy**\n\nSweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France, and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and Belgium. Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the ninth-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education. On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nIn the 18th century, Sweden's scientific revolution took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.\n\n**Waste management**\n\nSweden is known for its efficient waste management system. Only 0.7% of the total household waste is disposed of, and the rest is reused. Around 52% of its waste is used for energy production (that is, burnt), and 47% is recycled. About two million tonnes of waste are imported from neighbouring countries to make profitable recycling products.\n\n**Taxes**\n\nSince the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two-step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20‚Äì25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. Payroll taxes amount to 32%. In addition, a national VAT of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens. In 2007, total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% in 2006.\n\n**Pensions**\n\nEvery Swedish resident receives a state pension. The Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions. People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension. There are several types of pensions in Sweden: occupational and private pensions, and national retirement. A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe total resident population of Sweden was 10,377,781 in October 2020. The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday, 20 January 2017.\n\n**Language**\n\nThe official language of Sweden is Swedish, a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography. The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it. Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population, and Finnish is recognised as a minority language. Owing to a 21st-century influx of native speakers of Arabic, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish, however, no official statistics are kept on language use.\n\n**Religion**\n\nBefore the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping √Üsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala. With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished and Lutheranism became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially Calvinist Dutch, the Moravian Church, and French Huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated. The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n**Health**\n\nHealthcare in Sweden is mainly tax-funded, universal for all citizens, and decentralised. Although private health care also exists, the public health care system is the main provider of health care services. A total of 21 councils are in charge of primary and hospital care within the country.\n\n**Education**\n\nChildren aged 1‚Äì5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public kindergarten (Swedish: f√∂rskola or, colloquially, dagis). Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school. In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average. After completing the ninth grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (gymnasium), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university. The school system is largely financed by taxes.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the \"sexual revolution\", with gender equality having particularly been promoted. Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its \"registered partnership\" laws and fully replaced them with gender-neutral marriage. Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (sammanboende) by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as older couples, is widespread.\n\n**Music**\n\nHistorical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the lur (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes, and drums. Sweden has a significant folk-music scene. The joik, a type of Sami music, is a chant that is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality. Notable composers include Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nBefore the 13th century, almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift soon began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the countryside. This would include the Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm√∂, and Helsingborg.\n\n**Media**\n\nSwedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are Dagens Nyheter (liberal), G√∂teborgs-Posten (liberal), Svenska Dagbladet (liberal conservative), and Sydsvenska Dagbladet (liberal).

1992, a run on the currency caused the central bank to briefly increase interest rates to 500% [96] [97]\n\n\nGeography\nSituated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of

care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities Gotland is a special case of being a region with only one municipality and the functions of region and municipality are performed by the same organisation [163]\n\n\nJudicial system\nThe courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts (allm√§nna domstolar) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts (allm√§nna f√∂rvaltningsdomstolar) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities [164] Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become precedent There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThroughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and neutrality in wartime Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war [90]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe law is enforced in Sweden by several government entities The Swedish police is a Government agency concerned with police matters The National Task Force is a national SWAT unit within the police force The Swedish Security Service's responsibilities are counter-espionage, anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.\n\n\nEconomy\nSweden is the twelfth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a high standard of living is experienced by its citizens Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance Sweden is the ninth-largest arms exporter in the world Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment The country ranks among the highest for telephone and Internet access penetration [175]\n\n\nEnergy\nSweden's energy market is largely privatised The Nordic energy market is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 TWh, electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and nuclear power delivered 65 TWh (47%) At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%) Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh [197] Biomass is mainly used to produce heat for district heating and central heating and industry processes.\n\n\nTransport\nSweden has 162,707¬†km (101,101¬†mi) of paved road and 1,428¬†km (887¬†mi) of expressways Motorways run through Sweden and over the √òresund Bridge to Denmark Sweden had left-hand traffic (v√§nstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as Dagen H.\n\n\nPublic policy\nSweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France, and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and Belgium [208] Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the ninth-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education [209] On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest [210]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn the 18th century, Sweden's scientific revolution took off Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.\n\n\nWaste management\nSweden is known for its efficient waste management system Only 0.7% of the total household waste is disposed, and the rest is reused [234] Around 52% of its waste is used for energy production (that is burnt) and 47% recycled [235] [236] About two million tonnes of waste are imported from neighbouring countries to make profitable recycling products [234] As of 2023 report, Sweden generated 1.7 billion euros in 2020 (the highest so far was 1.98 billion euros in 2016) from recycling waste [237] The works are mostly executed through the public organisation, Swedish Waste Management (Avfall Sverige) [234]\n\n\nTaxes\nSince the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries Sweden has a two-step progressive tax scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20‚Äì25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year Payroll taxes amount to 32% In addition, a national VAT of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages In 2007 [update], total tax revenue was 47.8% of GDP, the second-highest tax burden among developed countries, down from 49.1% 2006 [238] Public sector spending amounts to 53% of the GDP State and municipal employees total around a third of the workforce, much more than in most Western countries Only Denmark has a larger public sector (38% of Danish workforce) Spending on transfers is also high On average, 27% of taxpayers' money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security [239]\n\n\nPensions\nEvery Swedish resident receives a state pension Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension There are several types of pensions in Sweden: occupational and private pensions, and national retirement A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe total resident population of Sweden was 10,377,781 in October 2020 [6] The population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday 20 January 2017 [240] [241]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Sweden is Swedish, [1] [2] a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography The dialects spoken in Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority, comprising about 5% of Sweden's population, [248] and Finnish is recognised as a minority language [2] Owing to a 21st-century influx of native speakers of Arabic, the use of Arabic is likely more widespread in the country than that of Finnish However, no official statistics are kept on language use [249]\n\n\nReligion\nBefore the 11th century, Swedes adhered to Norse paganism, worshiping √Üsir gods, with its centre at the Temple in Uppsala With Christianisation in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century After the Protestant Reformation in the 1530s, the authority of the Roman Catholic Church was abolished and Lutheranism became widespread Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the Uppsala Synod of 1593, and it became the official religion During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy, small groups of non-Lutherans, especially Calvinist Dutch, the Moravian Church and French Huguenots played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated [253] The Sami originally had their own shamanistic religion, but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n\nHealth\nHealthcare in Sweden is mainly tax-funded, universal for all citizens, and decentralised, [266] although private health care also exists The health care system in Sweden is financed primarily through taxes levied by regional councils and municipalities A total of 21 councils are in charge of primary and hospital care within the country.\n\n\nEducation\nChildren aged 1‚Äì5 years old are guaranteed a place in a public kindergarten (Swedish: f√∂rskola or, colloquially, dagis) Between the ages of 6 and 16, children attend compulsory comprehensive school In the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Swedish 15-year-old pupils score close to the OECD average [271] After completing the ninth grade, about 90% of the students continue with a three-year upper secondary school (gymnasium), which can lead to both a job qualification or entrance eligibility to university The school system is largely financed by taxes.\n\n\nCulture\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the \"sexual revolution\", with gender equality having particularly been promoted [280] [281] Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as Show Me Love Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its \"registered partnership\" laws and fully replaced them with gender-neutral marriage [282] Sweden also offers domestic partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples Cohabitation (sammanboende) by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as older couples, is widespread.\n\n\nMusic\nHistorical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites The instruments used were the lur (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums Sweden has a significant folk-music scene The joik, a type of Sami music, is a chant that is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality Notable composers include Carl Michael Bellman and Franz Berwald.\n\n\nArchitecture\nBefore the 13th century, almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift soon began towards stone Early Swedish stone buildings are the Romanesque churches on the countryside This would include the Lund Cathedral from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in Dalby, but also many early Gothic churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malm√∂ and Helsingborg.\n\n\nMedia\nSwedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper The country's main quality morning papers are Dagens Nyheter (liberal), G√∂teborgs-Posten (liberal), Svenska Dagbladet (liberal conservative) and Sydsvenska Dagbladet (liberal) The two largest evening tabloids are Aftonbladet (social democratic) and Expressen (liberal) The ad-financed, free international morning paper, Metro International, was founded in Stockholm, Sweden The country's news is reported in English by, among others, The Local (liberal) [289]\n\n\nLiterature\nSweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including August Strindberg, Astrid Lindgren, and Nobel Prize winners Selma Lagerl√∂f and Harry Martinson In total seven Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded to Swedes.\nThe first literary text from Sweden is the R√∂k runestone, carved during the Viking Age c.‚Äâ800 AD With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the Middle Ages, during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin Therefore, there are only a few texts in Old Swedish from that period Swedish literature only began to flourish when the language was standardised during the 16th century This standardisation was largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541 This translation is the so-called Gustav Vasa Bible.\n\n\nHolidays\nApart from traditional Protestant Christian holidays, Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition They include Midsummer celebrating the summer solstice; Walpurgis Night (Valborgsm√§ssoafton) on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or May Day on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations The day of giver-of-light Saint Lucia, 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.\n\n\nCuisine\nSwedish cuisine, like that of the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Finland), was traditionally simple Fish (particularly herring), meat, potatoes and dairy products played prominent roles Spices were sparse Preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam; pancakes; pyttipanna, a spiced fried hash of meat and potatoes originally meant to use up any leftovers of meat; lutfisk; and the sm√∂rg√•sbord, or lavish buffet Akvavit is a popular alcoholic distilled beverage, and the drinking of snaps is of cultural importance The traditional flat and dry crisp bread has developed into several contemporary variants Regionally important foods are the surstr√∂mming (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and eel in southern Sweden.\n\n\nCinema\nSwedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sj√∂str√∂m In the 1920s‚Äì1980s, the filmmaker Ingmar Bergman and actors Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman became internationally noted people within cinema More recently, the films of Lukas Moodysson, Lasse Hallstr√∂m, and Ruben √ñstlund have received international recognition.\n\n\nSports\nSport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities The two main spectator sports are football and ice hockey Second to football, horse sports (of which most of the participants are women) have the highest number of practitioners Thereafter, golf, orienteering, gymnastics, track and field, and the team sports of ice hockey, handball, floorball, basketball and bandy are the most popular in terms of practitioners [292]\nThe Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as Tre Kronor (English: Three Crowns), has won the World Championships nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in 1994 and 2006 In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year The Swedish national men's football team has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in 1950 and 1994.\n\n\nSee also\nPublic sector\n\n\nNotes\nPublic sector\n\n\nReferences\nPublic

{"title": "Thunderbolts_(comics)", "content": "\nPublication history\nThe Thunderbolts were first presented, both to readers and to the Marvel Universe, in The Incredible Hulk #449 (January 1997), written by Peter David with art by Mike Deodato Jr., as a group of super-powered figures who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 \"Onslaught\" crossover The final page of Thunderbolts #1 (April 1997), however, written by Kurt Busiek with art by Mark Bagley, revealed that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel Comics [5]\n\n\nFictional team biography\nBaron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during a rescue attempt of Goliath (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo) The summoned members included Beetle, Fixer, Moonstone and Screaming Mimi Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers [19] Before they could strike, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four were apparently killed by the villain Onslaught

joined the Thunderbolts These members included the former Avenger Hawkeye, and later a young African American hero named Charcoal who had previously fought the team, having been created by a \"Create a character\" contest in Wizard Magazine Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually killed anyone), turned himself in to authorities The team considered joining the mysterious Crimson Cowl's new Masters of Evil instead Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye's advice MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder Even with MACH-1's surrender, the U.S Government refused to pardon the group [28]\n\n\nChanges\nWhile exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered Ogre Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded This also left him with custody of Humus Sapien, a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation [30]\n\n\nThe Redeemers\nAll four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt's body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he \"died\", imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process The Thunderbolts were upset with Hawkeye, but, on unmasking Monroe, decided that confronting Gyrich was more important [36]\n\n\nRebirth and endings\nThe Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo's mind ‚Äî accidentally transferred into Fixer's tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to Counter-Earth, the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after

team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They were created by writer Kurt Busiek and artist Mark Bagley.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe Thunderbolts first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #449 (January 1997), written by Peter David with art by Mike Deodato Jr., as a group of super-powered figures who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 \"Onslaught\" crossover. However, the final page of Thunderbolts #1 (April 1997), written by Kurt Busiek with art by Mark Bagley, revealed that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel Comics.\n\n**Fictional Team Biography**\n\nBaron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during a rescue attempt of Goliath (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo). The summoned members included Beetle, Fixer, Moonstone, and Screaming Mimi. Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers.\n\n**Baron Helmut Zemo's Thunderbolts**\n\nBaron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during a rescue attempt of Goliath (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo). The summoned members included Beetle, Fixer, Moonstone, and Screaming Mimi. Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers.\n\n**Marvel's Most Wanted**\n\nNow fugitives, new members soon joined the Thunderbolts. These members included the former Avenger Hawkeye, and later a young African American hero named Charcoal who had previously fought the team. Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually killed anyone), turned himself in to authorities. The team considered joining the mysterious Crimson Cowl's new Masters of Evil instead. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye's advice. MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder. Even with MACH-1's surrender, the U.S Government refused to pardon the group.\n\n**Changes**\n\nWhile exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered Ogre. Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base. Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded. This also left him with custody of Humus Sapien, a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation.\n\n**The Redeemers**\n\nAll four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt's body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he \"died\", imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process.\n\n**Rebirth and Endings**\n\nThe Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton. During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo's mind ‚Äî accidentally transferred into Fixer's tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to Counter-Earth, the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after their final battle with Onslaught.\n\n**Avengers/Thunderbolts: The Best Intentions**\n\nIn 2004, the six-issue Avengers/Thunderbolts limited series was launched, picking up a year after the events of Thunderbolts #75. Zemo led the Thunderbolts (now including Dallas Riordan, under the codename Vantage) in an attempt to drain the powers of all superhumans on Earth, using Moonstone. They fought the Avengers, including former Thunderbolt Hawkeye. The Avenger Iron Man infiltrated the Thunderbolts disguised as Cobalt Man. Eventually, all the power absorbed by Moonstone caused her to snap. Jolt returned from Counter-Earth to help stop Moonstone. Finally, Iron Man convinced Hawkeye to lobotomize Moonstone to save the planet.\n\n**The New Thunderbolts**\n\nMarvel subsequently launched New Thunderbolts #1. MACH-3 (now called MACH-IV), Atlas, and Songbird were now a part of the new Thunderbolts. The team's new recruits included Photon, Speed Demon, Joystick, Blizzard II, and the Radioactive Man. The new team has battled Atlantean superhuman terrorist group the Fathom Five and Baron Strucker's HYDRA organization, which funded the team's return.\n\n**Right of Power**\n\nSoon after Nighthawk joined the team, the Thunderbolts discovered that Photon's awareness of all space and time brought with it a vision of the destruction of the universe at his hands. As they tried to come to terms with this, they were attacked by a Moonstone puppeteered by Zemo to kill Genis-Vell. When the initial strike failed, the remainder of Zemo's team revealed themselves to the Thunderbolts. Zemo explained that he had used the Moonstones to accelerate Genis' return from death, and in the process made the mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time itself, creating a link between Genis and the universe that threatened to end existence. Unable to find a way to save both Genis and the universe, he concluded that the only solution was Genis's death.\n\n**Civil War: Hero Hunters**\n\nThe new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated Quicksand in a battle in Denver during the early days of the superhero Civil War. After this, they were summoned to Washington where they met with Iron Man, Mister Fantastic, and Yellowjacket. The three heroes, all supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, informed Zemo that they wanted the Thunderbolts to hunt down supervillains and recruit them to the Pro-Registration cause, which would be their chance at redemption. Unknown to Iron Man, the Thunderbolts had been doing this in secret for three weeks.\n\n**Zemo: Born Better**\n\nIn the events of Thunderbolts: Zemo - Born Better mini-series, Baron Zemo found himself lost in time and in Europe, forced to witness the lives and deaths of the previous generations of \"Baron Zemos\", while being violently thrust forward in time at random points of his adventures. The journey forward in time was a prolonged \"moment of clarity\" experience for Zemo, who saw his family's true history and not the rose-colored version his father and grandfather had taught him. When he ultimately returned to the present day, Zemo discovered that a distant cousin had been responsible for his return to the present, though at a horrific cost of causing Zeno to jump forward from era to era every time his cousin murdered a family member who shared the same blood as Helmut. When Helmut discovered that his cousin rescued Zeno just so he could kill his infamous relative, Helmut refused to resist, a move that caused his cousin to attempt to take his own life before Zeno convinced him to put down his gun and stop the cycle of violence.\n\n**Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts**\n\nThunderbolts #110 featured a new creative team (writer Warren Ellis and artist Mike Deodato) and a new roster and direction for the team. The team was formed under the control of Norman Osborn, and the majority of the roster was made up of villains wishing to redeem themselves.\n\n**H.A.M.M.E.R.'s Thunderbolts**\n\nAfter Songbird got mad at Osborn for leaving her to deal with a dangerous Skrull who nearly killed her, Norman Osborn and Moonstone came to the agreement to get rid of Songbird and the other Thunderbolts whose morals do not match their own. Their plan came into effect while Norman was in Washington during the Dark Reign storyline, preparing to assume control over S.H.I.E.L.D. The group deported Radioactive Man back to China after Norman had his work visa revoked, and Moonstone had Penance sent to a corrupt maximum security mental institution where he would be held prisoner for the rest of his natural life.

Revolution recruited Shang-Chi to intercept U.S Agent and American Kaiju in Hong Kong, both of whom were tricked by the Red Skull's agents in the United States Army into destroying his Latverian hideout.

Incredible Hulk #449 (January 1997), written by Peter David with art by Mike Deodato Jr., as a group of super-powered figures who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 \"Onslaught\" crossover The final page of Thunderbolts #1 (April 1997), however, written by Kurt Busiek with art by Mark Bagley, revealed that the Thunderbolts were actually the Masters of Evil in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel Comics [5]\n\n\nFictional team biography\nBaron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during a rescue attempt of Goliath (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo) The summoned members included Beetle, Fixer, Moonstone and Screaming Mimi Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers [19] Before they could strike, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four were apparently killed by the villain Onslaught [20]\n\n\nBaron Helmut Zemo's Thunderbolts\nBaron Helmut Zemo summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the Masters of Evil during

Most Wanted\nNow fugitives, new members soon joined the Thunderbolts These members included the former Avenger Hawkeye, and later a young African American hero named Charcoal who had previously fought the team, having been created by a \"Create a character\" contest in Wizard Magazine Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually killed anyone), turned himself in to authorities The team considered joining the mysterious Crimson Cowl's new Masters of Evil instead Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye's advice MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder Even with MACH-1's surrender, the U.S Government refused to pardon the group [28]\n\n\nChanges\nWhile exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered Ogre Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded This also left him with custody of Humus Sapien, a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation [30]\n\n\nThe Redeemers\nAll four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt's body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he \"died\", imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process The Thunderbolts were upset with Hawkeye, but, on unmasking Monroe, decided that confronting Gyrich was more important [36]\n\n\nRebirth and endings\nThe Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo's mind ‚Äî accidentally transferred into Fixer's tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to Counter-Earth, the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after their final battle with Onslaught [volume¬†&¬†issue¬†needed] The Thunderbolts met Counter-Earth versions of Heinrich Zemo, Helmut Zemo and the

absorbed by Moonstone caused her to snap Jolt returned from Counter-Earth to help stop Moonstone Finally, Iron Man convinced Hawkeye to lobotomize Moonstone to save the planet

vision of the destruction of the universe at his hands As they tried to come to terms with this, they were attacked by a Moonstone puppeteered by Zemo to kill Genis-Vell When the initial strike failed, the remainder of Zemo's team revealed themselves to the Thunderbolts Zemo explained that he had used the Moonstones to accelerate Genis' return from death, and in the process made the mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time itself, caused by inexperience with his Moonstones, creating a link between Genis and the universe that threatened to end existence Unable to find a way to save both Genis and the universe, he concluded that the only solution was Genis's death.\n\n\nCivil War: Hero Hunters\nThe new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated Quicksand in a battle in

ultimately returned to the present day, Zemo discovered that a distant cousin had been responsible for his return to the present, though at a horrific cost of causing Zemo to jump forward from era to era every time his cousin murdered a family member who shared the same blood as Helmut When Helmut discovered that his cousin rescued Zemo just so he could kill his infamous relative, Helmut refused

It is one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world, known for its eclectic mix of music, art, and culture. The festival has a rich history, dating back to its first edition in 1970, and has become a beloved institution for music lovers and festival-goers alike.\n\n**History**\n\nThe first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, hosted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. There had been a commercial UK festival tradition which included the National Jazz and Blues Festival and the Isle of Wight Festival.

Eavis decided to host the first festival after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.\n\n**1971**\n\nThe \"Glastonbury Fair\" of 1971 was instigated by Andrew Kerr after being found and introduced to Michael Eavis by David Trippas and organised with help from Arabella Churchill, Jean Bradbery, Kikan Eriksdotter, John Massara, Jeff Dexter, Thomas Crimble, Bill Harkin, Gilberto Gil, Mark Irons, John Coleman, and Jytte Klamer. The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the \"Pyramid Stage\". Conceived by Bill Harkin, the stage was a one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a \"blind spring\", a term used to describe a hypothetical underground body of water in the pseudoscientific practice of dowsing.\n\n**1979**\n\nThere was a small unplanned event in 1978, when the convoy of vehicles from the Stonehenge festival was directed by police to Worthy Farm; the festival was then revived the following year (1979) by Churchill, Crimble, Kerr and Eavis, in an event for the Year of the Child, which lost money.\n\n**1980s**\n\nThe 1980s saw the festival become an annual fixture, barring periodic fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis took back sole control of the festival, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a permanent structure which doubled as a hay barn and cowshed during the winter.\n\n**1990s**\n\nFollowing the 1990 festival, violence flared between security guards and new age travellers in what became known as \"The Battle of Yeoman's Bridge\". Eavis was also facing increasing battles from locals over the festival, with no festival taking place in 1991. Both pressures are captured in the 1992 Channel 4 documentary Showdown at Glastonbury.\n\n**2000s**\n\n2000 saw a new Pyramid Stage introduced as well as new features such as The Glade and The Left Field. The festival was headlined by Chemical Brothers, Travis and David Bowie, who played thirty years after his first appearance. The Pyramid Stage also hosted an unusual event on the Saturday morning, with the wedding of two festivalgoers, who had written to the organisers asking for permission to get married there, taking place and conducted by actor Keith Allen in front of a small group of friends and any other festivalgoers who still happened to be awake. This year also saw an estimated 250,000 people attend the festival (only 100,000 tickets were sold) due to gatecrashers, leading to public safety concerns and the local District Council refused any further licences until the problem was solved.\n\n**2010s**\n\nThe Glastonbury Festival 2010 took place between 23 and 28 June. On the last night, Michael Eavis appeared on the main stage with headline artist Stevie Wonder to sing the chorus of the latter's \"Happy Birthday\", marking the festival's 40th year. Tickets went on sale on 4 October 2009, using the same ¬£50 deposit scheme introduced the previous year. Unlike the previous two years, and more in common with earlier festivals, the tickets for the 2010 edition sold out in less than 24 hours. U2 were due to headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night at Glastonbury 2010, but due to frontman Bono sustaining a back injury they were forced to pull out. According to the media, Bono was \"gutted\", even having written a song especially for the festival. Damon Albarn's Gorillaz replaced U2, and joined Muse and Stevie Wonder for the Saturday and Sunday headline slots respectively. Pet Shop Boys returned after 10 years to headline the Other Stage on the Saturday Night. The entire stage set from their Pandemonium Tour was brought in for the performance which was extremely well received. Radiohead's Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood made a surprise appearance with a nine-song set. The weather at the festival was among some of the best ever, the festival-goers enjoying 3 days of abundant sunshine and very warm to hot temperatures, which reached close to 30 degrees on the Sunday; it was the first rain-free festival since 2002 and the hottest since the festival began.\n\n**2020s**\n\nThe 2020 and 2021 festivals were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2002, Festival Republic (a company consisting of both Live Nation and MCD) took on the job of managing the logistics and security of the festival through a 40% stake in the festival management company. This relationship ended in 2012 and Glastonbury festival is now independent. Glastonbury Festivals Ltd donates most of its profits to charities, including donations to local charity and community groups and paying for the purchase and restoration of the Tithe Barn in Pilton.\n\n**Transport**\n\nSignificant logistical operations take place to bring people into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.\n\n**Location**\n\nThe festival takes place in South West England at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle in Somerset, six miles east of Glastonbury, overlooked by the Glastonbury Tor in the \"Vale of Avalon\". The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions, and is a \"New Age\" site of interest: ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor. The nearest town to the festival site is Shepton Mallet, three miles (5¬†km) north east, but there continues to be interaction between the people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival. The farm is situated between the A361 and A37 roads.\n\n**Lineups**\n\nActs in bold indicate the performer played in the Sunday Legends slot.\n\n**Accommodation**\n\nMost people who stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are different camping areas, each with its own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. An accessible campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna.\n\n**Cultural references**\n\nIt has been noted that Saint Dunstan, the Patron Saint of Music, was the Abbot of Glastonbury in 943. Various artists have written songs entitled Glastonbury or about the festival including Nizlopi, The Waterboys, and Scouting for Girls. Cosmic Rough Riders included \"Glastonbury Revisited\" on their album Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine (Poptones) in 2000. Amy Macdonald, in her song \"Let's Start a Band\" referenced Glastonbury: \"Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star.\" Robbie Williams, in his song \"The 90s\", refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That. Joe Strummer wrote the song \"Coma Girl\" about his experiences at Glastonbury, ‚Äì in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival.\n\n**Awards and nominations**\n\nDJ Magazine \nNME Awards", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Glastonbury_Festival\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, [10] hosted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people There had been a commercial UK festival tradition which included the National Jazz and Blues Festival and the Isle of Wight Festival Eavis decided to host the first festival after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970 [11]\n\n\n1970\nThe first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pop, Blues & Folk Festival, [10] hosted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people There had been a commercial UK festival tradition which included the National Jazz and Blues Festival and the Isle of Wight Festival Eavis decided to host the first festival after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970 [11]\n\n\n1971\nThe \"Glastonbury Fair\" of 1971 [15] was instigated by Andrew Kerr after being found and introduced to Michael Eavis by David Trippas and organised with help from Arabella Churchill, Jean Bradbery, Kikan Eriksdotter, John Massara, Jeff Dexter, Thomas Crimble, [16] Bill Harkin, [17] Gilberto Gil, [18] Mark Irons, John Coleman, and Jytte Klamer The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the \"Pyramid Stage\" Conceived by Bill Harkin the stage was a one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a \"blind spring\", a term used to describe a hypothetical underground body of water in the pseudoscientific practice of dowsing [19]\n\n\n1979\nThere was a small unplanned event in 1978, when the convoy of vehicles from the Stonehenge festival was directed by police to Worthy Farm;

The company was incorporated on May 1, 2013, by Mark and DeAnne Stidham, who are also the founders of the company.\n\n**History**\n\nLuLaRoe was founded by Mark and DeAnne Stidham, who have a strong background in the MLM industry. The company's name was derived from the names of their first three granddaughters, Lucy, Lola, and Monroe. The Stidhams' affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has also influenced the company's values and business model.\n\nIn the early days of LuLaRoe, the company focused on selling modest, conservative clothing that appealed to a specific market. The company's products were designed to be comfortable, durable, and easy to wear. LuLaRoe's clothing is known for its bright patterns and bold designs, which have become a hallmark of the brand.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nLuLaRoe's business model is based on a multi-level marketing structure, where independent distributors sell products to customers. Distributors purchase inventory from LuLaRoe wholesale and then resell it to consumers. The company requires distributors to purchase an initial inventory of clothing and marketing materials, which can cost between $4,925 and $9,000, depending on the package chosen.\n\nDistributors are also recommended to keep around $20,000 worth of inventory on hand to ensure they have a steady supply of products to sell. Once a distributor has purchased the initial inventory, they can earn commissions on sales made by their customers. LuLaRoe distributors can also earn commissions on sales made by other distributors they recruit to join the company.\n\n**Products**\n\nLuLaRoe's main products are brightly patterned leggings, shirts, and dresses. The company releases 5,000 copies of any given pattern, and once a product has sold out, it is generally not reissued. Distributors can choose styles and sizes, but not specific patterns. Each distributor is provided with different products for their inventory, which helps to create a sense of exclusivity and scarcity.\n\nSome patterns, known as \"unicorns,\" are significantly easier to sell than others. These patterns are highly sought after by customers, and distributors often report that they are more likely to sell out quickly. LuLaRoe's products are designed to be comfortable and durable, with a focus on quality and style.\n\n**Product Quality and Return Policy Complaints**\n\nIn late 2016, LuLaRoe began receiving many reports from customers that the company's leggings ripped and developed holes easily, in some cases shortly after being worn for the first time. The company's return policy was also criticized, with some customers reporting difficulty in getting refunds or exchanges for defective products.\n\nIn January 2017, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) downgraded LuLaRoe's rating to \"F\" in response to the company's failure to address complaints, as well as for issues with charging sales tax in places that do not levy sales tax on clothes. The BBB's rating system is based on a scale of A+ to F, with A+ being the highest rating.\n\n**In Popular Media**\n\nLuLaRoe has been featured in various media outlets, including the New York Times, Forbes, and CNN. The company has also been the subject of several documentaries and expos√©s, which have raised concerns about the company's business practices and treatment of distributors.\n\nSome of the issues raised in these documentaries and expos√©s include the high cost of joining the company, the difficulty of selling products, and the pressure to purchase large quantities of inventory. Distributors have also reported feeling misled about the potential earnings and opportunities offered by the company.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Multi-level marketing\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n* Better Business Bureau\n\n**External Links**\n\n* LuLaRoe website\n* Better Business Bureau rating for LuLaRoe\n* New York Times article on LuLaRoe\n* Forbes article on LuLaRoe\n* CNN article on LuLaRoe", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"LuLaRoe\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nLuLaRoe was incorporated on May 1, 2013  The company's name was derived by combining the names of Brady's first three granddaughters; Lucy, Lola, and Monroe [10]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn early 2017, a class-action lawsuit was filed against LuLaRoe by customers, who complained that the firm's proprietary point-of-sale software incorrectly calculated sales tax rates on interstate sales, and in jurisdictions that do not charge sales tax on clothing These complaints, combined with complaints over poor quality, led to the company's Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating being downgraded to \"F\" in January 2017 [5] [6] [12]\n\n\nBusiness model\nLuLaRoe clothing is sold only by the company through multi-level marketing distributors These distributors purchase inventory from LuLaRoe wholesale, which they then resell to consumers LuLaRoe distributors are required to purchase an initial inventory of clothing and marketing materials that cost between $4,925 and $9,000 (as of 2017 [update]) and are recommended to keep around $20,000 worth of inventory on hand [5]\n\n\nProducts\nLuLaRoe's main products are brightly patterned leggings, shirts, and dresses The company's clothes tend toward modesty, based partly on the Stidhams' affiliation with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints [4] [3] LuLaRoe releases 5,000 copies of any given pattern, and once a product has sold out, it is generally not reissued [8] LuLaRoe distributors can choose styles and sizes, but not specific patterns, and each distributor is provided different products for their inventory Distributors have noted that some patterns (known as \"unicorns\") are significantly easier to sell than others [10] [7] [31]\n\n\nProduct quality and return policy complaints\nIn late 2016, LuLaRoe began receiving many reports from customers that the firm's leggings ripped and developed holes easily, in some cases shortly after being worn for the first time In January 2017, the BBB downgraded the company's rating to \"F\" in response to the company's failure to address complaints, as well as for issues with charging sales tax in places that do not levy sales tax on clothes [6]\n\n\nIn popular media\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is one of the most influential musicians of all time, known for his deep, baritone voice and his ability to blend different styles of music, including country, rockabilly, blues, and gospel.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJohnny Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, to Ray and Carrie Cash. He was the fourth of seven children, and his family moved to Dyess, Arkansas, when he was three years old. Cash's father was a farmer, and the family lived on a small farm, where they struggled to make ends meet. Despite the financial difficulties, the Cash family was close-knit, and Johnny's parents encouraged his love of music from an early age.\n\nCash's early life was marked by hardship and tragedy. His father struggled with depression and eventually died when Johnny was just 14 years old. After his father's death, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash attended high school and began to develop his musical talents. He played guitar and sang in a local band, and his music was heavily influenced by the blues and country artists he heard on the radio.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1954, Cash and his first wife, Vivian, moved to Memphis, where he began to pursue a career in music. He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer, but his true passion was music. Cash worked up the courage to visit the Sun Records studio, hoping to get a recording contract. He auditioned for Sam Phillips by singing mostly gospel songs, but Phillips was looking for something more upbeat. Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style.\n\nIn 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"Hey Porter\" and \"Cry! Cry! Cry!\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country hit parade. Cash's music was a fusion of country, rockabilly, and blues, and it quickly gained popularity. He became known as the \"Man in Black,\" a nickname that stuck with him for the rest of his career.\n\nEarly Career\n\nCash's early career was marked by struggle and hardship. He was rejected by several record labels, and his music was not widely accepted by the country music establishment. However, he persevered, and his music eventually gained traction. In the late 1950s, Cash began performing concerts at prisons, a tradition that continued throughout his career. These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums, including \"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison\" and \"Johnny Cash at San Quentin.\"\n\nOutlaw Image\n\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours, and friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior. Many ignored the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction.\n\nFolsom and Other Prison Concerts\n\nIn the late 1950s, Cash began performing concerts at prisons. He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison in California. These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums, including \"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison\" and \"Johnny Cash at San Quentin.\" Both live albums reached number one on the Billboard country album music charts, and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the Billboard pop album chart.\n\nActivism for Native Americans\n\nCash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people. He sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S government. Many non-Native Americans did not address those topics in their music. In 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, \"Rainbow Quest,\" where Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans.\n\nThe Johnny Cash Show\n\nFrom June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, \"The Johnny Cash Show,\" on the ABC network.

His diagnosis was later altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring, and he was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs. Cash died on September 12, 2003, at the age of 71, due to complications from diabetes.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOn July 18, 1951, while in Air Force basic training, Cash met 17-year-old Italian-American Vivian Liberto at a roller skating rink in San Antonio, Texas. They dated for three weeks until Cash was deployed to West Germany for a three-year tour. During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of love letters. On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio. They had four daughters: Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, and Tara.\n\nReligious Beliefs\n\nCash was raised by his parents in the Christian faith. In 1944, he became a Christian at the Central Baptist Church in Dyess, Arkansas, affiliated to the Southern Baptist Convention, and began singing publicly there. He was baptized shortly after in the Tyronza River.\n\nLegacy\n\nCash's music and legacy continue to inspire and influence artists today. He was a true original, a master of multiple styles, and a voice for the voiceless. His music and message of hope and redemption continue to resonate with people around the world.\n\nPortrayals\n\nCountry singer Mark Collie portrayed Cash in John Lloyd Miller's award-winning 1999 short film \"I Still Miss Someone.\"\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nCash's awards and honors are numerous and well-deserved.

Cry! Cry!\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country hit parade.\n\n\nOutlaw image\nAs his career was taking off in the late 1950s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was deeply addicted to amphetamines Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction.\n\n\nFolsom and other prison concerts\nIn the late 1950s Cash began performing concerts at prisons He played his first notable prison concert on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison in California [64] These performances were recorded live, and released on highly successful albums: Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) and Johnny Cash at San Quentin (1969) Both live albums reached number one on Billboard country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the Billboard pop album chart In 1969, Cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even The Beatles by selling 6.5¬†million albums [65] In comparison, the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as Strawberry Cake recorded in London and Live at Madison Square Garden, which peaked at numbers 33 and 39 on the album charts, respectively.\n\n\nActivism for Native Americans\nCash used his stardom and economic status to bring awareness to the issues surrounding the Native American people [66] Cash sang songs about indigenous humanity in an effort to confront the U.S government Many non-Native Americans did not address those topics in their music [67] In 1965, Cash and June Carter appeared on Pete Seeger's TV show, Rainbow Quest, on which Cash explained his start as an activist for Native Americans:\n\n\nThe Johnny Cash Show\nFrom June 1969 to March 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, The Johnny Cash Show, on the ABC network [80] Produced by Screen Gems, the show was performed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville The Statler Brothers opened for him in every episode; the Carter Family and rockabilly legend Carl Perkins were also part of the regular show entourage Cash also enjoyed booking mainstream performers as guests; including Linda Ronstadt in her first TV appearance, Neil Young, Louis Armstrong, Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers and the First Edition (who appeared four times), James Taylor, Ray Charles, Roger Miller, Roy Orbison, Derek and the Dominos, Joni Mitchell, and Bob Dylan [80]\n\n\nThe \"Man in Black\"\nBy the early 1970s, Cash had established his public image as the \"Man in Black\" He regularly performed in entirely black suits with a long, black, knee-length coat This outfit stood in contrast to the rhinestone suits and cowboy boots worn by most of the major country acts of his day.\n\n\nHighwaymen and departure from Columbia Records\nIn 1980, Cash became the Country Music Hall of Fame's youngest living inductee at age 48, but during the 1980s, his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson as the Highwaymen, making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled Highwayman in 1985, followed by Highwaymen 2 in 1990, and concluding with Highwaymen¬†‚Äì The Road Goes On Forever in 1995.\n\n\nAmerican Recordings\nAfter Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with Mercury Records from 1987 to 1991 During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as Water from the Wells of Home, a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children Rosanne Cash and John Carter Cash, as well as Paul McCartney A one-off Christmas album recorded for Delta Records followed his Mercury contract.\n\n\nLater years and death\nIn 1997, during a trip to New York City, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy‚ÄìDrager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy [109] According to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to his audience that he had Parkinson's after nearly collapsing on stage in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997 Soon afterwards, his diagnosis was changed to Shy‚ÄìDrager, and Cash was told he had about 18 months to live [110] The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn July 18, 1951, while in Air Force basic training, Cash met 17-year-old Italian-American Vivian Liberto at a roller skating rink in San Antonio, Texas [119] They dated for three weeks until Cash was deployed to West Germany for a three-year tour During that time, the couple exchanged hundreds of love letters [120] On August 7, 1954, one month after his discharge, they were married at St Ann's Roman Catholic Church in San Antonio They had four daughters: Rosanne, Kathy, Cindy, and Tara In 1961, Cash moved his family to a hilltop home overlooking Casitas Springs, California He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement Liberto later said that she had filed for divorce in 1966 because of Cash's severe drug and alcohol abuse, as well as his constant touring, his repeated acts of adultery with other women, and his close relationship with singer June Carter Their four daughters were then raised by their mother.\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nCash was raised by his parents in the Christian faith In 1944, he became a Christian at the Central Baptist Church in Dyess, Arkansas, affiliated to the Southern Baptist Convention, and began singing publicly there [123] He was baptized shortly after in the Tyronza River [124]\n\n\nLegacy\nCash nurtured and defended artists such as Bob Dylan [46] on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment's most visible symbol At an all-star concert which aired in 1999 on TNT, a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Dylan, Chris Isaak, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Dom DeLuise, and U2 Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; Kindred Spirits contains works from established artists, while Dressed in Black contains works from many lesser-known musicians.\n\n\nPortrayals\nCountry singer Mark Collie portrayed Cash in John Lloyd Miller's award-winning 1999 short film I Still Miss Someone.\n\n\nAwards and honors\nIf there were a hall of fame for creating larger-than-life personae, Cash would no doubt have been elected to it as well His 1971 song \"Man in Black\" codified an image that the singer had assumed naturally for more than fifteen years at that point Part rural preacher, part outlaw Robin Hood, he was a blue-collar prophet who, dressed in stark contrast to the glinting rhinestones and shimmering psychedelia of the time, spoke truth to power.\n\n\nDiscography\n\n‚Ä†Honorary former member;

{"title": "Andrew_Jackson_and_the_slave_trade_in_the_United_States", "content": "\nBackground\nJackson, a native of the Carolinas and pioneer settler of Tennessee in 1788, was connected to distant Mississippi by the geography of commerce Moving goods from the Cumberland River basin to eastern markets, even those in East Tennessee, was challenging because of the necessary, difficult passage through the Appalachian Mountains [1] Moving goods north to market in Kentucky or the Illinois Country was pointless because those places produced more or less the same products as Tennessee [2] That left the western inland waterways as the road to market, and in much of what became the territory of the United States in North America, these waters lead to the mouth of the Mississippi River at the Gulf of Mexico and from there to the rest of the Atlantic world As Jackson himself put it in 1812, \"Every man of the western Country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi He there beholds the only outlet by which his produce can reach the markets of foreign and of the atlantic States: Blocked up, all the fruits of his industry rots upon his land‚Äîopen, and he carries on a trade with all the nations of the earth To the people of Western Country is then peculiarly committed by nature herself the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.\" [3]\n\n\nAccounts of Jackson as trader and gambler\nYoung Andrew Jackson sought the lifestyle of a Southern gentleman, and when he moved to the Nashville area in 1788 the first two things he acquired (that we have record of) were a horse, and an enslaved woman named Nancy, who was between 18 and 20 years old [25] According to historian Whitney Snow, Jackson's employment income as an attorney was unpredictable and insufficient to cover his gambling losses, so he \"began dabbling in mercantilism, land speculation, and the interstate slave trade\" and found that of the three, \"slave trading not only relieved Jackson of debt but also allowed him to accumulate a larger-than-average work force of slave labor, a sure sign of status at the time.\" [26] [a]\n\n\nTrading in colonial and territorial Mississippi\nThe first account of \"Jackson as slave trader\" that was published after his death comes from an author writing as Idler, datelined Rodney, Mississippi, 1854: \"...here  [at Bruinsburg], nearly fifty years ago, Gen Jackson‚Äîhe was not 'Old Hickory' then‚Äîlanded his flatboat, laden with Western produce, negroes, etc., which he had piloted from Nashville I have understood that the original intention of Jackson was to settle in Mississippi, but he subsequently returned through the wilderness to Tennessee...\" Idler continued, explaining that \"the removal of negroes through the Indian nation into one of the States of the Union was strictly prohibited,\" and there was a plan made by the Choctaw and their allies \"to arrest him by force should he persist in his unlawful attempt\" but Jackson \"armed his negroes and a few of his friends and boldly marched unmolested through the Indian territory.\" [44] [b]\n\n\nAccount of Idler\nThe first account of \"Jackson as slave

few of his friends and boldly marched unmolested through the Indian territory.\" [44] [b]\n\n\nAccount of Sparks\nThe memoirs of William Henry Sparks, published in 1870, described his knowledge of Jackson's slave-trading business: \"Many will remember the charge brought against him pending his candidacy for the Presidency, of having been, in early life, a negro-trader, or dealer in slaves This charge was strictly true, though abundantly disproved by the oaths of some, and even by the certificate of his principal partner.\" [55] Sparks said that Jackson had a \"small store, or trading establishment...which stood immediately upon the bank of the Mississippi\" at Bruinsburg, and there was an accompanying race track and a cockfighting pit, and people told stories for years after about Jackson's \"skill\" at these sports Per Sparks, Jackson sold slaves in the vicinity of Claiborne County, including to Sparks' father-in-law Abner Green and his wife's uncle Thomas M Green Jr Sparks claimed to have \"bills of sale for negroes sold to Abner Green, in the handwriting of Jackson, bearing his signature...\" [55]\n\n\nAccount of McCaleb\nDr James F McCaleb, writing about the Natchez Trace in the Natchez News-Democrat in 1915, [d] described Jackson as a sportsman and gambler, stated that he had stores at both Bruinsburg and Old Greenville, and that: \"Grindstone Ford lane, one mile in length, on the Natchez Trace was the great rendezvous for horse racing, the Indian ball game, and lacrosse Travelers from Kentucky and Tennessee stopped at the station of Mrs Worldridge and the tavern of George Lemon near the Grindstone Ford on Bayou Pierre to enjoy the regular Sunday festivals [e] ...Among the horsemen from the Blue Grass State was A S Colthrap, who ran his horse against General Jackson's betting four slaves to determine the winner as well as some money Colthrap lost his horse, his money, and his slaves to General Jackson, returning home a poorer and a wiser man.\" [63] [64] Per historian and Jackson biographer John Spencer Bassett, \"Race paths were laid out in the earliest  [Southern] settlements and succeeded by circular tracks, as the settlements developed.\" [65] In a study of antebellum horse racing, the Journal of Mississippi History recounted the Jackson‚ÄìColthrap incident and stated that this straightaway was the first racecourse in Claiborne County and was located near the \"Red House\" tavern at Rocky Springs [66] Also, according to the memoir of a Presbyterian minister, Sunday was indeed race day in the vicinity of Old Greenville, an attraction that drew many young men away from church attendance [67] Neither report addressed whether Jackson kept his winnings for personal use or resold them for short-term gain There is an E S Coltharp (1784‚Äì1859) buried at the old Rocky Springs Methodist Church cemetery on the historic road from Natchez to Nashville [68]\n\n\nAccounts of Dey and Robinson\nThere are two other first-person accounts of Jackson in pre-statehood Mississippi According to the county historian for Warren County, Ohio, a local plow manufacturer called John E Dey travelled widely in the early 19th century via the Mississippi and Ohio River, seeking customers for the company's products Dey spent his winters at Bruinsburg, and \"Andrew Jackson, years before when he was just a Colonel, lived at this place Colonel Jackson quite often frequented the plantation, and Mr Dey became well acquainted with him He remembered that he was a tall, slim man, with a nervous manner He used to carry a pocket full of shelled corn and play with the grains at the dining table...He says that Colonel Jackson, soon after he came to Mississippi, went back into the woods about four miles from the river to a noted hunting place of the hunting gentlemen of the country Here he started a saloon which he continued for many years He never appeared behind the bar, but the establishment was his and he was responsible for it.\" [69]\n\n\nTrading in Tennessee\nAt the turn of the 19th century, wrote historian J Winston Coleman, \"Tennessee was as wild and rough a frontier country as the Nation possessed Life in those parts was both hard and turbulent, and a short one for many a man who tried to get on for himself in that fast-growing section of young America Reckless gambling, hard drinking, and fighting to the death with pistol and knife were the order of the day Men fought for their rights and for their lives...cut-throats of every description defied the laws of the back country districts, and the towns themselves were scarcely less barbarous.\" [83] The exact site where the Mississippi store(s) stood has been lost, but it was one of several such outlets for Jackson's business endeavors, all at a time when \"Money was scarce, and the interchange of goods was difficult and hazardous Barter was still commonly employed in conducting commercial transactions.\" [84] According to the editors of The Papers of Andrew Jackson, \"Between 1795 and 1807 Jackson followed general-store merchandising at least as fully as farming, the law, or the military.\" [85] Goods from Philadelphia resold in the Cumberland were marked up triple [86] Products for sale include fabric, \"salt, grindstones, hardware, gunpowder, cow bells, and whatever else the people of the neighborhood wanted In payment for these commodities, they took, not money, but cotton, ginned and unginned, wheat, corn, tobacco, pork, skins, furs, and, indeed, all the produce of the country.\" [86] Middle Tennessee had originally produced mostly corn and stock animals, but by 1800 cotton had become so lucrative a cash crop that cotton bales served as a local currency [87] The \"produce of the country\" that was traded included slaves In 1805, Jackson and his nephew accepted $25 in cash and \"A Negro Woman namd Fan a bout forty five years of age\" to pay off the $150 past-due account of Andrew Steele at their store [88]\n\n\n1789‚Äì1799\nJackson was 22 years old when opened his trading post at Bruinsburg, which was located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Bayou Pierre at what was at that time the northernmost White settlement in the Natchez District The name Bayou Pierre dates to the French period, but the local pronunciation of bayou \"ignores the y and rhymes the word with now.\" [113] In 1789 there were no riverfront settlements between  L'Anse √† la Graisse (later known as New Madrid, Missouri) and Bayou Pierre [114] The earliest surviving description of Bruinsburg dates to March 25, 1801: \"...pass't Judge Bruin's at the lower side of a creek called Biopere...some Houses but no improvements worth notice...\" [115] The fullest description of life on pre-territorial Bayou Pierre comes from the autobiography of Confederate general and Reconstruction-era Mississippi governor Benjamin G Humphreys: [52]\n\n\n1800‚Äì1809\n\nIn his 2013 biography, Andrew Jackson, Southerner, historian Mark R Cheathem wrote, \"Historian Charles Sellers once argued that after 1804 'never again was Jackson to engage in any considerable speculative venture.' The facts do not bear out this claim Jackson speculated widely in land during the 1810s in an effort to benefit himself Given his direct involvement in land seizures during the 1810s and his subsequent correspondence about prospects in Alabama, Florida, and the Mississippi Territory, it stretches credulity to imagine that he did not calculate these moves to help his land-speculating associates turn a profit as well.\" [141]  Similarly, Jackson was still opportunistically trading slaves well into the 19th century, certainly until his actions during the War of 1812 made him a national figure According to Frederic Bancroft's Slave-Trading in the Old South (1931), letters in the Jackson papers at the Library of Congress demonstrate his continuing interest in the market [142] For instance, William C C Claiborne wrote to Jackson from \"near Natchez\" on December 8, 1801, with an update on local markets: [143]\n\n1810‚Äì1812\nIn 1810, Andrew Jackson, Joseph Coleman (the first mayor of Nashville), and a \"probable\" resident of Natchez named Horace Green formed a business partnership on the existing system of transporting trade goods, slaves, etc downriver from Tennessee to the consumers of Louisiana and Mississippi [172] [173] [o] Slaves owned by this firm became part of the propaganda leafleting and news coverage of Jackson's business dealings during the bitter 1828 campaign [173]\n\n\nAndrew Jackson versus Silas Dinsmoor\nWhile returning to Nashville with his unsold stock, Jackson got into a dispute with an Indian agent named Silas Dinsmoor [q] Dismoor was determined to enforce a regulation requiring that every enslaved person crossing through the unceded Choctaw lands carry a document identifying their legal owner and the purpose of their travel The intention was to prevent runaway slaves from using the Choctaw lands as a refuge, which in turn would hopefully reduce complaints from white settlers about the Choctaw Jackson disliked Dinsmoor enforcing this rule, and while traveling, had to pass the Choctaw Agency in company of a \"considerable number of slaves.\" Dinsmoor was not at the agency when Jackson passed by Still, Jackson left a message promising a future confrontation with Dinsmoor, who persisted in regulating the passage of enslaved people over the Trace Jackson later saw to it that Dismoor was removed from his post [185] According to The Devil's Backbone, a history of the Natchez Trace, \"No explanation has been made as to why Jackson felt this passport ruling was unreasonable when applied to him, except that Wilkinson's treaty of 1801 opened the road through the Indian nations to all white travelers, and presumably also to their slaves.\" [186]\n\n\nThe land uneasy: Jackson's side of the story\nThere are three surviving letters from Jackson himself about this specific  platoon of slaves for sale, which was initially under the purview of Green and which he later took control of himself Jackson, then 44 years old, wrote that there were 27 people in the group: \"There was 25 grown negroes; with two sucking children they always count with the mother,\" [197] and that 13 of the group were women, as they needed \"habits.\" [198]\n\n\nIndividual slave sales\n(Note: Small sample size likely makes this data meaningless.) \n\n\nCharges, denials, coverup\nAmerican abolitionist Benjamin Lundy covered reports of Jackson's slave trading in his newspaper, The Genius of Universal Emancipation, or American Anti-Slavery Journal and Register of News In 1827, when the first allegation appeared in Kentucky, Lundy recounted a separate story about Jackson having whipped a recaptured runaway slave he had tied to the joist of a blacksmith shop Lundy could not confirm the secondhand report, and expressed hope that the reports of slave trading were exaggerating this tale [231] If Jackson did whip a man tied to a joist, the use of such violence on a person would not have been out of character: multiple historians have described Jackson as \"vengeful and mean spirited,\" [232] and in the words of Opal, \" [Jackson's] willingness to kill, assault, or threaten people was a constant theme in his adult life and a central component of the reputation he cultivated.\" [233] As the election approached in 1828, Lundy wrote that he felt that Jackson's own account of the deal was effectively a full confession: \"This, we repeat, is Gen Jackson's own story It amounts to this A speculation was to be made in cotton, tobacco and negroes: Coleman was to do the business and Jackson to furnish the means; the negroes were bought up, taken to market, followed by Jackson, part of them sold by himself at Natchez, and the rest carried back by him to Tennessee in the year 1812.\" [234]\n\n\nConnection to other Jackson controversies\nSeveral of Jackson's interpersonal conflicts involved the trade An Andrew Erwin was mentioned in American Slavery As It Is: \"It is known in Alabama, that Mr Erwin, son-in-law of the Hon Henry Clay, and brother of J P Erwin, formerly postmaster, and late mayor of the city of Nashville, laid the foundation of a princely fortune in the slave-trade, carried on from the Northern Slave States to the Planting South.\" [244] The genealogy is a bit mangled but this might refer Erwin or Andrew Erwin Jr., born 1800 [251] Similarly, in an early letter about the duel in which he killed Charles Dickinson, Jackson wrote, \"...for the present it will only be observed that the deceased, could not be called a Citizen of this state‚Äîthat he was engaged in the humane persuit of purchasing Negroes in Maryland and carrying them to Natchez & Louisa and thus making a fortune of speculating on human flesh...\" [252] In 1882, the Denton Journal described a derelict outbuilding on what had once been Dickinson's property near Preston, Maryland, where \"staples and ringbolts\" for chaining slaves were still embedded in the \"massive timbers\" of the old barn, originally constructed as a trader's slave pen [253]\n\n\nInfluence\nAndrew Jackson's business model and actions met the definition of \"slave trader\" as understood by abolitionists According to historian Cheathem, at a bare minimum, Jackson's surviving business records show that \"at least six of the slaves that Jackson bought between 1790 and 1803 were purchased from men listed as being residents of other states; a number of his slave transactions also occurred outside of Tennessee.\" [259] Still, as an 1828 campaign issue, \"Andrew Jackson as human trafficker\" got little traction According to historian Robert Gudmestad, information about \"Gen Jackson's negro trading\" failed to swing voters in part because \"Southerners wanted to believe that there was a small group of itinerant traders who created most of the difficulties It was this type of speculator, most thought, who destroyed slave families, escorted coffles, sold diseased slaves, and concealed the flaws of bondservants They were the 'slave-dealers.' All others who bought or sold slaves, even if they did so on a full-time basis, were innocent.\" [260]\n\n\nEpilogue\nOn Wednesday evening, April 29, 1863, a little over 25 years after the end of Jackson's presidency, a freedman came to the camp of U.S Army general Ulysses S Grant on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River, and informed him that there was an excellent, undefended boat landing at Bruinsburg, much closer than the one Grant had planned to use There, at the site of Andrew Jackson's old slave-trading stand, Grant successfully made what stood as the largest amphibious landing in U.S military history until 1942 Grant's men went on from Bruinsburg to capture Vicksburg, breaking the spine of the Confederacy at the Mississippi River [274]\n\n\nAdditional images\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Andrew Jackson and the Slave Trade in the United States\n\n# Background\n\nAndrew Jackson, a native of the Carolinas and pioneer settler of Tennessee in 1788, was connected to distant Mississippi by the geography of commerce. Moving goods from the Cumberland River basin to eastern markets, even those in East Tennessee, was challenging because of the necessary, difficult passage through the Appalachian Mountains. Moving goods north to market in Kentucky or the Illinois Country was pointless because those places produced more or less the same products as Tennessee. That left the western inland waterways as the road to market, and in much of what became the territory of the United States in North America, these waters led to the mouth of the Mississippi River at the Gulf of Mexico and from there to the rest of the Atlantic world.\n\nAs Jackson himself put it in 1812, \"Every man of the western Country turns his eyes intuitively upon the mouth of the Mississippi. He there beholds the only outlet by which his produce can reach the markets of foreign and of the Atlantic States: Blocked up, all the fruits of his industry rots upon his land‚Äîopen, and he carries on a trade with all the nations of the earth. To the people of Western Country is then peculiarly committed by nature herself the defense of the lower Mississippi and the city of New Orleans.\"\n\n# Accounts of Jackson as Trader and Gambler\n\nYoung Andrew Jackson sought the lifestyle of a Southern gentleman, and when he moved to the Nashville area in 1788, the first two things he acquired (that we have record of) were a horse, and an enslaved woman named Nancy, who was between 18 and 20 years old. According to historian Whitney Snow, Jackson's employment income as an attorney was unpredictable and insufficient to cover his gambling losses, so he \"began dabbling in mercantilism, land speculation, and the interstate slave trade\" and found that of the three, \"slave trading not only relieved Jackson of debt but also allowed him to accumulate a larger-than-average work force of slave labor, a sure sign of status at the time.\"\n\n# Trading in Colonial and Territorial Mississippi\n\nThe first account of \"Jackson as slave trader\" that was published after his death comes from an author writing as Idler, datelined Rodney, Mississippi, 1854: \"...here [at Bruinsburg], nearly fifty years ago, Gen Jackson‚Äîhe was not 'Old Hickory' then‚Äîlanded his flatboat, laden with Western produce, negroes, etc., which he had piloted from Nashville I have understood that the original intention of Jackson was to settle in Mississippi, but he subsequently returned through the wilderness to Tennessee...\" Idler continued, explaining that \"the removal of negroes through the Indian nation into one of the States of the Union was strictly prohibited,\" and there was a plan made by the Choctaw and their allies \"to arrest him by force should he persist in his unlawful attempt\" but Jackson \"armed his negroes and a few of his friends and boldly marched unmolested through the Indian territory.\"\n\n# Account of Sparks\n\nThe memoirs of William Henry Sparks, published in 1870, described his knowledge of Jackson's slave-trading business: \"Many will remember the charge brought against him pending his candidacy for the Presidency, of having been, in early life, a negro-trader, or dealer in slaves.

still commonly employed in conducting commercial transactions.\" [84] According to the editors of The Papers of Andrew Jackson, \"Between 1795 and 1807 Jackson followed general-store merchandising at least as fully as farming, the law, or the military.\" [85] Goods from Philadelphia resold in the Cumberland were marked up triple [86] Products for sale include fabric, \"salt, grindstones, hardware, gunpowder, cow bells, and whatever else the people of the neighborhood wanted In payment for these commodities, they took, not money, but cotton, ginned and unginned, wheat, corn, tobacco, pork, skins, furs, and, indeed, all the produce of the country.\" [86] Middle Tennessee had originally produced mostly corn and stock animals, but by 1800 cotton had become so lucrative a cash crop that cotton bales served as a local currency [87] The \"produce of the country\" that was traded included slaves In 1805, Jackson and his nephew accepted $25 in cash and \"A Negro Woman namd Fan a bout forty five years of age\" to pay off the $150 past-due account of Andrew Steele at their store [88]\n\n\n1789‚Äì1799\nJackson was 22 years old when opened his trading post at Bruinsburg, which was located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Bayou Pierre at what was at that time the northernmost White settlement in the Natchez District The name Bayou Pierre dates to the French period, but the local pronunciation of bayou \"ignores the y and rhymes the word with now.\" [113] In 1789 there were no riverfront settlements between  L'Anse √† la Graisse (later known as New Madrid, Missouri) and Bayou Pierre [114] The earliest surviving description of Bruinsburg dates to March 25, 1801: \"...pass't Judge Bruin's at the lower side of a creek called Biopere...some Houses but no improvements worth notice...\" [115] The fullest description of life on pre-territorial Bayou Pierre comes from the autobiography of Confederate general and Reconstruction-era Mississippi governor Benjamin G Humphreys: [52]\n\n\n1800‚Äì1809\n\nIn his 2013 biography, Andrew Jackson, Southerner, historian Mark R Cheathem wrote, \"Historian Charles Sellers once argued that after 1804 'never again was Jackson to engage in any considerable speculative venture.' The facts do not bear out this claim Jackson speculated widely in land during the 1810s in an effort to benefit himself Given his direct involvement in land seizures during the 1810s and his subsequent correspondence about prospects in Alabama, Florida, and the Mississippi Territory, it stretches credulity to imagine that he did not calculate these moves to help his land-speculating associates turn a profit as well.\" [141]  Similarly, Jackson was still opportunistically trading slaves well into the 19th century, certainly until his actions during the War of 1812 made him a national figure According to Frederic Bancroft's Slave-Trading in the Old South (1931), letters in the Jackson papers at the Library of Congress demonstrate his continuing interest in the market [142] For instance, William C C Claiborne wrote to Jackson from \"near Natchez\" on December 8, 1801, with an update on local markets: [143]\n\n1810‚Äì1812\nIn 1810, Andrew Jackson, Joseph Coleman (the first mayor of Nashville), and a \"probable\" resident of Natchez named Horace Green formed a business partnership on the existing system of transporting trade goods, slaves, etc downriver from Tennessee to the consumers of Louisiana and Mississippi [172] [173] [o] Slaves owned by this firm became part of the propaganda leafleting and news coverage of Jackson's business dealings during the bitter 1828 campaign [173]\n\n\nAndrew Jackson versus Silas Dinsmoor\nWhile returning to Nashville with his unsold stock, Jackson got into a dispute with an Indian agent named Silas Dinsmoor [q] Dismoor was determined to enforce a regulation requiring that every enslaved person crossing through the unceded Choctaw lands carry a document identifying their legal owner and the purpose of their travel The intention was to prevent runaway slaves from using the Choctaw lands as a refuge, which in turn would hopefully reduce complaints from white settlers about the Choctaw Jackson disliked Dinsmoor enforcing this rule, and while traveling, had to pass the Choctaw Agency in company of a \"considerable number of slaves.\" Dinsmoor was not at the agency when Jackson passed by Still, Jackson left a message promising a future confrontation with Dinsmoor, who persisted in regulating the passage of enslaved people over the Trace Jackson later saw to it that Dismoor was removed from his post [185] According to The Devil's Backbone, a history of the Natchez Trace, \"No explanation has been made as to why Jackson felt this passport ruling was unreasonable when applied to him, except that Wilkinson's treaty of 1801 opened the road through the Indian nations to all white travelers, and presumably also to their slaves.\" [186]\n\n\nThe land uneasy: Jackson's side of the story\nThere are three surviving letters from Jackson himself about this specific  platoon of slaves for sale, which was initially under the purview of Green and which he later took control of himself Jackson, then 44 years old, wrote that there were 27 people in the group: \"There was 25 grown negroes; with two sucking children they always count with the mother,\" [197] and that 13 of the group were women, as they needed \"habits.\" [198]\n\n\nIndividual slave sales\n(Note: Small sample size likely makes this data meaningless.) \n\n\nCharges, denials, coverup\nAmerican abolitionist Benjamin Lundy covered reports of Jackson's slave trading in his newspaper, The Genius of Universal Emancipation, or American Anti-Slavery Journal and Register of News In 1827, when the first allegation appeared in Kentucky, Lundy recounted a separate story about Jackson having whipped a recaptured runaway slave he had tied to the joist of a blacksmith shop Lundy could not confirm the secondhand report, and expressed hope that the reports of slave trading were exaggerating this tale [231] If Jackson did whip a man tied to a joist, the use of such violence on a person would not have been out of character: multiple historians have described Jackson as \"vengeful and mean spirited,\" [232] and in the words of Opal, \" [Jackson's] willingness to kill, assault, or threaten people was a constant theme in his adult life and a central component of the reputation he cultivated.\" [233] As the election approached in 1828, Lundy wrote that he felt that Jackson's own account of the deal was effectively a full confession: \"This, we repeat, is Gen Jackson's own story It amounts to this A speculation was to be made in cotton, tobacco and negroes: Coleman was to do the business and Jackson to furnish the means; the negroes were bought up, taken to market, followed by Jackson, part of them sold by himself at Natchez, and the rest carried back by him to Tennessee in the year 1812.\" [234]\n\n\nConnection to other Jackson controversies\nSeveral of Jackson's interpersonal conflicts involved the trade An Andrew Erwin was mentioned in American Slavery As It Is: \"It is known in Alabama, that Mr Erwin, son-in-law of the Hon Henry Clay, and brother of J P Erwin, formerly postmaster, and late mayor of the city of Nashville, laid the foundation of a princely fortune in the slave-trade, carried on from the Northern Slave States to the Planting South.\" [244] The genealogy is a bit mangled but this might refer Erwin or Andrew Erwin Jr., born 1800 [251] Similarly, in an early letter about the duel in which he killed Charles Dickinson, Jackson wrote, \"...for the present it will only be observed that the deceased, could not be called a Citizen of this state‚Äîthat he was engaged in the humane persuit of purchasing Negroes in Maryland and carrying them to Natchez & Louisa and thus making a fortune of speculating on human flesh...\" [252] In 1882, the Denton Journal described a derelict outbuilding on what had once been Dickinson's property near Preston, Maryland, where \"staples and ringbolts\" for chaining slaves were still embedded in the \"massive timbers\" of the old barn, originally constructed as a trader's slave pen [253]\n\n\nInfluence\nAndrew Jackson's business model and actions met the definition of \"slave trader\" as understood by abolitionists According to historian Cheathem, at a bare minimum, Jackson's surviving business records show that \"at least six of the slaves that Jackson bought between 1790 and 1803 were purchased from men listed as being residents of other states; a number of his slave transactions also occurred outside of Tennessee.\" [259] Still, as an 1828 campaign issue, \"Andrew Jackson as human trafficker\" got little traction According to historian Robert Gudmestad, information about \"Gen Jackson's negro trading\" failed to swing voters in part because \"Southerners wanted to believe that there was a small group of itinerant traders who created most of the difficulties It was this type of speculator, most thought, who destroyed slave families, escorted coffles, sold diseased slaves, and concealed the flaws of bondservants They were the 'slave-dealers.' All others who bought or sold slaves, even if they did so on a full-time basis, were innocent.\" [260]\n\n\nEpilogue\nOn Wednesday evening, April 29, 1863, a little over 25 years after the end of Jackson's presidency, a freedman came to the camp of U.S Army general Ulysses S Grant on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River, and informed him that there was an excellent, undefended boat landing at Bruinsburg, much closer than the one Grant had planned to use There, at the site of Andrew Jackson's old slave-trading stand, Grant successfully made what stood as the largest amphibious landing in U.S military history until 1942 Grant's men went on from Bruinsburg to capture Vicksburg, breaking the spine of the Confederacy at the Mississippi River [274]\n\n\nAdditional images\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Before the match officially began, WWE official Adam Pearce came out and announced that Theory, from Raw, would participate in the match, thus eight participants completed the match (four from each brand). During the match, Theory dove off the top rope at Omos, who caught Theory and chokeslammed him. Riddle and Sheamus beat Omos with ladders at ringside and knocked him down, after which, all the participants pilled numerous ladders on Omos to keep him down. Riddle performed a Hangman's DDT on Sheamus, whose legs were on a ladder. Outside the ring, all men ganged up on Omos and powerbombed him through the announce table. As McIntyre ascended the ladder, Butch ran out and attacked McIntyre. Sheamus placed the ladder over McIntyre and climbed the other side, but McIntyre pressed the ladder and knocked Sheamus down. McIntyre then performed a Claymore Kick on Butch. McIntyre and Sheamus were on top of the ladder when Zayn tipped it over, causing them to crash onto another ladder. Moss then prevented Zayn from retrieving the briefcase, only to be knocked out with The Stomp by Rollins. In the climax, as Rollins ascended the ladder, Riddle performed an RKO on Rollins off the ladder. Riddle then climbed the ladder until Theory made it up the other side. After the two traded punches, Theory shoved Riddle down and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.\n\nReception\n\nThe Usos vs The Street Profits received a 4.5-star rating from Dave Meltzer, the highest of the night. The lowest would be Bianca Belair vs Carmella, which received 2 stars. The United States, SmackDown Women's title, and the women's money in the bank matches received 3.25 stars, and the men's money in the bank match received 4.25 stars.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 2022 Money in the Bank would be the final WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming event in which WWE owner Vince McMahon served as the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), as he announced his retirement on July 22. His daughter, Stephanie McMahon, and WWE President Nick Khan took over as co-CEOs, and the former also took over as Chairwoman of WWE. However, on January 10, 2023, Stephanie announced her resignation as co-CEO and Chairwoman, with Khan being named the sole CEO and Vince returning as Executive Chairman.\n\nRaw\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Mr Money in the Bank Theory announced he was granted a rematch against Bobby Lashley for the United States Championship at SummerSlam. Theory claimed that in addition to winning back the United States Championship at the event, he would also cash-in his Money in the Bank contract that same night on the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. After a couple of failed attempts to cash-in on the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, as well as a tease of cashing in on the NXT Championship, Theory finally cashed in the contract on the November 7 episode of Raw, challenging Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins for the United States Championship, but failed to win the title due to an attack by Lashley. This made Theory the first wrestler to use the contract on a non-world championship.\n\nSmackDown\n\nWith her win of the SmackDown Women's Championship, Liv Morgan was officially transferred to the SmackDown brand. On the following episode of SmackDown, Morgan delivered a heartfelt message for her win but was interrupted by Natalya, who tried to take credit for Morgan's win since she had hurt Rousey's leg. Rousey came out and congratulated Morgan but said she wanted a rematch. After Rousey defeated Natalya in a rematch, it was announced that Morgan would defend the title in a rematch against Rousey at SummerSlam.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete

First, the 2007 music video for the song \"Sweep the Leg\" by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself as Johnny Lawrence, and features references to The Karate Kid (1984), including cameo appearances by Zabka's former co-stars [9] [10] In a 2010 interview, Zabka jokingly discussed this video in the context of his vision that Johnny was the true

confused for an adolescent The short was lauded by TV Guide's Bruce Fretts, who referred to the video as \"sidesplitting\" and \"comic gold\" [13] Finally, in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made guest appearances as themselves in the How I Met Your Mother episode \"The Bro Mitzvah\", where Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka [14] This influenced the launch of Cobra Kai, which gives a balanced perspective for Johnny, Daniel, and other characters [15] Zabka continued to be a recurring character throughout the ninth season of the show.\n\n\nProduction\nThe thematic

Hayden Schlossberg Although the series received offers from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and AMC, it ultimately ended up on the subscription service YouTube Red (later YouTube Premium) [16] [17] The trio was joined by executive producers James Lassiter and Caleeb Pinkett of Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television [18] The first season was released on May 2, 2018, and the second season on April 24, 2019 The creators of the series explored moving to another platform ahead of the season two premiere, but the deal did not go through [19]\n\n\nCasting\nAccording to Heald, Hurwitz, and Schlossberg, only the characters from The Karate Kid, The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), and The Next Karate Kid (1994) comprise the \"Miyagi-verse\" (characters who interacted with Mr Miyagi) that shapes Cobra Kai Hurwitz has also clarified that he does not consider The Karate Kid animated series (1989) to be part of the Miyagi-verse canon, but an Easter egg from it appears in season three, in response to the question about its status within Cobra Kai [34] [35] [36]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the first season began in August 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia Filming took place at various locations throughout that month at places including Union City, Marietta, and the Briarcliff Campus of Emory University [54] In November, shooting moved to locales such as the North Atlanta Soccer Association Tophat fields in East Cobb [55] In December, the production was working out of Marietta and Conyers [56] Various exterior shots were also filmed in parts of Los Angeles such as Tarzana and Encino [57] Exterior locations included Golf N' Stuff in Norwalk and the South Seas Apartments in Reseda, both of which were originally featured in The Karate Kid [58]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series was promoted at the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour held in January 2018, when YouTube's global head of original content Susanne

comedy-drama television series created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg. The series is a sequel to the 1984 film The Karate Kid and follows the story of Johnny Lawrence, the main antagonist in the original film, as he returns to his karate roots and trains a new generation of students in the ways of Cobra Kai, a fictional karate style. The series explores themes of redemption, friendship, and the consequences of one's actions, and features a mix of action, drama, and humor.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThirty-four years after being defeated by Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament at the end of The Karate Kid (1984), Johnny Lawrence suffers from alcoholism and depression.

A recurring joke in the sketch is that Macchio is confused for an adolescent. The short was lauded by TV Guide's Bruce Fretts, who referred to the video as \"sidesplitting\" and \"comic gold\".

Although the series received offers from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and AMC, it ultimately ended up on the subscription service YouTube Red (later YouTube Premium). The trio was joined by executive producers James Lassiter and Caleeb Pinkett of Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television. The first season was released on May 2, 2018, and the second season on April 24, 2019. The creators of the series explored moving to another platform ahead of the season two premiere, but the deal did not go through.\n\n**Casting**\n\nAccording to Heald, Hurwitz, and Schlossberg, only the characters from The Karate Kid, The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), and The Next Karate Kid (1994) comprise the \"Miyagi-verse\" (characters who interacted with Mr. Miyagi) that shapes Cobra Kai. Hurwitz has also clarified that he does not consider The Karate Kid animated series (1989) to be part of the Miyagi-verse canon, but an Easter egg from it appears in season three, in response to the question about its status within Cobra Kai.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for the first season began in August 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. Filming took place at various locations throughout that month at places including Union City, Marietta, and the Briarcliff Campus of Emory University. In November, shooting moved to locales such as the North Atlanta Soccer Association Tophat fields in East Cobb. In December, the production was working out of Marietta and Conyers. Various exterior shots were also filmed in parts of Los Angeles such as Tarzana and Encino. Exterior locations included Golf N' Stuff in Norwalk and the South Seas Apartments in Reseda, both of which were originally featured in The Karate Kid.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe series was promoted at the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour held in January 2018, when YouTube's global head of original content Susanne Daniels described the show: \"It is a half an hour format but I would call it a dramedy. I think it leans into the tone of the movie in that there are dramatic moments throughout. I think it's very faithful really in some ways to what the movie set about doing, the lessons imparted in the movie if you will.

The franchise was created by Jeff Tremaine and features a group of friends, known as the \"Jackass crew,\" who perform various stunts and pranks on themselves and others.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea for Jackass was born in the late 1990s when Johnny Knoxville, a aspiring actor and writer from Knoxville, Tennessee, moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. Knoxville was inspired by the work of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson and wanted to create a show that would showcase his own brand of humor and stunt work. Knoxville's ideas were initially met with rejection from several magazines, but he eventually landed a meeting with Big Brother, a skateboarding magazine, where he convinced the editor, Jeff Tremaine, to let him produce a feature on himself testing various self-defense equipment.\n\nThe stunt, which was later included in the Big Brother video \"Number Two,\" featured Knoxville testing out pepper spray, a stun gun, a taser, and a .38 caliber gun with a bulletproof vest. The video also featured appearances by future Jackass cast members Jason \"Wee Man\" Acu√±a, Chris Pontius, and Dave England.

campaign\nDole was initially a heavy favorite for re-election, especially after several potential top-tier challengers such as Congressman Brad Miller, Governor Mike Easley and former Governor Jim Hunt all declined to compete against Dole [29] [30] Ultimately, Kay Hagan, a state senator from Greensboro, won the Democratic primary election against Jim Neal and became Dole's general election opponent Reports late in the campaign suggested that Dole suffered from Barack Obama's decision to aggressively contest North Carolina in the presidential election, [31] while Hagan received substantial support from independent 527 groups lobbying/advertising against Dole, [30] as well as the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which spent more money in North Carolina than in any other

Transportation\nShe served as director of the White House Office of Public Liaison, from 1981 to 1983 and as United States Secretary of Transportation from 1983 to 1987 under Ronald Reagan She was also appointed by Reagan to chair task forces that sought to reform federal and state laws to ensure equal rights for women She was the first woman appointed Secretary of Transportation In this role, she was the first woman to have served as the head of a branch of the United States military, as the United States Coast Guard was under the Department of Transportation at the time Dole's appointment was \"particularly irritating\" to conservative activists, since \"though at least nominally opposed to abortion,  [she was] viewed by the right as  [an] aggressive feminist.\" [16]\n\n\nBush administration and Secretary of Labor\nDole served as United States Secretary of Labor from 1989 to 1990 under George H W Bush; she is the first woman to serve in two different Cabinet positions in the administrations of two presidents Her tenure as both U.S Transportation Secretary and U.S Labor Secretary focused heavily on improving public safety and workplace safety and health [citation needed]\n\n\nAmerican Red Cross presidency\nIn 1991, Dole became the president of the American Red Cross [19] She served until 1999 She was the second woman to serve as president since Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881 She restructured the world's largest humanitarian organization during her eight years as president, serving as a volunteer in her first year She also led a transformation of the way the Red Cross collects, tests, and distributes one-half of the nation's blood supply [20]\n\n\n1996 Republican National Convention\nDole's husband Bob Dole was the Republican nominee in the US presidential election of 1996  Elizabeth Dole, who would have become First Lady had her husband won the election, or the Second Lady of the United States, had Gerald Ford won the 1976 election, received recognition for her speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention, during which she walked out into the audience while talking conversationally about her husband's qualities [citation needed]\n\n\n2000 United States presidential candidacy\nElizabeth Dole ran for the Republican nomination in the 2000 United States presidential election.\n\n\n2000 vice presidential vetting\nShortly before the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush campaign sources said Elizabeth Dole was on the short list to be named the vice-presidential nominee, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former Missouri Senator John Danforth [26] Many pundits believed that Dole was the frontrunner for the vice presidential nomination Bush then surprised most pundits by selecting former U.S Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who was actually in charge of leading Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited States Senate career\nIn late December 2001, Dole shifted her official residency from the Doles' condominium in the Watergate complex to her mother's home in Salisbury to seek election to the U.S Senate [27] [28] The seat was made available by the retirement of Republican Jesse Helms Although Dole had not lived regularly in North Carolina since 1959 and had been a resident of the Washington area for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the state and national Republican establishment quickly cleared the field for her She handily won the Republican primary with 80 percent of the vote over a lesser-known candidate, Ada Fisher In the November general election, she defeated her Democratic opponent Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, by an eight-point margin.\n\n\n2002 Senate campaign\nIn late December 2001, Dole shifted her official residency from the Doles' condominium in the Watergate

handily won the Republican primary with 80 percent of the vote over a lesser-known candidate, Ada Fisher In the November general election, she defeated her Democratic opponent Erskine Bowles, a former chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, by an eight-point margin.\n\n\n2008 Senate re-election campaign\nDole was initially a heavy favorite for re-election, especially after several potential top-tier challengers such as Congressman Brad Miller, Governor Mike Easley and former Governor Jim Hunt all declined to compete against Dole [29] [30] Ultimately, Kay Hagan, a state senator from Greensboro, won the Democratic primary election against Jim Neal and became Dole's general election opponent Reports late in the campaign suggested that Dole suffered from Barack Obama's decision to aggressively contest North Carolina in the presidential election, [31] while Hagan received substantial support from independent 527 groups lobbying/advertising against Dole, [30] as well as the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, which spent more money in North Carolina than in any other state during the 2008 election season [30] Dole undertook an eight-day \"ElizaBus\" tour of the state in the days leading up to election day [32]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nDole's voting record was somewhat more conservative than that of her husband, though slightly less conservative than that of Helms She has a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union [citation needed]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nDole was a member of the following U.S Senate committees:\n\n\nAfter politics:

169 athletes competing and won 46 medals The American team managed to win only 20 medals, dwarfed by the enormous Greek team However, the United States managed to win 11 gold medals, edging out Greece, who secured 10 golds, and allowing Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke won three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games [18] Robert Garrett won two gold medals in the discus throw and shot put events, demonstrating American strength in athletics.\n\n\nEarly Olympics (1896‚Äì1912)\nThe first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three

throw and shot put events, demonstrating American strength in athletics.\n\n\nInterwar period (1920‚Äì1936)\nSeveral notable American athletes participated in the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, including future legendary figures like swimmer Duke Kahanamoku These games marked a historic moment for American swimming when Ethelda Bleibtrey became the first American woman to earn Olympic gold in the sport.\n\n\nCold War era (1948‚Äì1992)\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that newly communist countries, occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings The Soviet officials told him that chances were even, [21] and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948 With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15 The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65‚Äì21 [22] The 1948 London Summer Olympics marked the first time that the Olympic Games were broadcast on television with a more widespread coverage However, television sets were still not widely available to the public at this time.\n\n\nRecent period (1994‚Äìpresent)\nU.S athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics Games in recent decades, with their fortunes having steadily improved in most sports since 1992 America finished second in the medal count in 1992 and 2008, while placing first at seven other Games in that period.\n\n\nAmateurism and professionalism\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals, when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds [54]\n\n\nPrize money\nWhen a U.S athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze [61] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017 [62] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal [63] [64] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for  [American] Paralympic athletes  [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\" [65]\n\n\nDoping\nUnited States has had eight Olympic medals stripped for doping violations In all cases, the US government or the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had nothing to do with it, and sanctioned athletes acted on their own In the case of swimmer Rick DeMont, the USOC has recognized his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001, [66] but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has as of 2024 refused to do so [66] DeMont originally won the gold medal in 4:00.26 Following the race, the IOC stripped him of his gold medal [67] after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the USOC had not cleared them with the IOC's medical committee [68] [66]\n\n\nDisqualified medalists\nThe United States has had

1896 Games [18] Robert Garrett won two gold medals in the discus throw and shot put events, demonstrating American strength in athletics.\n\n\nEarly Olympics (1896‚Äì1912)\nThe first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals The American team managed to win only 20 medals, dwarfed by the enormous Greek team However, the United States managed to win 11 gold medals, edging out Greece, who secured 10 golds, and allowing Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke won three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games [18] Robert Garrett won two gold medals in the discus throw and shot put events, demonstrating American strength in athletics.\n\n\nInterwar period (1920‚Äì1936)\nSeveral notable American athletes participated in the 1920 Antwerp Olympics, including future legendary figures like swimmer Duke Kahanamoku These games marked a historic moment for American swimming when Ethelda Bleibtrey became the first American woman to earn Olympic gold in the sport.\n\n\nCold War era (1948‚Äì1992)\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that newly communist countries, occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings The Soviet officials told him that chances were even, [21] and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948 With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15 The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65‚Äì21 [22] The 1948 London Summer Olympics marked the first time that the Olympic Games were broadcast on television with a more widespread coverage However, television sets were still not widely available to the public at this time.\n\n\nRecent period (1994‚Äìpresent)\nU.S athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics Games in recent decades, with their fortunes having steadily improved in most sports since 1992 America finished second in the medal count in 1992 and 2008, while placing first at seven other Games in that period.\n\n\nAmateurism and professionalism\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals, when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds [54]\n\n\nPrize money\nWhen a U.S athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze [61] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017 [62] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal [63] [64] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians The International Paralympic Committee noted that \"'Operation Gold Awards' for  [American] Paralympic athletes  [would] be increased by as much as 400 percent.\" [65]\n\n\nDoping\nUnited States has had eight Olympic medals stripped for doping violations In all cases, the US government or the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had nothing to do with it, and sanctioned athletes acted on their own In the case of swimmer Rick DeMont, the USOC has recognized his gold medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001, [66] but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has as of 2024 refused to do so [66] DeMont originally won the gold medal in 4:00.26 Following the race, the IOC stripped him of his gold medal [67] after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax The positive test following the 400-meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the USOC had not cleared them with the IOC's medical committee [68] [66]\n\n\nDisqualified medalists\nThe United States has had eight Olympic medals stripped, which is fifth in the ranking of countries with the most stripped medals

The show's title, \"This Is Us,\" refers to the idea that the characters are all connected by their shared experiences and relationships.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe original idea for the show began as an 80-page movie script developed by Dan Fogelman while working for ABC Studios in the spring of 2015. The story line, which Fogelman admitted to not having a definite direction, revolved around the lives of eight adults who, as it would be revealed, were octuplets. After moving to an eight-figure deal with 20th Century Fox Television, Fogelman decided to develop a television series from the characters of his original script, cutting a few characters and shortening the script to 45 pages.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe series premiered on September 20, 2016, and has since aired six seasons, consisting of 84 episodes. Each episode is approximately 45 minutes long, and the show has been praised for its well-written and engaging storylines.

unbeaten record for singer-actor combination Kishore sang 245 songs for Rajesh Khanna, 202 for Jeetendra, 119 for Dev Anand and 131 for Amitabh Bachchan [55] S D Burman and Kishore continued with music including \"Ye dil na hota bechara\" and \"Aasmaan ke neeche\" from \"Jewel thief\" (1967), \"Phoolon Ke Rang Se\" and \"Shokhiyon Mein Ghola Jaaye\" from Prem Pujari (1969), \"Aaj Madhosh Hua Jaye Re,\" \"Khilte Hain Gul Yahan\" and \"O Meri Sharmilee\" from Sharmilee (1971), \"Meet Na Mila\" from Abhimaan (1973), and \"Jeevan Ki Bagiya Mehkegi\" from Tere Mere Sapne (1971) In 1975, S D Burman composed his last song for Kishore, \"Badi Sooni Sooni Hai\" for the film Mili [56]\n\n\nIndian Emergency\nDuring the Indian Emergency (1975‚Äì1977), Sanjay Gandhi asked Kishore to sing for an Indian National Congress rally in Bombay, but he refused [60] As a result, Information and broadcasting minister Vidya Charan Shukla (1975‚Äì1977) put an unofficial ban on playing Kumar songs on state broadcasters All India Radio and Doordarshan from 4 May 1976 till the end of Emergency [61] [62]\n\n\nLater years\nKishore Kumar's son Amit Kumar became a singer in Hindi cinema in 1974 with the song \"Apne Bas Ki Baat Nahi\", composed by Kumar for the film Badthi Ka Naam Daadi Amit Kumar became popular with success of the song \"Bade Achche Lagte Hai\" Kishore continued singing for several actors even in 1980s Kumar performed stage shows right from 1969 to earn money to pay his income tax arrears [53] Kumar stopped singing for Amitabh Bachchan in the year 1981, after Bachchan refused to appear as a guest in the film Mamta Ki Chhaon Mein, which Kishore produced Kishore declined to give voice for Amitabh in Naseeb, Coolie, Mard and Desh Premee Kishore said he would give his voice to Randhir Kapoor in the film Pukar, also starring Amitabh Since Kishore shared good rapport with R D Burman, he agreed to sing in Mahaan, Shakti and Bemisal Later, Kishore called a truce by singing for Amitabh in a solo song in Shahenshah and later in Toofan [63] Kishore sang the song \"Mera Geet Adhura Hai\" for his production Mamta Ki Chaon Mein and picturised the song on Rajesh Khanna Kishore had directed the film, but died in 1987 and Rajesh Khanna helped Amit Kumar in releasing the film in 1989 He also temporarily stopped singing for Mithun Chakraborty after Yogeeta Bali divorced him and married Chakraborty [64] However, he later sang for Chakraborty in Surakshaa (1979), and in the 1980s in many films, including Boxer, Jaagir, Faraib and Waqt Ki Awaz.\n\n\nCollaboration with other singers\nKishore Kumar is credited with the highest number of multi-singer and male duet hits with the finest singers of different eras Kishore Kumar sang the highest number of duets with Asha Bhosle (687 duets) He also sang duets with Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor, Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum, Sulakshana Pandit, S Janaki, P Susheela and Kavita Krishnamurthy.\n\n\nBhajans\nKishore Kumar sang Bhajans like \"Aao Kanhai Mere Dham\" from Mere Jeevan Saathi (1972), \"Devi Mata Rani\" from Swarag Se Sunder (1986), \"Jai Bholenath Jai Ho Prabhu\" from Kunwara Baap (1974), \"He Re Kanhaiya\" from Chhoti Bahu (1971), \"Jab Ram Naam Le Le\" from Abhi Toh Jee Le (1977), \"Kahe Apno K Kaam Nahi Aye Tu\" from Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), \"Krishna Krishna, Bolo Krishna\" from Naya Din Nai Raat (1974), \"Prabhuji Teri Leela Aparampaar\" from Humsafar (1953) etc [67] [68]\n\n\nQawwali\nKishore Kumar recorded Qawwalis like all-time hit \"Vaada Tera Vaada\" from Dushman (1971), \"Hum Toh Jhuk Kar Salam Karte Hai\" from Fakira (1976), \"Mehfil Mein Paimana Jo Laga Jhumne\" from Chunaoti (1980), \"Is Ishq Mein\" from Mr Romeo (1974), \"Kya

\"Qurbani Qurbani Qurbani\" from Qurbani (1980) etc [58] [69]\n\n\nGhazals\nKishore Kumar sang Ghazals like \"Peechhli Yaad Bhula Do\" from Mehndi (1983), \"Aisi Haseen Chandni\" from Dard (1981), \"Yun Neend Se Woh Jaan-E-Chaman\" from Dard Ka Rishta (1982), \"Tera Chehra Mejhe Gulab Lage\" from Aapas Ki Baat (1981) and \"Sarakti jaaye hai rukh se naqaab\" from film Deedar e Yaar (1982) with Lata Mangeshkar under the music direction of Laxmikant Pyarelal and penned by famous Urdu shayar Ameer Meenai and many more [69] [70]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKumar married four times His first wife was Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta aka Ruma Ghosh Their marriage lasted from 1950 to 1958 [49]:‚Ää53‚Ää\n\n\nDeath\nBy September 1987, Kishore Kumar had decided to retire as he was unhappy with kind of songs and tunes being made by music directors and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa [53]\n\n\nLegacy\nSingers like Kumar Sanu, Ayushmann Khurrana, Vinod Rathod, Roop Kumar Rathod, [89] Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Amit Kumar, Sudesh Bhosale were influenced by Kishore Kumar's style of singing [90] [91] [92] [93] [94]   Many other singers like Mohit Chauhan, Shaan, Neeti Mohan,

{"title": "Marfan_syndrome", "content": "\nSigns and symptoms\nMore than 30 signs and symptoms are variably associated with Marfan syndrome The most prominent of these affect the skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems, but all fibrous connective tissue throughout the body can be affected [citation needed]\n\n\nSkeletal system\nMost of the readily visible signs are associated with the skeletal system Many people with Marfan syndrome grow to above-average height, and some have disproportionately long, slender limbs with thin, weak wrists and long fingers and toes.\n\n\nEyes\nIn Marfan syndrome, the health of the eye can be affected in many ways, but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the lens is shifted out of its normal position [17] This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the lens shifting upwards and outwards, but it can shift in other directions as well Nearsightedness (myopia), and blurred vision are common due to connective tissue defects in the eye [18] Farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in about 60% of people with Marfan syndrome by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope [18] If the lens subluxation is subtle, then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used [19]\n\n\nCardiovascular system\nThe most serious signs and symptoms associated with Marfan syndrome involve the cardiovascular system: undue fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, racing heartbeats, or chest pain radiating to the back, shoulder, or arm Cold arms, hands, and feet can also be linked to MFS because of inadequate circulation A heart murmur, abnormal reading on an ECG, or symptoms of angina can indicate further investigation The signs of regurgitation from prolapse of the mitral or aortic valves (which control the flow of blood through the heart) result from cystic medial degeneration of the valves, which is commonly associated with MFS (see mitral valve prolapse, aortic regurgitation) However, the major sign that would lead a doctor to consider an underlying condition is a dilated aorta or an aortic aneurysm Sometimes, no heart problems are apparent until the weakening of the connective tissue (cystic medial degeneration) in the ascending aorta causes an aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection, a surgical emergency An aortic dissection is most often fatal and presents with pain radiating down the back, giving a tearing sensation [20]\n\n\nLungs\nIndividuals with Marfan syndrome may be affected by various lung-related problems One study found that only 37% of the patient sample studied (mean age 32¬±14 years; M 45%) had normal lung function [23] Spontaneous pneumothorax is common [24] In spontaneous unilateral pneumothorax, air escapes from a lung and occupies the pleural space between the chest wall and a lung The lung becomes partially compressed or collapsed This can cause pain, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and, if not treated, death Other possible pulmonary manifestations of MFS include sleep apnea [25] and idiopathic obstructive lung disease [26] Pathologic changes in the lungs have been described such as cystic changes, emphysema, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, bullae, apical fibrosis and congenital malformations such as middle lobe hypoplasia [27]\n\n\nNervous system\nDural ectasia, the weakening of the connective tissue of the dural sac encasing the spinal cord, can result in a loss of quality of life It can be present for a long time without producing any noticeable symptoms Symptoms that can occur are lower back pain, leg pain, abdominal pain, other neurological symptoms in the lower extremities, or headaches¬†‚Äì symptoms which usually diminish when lying flat On X-ray, however, dural ectasia is not often visible in the early stages A worsening of symptoms might warrant an MRI of the lower spine Dural ectasia that has progressed to this stage would appear in an MRI as a dilated pouch wearing away at the lumbar vertebrae [28] Other spinal issues associated with MFS include degenerative disc disease, spinal cysts, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system [citation needed]\n\n\nGenetics\nEach parent with the condition has a 50% risk of passing the genetic defect on to any child due to its autosomal dominant nature Most individuals with MFS have another affected family member  About 75% of cases are inherited [1] On the other hand, about 15‚Äì30% of all cases are due to de novo genetic mutations; [29] such spontaneous mutations occur in about one in 20,000 births Marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency [30] [31] It is associated with variable expressivity; complete penetrance has been definitively documented [32]\n\n\nPathogenesis\nMarfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, [33] which encodes fibrillin 1, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix Fibrillin-1 is essential for the proper formation of the extracellular matrix, including the biogenesis and maintenance of elastic fibers The extracellular matrix is critical for both the structural integrity of connective tissue, but also serves as a reservoir for growth factors [29] Elastic fibers are found throughout the body, but are particularly abundant in the aorta, ligaments and the ciliary zonules of the eye; consequently, these areas are among the worst affected.\n\n\nMarfanoid‚Äìprogeroid‚Äìlipodystrophy syndrome\nMarfanoid‚Äìprogeroid‚Äìlipodystrophy syndrome (MPL), also referred to as Marfan lipodystrophy syndrome (MFLS), is a variant of MFS in which Marfan symptoms are accompanied by features usually associated with neonatal progeroid syndrome (also referred to as Wiedemann‚ÄìRautenstrauch syndrome) in which the levels of white adipose tissue are reduced [37] Since 2010, evidence has been accumulating that MPL is caused by mutations near the 3'-terminus of the FBN1 gene [38] [39] It has been shown that these people are also deficient in asprosin, a gluco-regulatory protein hormone which is the C-terminal cleavage product of profibrillin The levels of asprosin seen in these people were lower than expected for a heterozygous genotype, consistent with a dominant negative effect [40]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic criteria of MFS were agreed upon internationally in 1996 [41] However, Marfan syndrome is often difficult to diagnose in children, as they typically do not show symptoms until reaching pubescence [42] A diagnosis is based on family history and a combination of major and minor indicators of the disorder, rare in the general population, that occur in one individual¬†‚Äì for example: four skeletal signs with one or more signs in another body system such as ocular and cardiovascular in one individual The following conditions may result from MFS, but may also occur in people without any known underlying disorder.\n\n\nRevised Ghent nosology\n\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nMany other disorders can produce the same type of body characteristics as Marfan syndrome [61] Genetic testing and evaluating other signs and symptoms can help to differentiate these The following are some of the disorders that can manifest as \"marfanoid\": [citation needed]\n\n\nManagement\nThere is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but life expectancy has increased significantly over the last few decades [when?] and is now similar to that of the average person [63]\n\n\nPhysical activity\nThe American Heart Association made the following recommendations for people with Marfan syndrome with no or mild aortic dilation: [65] [66]\n\n\nMedication\nManagement often includes the use of beta blockers such as propranolol or if not tolerated calcium channel blockers or ACE inhibitors [4] [5] Beta blockers are used to reduce the stress exerted on the aorta and to decrease aortic dilation [18]\n\n\nSurgery\nIf the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter aneurysm, causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a composite aortic valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement) becomes necessary Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis [67] Surgery in the setting of acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic Elective aortic valve/graft surgery is usually considered when aortic root diameter reaches 50 millimeters (2.0 inches), but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common [68] As people with Marfan syndrome live longer, other vascular repairs are becoming more common, e.g., repairs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta [citation needed]\n\n\nPregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection, which is often fatal even when rapidly treated Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and echocardiography should be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible [73]\n\n\nPrognosis\nPrior to modern cardiovascular surgical techniques and medications such as losartan, and metoprolol, the prognosis of those with Marfan syndrome was not good: a range of untreatable cardiovascular issues was common Lifespan was reduced by at least a third, and many died in their teens and twenties due to cardiovascular problems Today, cardiovascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome are still the most significant issues in diagnosis and management of the disease, but adequate prophylactic monitoring and prophylactic therapy offers something approaching a normal lifespan, and more manifestations of the disease are being discovered as more patients live longer [75] Women with Marfan syndrome live longer than men [17]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nMarfan syndrome affects males and females equally, [76] and the mutation shows no ethnic or geographical bias [10] Estimates indicate about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals have Marfan syndrome [4]\n\n\nHistory\nMarfan syndrome is named after Antoine Marfan, [11] the French pediatrician who first described the condition in 1896 after noticing striking features in a five-year-old girl [12] [77] The gene linked to the disease was first identified by Francesco Ramirez at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City in 1991 [78]\n\n\nFamous patients\nNotable people who have or had Marfan syndrome include:\n\n\nSee

are used to reduce the stress exerted on the aorta and to decrease aortic dilation [18]\n\n\nSurgery\nIf the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameter aneurysm, causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly a composite aortic valve graft or valve-sparing aortic root replacement) becomes necessary Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis [67] Surgery in the setting of acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic Elective aortic valve/graft surgery is usually considered when aortic root diameter reaches 50 millimeters (2.0 inches), but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common [68] As people with Marfan syndrome live longer, other vascular repairs are becoming more common, e.g., repairs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta [citation needed]\n\n\nPregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection, which is often fatal even when rapidly treated Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and echocardiography should be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible [73]\n\n\nPrognosis\nPrior to modern cardiovascular surgical techniques and medications such as losartan, and metoprolol, the prognosis of those with Marfan syndrome was not good: a range of untreatable cardiovascular issues was common Lifespan was reduced by at least a third, and many died in their teens and twenties due to cardiovascular problems Today, cardiovascular symptoms of Marfan syndrome are still the most significant issues in diagnosis and management of the disease, but adequate prophylactic monitoring and prophylactic therapy offers something approaching a normal lifespan, and more manifestations of the disease are being discovered as more patients live longer [75] Women with Marfan syndrome live longer than men [17]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nMarfan syndrome affects males and females equally, [76] and the mutation shows no ethnic or geographical bias [10] Estimates indicate about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals have Marfan syndrome [4]\n\n\nHistory\nMarfan syndrome is named after Antoine Marfan, [11] the French pediatrician who first described the condition in 1896 after noticing striking features in a five-year-old girl [12] [77] The gene linked to the disease was first identified by Francesco Ramirez at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City in 1991 [78]\n\n\nFamous patients\nNotable people who have or had Marfan syndrome include:\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Hu_Jintao", "content": "\nEarly life, education, and family\nHu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942 [4] in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates [5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name [6]\n\n\nEarly political career\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission [18] Another prot√©g√© of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\nLeading the party in Guizhou\nIn 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party [22] Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties [23] While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public [23] While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.\n\n\nTenure in Tibet\nHu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his 'liberal' tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer [24] In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance [25] Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising [26] What occurred after is a matter of dispute Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March [27]\n\n\nRise to power\nBefore the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.) Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders [29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\nLeadership\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary [32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nSucceeding Jiang\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary [32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's prot√©g√© [1]\n\n\nSARS crisis\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during

health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's prot√©g√© [1]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nHu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005 Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies [36] The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector, [37] increased funding for education, halted privatization, [38] and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled [39]\n\n\nMedia\nIn media policy, Hu discussed the idea of \"channeling\" public opinion, a term he first used in a 23 January 2007 Politburo meeting [43]:‚Ää71‚Ää Hu stated that the Party should \"grasp the online discourse power, enhance our ability to channel online discussions, emphasize the art of 'channeling', actively leverage new technologies, increase positive coverage, and promote a positive mainstream discourse.\" [43]:‚Ää71‚Ää In an online discussion via the Strong China Forum, Hu stated that China should \"strengthen our traditional media and new media and form a new setting for channeling public opinion\" [43]:‚Ää71‚Äì72‚Ää\n\n\nTibet\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin [44] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable [44] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's economic growth offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts [45] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions [46]\n\n\nHong Kong\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin [44]

pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 Consensus Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China [52]\n\n\nTransition to Xi\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu [58] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president [59]\n\n\nAfter retirement\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media [60] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites [61] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017 [62] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021 [63]\n\n\n20th Communist Party Congress\nAt the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October 2022, Hu, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges [64] [65] [66] This incident occurred before the votes that day, which Hu was absent from as a result [67] [68] Xinhua News Agency, China's official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well, [69] while foreign news speculated about whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi [70] [71] [72] The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu's and his son's names were blocked by Chinese censors [73]\n\n\nJiang Zemin's funeral\nFollowing the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names [74] Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery [75] He was accompanied by an aide.\n\n\nLegacy\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely [76] China's achievements under Hu included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo [76] In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public [77]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans ‚Äî a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms [42] The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\n\nScientific Outlook on

response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, Hu Jintao released the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth [87] Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao's ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric [88]\n\n\nPublic image\nNewsweek named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\" [90] Forbes also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year [91] Hu was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by Forbes Magazine [92] Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Hu among the list of press freedom predators [93]\n\n\nAwards and honors\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically. Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public.\n\n**Political Positions**\n\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans ‚Äî a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms. The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\n**Scientific Outlook on Development**\n\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy.

Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao's ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nNewsweek named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\" Forbes also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year. Hu was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by Forbes Magazine. Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the st", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hu_Jintao\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life, education, and family\nHu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942 [4] in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates [5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name [6]\n\n\nEarly political career\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission [18] Another prot√©g√© of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\nLeading the party in Guizhou\nIn 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party [22] Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties [23] While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public [23] While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.\n\n\nTenure in Tibet\nHu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his 'liberal' tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer [24] In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance [25] Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising [26] What occurred after is a matter of dispute Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March [27]\n\n\nRise to power\nBefore the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.) Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders [29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\nLeadership\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary [32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nSucceeding Jiang\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary [32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nDomestic policy\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's prot√©g√© [1]\n\n\nSARS crisis\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's prot√©g√© [1]\n\n\nEconomic policies\nHu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005 Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies [36] The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector, [37] increased funding for education, halted privatization, [38] and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled [39]\n\n\nMedia\nIn media policy, Hu discussed the idea of \"channeling\" public opinion, a term he first used in a 23 January 2007 Politburo meeting [43]:‚Ää71‚Ää Hu stated that the Party should \"grasp the online discourse power, enhance our ability to channel online discussions, emphasize the art of 'channeling', actively leverage new technologies, increase positive coverage, and promote a positive mainstream discourse.\" [43]:‚Ää71‚Ää In an online discussion via the Strong China Forum, Hu stated that China should \"strengthen our traditional media and new media and form a new setting for channeling public opinion\" [43]:‚Ää71‚Äì72‚Ää\n\n\nTibet\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin [44] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable [44] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's economic growth offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts [45] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions [46]\n\n\nHong Kong\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin [44] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable [44] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's economic growth offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts [45] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions [46]\n\n\nForeign policy\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin [44] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable [44] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's economic growth offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts [45] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions [46]\n\n\nTaiwan\nEarly in his leadership, Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 Consensus Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China [52]\n\n\nTransition to Xi\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu [58] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president [59]\n\n\nAfter retirement\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media [60] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites [61] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017 [62] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021 [63]\n\n\n20th Communist Party Congress\nAt the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October 2022, Hu, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges [64] [65] [66] This incident occurred before the votes that day, which Hu was absent from as a result [67] [68] Xinhua News Agency, China's official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well, [69] while foreign news speculated about whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi [70] [71] [72] The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu's and his son's names were blocked by Chinese censors [73]\n\n\nJiang Zemin's funeral\nFollowing the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names [74] Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery [75] He was accompanied by an aide.\n\n\nLegacy\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely [76] China's achievements under Hu included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo [76] In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei,

{"title": "Sudan", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe country's name Sudan is a name given historically to the large Sahel region of West Africa to the immediate west of modern-day Sudan Historically, Sudan referred to both the geographical region, stretching from Senegal on the Atlantic Coast to Northeast Africa and the modern Sudan.\n\n\nHistory\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach in northern Sudan, [38] which hosts \"the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest open-air hut in the world) and diverse hunting and gathering loci some 50,000 years old\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nPrehistoric Sudan (before c. 8000 BC)\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach in northern Sudan, [38] which hosts \"the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest open-air hut in the world) and diverse hunting and gathering loci some 50,000 years old\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nKerma culture (2500‚Äì1500 BC)\nThe Kerma culture was an early civilization centered in Kerma, Sudan It flourished from around 2500 BC to 1500 BC in ancient Nubia The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of Nubia, or \"Upper Nubia\" (in parts of present-day northern and central Sudan), and later extended its reach northward into Lower Nubia and the border of Egypt [44] The polity seems to have been one of several Nile Valley states during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt In the Kingdom of Kerma's latest phase, lasting from about 1700‚Äì1500 BC, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sa√Ø and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt.\n\n\nEgyptian Nubia (1504‚Äì1070 BC)\nMentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom [45] Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south.\n\n\nKingdom of Kush (c. 1070 BC‚Äì350 AD)\nThe Kingdom of Kush was an ancient Nubian state centred on the confluences of the Blue Nile and White Nile, and the Atbarah River and the Nile River It was established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt; it was centred at Napata in its early phase [50]\n\n\nMedieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350‚Äì1500)\nOn the turn of the fifth century the Blemmyes established a short-lived state in Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia, probably centred around Talmis (Kalabsha), but before 450 they were already driven out of the Nile Valley by the Nobatians The latter eventually founded a kingdom on their own, Nobatia [57]\nBy the sixth century there were in total three Nubian kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, which had its capital at Pachoras (Faras); the central kingdom, Makuria centred at Tungul (Old Dongola), about 13 kilometres (8 miles) south of modern Dongola; and Alodia, in the heartland of the old Kushitic kingdom, which had its capital at Soba (now a suburb of modern-day Khartoum) [58] Still in the sixth century they converted to Christianity [59] In the seventh century, probably at some point between 628 and 642, Nobatia was incorporated into Makuria [60]\n\n\nIslamic kingdoms of Sennar and Darfur (c. 1500‚Äì1821)\nIn 1504 the Funj are recorded to have founded the Kingdom of Sennar, in which Abdallah Jamma's realm was incorporated [92] By 1523, when Jewish traveller David Reubeni visited Sudan, the Funj state already extended as far north as Dongola [93] Meanwhile, Islam began to be preached on the Nile by Sufi holy men who settled there in the 15th and 16th centuries [94] and by David Reubeni's visit king Amara Dunqas, previously a Pagan or nominal Christian, was recorded to be Muslim [95] However, the Funj would retain un-Islamic customs like the divine kingship or the consumption of alcohol until the 18th century [96] Sudanese folk Islam preserved many rituals stemming from Christian traditions until the recent past [97]\n\n\nTurkiyah and Mahdist Sudan (1821‚Äì1899)\nIn 1821, the Ottoman ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, invaded and conquered northern Sudan Although technically the Vali of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali styled himself as Khedive of a virtually independent Egypt Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with Isma ªil Pasha mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt With the exception of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan, he was met without resistance The Egyptian policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by Ibrahim Pasha's son, Isma ªil, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered.\n\n\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899‚Äì1956)\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent [127] In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a Crown colony The British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali Pasha, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries [citation needed]\n\n\nIndependence (1956‚Äìpresent)\nA polling process was carried out resulting in the composition of a democratic parliament and Ismail al-Azhari was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government [136] On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister Ismail al-Azhari.\n\n\nBashir era (1989‚Äì2019)\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel Omar al-Bashir led a bloodless military coup [137] The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level [138] Later, al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists [139] On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"President\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council The executive and legislative powers of the council were taken by al-Bashir [140]\n\n\nPartition and rehabilitation\nThe Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile in the early 2010s between the Army of Sudan and the Sudan Revolutionary Front started as a dispute over the oil-rich region of Abyei in the months leading up to South Sudanese independence in 2011, though it is also related to civil war in Darfur that is nominally resolved A year later in 2012 during the Heglig Crisis Sudan would achieve victory against South Sudan, a war over oil-rich regions between South Sudan's Unity and Sudan's South Kordofan states The events would later be known as the Sudanese Intifada, which would end only in 2013 after al-Bashir promised he would not seek re-election in 2015 He later broke his promise and sought re-election in 2015, winning through a boycott from the opposition who believed that the elections would not be free and fair Voter turnout was at a low 46% [158]\n\n\n2019 Sudanese Revolution and transitional government\nOn 19 December 2018, massive protests began after a government decision to triple the price of goods at a time when the country was suffering an acute shortage of foreign currency and inflation of 70 percent [160] In addition, President al-Bashir, who had been in power for more than 30 years, refused to step down, resulting in the convergence of opposition groups to form a united coalition The government retaliated by arresting more than 800 opposition figures and protesters, leading to the death of approximately 40 people according to the Human Rights Watch, [161] although the number was much higher than that according to local and civilian reports The protests continued after the overthrow of his government on 11 April 2019 after a massive sit-in in front of the Sudanese Armed Forces main headquarters, after which the chiefs of staff decided to intervene and they ordered the arrest of President al-Bashir and declared a three-month state of emergency [162] [163] [164] Over 100 people died on 3 June after security forces dispersed the sit-in using tear gas and live ammunition in what is known as the Khartoum massacre, [165] [166] resulting in Sudan's suspension from the African Union [167] Sudan's youth had been reported to be driving the protests [168] The protests came to an end when the Forces for Freedom and Change (an alliance of groups organizing the protests) and Transitional Military Council (the ruling military government) signed the July 2019 Political Agreement and the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration [169] [170]\n\n\n2021 coup and the al-Burhan regime\nThe Sudanese government announced on 21 September 2021 that there was a failed attempt at a coup d'√©tat from the military that had led to the arrest of 40 military officers [176] [177]\n\n\n2023‚Äìpresent: Internal conflict\nIn April 2023 ‚Äì as an internationally brokered plan for a transition to civilian rule was discussed ‚Äì power struggles grew between army commander (and de facto national leader) Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, Hemedti, head of the heavily armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), formed from the Janjaweed militia [190] [191]\n\n\nGeography\nSudan is situated in North Africa, with an 853¬†km (530¬†mi) coastline bordering the Red Sea [204] It has land borders with Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya With an area of 1,886,068¬†km2 (728,215¬†sq¬†mi), it is the third-largest country on the continent (after Algeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the fifteenth-largest in the world.\n\n\nClimate\nThe amount of rainfall increases towards the south The central and the northern part have extremely dry, semi-desert areas such as the Nubian Desert to the northeast and the Bayuda Desert to the east; in the south, there are grasslands and tropical savanna Sudan's rainy season lasts for about four months (June to September) in the north, and up to six months (May to October) in the south.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nDesertification is a serious problem in Sudan [208] There is also concern over soil erosion Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has proceeded without conservation measures The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of deforestation, soil desiccation, and the lowering of soil fertility and the water table [209]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe politics of Sudan formally took place within the framework of a federal authoritarian Islamic republic until April 2019, when President Omar al-Bashir's regime was overthrown in a military coup led by Vice President Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf As an initial step he established the Transitional Military Council to manage the country's internal affairs He also suspended the constitution and dissolved the bicameral parliament ‚Äì the National Legislature, with its National Assembly (lower chamber) and the Council of States (upper chamber) Ibn Auf however, remained in office for only a single day and then resigned, with the leadership of the Transitional Military Council then being handed to Abdel Fattah al-Burhan On 4 August 2019, a new Constitutional Declaration was signed between the representatives of the Transitional Military Council and the Forces of Freedom and Change, and on 21 August 2019 the Transitional Military Council was officially replaced as head of state by an 11-member Sovereignty Council, and as head of government by a civilian Prime Minister According to 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices Sudan is 6th least democratic country in Africa [211]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe politics of Sudan formally took place within the framework of a federal authoritarian Islamic republic until April 2019, when

implementing hudud punishments like public amputations Al-Turabi supported this move, differing from Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's dissenting view Al-Turabi and his allies within the regime also opposed self-rule in the south, a secular constitution, and non-Islamic cultural acceptance One condition for national reconciliation was re-evaluating the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement that granted the south self-governance, reflecting a failure to accommodate minority rights and leverage Islam's rejection of racism [212] The Islamic economy followed in early 1984, eliminating interest and instituting zakat Nimeiri declared himself the imam of the Sudanese Umma in 1984 [213]\n\n\nUnder Nimeiri\nIn September 1983, President Jaafar Nimeiri introduced sharia law in Sudan, known as September laws,

based on Islamic Sharia law The 2005 Naivasha Agreement, ending the civil war between north and south Sudan, established some protections for non-Muslims in Khartoum Sudan's application of Sharia law is geographically inconsistent [214]\n\n\nAfter al-Bashir\nFollowing the ousting of al-Bashir, the interim constitution signed in August 2019 contained no mention of Sharia law [233] As of 12 July 2020, Sudan abolished the apostasy law, public flogging and alcohol ban for non-Muslims The draft of a new law was passed in early July Sudan also criminalized female genital mutilation with a punishment of up to 3 years in jail [234] An accord between the transitional government and rebel group leadership was signed in September 2020, in which the government agreed to officially separate the state and religion, ending three decades of rule under Islamic law It also agreed that no official state religion will be established [235] [233] [236]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSudan is divided into 18 states (wilayat, sing wilayah) They are further divided into 133 districts.\n\n\nRegional bodies\nIn addition to the states, there also exist regional administrative bodies established by peace agreements between the central government and rebel groups.\n\n\nDisputed areas and zones of conflict\nSudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community, owing to what is viewed as its radical Islamic stance For much of the 1990s, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia formed an ad hoc alliance called the \"Front Line States\" with support from the United States to check the influence of the National Islamic Front government The Sudanese Government supported anti-Ugandan rebel groups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) [239]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community, owing to what is viewed as its radical Islamic stance For much

The Sudanese Government supported anti-Ugandan rebel groups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) [239]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces is the regular forces of Sudan and is divided into five branches: the Sudanese Army, Sudanese Navy (including the Marine Corps), Sudanese Air Force, Border Patrol and the Internal Affairs Defence Force, totalling about 200,000 troops The military of Sudan has become a well-equipped fighting force; a result of increasing local production of heavy and advanced arms These forces are under the command of the National Assembly and its strategic principles include defending Sudan's external borders and preserving internal security.\n\n\nHuman rights\nSince 1983, a combination of civil war and famine has taken the lives of nearly two million people in Sudan [262] It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the Second Sudanese Civil War [263]\n\n\nDarfur\nA 14 August 2006 letter from the executive director of Human Rights Watch found that the Sudanese government is both incapable of protecting its own citizens in Darfur and unwilling to do so, and that its militias are guilty of crimes against humanity The letter added that these human-rights abuses have existed since 2004 [270] Some reports attribute part of the violations to the rebels as well as the government and the Janjaweed The U.S State Department's human-rights report issued in March 2007 claims that \" [a]ll parties to the conflagration committed serious abuses, including widespread killing of civilians, rape as a tool of war, systematic torture, robbery and recruitment of child soldiers.\" [271]\n\n\nPress freedom\nUnder the government of Omar al-Bashir (1989‚Äì2019), Sudan's media outlets were given little freedom in their reporting [275] In 2014, Reporters Without Borders' freedom of the press rankings placed Sudan at 172th of 180 countries [276] After al-Bashir's ousting in 2019, there was a brief period under a civilian-led transitional government where there was some press freedom [275] However, the leaders of a 2021 coup quickly reversed these changes [277] \"The sector is deeply polarised\", Reporters Without Borders stated in their 2023 summary of press freedom in the country \"Journalistic critics have been arrested, and the internet is regularly shut down in order to block the flow of information.\" [278] Additional crackdowns occurred after the beginning of the 2023 Sudanese civil war [275]\n\n\nInternational organisations in Sudan\nSeveral UN agents are operating in Sudan such as the World Food Program (WFP); the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the United Nations Mine Service (UNMAS), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Bank Also present is the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [279] [280]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2010, Sudan was considered the 17th-fastest-growing economy [285] in the world and the rapid development of the country largely from oil profits even when facing international sanctions was noted by The New York Times in a 2006 article [286] Because of the secession of South Sudan, which contained about 75 percent of Sudan's oilfields, [287] Sudan entered a phase of stagflation, GDP growth slowed to 3.4 percent in 2014, 3.1 percent in 2015 and was projected to recover slowly to 3.7 percent in 2016 while inflation remained as high as 21.8% as of 2015 [update] [288] Sudan's GDP fell from US$123.053¬†billion in 2017 to US$40.852¬†billion in 2018 [289]\n\n\nScience and research\nSudan has around 25‚Äì30 universities; instruction is primarily in Arabic or English Education at the secondary and university levels has been seriously hampered by the requirement that most males perform military service before completing their education [301] In addition, the \"Islamisation\" encouraged by president Al-Bashir alienated many researchers: the official language of instruction in universities was changed from English to Arabic and Islamic courses became mandatory Internal science funding withered [302] According to UNESCO, more than 3,000 Sudanese researchers left the country between 2002 and 2014 By 2013, the country had a mere 19 researchers for every 100,000 citizens, or 1/30 the ratio of Egypt, according to the Sudanese National Centre for Research In 2015, Sudan published only about 500 scientific papers [302] In comparison, Poland, a country of similar population size, publishes on the order of 10,000 papers per year [303]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn Sudan's 2008 census, the population of northern, western and eastern Sudan was recorded to be over 30 million [306] This puts present estimates of the population of Sudan after the secession of South Sudan at a little over 30 million people This is a significant increase over the past two decades, as the 1983 census put the total population of Sudan, including present-day South Sudan, at 21.6¬†million [307] The population of Greater Khartoum (including Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North) is growing rapidly and was recorded to be 5.2¬†million.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe Arab population is estimated at 70% of the national total They are almost entirely Muslims and speak predominantly Sudanese Arabic Other ethnicities include Beja, Fur, Nubians, Nuba and Copts [309] [310]\n\n\nUrban areas\nApproximately 70 languages are native to Sudan [320] Sudan has multiple regional sign languages, which are not mutually intelligible A 2009 proposal for a unified Sudanese Sign Language had been worked out [321]\n\n\nLanguages\nApproximately 70 languages are native to Sudan [320] Sudan has multiple regional sign languages, which are not mutually intelligible A 2009 proposal for a unified Sudanese Sign Language had been worked out [321]\n\n\nReligion\nAt the 2011 division which split off South Sudan, over 97% of the population in the remaining Sudan adhered to Islam [325] Most Muslims are divided between two groups: Sufi and Salafi Muslims Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country [326]\n\n\nHealth\nSudan has a life expectancy of 65.1 years according to the latest data for the year 2019 from macrotrends.net [327] Infant mortality in 2016 was 44.8 per 1,000 [328]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children do not go to schools due to the economic situation Environmental and social factors also increase the difficulty of getting to school, especially for girls [330] Primary education consists of eight years, followed by three years of secondary education The former educational ladder 6 + 3 + 3 was changed in 1990 The primary language at all levels is Arabic Schools are concentrated in urban areas; many in the west have been damaged or destroyed by years of civil war In 2001 the World Bank estimated that primary enrollment was 46 percent of eligible pupils and 21 percent of secondary students Enrollment varies widely, falling below 20 percent in some provinces The literacy rate is 70.2% of total population, male: 79.6%, female: 60.8% [259]\n\n\nCulture\nSudanese culture melds the behaviours, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in numerous different dialects and languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested [331]\n\n\nMedia\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan Beginning with the imposition of strict Salafi interpretation of sharia law in 1983, many of the country's most prominent poets and artists, like Mahjoub Sharif, were imprisoned while others, like Mohammed el Amin (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and Mohammed Wardi (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo Traditional music suffered too, with traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated  [1].\n\n\nMusic\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and

traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated  [1].\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Sudan began with cinematography by the British colonial presence in the early 20th century After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the Islamist government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\n\nClothing\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the jalabiya, which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to Egypt The jalabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, coloured, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\n\nSport\nLike in many countries, football is the most popular sport also in Sudan The Sudan Football Association was founded in 1936 and thus it became one of the oldest football associations to exist in Africa However, before the foundation of the Football Association, Sudan had started experiencing football brought to the country by the British colonizers since early 20th century via Egypt Other Sudanese clubs founded at that time include Al-Hilal Omdurman, Al-Merrikh, which led to popularization of football in the country The Khartoum League became the first national league to be played in Sudan, laying ground for the future development of Sudanese football [333]\n\n\nSee

Sea. It has land borders with Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya. With an area of 1,886,068 km2 (728,215 sq mi), it is the third-largest country on the continent (after Algeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the fifteenth-largest in the world.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe country's name Sudan is a name given historically to the large Sahel region of West Africa to the immediate west of modern-day Sudan. Historically, Sudan referred to both the geographical region, stretching from Senegal on the Atlantic Coast to Northeast Africa, and the modern Sudan.\n\n**History**\n\n### Prehistoric Sudan (before c. 8000 BC)\n\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach in northern Sudan. It hosts \"the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest open-air hut in the world) and diverse hunting and gathering loci some 50,000 years old\".\n\n### Kerma culture (2500‚Äì1500 BC)\n\nThe Kerma culture was an early civilization centered in Kerma, Sudan. It flourished from around 2500 BC to 1500 BC in ancient Nubia. The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of Nubia, or \"Upper Nubia\" (in parts of present-day northern and central Sudan), and later extended its reach northward into Lower Nubia and the border of Egypt.\n\n### Egyptian Nubia (1504‚Äì1070 BC)\n\nMentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.\n\n### Kingdom of Kush (c. 1070 BC‚Äì350 AD)\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush was an ancient Nubian state centered on the confluences of the Blue Nile and White Nile, and the Atbarah River and the Nile River. It was established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt; it was centered at Napata in its early phase.\n\n### Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350‚Äì1500)\n\nOn the turn of the fifth century, the Blemmyes established a short-lived state in Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia, probably centered around Talmis (Kalabsha), but before 450, they were already driven out of the Nile Valley by the Nobatians. The latter eventually founded a kingdom on their own, Nobatia.\n\n### Islamic kingdoms of Sennar and Darfur (c. 1500‚Äì1821)\n\nIn 1504, the Funj are recorded to have founded the Kingdom of Sennar, in which Abdallah Jamma's realm was incorporated. By 1523, when Jewish traveler David Reubeni visited Sudan, the Funj state already extended as far north as Dongola.\n\n### Turkiyah and Mahdist Sudan (1821‚Äì1899)\n\nIn 1821, the Ottoman ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, invaded and conquered northern Sudan. Although technically the Vali of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali styled himself as Khedive of a virtually independent Egypt. Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail to conquer the country and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt.\n\n### Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899‚Äì1956)\n\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a Crown colony. The British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali Pasha, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries.\n\n### Independence (1956‚Äìpresent)\n\nA polling process was carried out resulting in the composition of a democratic parliament and Ismail al-Azhari was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government. On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue, and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister Ismail al-Azhari.\n\n### Bashir era (1989‚Äì2019)\n\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel Omar al-Bashir led a bloodless military coup. The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level. Later, al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.\n\n### Partition and rehabilitation\n\nThe Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile in the early 2010s between the Army of Sudan and the Sudan Revolutionary Front started as a dispute over the oil-rich region of Abyei in the months leading up to South Sudanese independence in 2011. A year later in 2012 during the Heglig Crisis, Sudan would achieve victory against South Sudan, a war over oil-rich regions between South Sudan's Unity and Sudan's South Kordofan states.\n\n### 2019 Sudanese Revolution and transitional government\n\nOn 19 December 2018, massive protests began after a government decision to triple the price of goods at a time when the country was suffering an acute shortage of foreign currency and inflation of 70 percent. In addition, President al-Bashir, who had been in power for more than 30 years, refused to step down, resulting in the convergence of opposition groups to form a united coalition. The government retaliated by arresting more than 800 opposition figures and protesters, leading to the death of approximately 40 people according to the Human Rights Watch.\n\n### 2021 coup and the al-Burhan regime\n\nThe Sudanese government announced on 21 September 2021 that there was a failed attempt at a coup d'√©tat from the military that had led to the arrest of 40 military officers.\n\n### 2023‚Äìpresent: Internal conflict\n\nIn April 2023, power struggles grew between army commander (and de facto national leader) Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, Hemedti, head of the heavily armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), formed from the Janjaweed militia.\n\n**Geography**\n\nSudan is situated in North Africa, with an 853 km (530 mi) coastline bordering the Red Sea.

There is also concern over soil erosion. Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has proceeded without conservation measures. The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of deforestation, soil desiccation, and the lowering of soil fertility and the water table.\n\n**Wildlife**\n\nSudan has a rich and diverse wildlife. The country is home to many species of mammals, birds, and reptiles. The Sahara desert covers a significant portion of the country, and the savannas and grasslands in the south are home to many species of antelopes, gazelles, and other large mammals.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces is the regular forces of Sudan and is divided into five branches: the Sudanese Army, Sudanese Navy (including the Marine Corps), Sudanese Air Force, Border Patrol, and the Internal Affairs Defence Force, totaling about 200,000 troops.\n\n**Human rights**\n\nSince 1983, a combination of civil war and famine has taken the lives of nearly two million people in Sudan. It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the Second Sudanese Civil War.\n\n**Darfur**\n\nA 14 August 2006 letter from the executive director of Human Rights Watch found that the Sudanese government is both incapable of protecting its own citizens in Darfur and unwilling to do so, and that its militias are guilty of crimes against humanity.

A 2009 proposal for a unified Sudanese Sign Language had been worked out.\n\n**Religion**\n\nAt the 2011 division, which split off South Sudan, over 97 percent of the population in the remaining Sudan adhered to Islam. Most Muslims are divided between two groups: Sufi and Salafi Muslims. Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively.\n\n**Health**\n\nSudan has a life expectancy of 65.1 years according to the latest data for the year 2019 from macrotrends.net. Infant mortality in 2016 was 44.8 per 1,000.\n\n**Education**\n\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40 percent of children do not go to schools due to the economic situation. Environmental and social factors also increase the difficulty of getting to school, especially for girls. Primary education consists of eight years, followed by three years of secondary education. The former educational ladder 6 + 3 + 3 was changed in 1990. Schools are concentrated in urban areas; many in the west have been damaged or destroyed by years of civil war. In 2001 the World Bank estimated that primary enrollment was 46 percent of eligible pupils and 21 percent of secondary students. Enrollment varies widely, falling below 20 percent in some provinces. The literacy rate is 70.2 percent of total population, male: 79.6 percent, female: 60.8 percent.\n\n**Culture**\n\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in numerous different dialects and languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarizing and contested.\n\n**Media**\n\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan. Beginning with the imposition of strict Salafi interpretation of sharia law in 1983, many of the country's most prominent poets and artists, like Mahjoub Sharif, were imprisoned while others, like Mohammed el Amin (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and Mohammed Wardi (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated.\n\n**Music**\n\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan.

Traditional music suffered too, with traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nThe cinema of Sudan began with cinematography by the British colonial presence in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the Islamist government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\n**Clothing**\n\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the jalabiya, which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to Egypt. The jalabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\n**Sport**\n\nLike in many countries, football is the most popular sport in Sudan. The Sudan Football Association was founded in 1936 and thus it became one of the oldest football associations to exist in Africa. However, before the foundation of the Football Association, Sudan had started experiencing football brought to the country by the British colonizers since early 20th century via Egypt. Other Sudanese clubs founded at that time include Al-Hilal Omdurman, Al-Merrikh, which led to popularization of football in the country. The Khartoum League became the first national league to be played in Sudan, laying ground for the future development of Sudanese football.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Books on Sudan\n* Sudanese literature\n*

article in English about \"Sudan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe country's name Sudan is a name given historically to the large Sahel region of West Africa to the immediate west of modern-day Sudan Historically, Sudan referred to both the geographical region, stretching from Senegal on the Atlantic Coast to Northeast Africa and the modern Sudan.\n\n\nHistory\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach in northern Sudan, [38] which hosts \"the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest open-air hut in the world) and diverse hunting and gathering loci some 50,000 years old\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nPrehistoric Sudan (before c. 8000 BC)\nAffad 23 is an archaeological site located in the Affad region of southern Dongola Reach in northern Sudan, [38] which hosts \"the well-preserved remains of prehistoric camps (relics of the oldest open-air hut in the world) and diverse hunting and gathering loci some 50,000 years old\" [39] [40] [41]\n\n\nKerma culture (2500‚Äì1500 BC)\nThe Kerma culture was an early civilization centered in Kerma, Sudan It flourished from around 2500 BC to 1500 BC in ancient Nubia The Kerma culture was based in the southern part of Nubia, or \"Upper Nubia\" (in parts of present-day northern and central Sudan), and later extended its reach northward into Lower Nubia and the border of Egypt [44] The polity seems to have been one of several Nile Valley states during the Middle Kingdom of Egypt In the Kingdom of Kerma's latest phase, lasting from about 1700‚Äì1500 BC, it absorbed the Sudanese kingdom of Sa√Ø and became a sizable, populous empire rivaling Egypt.\n\n\nEgyptian Nubia (1504‚Äì1070 BC)\nMentuhotep II, the 21st century BC founder of the Middle Kingdom, is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign This is the earliest Egyptian reference to Kush; the Nubian region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom [45] Under Thutmose I, Egypt made several campaigns south.\n\n\nKingdom of Kush (c. 1070 BC‚Äì350 AD)\nThe Kingdom of Kush was an ancient Nubian state centred on the confluences of the Blue Nile and White Nile, and the Atbarah River and the Nile River It was established after the Bronze Age collapse and the disintegration of the New Kingdom of Egypt; it was centred at Napata in its early phase [50]\n\n\nMedieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350‚Äì1500)\nOn the turn of the fifth century the Blemmyes established a short-lived state in Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia, probably centred around Talmis (Kalabsha), but before 450 they were already driven out of the Nile Valley by the Nobatians The latter eventually founded a kingdom on their own, Nobatia [57]\nBy the sixth century there were in total three Nubian kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, which had its capital at Pachoras (Faras); the central kingdom, Makuria centred at Tungul (Old Dongola), about 13 kilometres (8 miles) south of modern Dongola; and Alodia, in the heartland of the old Kushitic kingdom, which had its capital at Soba (now a suburb of modern-day Khartoum) [58] Still in the sixth century they converted to Christianity [59] In the seventh century, probably at some point between 628 and 642, Nobatia was incorporated into Makuria [60]\n\n\nIslamic kingdoms of Sennar and Darfur (c. 1500‚Äì1821)\nIn 1504 the Funj are recorded to have founded the Kingdom of Sennar, in which Abdallah Jamma's realm was incorporated [92] By 1523, when Jewish traveller David Reubeni visited Sudan, the Funj state already extended as far north as Dongola [93] Meanwhile, Islam began to be preached on the Nile by Sufi holy men who settled there in the 15th and 16th centuries [94] and by David Reubeni's visit king Amara Dunqas, previously a Pagan or nominal Christian, was recorded to be Muslim [95] However, the Funj would retain un-Islamic customs like the divine kingship or the consumption of alcohol until the 18th century [96] Sudanese folk Islam preserved many rituals stemming from Christian traditions until the recent past [97]\n\n\nTurkiyah and Mahdist Sudan (1821‚Äì1899)\nIn 1821, the Ottoman ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, invaded and conquered northern Sudan Although technically the Vali of Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Ali styled himself as Khedive of a virtually independent Egypt Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with Isma ªil Pasha mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt With the exception of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan, he was met without resistance The Egyptian policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by Ibrahim Pasha's son, Isma ªil, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered.\n\n\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899‚Äì1956)\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent [127] In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a Crown colony The British were keen to reverse the process, started under Muhammad Ali Pasha, of uniting the Nile Valley under Egyptian leadership and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries [citation needed]\n\n\nIndependence (1956‚Äìpresent)\nA polling process was carried out resulting in the composition of a democratic parliament and Ismail al-Azhari was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government [136] On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister Ismail al-Azhari.\n\n\nBashir era (1989‚Äì2019)\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel Omar al-Bashir led a bloodless military coup [137] The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level [138] Later, al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists [139] On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"President\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council The executive and legislative powers of the council were taken by al-Bashir [140]\n\n\nPartition and rehabilitation\nThe Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile in the early 2010s between the Army of Sudan and the Sudan Revolutionary Front started as a dispute over the oil-rich region of Abyei in the months leading up to South Sudanese independence in 2011, though it is also related to civil war in Darfur that is nominally resolved A year later in 2012 during the Heglig Crisis Sudan would achieve victory against South Sudan, a war over oil-rich regions between South Sudan's Unity and Sudan's South Kordofan states The events would later be known as the Sudanese Intifada, which would end only in 2013 after al-Bashir promised he would not seek re-election in 2015 He later broke his promise and sought re-election in 2015, winning through a boycott from the opposition who believed that the elections would not be free and fair Voter turnout was at a low 46% [158]\n\n\n2019 Sudanese Revolution and transitional government\nOn 19 December 2018, massive protests began after a government decision to triple the price of goods at a time when the country was suffering an acute shortage of foreign currency and inflation of 70 percent [160] In addition, President al-Bashir, who had been in power for more than 30 years, refused to step down, resulting in the convergence of opposition groups to form a united coalition The government retaliated by arresting more than 800 opposition figures and protesters, leading to the death of approximately 40 people according to the Human Rights Watch, [161] although the number was much higher than that according to local and civilian reports The protests continued after the overthrow of his government on 11 April 2019 after a massive sit-in in front of the Sudanese Armed Forces main headquarters, after which the chiefs of staff decided to intervene and they ordered the arrest of President al-Bashir and declared a three-month state of emergency [162] [163] [164] Over 100 people died on 3 June after security forces dispersed the sit-in using tear gas and live ammunition in what is known as the Khartoum massacre, [165] [166] resulting in Sudan's suspension from the African Union [167] Sudan's youth had been reported to be driving the protests [168] The protests came to an end when the Forces for Freedom and Change (an alliance of groups organizing the protests) and Transitional Military Council (the ruling military government) signed the July 2019 Political Agreement and the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration [169] [170]\n\n\n2021 coup and the al-Burhan regime\nThe Sudanese government announced on 21 September 2021 that there was a failed attempt at a coup d'√©tat from the military that had led to the arrest of 40 military officers [176] [177]\n\n\n2023‚Äìpresent: Internal conflict\nIn April 2023 ‚Äì as an internationally brokered plan for a transition to civilian rule was discussed ‚Äì power struggles grew between army commander (and de facto national leader) Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy, Hemedti, head of the heavily armed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), formed from the Janjaweed militia [190] [191]\n\n\nGeography\nSudan is situated in North Africa, with an 853¬†km (530¬†mi) coastline bordering the Red Sea [204] It has land borders with Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya With an area of 1,886,068¬†km2 (728,215¬†sq¬†mi), it is the third-largest country on the continent (after Algeria and Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the fifteenth-largest in the world.\n\n\nClimate\nThe amount of rainfall increases towards the south The central and the northern part have extremely dry, semi-desert areas such as the Nubian Desert to the northeast and the Bayuda Desert to the east; in the south, there are grasslands and tropical savanna Sudan's rainy season lasts for about four months (June to September) in the north, and up to six months (May to October) in the south.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nDesertification is a serious problem in Sudan [208] There is also concern over soil erosion Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has proceeded without conservation measures The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of deforestation, soil desiccation, and the lowering of soil fertility and the water table [209]\n\n\nWildlife\nThe politics of Sudan formally took place within the framework of a federal authoritarian Islamic republic until April 2019, when President Omar al-Bashir's regime was overthrown in a military coup led by Vice President Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf As an initial step he established the Transitional Military Council to manage the country's internal affairs He also suspended the constitution and dissolved the bicameral parliament ‚Äì the National Legislature, with its National Assembly (lower chamber) and the Council of States (upper chamber) Ibn Auf however, remained in office for only a single day and then resigned, with the leadership of the Transitional Military Council then being handed to Abdel Fattah al-Burhan On 4 August 2019, a new Constitutional Declaration was signed between the representatives of the Transitional Military Council and the Forces of Freedom and Change, and on 21 August 2019 the Transitional Military Council was officially replaced as head of state by an 11-member Sovereignty Council, and as head of government by a civilian Prime Minister According to 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices Sudan is 6th least democratic country in Africa [211]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe politics of Sudan formally took place within the framework of a federal authoritarian Islamic

Democracy indices Sudan is 6th least democratic country in Africa [211]\n\n\nSharia law\nIn September 1983, President Jaafar Nimeiri introduced sharia law in Sudan, known as September laws, symbolically disposing of alcohol and implementing hudud punishments like public amputations Al-Turabi supported this move, differing from Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's dissenting view Al-Turabi and his allies within the regime also opposed self-rule in the south, a secular constitution, and non-Islamic cultural acceptance One condition for national reconciliation was re-evaluating the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement that granted the south self-governance, reflecting a failure to accommodate minority rights and leverage Islam's rejection of racism [212] The Islamic economy followed in early 1984, eliminating interest and instituting zakat Nimeiri declared himself the imam of the Sudanese Umma in 1984 [213]\n\n\nUnder Nimeiri\nIn September 1983, President Jaafar Nimeiri introduced sharia law in

al-Bashir, the legal system in Sudan was based on Islamic Sharia law The 2005 Naivasha Agreement, ending the civil war between north and south Sudan, established some protections for non-Muslims in Khartoum Sudan's application of Sharia law is geographically inconsistent [214]\n\n\nAfter al-Bashir\nFollowing the ousting of al-Bashir, the interim constitution signed in August 2019 contained no mention of Sharia law [233] As of 12 July 2020, Sudan abolished the apostasy law, public flogging and alcohol ban for non-Muslims The draft of a new law was passed in early July Sudan also criminalized female genital mutilation with a punishment of up to 3 years in jail [234] An accord between the transitional government and rebel group leadership was signed in September 2020, in which the government agreed to officially separate the state and religion, ending three decades of rule under Islamic law It also agreed that no official state religion will be established [235] [233] [236]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSudan is divided into 18 states (wilayat, sing wilayah) They are further divided into 133 districts.\n\n\nRegional bodies\nIn addition to the states, there also exist regional administrative bodies established by peace agreements between the central government and rebel groups.\n\n\nDisputed areas and zones of conflict\nSudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community, owing to what is viewed as its radical Islamic stance For much of the 1990s, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia formed an ad hoc alliance called the \"Front Line States\" with support from the United States to check the influence of the National Islamic Front government The Sudanese Government supported anti-Ugandan rebel groups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) [239]\n\n\nForeign relations\nSudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community, owing to what is viewed as its

National Islamic Front government The Sudanese Government supported anti-Ugandan rebel groups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) [239]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces is the regular forces of Sudan and is divided into five branches: the Sudanese Army, Sudanese Navy (including the Marine Corps), Sudanese Air Force, Border Patrol and the Internal Affairs Defence Force, totalling about 200,000 troops The military of Sudan has become a well-equipped fighting force; a result of increasing local production of heavy and advanced arms These forces are under the command of the National Assembly and its strategic principles include defending Sudan's external borders and preserving internal security.\n\n\nHuman rights\nSince 1983, a combination of civil war and famine has taken the lives of nearly two million people in Sudan [262] It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the Second Sudanese Civil War [263]\n\n\nDarfur\nA 14 August 2006 letter from the executive director of Human Rights Watch found that the Sudanese government is both incapable of protecting its own citizens in Darfur and unwilling to do so, and that its militias are guilty of crimes against humanity The letter added that these human-rights abuses have existed since 2004 [270] Some reports attribute part of the violations to the rebels as well as the government and the Janjaweed The U.S State Department's human-rights report issued in March 2007 claims that \" [a]ll parties to the conflagration committed serious abuses, including widespread killing of civilians, rape as a tool of war, systematic torture, robbery and recruitment of child soldiers.\" [271]\n\n\nPress freedom\nUnder the government of Omar al-Bashir (1989‚Äì2019), Sudan's media outlets were given little freedom in their reporting [275] In 2014, Reporters Without Borders' freedom of the press rankings placed Sudan at 172th of 180 countries [276] After al-Bashir's ousting in 2019, there was a brief period under a civilian-led transitional government where there was some press freedom [275] However, the leaders of a 2021 coup quickly reversed these changes [277] \"The sector is deeply polarised\", Reporters Without Borders stated in their 2023 summary of press freedom in the country \"Journalistic critics have been arrested, and the internet is regularly shut down in order to block the flow of information.\" [278] Additional crackdowns occurred after the beginning of the 2023 Sudanese civil war [275]\n\n\nInternational organisations in Sudan\nSeveral UN agents are operating in Sudan such as the World Food Program (WFP); the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the United Nations Mine Service (UNMAS), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Bank Also present is the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [279] [280]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2010, Sudan was considered the 17th-fastest-growing economy [285] in the world and the rapid development of the country largely from oil profits even when facing international sanctions was noted by The New York Times in a 2006 article [286] Because of the secession of South Sudan, which contained about 75 percent of Sudan's oilfields, [287] Sudan entered a phase of stagflation, GDP growth slowed to 3.4 percent in 2014, 3.1 percent in 2015 and was projected to recover slowly to 3.7 percent in 2016 while inflation remained as high as 21.8% as of 2015 [update] [288] Sudan's GDP fell from US$123.053¬†billion in 2017 to US$40.852¬†billion in 2018 [289]\n\n\nScience and research\nSudan has around 25‚Äì30 universities; instruction is primarily in Arabic or English Education at the secondary and university levels has been seriously hampered by the requirement that most males perform military service before completing their education [301] In addition, the \"Islamisation\" encouraged by president Al-Bashir alienated many researchers: the official language of instruction in universities was changed from English to Arabic and Islamic courses became mandatory Internal science funding withered [302] According to UNESCO, more than 3,000 Sudanese researchers left the country between 2002 and 2014 By 2013, the country had a mere 19 researchers for every 100,000 citizens, or 1/30 the ratio of Egypt, according to the Sudanese National Centre for Research In 2015, Sudan published only about 500 scientific papers [302] In comparison, Poland, a country of similar population size, publishes on the order of 10,000 papers per year [303]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn Sudan's 2008 census, the population of northern, western and eastern Sudan was recorded to be over 30 million [306] This puts present estimates of the population of Sudan after the secession of South Sudan at a little over 30 million people This is a significant increase over the past two decades, as the 1983 census put the total population of Sudan, including present-day South Sudan, at 21.6¬†million [307] The population of Greater Khartoum (including Khartoum, Omdurman, and Khartoum North) is growing rapidly and was recorded to be 5.2¬†million.\n\n\nEthnic groups\nThe Arab population is estimated at 70% of the national total They are almost entirely Muslims and speak predominantly Sudanese Arabic Other ethnicities include Beja, Fur, Nubians, Nuba and Copts [309] [310]\n\n\nUrban areas\nApproximately 70 languages are native to Sudan [320] Sudan has multiple regional sign languages, which are not mutually intelligible A 2009 proposal for a unified Sudanese Sign Language had been worked out [321]\n\n\nLanguages\nApproximately 70 languages are native to Sudan [320] Sudan has multiple regional sign languages, which are not mutually intelligible A 2009 proposal for a unified Sudanese Sign Language had been worked out [321]\n\n\nReligion\nAt the 2011 division which split off South Sudan, over 97% of the population in the remaining Sudan adhered to Islam [325] Most Muslims are divided between two groups: Sufi and Salafi Muslims Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country [326]\n\n\nHealth\nSudan has a life expectancy of 65.1 years according to the latest data for the year 2019 from macrotrends.net [327] Infant mortality in 2016 was 44.8 per 1,000 [328]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children do not go to schools due to the economic situation Environmental and social factors also increase the difficulty of getting to school, especially for girls [330] Primary education consists of eight years, followed by three years of secondary education The former educational ladder 6 + 3 + 3 was changed in 1990 The primary language at all levels is Arabic Schools are concentrated in urban areas; many in the west have been damaged or destroyed by years of civil war In 2001 the World Bank estimated that primary enrollment was 46 percent of eligible pupils and 21 percent of secondary students Enrollment varies widely, falling below 20 percent in some provinces The literacy rate is 70.2% of total population, male: 79.6%, female: 60.8% [259]\n\n\nCulture\nSudanese culture melds the behaviours, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in numerous different dialects and languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested [331]\n\n\nMedia\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan Beginning with the imposition of strict Salafi interpretation of sharia law in 1983, many of the country's most prominent poets and artists, like Mahjoub Sharif, were imprisoned while others, like Mohammed el Amin (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and Mohammed Wardi (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo Traditional music suffered too, with traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated  [1].\n\n\nMusic\nSudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has

Traditional music suffered too, with traditional ZƒÅr ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated  [1].\n\n\nCinema\nThe cinema of Sudan began with cinematography by the British colonial presence in the early 20th century After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the Islamist government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\n\nClothing\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the jalabiya, which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to Egypt The jalabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, coloured, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\n\nSport\nLike in many countries, football is the most popular sport also in Sudan The Sudan Football Association was founded in 1936 and thus it became one of the oldest football associations to exist in Africa However, before the foundation of the Football Association, Sudan had started experiencing football brought to the country by the British colonizers since early 20th century via Egypt Other Sudanese clubs founded at that time include Al-Hilal Omdurman, Al-Merrikh, which led to popularization of football in the country The Khartoum League became the first national league to be played in Sudan, laying ground for the future development of Sudanese football [333]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "T-72", "content": "\nDevelopment\nThe T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams Morozov KB was led by Alexander Morozov in Kharkiv Uralvagon KB was led by Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil [15]\n\n\nDevelopment from the T-64\nThe T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams Morozov KB was led by Alexander Morozov in Kharkiv Uralvagon KB was led by Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil [15]\n\n\nObject 172\nIn 1967, the Uralvagonzavod formed \"Section 520\", which was to prepare the serial production of the T-64 for 1970 [23] Because of the time-consuming construction of the 5TDF engines, which took about twice as long as the contemporary V-45, the Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv could not provide a sufficient number of 5TDF engines for all Soviet tank factories [24] The Military-Industrial Commission (VPK) authorized work on two alternative engines for a wartime T-64, a so-called \"mobilization model\" that could be produced more quickly and at half the cost [15] Obj 219 (which became the T-80, with a GTD-1000T gas-turbine) was designed in Leningrad Ob 439 with a diesel V-45 engine was designed by Uralvagon KB at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil [25]\n\n\nT-72\nBeing only a mobilisation model, serial production of Object¬†172 was not possible in peacetime However, by 1971, even Ustinov was growing tired of problems with the T-64 [25] In an unclear political process [32] decree number 326-113 was issued, which allowed the production of Object 172 in the Soviet Union from 1 January 1972, and freed Uralvagonzavod from the T-64A production [33]\n\n\nProduction history\nThe first series production of T-72 Object 172M began in July at UKBM in Nizhny Tagil However, due to difficulties in getting the factory organised for the change in production from T-64 to T-72, only 30 completed tanks were delivered in 1973 Troubles continued in 1974 where out of a state production quota of 440 only 220 were officially declared, with the actual number of completed tanks being close to 150 As a result, substantial investment in tooling was undertaken Only after modernisation, could the factory begin full-scale production of the T-72 Nizhny Tagil produced the tank in various modifications until 1992.\n\n\nModels\nMain models of the T-72, built in the Soviet Union and Russia Command tanks have K added to their designation for komandirskiy, \"command\", for example T-72K is the command version of the basic T-72 Versions with reactive armour have V added, for vzryvnoy, \"explosive\".\n\n\nVariants\nIn addition, the T-72 hull has been used as the basis for other heavy vehicle designs, including the following:\n\n\nDesign characteristics\nThe T-72 shares many design features with other tank designs of Soviet origin Some of these are viewed as deficiencies in a straight comparison to NATO tanks, but most are a product of the way these tanks were envisioned to be employed, based on the Soviets' practical experiences in World War II.\n\n\nWeight\nThe T-72 is extremely lightweight, at forty-one tonnes, and very small compared to Western main battle tanks Some of the roads and bridges in former Warsaw Pact countries were designed such that T-72s can travel along in formation, but NATO tanks could not pass at all, or just one-by-one, significantly reducing their mobility The basic T-72 is relatively underpowered, with a 780¬†hp (580¬†kW) supercharged version of the basic 500¬†hp (370¬†kW) V12 diesel engine originally designed for the World War II-era T-34 The 0.58¬†m (1¬†ft 11¬†in) wide tracks run on large-diameter road wheels, which allows for easy identification of the T-72 and descendants (the T-64 family has relatively small road wheels).\n\n\nNuclear, biological, and chemical protection\nThe T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions The crew is supplied clean air via an air filter system A slight over-pressure prevents entry of contamination via bearings and joints Use of an autoloader for the main gun allows for more efficient forced smoke removal compared to traditional manually loaded (\"pig-loader\") tank guns, so NBC isolation of the fighting compartment can, in theory, be maintained indefinitely.\n\n\nInterior\nLike all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader There is a widespread Cold War-era myth that Soviet tanks were so cramped that height constraints were put in place, with a maximum height of 5¬†ft 4in (163¬†cm) However, official regulations state that the T-72 allowed for a height of 5¬†ft 9in (175¬†cm), which was standard for other tanks at the time The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.\n\n\nArmour\nArmour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding generation The original T-72 \"Ural\" Object 172M's (from 1973) turret is made from conventional cast high hardness steel (HHS) armour with no laminate inserts It is believed that the maximum thickness is 280¬†mm (11¬†in) and the nose is 80¬†mm (3.1¬†in) The glacis of the new laminated armour is 205¬†mm (8.1¬†in) thick, comprising 80¬†mm (3.1¬†in) HHS, 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) double layer of laminate and 20¬†mm (0.79¬†in) RHA steel, which when inclined gives about 500‚Äì600¬†mm (20‚Äì24¬†in) thickness along the line of sight In 1977 the armour of the T-72 Object 172M was slightly changed The turret now featured insert filled with ceramic sand bars \"kwartz\" rods and the glacis plate composition was changed It was now made up of 60¬†mm (2.4¬†in) HHA steel, 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) glass Tekstolit laminate and 50¬†mm (2.0¬†in) RHA steel This version was often known in Soviet circles as T-72 \"Ural-1\" The next armour update was introduced by the T-72A (Object 176), which was designed in 1976 and replaced the original on the production lines during 1979‚Äì1985 T-72 Object 1976 is also known as T-72A With the introduction of the T-72B (Object 184) in 1985, the composite armour was again changed According to retired major, James M Warford, variants developed after the T-72 base model and T-72M/T-72G MBT, featured a cast steel turret that included a cavity filled with quartz or sand in a form similar to US \"fused-silica\" armour [48] The T-72 Model 1978 (Obiekt 172M sb-4), which entered production in 1977, featured a new turret with special armour composed of ceramic rods [49]\n\n\nEstimated protection level\nThe following table shows the estimated protection level of different T-72 models in rolled homogeneous armour equivalency, i.e., the composite armour of the turret of a T-72B offers as much protection against an armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round as a 520¬†mm (20¬†in) thick armour steel layer.\n\n\nGun\nThe T-72 is equipped with the 125¬†mm (4.9¬†in) 2A46 series main gun, a significantly larger (20-mm larger) calibre than the standard 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) gun found in contemporary Western MBTs, and still slightly larger than the 120 mm/L44 found in many modern Western MBTs As is typical of Soviet tanks, the gun can fire anti-tank guided missiles, and standard main gun ammunition, including HEAT and APFSDS rounds.\n\n\nAutoloader\nLike the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.\n\n\nOperators and service\nThe T-72 was never used in the Afghanistan War [citation needed] The 40th Soviet Army that was deployed there had mainly T-55, and T-62 tanks [84]\n\n\nSyria\nIn the 1982 Lebanon War, Syrian T-72s are believed to have engaged Israeli tanks (M60A1, Magach or possibly Merkava tanks) in the south of Lebanon [85] On 9 June 1982, the Syrian General HQ ordered a brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, recently equipped with T-72 tanks, to move straight ahead, cross the border, and hit the right flank of the Israeli units advancing along the eastern side of Beka'a valley The ensuing battle staved off further Israeli advance and 10 IDF main battle tanks were destroyed After the war, Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad called it \"the best tank in the world\" [86]\n\n\nIraq\nIraqi T-72 Ural (1973)s, T-72 Ural Modernization, T-72Ms and T-72M1s were used successfully throughout the Iran-Iraq War and in countless operations, among others Operation Nasr, in the battle for Basra and during the Tawakalna ala Allah Operations 105 mm M68 tank guns and TOW missiles proved ineffective against the frontal armour of Iraqi T-72s [90] [91] Sixty T-72 tanks were lost during the eight years of war [92] [93] Ra'ad Al-Hamdani, an Iraqi general in the Iraqi Republican Guard, stating \"The 16th Iranian Armoured Division, which was equipped with Chieftain tanks, lost a battle against the 10th Iraqi Armoured Brigade with T-72 tanks It is hard for an armoured brigade to destroy a division in 12 hours but it happened; it was a disaster for the Iranians\" [94] Out of the 894 Chieftain tanks that had started the war only 200 were left by the war's end [95] The 3BM9 APFSDS shell was more than enough to deal with any NATO tank of the time, including the most heavily armoured such as the M60A1 and the Chieftain According to a Soviet analysis of an Iranian Chieftain captured by the Iraqi army during the early part of the Iran-Iraq war, the Chieftain Mk.5 was considered to have totally insufficient protection even at its strongest points The frontal part of the entire turret, hull upper front plate and lower front plate could all be defeated at 3¬†km or more This essentially means that the T-72 Ural could defeat one of NATO's toughest tanks at any reasonable combat distance [96] According to Iranians and Iraqis, the T-72 was the most feared tank of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War [97]\n\n\nChechen wars\nDuring the First Chechen War (December 1994 to September 1996) fought between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, led by Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Russian Federation deployed both T-72 and T-80 tanks Russian AFV losses during the first three months fighting amounted to 62 tank (T-72/T-80) losses (44 T-72s of 141, 18 T-80s of 71 and 0 PT-76s of 9) Analysis of damage to non repairable vehicles showed that no T-72 were lost to frontal penetration of the hull from man portable anti tank weapons [111]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War\nDuring the war in South Ossetia in 2008 both sides deployed great numbers of T-72 tanks  At the time of the conflict, the Georgian military fielded 191 T-72 tanks of which 120 were modified to T-72SIM1s The Georgian army deployed a total of 75 of its T-72 tanks into South Ossetia [117] The Georgian military lost 30 T-72s, ten in combat during the fighting around Tskhinvali, [118] and another 20 destroyed by Russian paratroopers after their capture [119]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nOn 26 August 2014, the International Institute for Strategic Studies claimed that it had identified a mixed Russian column composed of at least 3 T-72Bs and a lone T-72B3 in the war in Donbas The significance of this sighting was that Russia attempted to maintain plausible deniability over the issue of supplying tanks and other arms to the separatists Russia continuously claimed that any tanks operated by the separatists must have been captured from Ukraine's own army The T-72B3 is in service with the Russian Army in large numbers This modernized T-72 is not known to have been exported to nor operated by any other country [120]\n\n\nWar in Donbas\nOn 26 August 2014, the International Institute for Strategic Studies claimed that it had identified a mixed Russian column composed of at least 3 T-72Bs and a lone T-72B3 in the war in Donbas The significance of this sighting was that Russia attempted to maintain plausible deniability

extensive service in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine with both sides [124]\n\n\nCombat history\nBackground: History of the tank, Tank classification, Tanks in the Cold War\n\n\nSee

Developed as a replacement for the T-55, the T-72 was designed to be a more advanced and capable tank, with improved armor, firepower, and mobility.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams at Morozov KB in Kharkiv and Uralvagon KB in Nizhny Tagil. The Morozov team, led by Alexander Morozov, was tasked with developing a new tank that would meet the Soviet Union's military requirements, while the Uralvagon team, led by Leonid Kartsev, was working on a competing design.\n\nIn 1967, the Uralvagonzavod formed \"Section 520,\" which was responsible for preparing the serial production of the T-64 for 1970. However, due to difficulties in producing the 5TDF engine, which took twice as long as the contemporary V-45 engine, the Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv could not meet the demand for engines.\n\n**Object 172**\n\nAs a result, the Military-Industrial Commission (VPK) authorized work on two alternative engines for a wartime T-64, a \"mobilization model\" that could be produced more quickly and at half the cost. The Object 172 was designed to be a mobilization model, with a simplified design and reduced production time.\n\n**T-72**\n\nBy 1971, even Ustinov was growing tired of problems with the T-64, and decree number 326-113 was issued, which allowed the production of Object 172 in the Soviet Union from 1 January 1972, and freed Uralvagonzavod from the T-64A production. The first series production of T-72 Object 172M began in July at UKBM in Nizhny Tagil.\n\nHowever, due to difficulties in getting the factory organized for the change in production from T-64 to T-72, only 30 completed tanks were delivered in 1973. Troubles continued in 1974, with only 220 officially declared out of a state production quota of 440, and the actual number of completed tanks being close to 150.\n\n**Models**\n\nThe main models of the T-72, built in the Soviet Union and Russia, include:\n\n* Command tanks, which have \"K\" added to their designation for \"komandirskiy,\" or \"command.\"\n* Versions with reactive armor, which have \"V\" added to their designation for \"vzryvnoy,\" or \"explosive.\"\n\n**Variants**\n\nIn addition to the T-72, the T-72 hull has been used as the basis for other heavy vehicle designs, including:\n\n* The T-90, which is a modernized version of the T-72.\n* The T-14 Armata, which is a fifth-generation main battle tank that is designed to replace the T-72.\n\n**Design Characteristics**\n\nThe T-72 shares many design features with other tank designs of Soviet origin. Some of these features, such as the use of a cast steel turret and a mechanical loader, are viewed as deficiencies in a straight comparison to NATO tanks. However, most of these features are a product of the way these tanks were envisioned to be employed, based on the Soviets' practical experiences in World War II.\n\n**Weight**\n\nThe T-72 is extremely lightweight, at 41 tons, and very small compared to Western main battle tanks. Some of the roads and bridges in former Warsaw Pact countries were designed such that T-72s can travel along in formation, but NATO tanks could not pass at all, or just one-by-one.\n\n**Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection**\n\nThe T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system. The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions.\n\n**Interior**\n\nLike all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and efficient use of armor. The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks.\n\n**Armour**\n\nArmour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding generation. The original T-72 \"Ural\" Object 172M's turret is made from conventional cast high hardness steel (HHS) armour with no laminate inserts. The glacis of the new laminated armour is 205 mm thick, comprising 80 mm HHS, 105 mm double layer of laminate and 20 mm RHA steel.\n\n**Gun**\n\nThe T-72 is equipped with the 125 mm (4.9 in) 2A46 series main gun, which is a significantly larger calibre than the standard 105 mm gun found in contemporary Western MBTs. The gun can fire anti-tank guided missiles, and standard main gun ammunition, including HEAT and APFSDS rounds.\n\n**Autoloader**\n\nThe T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.\n\n**Operators and Service**\n\nThe T-72 was never used in the Afghanistan War. However, it has seen extensive service in various conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War, the First Chechen War, the Russo-Georgian War, and the War in Donbas.\n\n**Combat History**\n\nThe T-72 has seen extensive service in various conflicts, including:\n\n* The Iran-Iraq War, where Iraqi T-72s were used successfully throughout the conflict.\n* The First Chechen War, where Russian T-72s were deployed and saw action.\n* The Russo-Georgian War, where both sides deployed T-72s.\n* The War in Donbas, where Ukrainian T-72s were deployed and saw action.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* T-64\n* T-90\n* T-14 Armata\n* Main battle tank\n* Soviet Union\n* Russia\n* Ukraine\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Georgia\n* Chechnya\n* South Ossetia\n* War in Donbas\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The T-72 has been produced in various countries, including the Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, and others.\n* The T-72 has been exported to various countries, including the Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, and others.\n* The T-72 has seen extensive service in various conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War, the First Chechen War, the Russo-Georgian War, and the War in Donbas.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* Various sources, including books,

Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil [15]\n\n\nDevelopment from the T-64\nThe T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams Morozov KB was led by Alexander Morozov in Kharkiv Uralvagon KB was led by Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil [15]\n\n\nObject 172\nIn 1967, the Uralvagonzavod formed \"Section 520\", which was to prepare the serial production of the T-64 for 1970 [23] Because of the time-consuming construction of the 5TDF engines, which took about twice as long as the contemporary V-45, the Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv could not provide a sufficient number of 5TDF engines for all Soviet tank factories [24] The Military-Industrial Commission (VPK) authorized work on two alternative engines for a wartime T-64, a so-called \"mobilization model\" that could be produced more quickly and at half the cost [15] Obj 219 (which became the T-80, with a GTD-1000T gas-turbine) was designed in Leningrad Ob 439 with a diesel V-45 engine was designed by Uralvagon KB at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil [25]\n\n\nT-72\nBeing only a mobilisation model, serial production of Object¬†172 was not possible in peacetime However, by 1971, even Ustinov was growing tired of problems with the T-64 [25] In an unclear political process [32] decree number 326-113 was issued, which allowed the production of Object 172 in the Soviet Union from 1 January 1972, and freed Uralvagonzavod from the T-64A production [33]\n\n\nProduction history\nThe first series production of T-72 Object 172M began in July at UKBM in Nizhny Tagil However, due to difficulties in getting the factory organised for the change in production from T-64 to T-72, only 30 completed tanks were delivered in 1973 Troubles continued in 1974 where out of a state production quota of 440 only 220 were officially declared, with the actual number of completed tanks being close to 150 As a result, substantial investment in tooling was undertaken Only after modernisation, could the factory begin full-scale production of the T-72 Nizhny Tagil produced the tank in various modifications until 1992.\n\n\nModels\nMain models of the T-72, built in the Soviet Union and Russia Command tanks have K added to their designation for komandirskiy, \"command\", for example T-72K is the command version of the basic T-72 Versions with reactive armour have V added, for vzryvnoy, \"explosive\".\n\n\nVariants\nIn addition, the T-72 hull has been used as the basis for other heavy vehicle designs, including the following:\n\n\nDesign characteristics\nThe T-72 shares many design features with other tank designs of Soviet origin Some of these are viewed as deficiencies in a straight comparison to NATO tanks, but most are a product of the way these tanks were envisioned to be employed, based on the Soviets' practical experiences in World War II.\n\n\nWeight\nThe T-72 is extremely lightweight, at forty-one tonnes, and very small compared to Western main battle tanks Some of the roads and bridges in former Warsaw Pact countries were designed such that T-72s can travel along in formation, but NATO tanks could not pass at all, or just one-by-one, significantly reducing their mobility The basic T-72 is relatively underpowered, with a 780¬†hp (580¬†kW) supercharged version of the basic 500¬†hp (370¬†kW) V12 diesel engine originally designed for the World War II-era T-34 The 0.58¬†m (1¬†ft 11¬†in) wide tracks run on large-diameter road wheels, which allows for easy identification of the T-72 and descendants (the T-64 family has relatively small road wheels).\n\n\nNuclear, biological, and chemical protection\nThe T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions The crew is supplied clean air via an air filter system A slight over-pressure prevents entry of contamination via bearings and joints Use of an autoloader for the main gun allows for more efficient forced smoke removal compared to traditional manually loaded (\"pig-loader\") tank guns, so NBC isolation of the fighting compartment can, in theory, be maintained indefinitely.\n\n\nInterior\nLike all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72's design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader There is a widespread Cold War-era myth that Soviet tanks were so cramped that height constraints were put in place, with a maximum height of 5¬†ft 4in (163¬†cm) However, official regulations state that the T-72 allowed for a height of 5¬†ft 9in (175¬†cm), which was standard for other tanks at the time The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver's field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.\n\n\nArmour\nArmour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding generation The original T-72 \"Ural\" Object 172M's (from 1973) turret is made from conventional cast high hardness steel (HHS) armour with no laminate inserts It is believed that the maximum thickness is 280¬†mm (11¬†in) and the nose is 80¬†mm (3.1¬†in) The glacis of the new laminated armour is 205¬†mm (8.1¬†in) thick, comprising 80¬†mm (3.1¬†in) HHS, 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) double layer of laminate and 20¬†mm (0.79¬†in) RHA steel, which when inclined gives about 500‚Äì600¬†mm (20‚Äì24¬†in) thickness along the line of sight In 1977 the armour of the T-72 Object 172M was slightly changed The turret now featured insert filled with ceramic sand bars \"kwartz\" rods and the glacis plate composition was changed It was now made up of 60¬†mm (2.4¬†in) HHA steel, 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) glass Tekstolit laminate and 50¬†mm (2.0¬†in) RHA steel This version was often known in Soviet circles as T-72 \"Ural-1\" The next armour update was introduced by the T-72A (Object 176), which was designed in 1976 and replaced the original on the production lines during 1979‚Äì1985 T-72 Object 1976 is also known as T-72A With the introduction of the T-72B (Object 184) in 1985, the composite armour was again changed According to retired major, James M Warford, variants developed after the T-72 base model and T-72M/T-72G MBT, featured a cast steel turret that included a cavity filled with quartz or sand in a form similar to US \"fused-silica\" armour [48] The T-72 Model 1978 (Obiekt 172M sb-4), which entered production in 1977, featured a new turret with special armour composed of ceramic rods [49]\n\n\nEstimated protection level\nThe following table shows the estimated protection level of different T-72 models in rolled homogeneous armour equivalency, i.e., the composite armour of the turret of a T-72B offers as much protection against an armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round as a 520¬†mm (20¬†in) thick armour steel layer.\n\n\nGun\nThe T-72 is equipped with the 125¬†mm (4.9¬†in) 2A46 series main gun, a significantly larger (20-mm larger) calibre than the standard 105¬†mm (4.1¬†in) gun found in contemporary Western MBTs, and still slightly larger than the 120 mm/L44 found in many modern Western MBTs As is typical of Soviet tanks, the gun can fire anti-tank guided missiles, and standard main gun ammunition, including HEAT and APFSDS rounds.\n\n\nAutoloader\nLike the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.\n\n\nOperators and service\nThe T-72 was never used in the Afghanistan War [citation needed] The 40th Soviet Army that was deployed there had mainly T-55, and T-62 tanks [84]\n\n\nSyria\nIn the 1982 Lebanon War, Syrian T-72s are believed to have engaged Israeli tanks (M60A1, Magach or possibly Merkava tanks) in the south of Lebanon [85] On 9 June 1982, the Syrian General HQ ordered a brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, recently equipped with T-72 tanks, to move straight ahead, cross the border, and hit the right flank of the Israeli units advancing along the eastern side of Beka'a valley The ensuing battle staved off further Israeli advance and 10 IDF main battle tanks were destroyed After the war, Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad called it \"the best tank in the world\" [86]\n\n\nIraq\nIraqi T-72 Ural (1973)s, T-72 Ural Modernization, T-72Ms and T-72M1s were used successfully throughout the Iran-Iraq War and in countless operations, among others Operation Nasr, in the battle for Basra and during the Tawakalna ala Allah Operations 105 mm M68 tank guns and TOW missiles proved ineffective against the frontal armour of Iraqi T-72s [90] [91] Sixty T-72 tanks were lost during the eight years of war [92] [93] Ra'ad Al-Hamdani, an Iraqi general in the Iraqi Republican Guard, stating \"The 16th Iranian Armoured Division, which was equipped with Chieftain tanks, lost a battle against the 10th Iraqi Armoured Brigade with T-72 tanks It is hard for an armoured brigade to destroy a division in 12 hours but it happened; it was a disaster for the Iranians\" [94] Out of the 894 Chieftain tanks that had started the war only 200 were left by the war's end [95] The 3BM9 APFSDS shell was more than enough to deal with any NATO tank of the time, including the most heavily armoured such as the M60A1 and the Chieftain According to a Soviet analysis of an Iranian Chieftain captured by the Iraqi army during the early part of the Iran-Iraq war, the Chieftain Mk.5 was considered to have totally insufficient protection even at its strongest points The frontal part of the entire turret, hull upper front plate and lower front plate could all be defeated at 3¬†km or more This essentially means that the T-72 Ural could defeat one of NATO's toughest tanks at any reasonable combat distance [96] According to Iranians and Iraqis, the T-72 was the most feared tank of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War [97]\n\n\nChechen wars\nDuring the First Chechen War (December 1994 to September 1996) fought between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, led by Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Russian Federation deployed both T-72 and T-80 tanks Russian AFV losses during the first three months fighting amounted to 62 tank (T-72/T-80) losses (44 T-72s of 141, 18 T-80s of 71 and 0 PT-76s of 9) Analysis of damage to non repairable vehicles showed that no T-72 were lost to frontal penetration of the hull from man portable anti tank weapons [111]\n\n\nRusso-Georgian War\nDuring the war in South Ossetia in 2008 both sides deployed great numbers of T-72 tanks  At the time of the conflict, the Georgian military fielded 191 T-72 tanks of which 120 were modified to T-72SIM1s The Georgian army deployed a total of 75 of its T-72 tanks into South Ossetia [117] The Georgian military lost 30 T-72s, ten in combat during the fighting around Tskhinvali, [118] and another 20 destroyed by Russian paratroopers after their capture [119]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nOn 26 August 2014, the International Institute for Strategic Studies claimed that it had identified a mixed Russian column composed of at least 3 T-72Bs and a lone T-72B3 in the war in Donbas The significance of this sighting was that Russia attempted to maintain plausible deniability over the issue of supplying tanks and other arms to the separatists Russia continuously claimed that any tanks operated by the separatists must have been captured from Ukraine's own army The T-72B3 is in service with the Russian Army in large numbers This modernized T-72 is not known to have been exported to nor operated by any other country [120]\n\n\nWar in Donbas\nOn 26 August 2014, the International Institute for Strategic Studies claimed that it had identified a mixed Russian column composed of at least 3 T-72Bs and a lone T-72B3 in the war in Donbas The significance of this sighting was that Russia attempted to maintain plausible deniability over the issue of supplying tanks and other arms to the separatists Russia continuously claimed that any tanks operated by the separatists must have been captured from Ukraine's own army The T-72B3 is in service with the Russian Army in large numbers This modernized T-72 is not known to have been exported to nor operated by any other country [120]\n\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\nThe T-72 has seen extensive service in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine with both sides [124]\n\n\nCombat history\nBackground: History of

trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions The IDR 10.3 trillion budget is given to provide discounted airplane ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which applies from March to May 2020 Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45% [100] Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus fund comes from the IDR 444.39 billion state budget (APBN) for a discounted value of 30% and 25% of passengers per flight [101] Additionally, there were additional IDR 100 billion ticket discounts paid by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II and IDR 260 billion PT Pertamina paid through jet fuel price discounts, so the total ticket price stimulus was IDR 960 billion, so that the ticket price could be discounted by 50%

government released an IDR 22.9 trillion stimulus policy Among other policies, the government will bear 100% of the income tax of workers in the manufacturing sector with income up to IDR 17 million/month This tax will be borne by the government or 6 months, from April to September, so the government will spend IDR 8,6 trillion [103]\n\n\nPhase 3\nOn 20 March 2020, the government is effectively able to use realocated state budget funds amounting to IDR 118.3-121.3 trillion to address the pandemic The funds were realocated from funds for agency and ministry official travels, nonoperational expenses, and honorary employees amounting to IDR 62.3 trillion and village as well as regional transfers amounting to IDR 56-59 trillion [104]\n\n\nMedical devices incentives\nOn 20 March 2020, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise centralized permits of imports of medical devices for handling the pandemic to BNPB Ministries/agencies, nonprofits, noncommercial private initiatives, and individuals can obtain medical device import tax allowance with a recommendation from BNPB However, this tax allowance does not apply to commercial private initiatives and individuals and still requires permit from BNPB [106]\n\n\nEconomic recovery policies\nTo recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic, the government planned to budget IDR 677 trillion for recovery policies [108] Economic growth for the period was projected to be similar to during the 1997 crisis [109] Because the revised  2020 state budget was projected to grow by IDR 124.5 trillion, the 2020 state budget deficit reached IDR 1039.2 trillion or up to 6.34% of GDP [110] after a revision to Presidential Decree No 54/2020 Before that, as explained by Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani, the state budget deficit was IDR 859.2 trillion or 5.07% of GDP [111] Consequently, the debt financing to cover the deficit increased from IDR 1006.4 trillion to IDR 1220.3 trillion, an increase of IDR 213.9 trillion The increase is used to cover the deficit increase and for additional investment financing [112] Initially, state revenue was projected to be  IDR 1,760.9 trillion, but was revised to IDR 1,699.1 trillion Expenses was revised from IDR 2,613.8 trillion to IDR 2,738.4 trillion Revenue from taxes was projected to reach IDR 1,404.5 trillion [111] Until June, Bank Indonesia has purchased government bonds in support of economic recovery [112] World Bank projected that Indonesia's debt ratio will rise by 37%, influenced by the widening of state budget deficit, retardation of economic growth, and weakening of the rupiah Social and economic policies would also need a huge amount of funds The deficit projection of up to 6.34% of GDP will be steadily lowered to 4.7% in 2021, 3.4% in 2022, and under 3% in 2023 [113] According to Governor of Bank Indonesia Perry Warjiyo, Indonesian can avoid a recession if the new normal scheme goes according to plan, and economic growth can reach the estimate, which is 3.2%, as long as the curve flattens [114]\n\n\nNew normal\nOn 21 May, the government announced that Indonesia enters the new normal stage They emphasize that this does not mean loosening of PSBB [115] Previously, President Jokowi has asked people to learn to live with COVID-19 [116]\n\n\nRegional government\nSpecific regions can apply for a request for large-scale social restrictions (PSBB/LSSR) to the Ministry of Health alongside proof of endemic and mitigation steps [124] Should it be approved, a date will be set by the local government and will run for at least two weeks [125]\n\n\nArea of emergency\nSpecific regions can apply for a request for large-scale social restrictions (PSBB/LSSR) to the Ministry of Health alongside proof of endemic and mitigation steps [124] Should it be approved, a date will be set by the local government and will run for at least two weeks [125]\n\n\nLarge-scale social restrictions\nSpecific regions can apply for a request for large-scale social restrictions (PSBB/LSSR) to the Ministry of Health alongside proof of endemic and mitigation steps [124] Should it be approved, a date will be set by the local government and will run for at least two weeks [125]\n\n\nAceh\nOn 12 March, Aceh acting governor Nova Iriansyah advised Acehnese to stay away from vices and activities that are incompatible with religious and Islamic sharia values [131]\n\n\nBanten\nOn 15 March, Governor of Banten Wahidin Halim declares \"extraordinary event\" and decides to close all schools for 2 weeks [134]\n\n\nCentral Java\nOn 13 March, the

Hadi Rudyatmo has also declared that the area is under \"extraordinary event\" [136] On the same day, the Regency of Sragen decided to close all schools from kindergarten to junior high school throughout the regency for at least a week, while closure of senior high school in the regency would be decided by the provincial government [137]\n\n\nDKI Jakarta\nOn 2 March, in response to the

government of North Sumatra declared a state of emergency until 29 May 2020 [169]\n\n\nPapua\nOn 24 March, the provincial government of Papua decided to close any in and out access to Papua except for logistics and medical workers starting from 26 March for 14 days [170] Indonesian Minister of Home Affairs Tito Karnavian disagreed with the decision, saying that the central government's advice to the regional governments is not to close transportation, but to ban mass gatherings [171]\n\n\nSouth Sumatra\nOn 30 March, Jakabaring Athletes Village, a former athlete's housing for the 2018 Asian Games in Palembang, was appointed by the Governor of South Sumatera Herman Deru to be the house of PUM's treatment (ODP Center) He named it as \"COVID-19 Healthy House\" (Rumah Sehat COVID-19) [172]\n\n\nWest Java\nOn 14 March, the city of Depok and Bogor decided to close all schools from kindergarten to senior high school until 28 March 2020 [173] [174] This decision was also followed by

[183]\n\n\nRail transport\nPT KAI and PT KCI has taken several measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, including gradually cancelling several train journeys starting 21 March [181] Some commuter line journeys are shortened by KCI and only opened from 06.00 to 20.00 WIB [182] Starting 21 March, the Palembang LRT trips are also cut from 74 to 54, then 26 starting 1 April The LRT would operate from 08.39 to 17.27 with a headway of 36 minutes [183]\n\n\nUniversities\nIn response of the outbreak, multiple universities opted to cancel classes and instead would teach students online [198]\n\n\nCorporations\nOn 14 March, Tokopedia and Gojek have begun trial for work at home operations [206] [207]\n\n\nSocietal organizations\nOn 16 March, Indonesian Council of Ulama (MUI) and Muhammadiyah urged to substitute Friday prayer with Zuhr prayer and not to attend any religious activities within heavily virus-plagued areas [223] [224]\n\n\nTravel restrictions\nIndonesia had denied transit and entry for all foreign visitors since 2 April 2020 [227] [228]\n\n\nCriticism\nPresident Jokowi was criticized in March 2020 by KADIN, [240] Komnas HAM, [241] and political parties such as Golkar and PKS [242] [243] for lack of transparency regarding information on COVID-19 Jokowi insisted on not sharing travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public [244] However, this secrecy is deemed to be unlawful [245] Critique on transparency is also levied by the Indonesian Doctors Association regarding the number of medical personnel infected [246] The public had asked the government to release official national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data [247] Some critics of the government were arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic [248]\n\n\nGovernment\nPresident Jokowi was criticized in March 2020 by KADIN, [240] Komnas HAM, [241] and political parties such as Golkar and PKS [242] [243] for lack of transparency regarding information on COVID-19 Jokowi insisted on not sharing travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public [244] However, this secrecy is deemed to be unlawful

national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data [247] Some critics of the government were arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic [248]\n\n\nLockdown policies\nPresident Jokowi came under increased pressure in the course of March to impose a partial lockdown on virus-plagued areas, with scientists saying the country is racing against time to curb the spread of COVID-19 before Eid al-Fitr and that a community quarantine could be the only solution to do exactly that [250] On 16 March, Jokowi said lockdown policies are the authority of the central government, and warned the local government to not impose lockdown without the consent of the central authority [251]\n\n\nFailure to detect the virus\nHealth experts were concerned early on that the country was failing to identify the transmission of the virus [254] Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch \"analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report .. that Indonesia might have missed cases\" of COVID-19 [255] Western diplomats [256] [257] as well as local [254] [258] and international [259] [260] news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention [261] [262]\n\n\nTests and treatment\nReports surfaced about patients in Jabodetabek having to wait for a long time to get tests or treatment for possible cases as referral hospitals face the increasing strain [266] University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono said that rapid diagnostic tests as a requirement for travelling has been commercialized, capitalizing on the public's fear of the COVID-19 pandemic According to him, RDTs are not a part of pandemic countermeasures, because it was only a serology survey to quantify how many people are infected [267] Critique was also expressed by Minister of Health Budi Sadikin, who said that COVID tests were misapplied, because they should have been conducted to suspected COVID cases, but instead the tests were conducted to people who just want to check themselves for journey or other purposes, so the tests are pointless [268]\n\n\nAdditional death rates excluded from official counts\nAccording to a Reuters report, as of 28 April 2020, there were around 2,200 patients who had died with coronavirus symptoms, but not included into the official death toll of 693 This suggests that Indonesia has a higher death rate than the official counts [269] An analysis by Financial Times showed that there were 1,400 more deaths in Jakarta compared to the historical average number of deaths in March and April This excess deaths figure is 15 times the official figure of 90 COVID-19 deaths in this same period [270]\n\n\nTravel restrictions and evasions\nProhibition of mudik for all of Indonesia was enacted after the pandemic worsens In a 21 April teleconference, Jokowi announced that the government would prohibit mudik for residents of red zones The prohibition was effective per 24 April The implementation would be step-by-step; sanctions for violators was effective per 7 May [271] Previously, mudik prohibition was only effective for civil servants, BUMN employees, and TNI-POLRI [272]\n\n\nLack of safety in tobacco industries\nDespite the temporary closure of HM Sampoerna due to two workers dying from COVID-19, with additional 63 workers tested positive, Pandu Riono, the epidemiologist from University of Indonesia reported that other cigarette factories in East and West Java will continue to operate without practicing social distancing and workers never wearing face masks This sparks concern that the cigarette factories could create new clusters for the COVID-19 pandemic considering that this industry usually has large workforce [286]\n\n\nInfluencer budget\nThe government faced harsh responses after announcing an IDR 72 billion budget to pay influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia [287] According to INDEF researcher Bhima Yudhistira, the government should have given incentives to sectors directly impacted by the pandemic, not to pay influencers to attract tourists [288] Besides, messages from influencers to stay home are deemed ineffective because not all people can economically do it, especially from the lower class, informal workers, and day laborers who must work outside the house to fulfill their basic needs [289]\n\n\nImpact\nIn the first weeks of the pandemic, surgical face masks in Indonesia soared in price by over six times the original retail value from around IDR 30,000 to IDR 185,000 (some sources said it exceeded IDR 300,000) per box in some outlets after the announcement that two citizens had tested positive for coronavirus [290] Panic buying was reported since mid-February before the first cases were confirmed [291] There were also shortages of thermometers, antiseptics and hand sanitizers within a few hours after the government announces COVID-19 cases in Indonesia [292] President Jokowi condemned the hoarding of face masks and hand sanitizers [293] and police started to crack down on suspected hoarders [294]\n\n\nSocioeconomic\nIn the first weeks of the pandemic, surgical face masks in Indonesia soared in price by over six times the original retail value from around IDR 30,000 to IDR 185,000 (some sources said it exceeded IDR 300,000) per box in some outlets after the

sanitizers [293] and police started to crack down on suspected hoarders [294]\n\n\nCensus\nIndonesia prepared to extend the online time for self-enumeration, and cancel all field data collection They relied on administrative data and had requested additional UNFPA technical support for using administrative data for census [295]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Ministry of Education implemented remote learning starting March 2020 Research by ISEAS shows that there were education inequalities in Indonesia 69 million students lost access to education, while students from more well-off families felt easier during the transition to remote learning Only 40% of Indonesians have internet access [296]\n\n\nEconomic\nFollowing the worldwide trend of stock price drops, the IDX Composite weakened even before the first confirmation of the disease in Indonesia [299] In response to expected economic slowdown due to the loss of Chinese economic activity, Bank Indonesia cut its interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75% on 20 February [300] On 12 March, as the WHO declared pandemic, IDX Composite tumbled 4.2% to 4,937 when Thursday's session was opened, a level unseen in almost four years [301]\n\n\nDecrease of income\nThe government had assessed the economic impact and decrease of income in all provinces based on low, middle, and high severity The scenarios were communicated by President Jokowi in a meeting with governors, mayors, and regents from all of Indonesia on 24 March The scenarios referred to economic resilience of provinces and the decrease of income of economic actors In a middle severity scenario, the income of day laborers in West Nusa Tenggara would decrease by 25% and would only last to June‚ÄìSeptember In the MSME sector, the greatest decrease of income would happen in North Kalimantan at 36% and would only last to August‚ÄìOctober For ojek and angkot drivers, the greatest decrease of income would happen in North Sumatra at 44% [311] For fishers and farmers, the greatest decrease of income would happen in West Kalimantan at 34% and would only last to October‚ÄìNovember [312]\n\n\nRupiah exchange rate\nOn 17 March, the rupiah weakened to IDR 15,000 per dollar, touching a level unseen since October 2018 [313] On 23 March, it almost touched IDR 16,000 [314] To prevent it from touching IDR 17,000, Bank Indonesia used US$7 billion of forex reserves, so by late March the reserves were US$121 billion, decreasing US$9,4 billion from February Bank Indonesia also bought IDR 166.2 trillion of government bonds sold by foreign investors [315] On 30 April the rupiah bounded back to IDR 15,000 [316] On 8 June, it drastically strengthened to IDR 13,000 [317] On 12 June, it weakened again to IDR 14,000 [318]\n\n\nSports, tourism, and leisure\nIndonesian tourism has been severely affected In March, overall tourist numbers fell by 64%, and Chinese tourists by 97% [319] Bali, where tourism accounts for 60% of GRP, had witnessed its foreign tourist arrivals fell by 93.2% in April [320] Hotels were taking on a meager occupancy rate, with some hotels experiencing 5% and even 0% occupancy rate due to overspecialization on Chinese visitors, increasing travel restrictions from source countries, and an overall fear of the virus [321] There was, however, an increase in interest for domestic tourism, [322] and Chinese tourists which had already been on the island generally opted to extend their stay [323] All beaches in Bali were temporarily closed for the public [324]\n\n\nTransition to endemic stage\nOn 18 May 2022, the Governor of Bali, I Wayan Koster, requested that Bali receive an endemic status to COVID-19 in order to \"accelerate the recovery of Bali's tourism and economy\" [347]\n\n\nReferral and examiner laboratories\nOn 16 March, Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto officially signed the Minister of Health Decree HK.01.07MENKES/187/2020 which designated 1 national COVID-19 referral laboratory and 12 COVID-19 examiner laboratories The Ministry of Health Research and Development Agency Laboratory was designated as the referral laboratory and while the other 12 laboratories are designated according to their locations throughout Indonesia [352]\n\n\nNotable deaths\nBelow is the list of prominent Indonesians who died from COVID-19:\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia began in January 2020 and has had a significant impact on the country's economy, society, and healthcare system. Indonesia was one of the countries that was initially affected by the pandemic and has since become one of the countries with the highest number of cases in Southeast Asia.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nFrom January until February 2020, Indonesia reported zero cases of COVID-19, despite being surrounded by infected countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Australia. Flights from countries with high infection rates, including South Korea and Thailand, also continued to operate. Health experts and researchers at Harvard University in the United States expressed their concerns, saying that Indonesia is ill-prepared for an outbreak and there could be undetected COVID-19 cases.\n\n**Classifications**\n\nSince 14 July 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia classifies people involved with COVID-19 into four levels:\n\n1. **Pengawasan Masyarakat** (Community Monitoring): Individuals who are suspected of being infected with COVID-19 and are being monitored by the community.\n2. **Penderita** (Patients): Individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are receiving treatment.\n3. **Kontak Erat** (Close Contacts): Individuals who have been in close contact with a patient or a suspected patient.\n4. **Kontak Jarak Jauh** (Distant Contacts): Individuals who have been in contact with a patient or a suspected patient but are not in close proximity.\n\n**Cases**\n\nJakarta became the first province to confirm COVID-19 cases, while Gorontalo was the last to do so. On 6 July 2020, Jambi became the last province to report a death, 53 days after the penultimate province East Nusa Tenggara did. West Java and Banten had ever reported 16,251 cases and 22,667 recoveries in a day respectively; both are the highest by a single province. Central Java hold the record for death numbers with 679. All six provinces in Java have the highest number of cases compared to other provinces, making it the worst-affected region in the country.\n\n**Location**\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, a regency or municipality may be classified into three levels depending on the severity of COVID-19 cases within the region, according to these parameters:\n\n1. **Zona Merah** (Red Zone): Regencies or municipalities with a high number of cases and a high risk of transmission.\n2. **Zona Oranye** (Orange Zone): Regencies or municipalities with a moderate number of cases and a moderate risk of transmission.\n3. **Zona Hijau** (Green Zone): Regencies or municipalities with a low number of cases and a low risk of transmission.\n\n**Confirmed Cases**\n\nJakarta became the first province to confirm COVID-19 cases, while Gorontalo was the last to do so. On 6 July 2020, Jambi became the last province to report a death, 53 days after the penultimate province East Nusa Tenggara did. West Java and Banten had ever reported 16,251 cases and 22,667 recoveries in a day respectively; both are the highest by a single province. Central Java hold the record for death numbers with 679. All six provinces in Java have the highest number of cases compared to other provinces, making it the worst-affected region in the country.\n\n**Suspected Cases**\n\nSeveral travellers who had visited or transited through Bali later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 shortly after their return to China, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore.\n\n**Responses**\n\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sent a letter to President Jokowi on 10 March 2020, urging countries with large populations, like Indonesia, to focus on increasing capacity of laboratoriums to detect cases of infection. Early detection is a key factor in limiting the spread of the virus as authorities are able to identify clusters faster. WHO gave advices, such as improving the mechanism of emergency responses, including asking for Indonesia to declare a national emergency situation as soon as possible, educating people and actively communicating while applying the appropriate risk communication measures, involving the local communities more, intensifying COVID-19 tracings, performing lab decentralization so that quick response teams can quickly map spread and clusters, and sharing detailed data on measures of the government in supervision and examination, including identification of patient contacts and summary of tracing patient contacts.\n\n**International Aid**\n\nOn 21 March 2020, the Asian Development Bank through the Asia-Pacific Disaster Response Fund granted US$3 million to Indonesia to counter COVID-19. The grant is a part of a $6.5 billion initial package prepared by ADB on 18 March 2020 to aid developing countries in countering COVID-19.\n\n**Central Government**\n\nIndonesia banned all flights from and to mainland China starting from 5 February 2020. The government also stopped giving free visa and visa on arrival for Chinese nationals. Those who live or have stayed in mainland China in the previous 14 days were barred from entering or transiting through Indonesia. Indonesians were discouraged from travelling to China.\n\n**Early Responses**\n\nIndonesia banned all flights from and to mainland China starting from 5 February 2020. The government also stopped giving free visa and visa on arrival for Chinese nationals. Those who live or have stayed in mainland China in the previous 14 days were barred from entering or transiting through Indonesia. Indonesians were discouraged from travelling to China.\n\n**Vaccination Efforts**\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination in Indonesia was started on 13 January 2021, when President Joko Widodo was vaccinated at the presidential palace.\n\n**Stimulus Policy**\n\nTo reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to the national economy, on 25 February, the government released an IDR 10.3 trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions. The IDR 10.3 trillion budget is given to provide discounted airplane ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which applies from March to May 2020. Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45%.\n\n**Phase 1**\n\nTo reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to the national economy, on 25 February, the government released an IDR 10.3 trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions. The IDR 10.3 trillion budget is given to provide discounted airplane ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which applies from March to May 2020. Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45%.\n\n**Phase 2**\n\nOn 14 March the government released an IDR 22.9 trillion stimulus policy. Among other policies, the government will bear 100% of the income tax of workers in the manufacturing sector with income up to IDR 17 million/month. This tax will be borne by the government or 6 months, from April to September, so the government will spend IDR 8,6 trillion.\n\n**Phase 3**\n\nOn 20 March 2020, the government is effectively able to use realocated state budget funds amounting to IDR 118.3-121.3 trillion to address the pandemic. The funds were realocated from funds for agency and ministry official travels, nonoperational expenses, and honorary employees amounting to IDR 62.3 trillion and village as well as regional transfers amounting to IDR 56-59 trillion.\n\n**Medical Devices Incentives**\n\nOn 20 March 2020, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise centralized permits of imports of medical devices for handling the pandemic to BNPB Ministries/agencies, nonprofits, noncommercial private initiatives, and individuals can obtain medical device import tax allowance with a recommendation from BNPB. However, this tax allowance does not apply to commercial private initiatives and individuals and still requires permit from BNPB.\n\n**Economic Recovery Policies**\n\nTo recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic, the government planned to budget IDR 677 trillion for recovery policies. Economic growth for the period was projected to be similar to during the 1997 crisis. Because the revised 2020 state budget was projected to grow by IDR 124.5 trillion, the 2020 state budget deficit reached IDR 1039.2 trillion or up to 6.34% of GDP after a revision to Presidential Decree No 54/2020. Before that, as explained by Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani, the state budget deficit was IDR 859.2 trillion or 5.07% of GDP. Consequently, the debt financing to cover the deficit increased from IDR 1006.4 trillion to IDR 1220.3 trillion, an increase of IDR 213.9 trillion. The increase is used to cover the deficit increase and for additional investment financing. Initially, state revenue was projected to be IDR 1,760.9 trillion, but was revised to IDR 1,699.1 trillion. Expenses was revised from IDR 2,613.8 trillion to IDR 2,738.4 trillion. Revenue from taxes was projected to reach IDR 1,404.5 trillion. Until June, Bank Indonesia has purchased government bonds in support of economic recovery. World Bank projected that Indonesia's debt ratio will rise by 37%, influenced by the widening of state budget deficit, retardation of economic growth, and weakening of the rupiah. Social and economic policies would also need a huge amount of funds. The deficit projection of up to 6.34% of GDP will be steadily lowered to 4.7% in 2021, 3.4% in 2022, and under 3% in 2023. According to Governor of Bank Indonesia Perry Warjiyo, Indonesian can avoid a recession if the new normal scheme goes according to plan, and economic growth can reach the estimate, which is 3.2%, as long as the curve flattens.\n\n**New Normal**\n\nOn 21 May, the government announced that Indonesia enters the new normal stage. They emphasize that this does not mean loosening of PSBB. Previously, President Jokowi has asked people to learn to live with COVID-19.\n\n**Regional Government**\n\nSpecific regions can apply for a request for large-scale social restrictions (PSBB/LSSR) to the Ministry of Health alongside proof of endemic and mitigation steps.

However, this secrecy is deemed to be unlawful. Critique on transparency is also levied by the Indonesian Doctors Association regarding the number of medical personnel infected.

Some critics of the government were arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Lockdown Policies**\n\nPresident Jokowi came under increased pressure in the course of March to impose a partial lockdown on virus-plagued areas, with scientists saying the country is racing against time to curb the spread of COVID-19 before Eid al-Fitr and that a community quarantine could be the only solution to do exactly that. On 16 March, Jokowi said lockdown policies are the authority of the central government, and warned the local government to not impose lockdown without the consent of the central authority.\n\n**Failure to Detect the Virus**\n\nHealth experts were concerned early on that the country was failing to identify the transmission of the virus. Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch \"analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report .. that Indonesia might have missed cases\" of COVID-19. Western diplomats as well as local and international news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.\n\n**Tests and Treatment**\n\nReports surfaced about patients in Jabodetabek having to wait for a long time to get tests or treatment for possible cases as referral hospitals face the increasing strain. University of Indonesia epidemiologist Pandu Riono said that rapid diagnostic tests as a requirement for travelling has been commercialized, capitalizing on the public's fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to him, RDTs are not a part of pandemic countermeasures, because it was only a serology survey to quantify how many people are infected. Critique was also expressed by Minister of Health Budi Sadikin, who said that COVID tests were misapplied, because they should have been conducted to suspected COVID cases, but instead the tests were conducted to people who just want to check themselves for journey or other purposes, so the tests are pointless.\n\n**Additional Death Rates Excluded from Official Counts**\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, as of 28 April 2020, there were around 2,200 patients who had died with", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"COVID-19_pandemic_in_Indonesia\" following this

infection rate, including South Korea and Thailand, also continued to operate Health experts and researchers at Harvard University in the United States expressed their concerns, saying that Indonesia is ill-prepared for an outbreak and there could be undetected COVID-19 cases [17]\n\n\nClassifications\nSince 14 July 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia classifies people involved with COVID-19 into four levels: [31]\n\n\nCases\nJakarta became the first province that confirmed COVID-19 cases, while Gorontalo was the last to do so On 6 July 2020, Jambi became the last

highest by a single province Central Java hold the record for death numbers with 679 All six provinces in Java have the highest number of cases compared to other provinces, making it the worst-affected region in the country.\n\n\nLocation\nAccording to the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, a regency or municipality may be classified into three levels depending on the severity of COVID-19 cases within the region, according to these parameters: [32]\n\n\nCases\nJakarta became the first province that confirmed COVID-19 cases, while Gorontalo was the last to do so On 6 July 2020, Jambi

Indonesians were discouraged from travelling to China [49]\n\n\nVaccination efforts\nCOVID-19 vaccination in Indonesia was started on 13 January 2021, when President Joko Widodo was vaccinated at the presidential palace.\n\n\nStimulus policy\nTo reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic to the national economy, on 25 February, the government released an IDR 10.3 trillion stimulus policy to the tourism sector, in the form of ticket price discounts and restaurant tax deductions The IDR 10.3 trillion budget is given to provide discounted airplane ticket prices for 10 tourist destinations, such as Batam, Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Labuan Bajo, Lombok, Malang, Manado, Lake Toba (Silangit Airport), Tanjung Pandan, and Tanjungpinang, which applies from March to May 2020 Ticket prices for low-cost airlines are discounted by 50%, medium-service by 48%, and full-service by 45% [100] Specifically for this ticket price discount, the stimulus fund comes from the IDR 444.39 billion state budget (APBN) for a discounted value of 30% and 25% of passengers per flight [101] Additionally, there were additional IDR 100 billion ticket discounts paid by Angkasa Pura I and Angkasa Pura II and IDR 260 billion PT Pertamina paid through jet fuel price discounts, so the total ticket price stimulus was IDR 960 billion, so that the ticket price could be discounted by 50% [102]\n\n\nPhase 1\nTo reduce

so the total ticket price stimulus was IDR 960 billion, so that the ticket price could be discounted by 50% [102]\n\n\nPhase 2\nOn 14 March the government released an IDR 22.9 trillion stimulus policy Among other policies, the government will bear 100% of the income tax of workers in the manufacturing sector with income up to IDR 17 million/month This tax will be borne by the government or 6 months, from April to September, so the government will spend IDR 8,6 trillion [103]\n\n\nPhase 3\nOn 20 March 2020, the government is effectively able to use realocated state budget funds amounting to IDR 118.3-121.3 trillion to address the pandemic The funds were realocated from funds for agency and ministry official travels, nonoperational expenses, and honorary employees amounting to IDR 62.3 trillion and village as well as regional transfers amounting to IDR 56-59 trillion [104]\n\n\nMedical devices incentives\nOn 20 March 2020, the Directorate General of Customs and Excise centralized permits of imports of medical devices for handling the pandemic to BNPB Ministries/agencies, nonprofits, noncommercial private initiatives, and individuals can obtain medical device import tax allowance with a recommendation from BNPB However, this tax allowance does not apply to commercial private initiatives and individuals and still requires permit from BNPB [106]\n\n\nEconomic recovery policies\nTo recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic, the government planned to budget IDR 677 trillion for recovery policies [108] Economic growth for the period was projected to be similar to during the 1997 crisis [109] Because the revised  2020 state budget was projected to grow by IDR 124.5 trillion, the 2020 state budget deficit reached IDR 1039.2 trillion or up to 6.34% of GDP [110] after a revision to Presidential Decree No 54/2020 Before that, as explained by Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani, the state budget deficit was IDR 859.2 trillion or 5.07% of GDP [111] Consequently, the debt financing to cover the deficit increased from IDR 1006.4 trillion to IDR 1220.3 trillion, an increase of IDR 213.9 trillion The increase is used to cover the deficit increase and for additional investment financing [112] Initially, state revenue was projected to be  IDR 1,760.9 trillion, but was revised to IDR 1,699.1 trillion Expenses was revised from IDR 2,613.8 trillion to IDR 2,738.4 trillion Revenue from taxes was projected to reach IDR 1,404.5 trillion [111] Until June, Bank Indonesia has purchased government bonds in support of economic recovery [112] World Bank projected that Indonesia's debt ratio will rise by 37%, influenced by the widening of state budget deficit, retardation of economic growth, and weakening of the rupiah Social and economic policies would also need a huge amount of funds The deficit projection of up to 6.34% of GDP will be steadily lowered to 4.7% in 2021, 3.4% in 2022, and under 3% in 2023 [113] According to Governor of Bank Indonesia Perry Warjiyo, Indonesian can avoid a recession if the new normal scheme goes according to plan, and economic growth can reach the estimate, which is 3.2%, as long as the curve flattens [114]\n\n\nNew normal\nOn 21 May, the government announced that Indonesia enters the new normal stage They emphasize that this does not mean loosening of PSBB [115] Previously, President Jokowi has

March for 14 days [170] Indonesian Minister of Home Affairs Tito Karnavian disagreed with the decision, saying that the central government's advice to the regional governments is not to close transportation, but to ban mass gatherings [171]\n\n\nSouth Sumatra\nOn 30 March, Jakabaring Athletes Village, a former athlete's housing for the 2018 Asian Games in Palembang, was appointed by the Governor of South Sumatera Herman Deru to be the house of PUM's treatment (ODP Center) He named it as \"COVID-19 Healthy House\" (Rumah Sehat COVID-19) [172]\n\n\nWest Java\nOn 14 March, the city of

there were around 2,200 patients who had died with coronavirus symptoms, but not included into the official death toll of 693 This suggests that Indonesia has a higher death rate than the official counts [269] An analysis by Financial Times showed that there were 1,400 more deaths in Jakarta compared to the historical average number of deaths in March and April This excess deaths figure is 15 times the official figure of 90 COVID-19 deaths in this same period [270]\n\n\nTravel restrictions and evasions\nProhibition of mudik for all of Indonesia was enacted after the pandemic worsens In a

industries\nDespite the temporary closure of HM Sampoerna due to two workers dying from COVID-19, with additional 63 workers tested positive, Pandu Riono, the epidemiologist from University of

cigarette factories could create new clusters for the COVID-19 pandemic considering that this industry usually has large workforce [286]\n\n\nInfluencer budget\nThe government faced harsh responses after announcing an IDR 72 billion budget to pay influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia [287] According to INDEF researcher Bhima Yudhistira, the government should have given incentives to sectors directly impacted by the pandemic, not to pay influencers to attract tourists [288] Besides, messages from influencers to stay home are deemed ineffective because not all people can economically do it, especially from the lower class, informal workers, and day laborers who must work outside the house to fulfill their basic needs [289]\n\n\nImpact\nIn the first weeks of the

Draft, but Favre was taken by the Falcons on the previous pick [25] [27]\n\n\nBeginnings (1992‚Äì94)\nIn the second game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers The Buccaneers were leading 17‚Äì0 at halftime, when head coach Mike Holmgren benched starting quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre [27] [34] Favre was tackled and the completion went for ‚àí7¬†yards The Packers lost the game 31‚Äì3, chalking up only 106¬†yards passing [35] [36] The following week, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the game Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, [36] a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer [37] However, down 23‚Äì17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe Three plays later, Favre threw the game‚Äìwinning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining [27] [36] [38]  Favre would go on to keep the starting job for the rest of his tenure in Green Bay The next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers started the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history The game ended in a 17‚Äì3 victory and Favre finished with a passer rating of 144.6 by going 14-of-19 for 210 yards and two touchdowns [39] During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965 In the winning streak was a 38‚Äì10 victory over the Detroit Lions in Week 14, where Favre was 15-of-19 for 214 yards and three touchdowns to give him a 153.2 passer rating [40] They ended 9‚Äì7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game, a 27‚Äì7 loss to the Minnesota Vikings [41] [42] Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227¬†yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl [43]\n\n\nMVP (√ó3) and Super Bowl seasons (1995‚Äì97)\nIn 1995, Favre won the first of his three AP MVP awards Favre led the Packers to an 11‚Äì5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years [52] Favre passed for a career-high of 4,413¬†yards, 38 touchdowns, and recorded a quarterback rating of 99.5, which was the highest of his career until he recorded a rating of 107.2 during the 2009 season [53] Favre also tied an NFL record by passing for at least two touchdowns in twelve consecutive games, a feat he accomplished over the 1994‚Äì1995 seasons The Packers advanced to the NFC Championship Game after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round The Packers lost the NFC Championship to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row the Packers season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs Favre helped the Packers advance farther in the playoffs than any other Packer team since 1967, which was the season the Packers last won the championship in Super Bowl II [54]\n\n\nMid-career (1998‚Äì2002)\nFavre led the Packers to an NFL record 29 consecutive home wins (25 regular season, 4 post season) until they were defeated by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football on October 5, 1998 [64] Favre's record for consecutive regular season home wins stood until 2010 [65] when Tom Brady led the New England Patriots to a home victory over the New York Jets on December 6, 2010 [66] Despite Brady and the Patriots surpassing the regular season mark for consecutive home victories, the combined regular season plus post season mark remains an NFL record for Favre since the Patriots had their combined regular and post season streak interrupted by a home playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens on January 10, 2010 [67] [65]\n\n\nLater career and personal tragedies (2003‚Äì2006)\nOne day after his father died of a heart attack or stroke, [80] Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders The Packers traveled to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first

passer rating of 154.9, [81] having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime [82] Afterwards, Favre said, \"I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play I love him so much and I love this game It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance But I know he was watching tonight.\" [83] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance [84] [85] [86]\n\n\nMilestone season (2007)\nOn February 26, 2007, Favre underwent minor arthroscopic ankle surgery in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to remove a buildup of bone spurs in his left ankle [106]\n\n\nRetirements and returns (2008)\nBeginning near the end of the 2006 season, word began to surface that Favre was considering retirement In fact, playing at Soldier Field against the arch-rival Bears in the season finale, Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis [122] Moments later at the postgame interview, he gave a tearful interview with an NBC Sports correspondent, where he admitted his future was still questionable However, after much debate, he returned for the 2007 season, during which his future was once again in doubt and an oft-discussed topic, with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl, Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented Aaron Rodgers, who was drafted two years earlier as Favre's heir-apparent Ultimately, the Packers fell in the NFC Championship to the New York Giants.\n\n\nNew York Jets (2008)\nAfter negotiations with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Jets, [143] the Packers traded Favre to the Jets on August 7, 2008, in exchange for a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2009 NFL draft with performance escalation [144]\n\n\nMinnesota Vikings (2009‚Äì2010)\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Favre officially signed with the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009 [155] He made his Vikings debut in the season opener against the Cleveland Browns In the 34‚Äì20 victory, he passed for 110 yards and one passing touchdown [156] In Week 4, Favre had his first game against his former team In the home game against the Green Bay Packers, he had 271 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in the 30‚Äì23 victory [157] With the victory over the Packers, he became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat every one of the league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002 [158] Favre helped lead the Vikings to a 6‚Äì0 start going into Week 7 The Vikings suffered their first setback against the Pittsburgh

{"title": "She-Hulk", "content": "\nPublication history\nShe-Hulk was created by Stan Lee, who wrote only the first issue, and was the last character he created for Marvel Comics, [6] until his return to comics with Ravage 2099 in 1992 The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of The Incredible Hulk (1977‚Äì1982) and The Bionic Woman television series, both from Universal Television Marvel was afraid that the show's executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, as producer Kenneth Johnson had already done with The Six Million Dollar Man [7] So Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the television series, Marvel would own the rights [8] [9] Kenneth Johnson later said the plans for season five of The Incredible Hulk was to have Banner's sister suffering from a disease where only the blood of a sibling could save her life, which would turn her into a \"woman Hulk who was crazy and scary and dangerous\" But six episodes into the season, a new boss at CBS decided to cancel the show with immediate effect, ending the last season with episode seven [10]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nJennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner (Hulk), is the small and somewhat shy daughter of Los Angeles County Sheriff William Morris Walters and Elaine (n√©e Banner) Walters (who died in a car crash when Jennifer was 17) [28] Operatives of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on the day that Banner visited her to tell her about his transformation into the Hulk Since no other donors with her blood type were available, Banner provided his blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and DNA, his gamma-irradiated blood, combined with the adrenaline from emotional stress, transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital [29] [30] She then used her new powers to take down Trask, who was killed when the earth-boring device he rode malfunctioned, taking him to the center of the Earth [31]\n\n\nThe

villain Krona, first battling Aquaman in Asgard, and later in the Savage Land with the rest of the heroes [50] During the final battle against Krona and his forces, she assists Wonder Woman in her battle against Surtur, and eventually appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event [51]\n\n\nSingle Green Female\nThe events of The Search for She-Hulk, combined with her

asked to practice law in the Superhuman Law division of the New York firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (GLK&H) [52] This offer is dependent upon Jennifer remaining human while she worked for the firm [volume¬†&¬†issue¬†needed]\n\n\nCivil War\nShe-Hulk registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, and is a supporter of Tony Stark (Iron Man) However, as an attorney, she advised

intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims [67] The Winter Guard attempts to stop them, but gives up after seeing the plight of the earthquake victims [68] Afterwards, the US government attempts to arrest She-Hulk for her actions in Marinmer, but drops the charges to avoid political embarrassment With public opinion overwhelmingly in her favor, She-Hulk seems poised to get her legal license back when Jazinda is captured by the Behemoth after he mistakenly attacks her, thinking she is the real She-Hulk [69] Jazinda is then taken to a government lab and brutally experimented on when her ability to resurrect herself from the dead is discovered Jazinda contacts She-Hulk telepathically through a secretly implanted mind reading device and warns her that the government will be coming to question her about their relationship Jazinda tells She-Hulk to say she did not know Jazinda was a Skrull and just before going dead/unconscious

he is coming dangerously close to the Maestro, as part of him enjoyed eliminating his 'rivals', having decided instead to accept the eventual loss of his intellect as Extremis wore off rather than risk that persona emerging Informing She-Hulk that she is the only gamma mutation whose life he felt had been legitimately enhanced by her condition, Doc Green provides her with the last injection of his cure, asking her to use it on him if he goes too far in his efforts to stop an A.I version of himself that he created and unleashed [84]\n\n\nGwenpool\nIn Gwenpool's first Christmas special,

her cousin Bruce Banner (the Hulk) granted Jennifer Walters superhuman powers In her She-Hulk form, she possesses enormous superhuman strength, that potentially makes her the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high [98] [99] [100] [101]\n\n\nSkills\nShe-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America and Gamora Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the martial arts to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is She once displayed sufficient knowledge of acupressure to render the Abomination insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him [117]\n\n\nPersonality\nThe character's personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance: originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, extremely kind, empathetic, yet still feisty woman who frequently uses humor when fighting She has stated that she does not want to kill her foes, especially ones which she has already subdued [118]\n\n\nBreaking the fourth wall\nFor a time, starting with the Sensational She-Hulk series by John Byrne in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of \"cross-dimensional\" or metafictional awareness to break the fourth wall In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her \"tearing the page\" or \"walking through a page of advertisements\" to reach an enemy's control center She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer (John Byrne), or appealed to the comic's editor, Ren√©e Witterstaetter The Sensational She-Hulk #50 (Byrne's last issue) involved Ren√©e locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book's new writer This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the Heroes for Hire, when she \"spoke\" to the book's narrator and \"fired\" him for losing the plot Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly \"address\" the audience include She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason, Uatu the Watcher (who narrates a majority of the issues of What If by speaking directly to the reader), and Deadpool On occasion, this practice has also been used for Loki, Rick Jones, Wyatt Wingfoot, and Howard the Duck The Dan Slott series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk's, save for a coda in vol 2 #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm \"researcher\" asks Jen if she can \"really do stuff like that.\" She somewhat wistfully replies \"No I can't\" ‚Äì however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking \"out\" of the comic at the reader She-Hulk's most recent profile in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe continues to list this \"ability\" of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her [99]\n\n\nRelationships\nShe-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.\n\n\nCostumes\nDue to her affiliation with different supergroups over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous costumes She-Hulk's personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.\n\n\nCultural impact and legacy\nJenna Anderson of ComicBook.com wrote, \"Although she has had a slew of different comic interpretations over the years, John Byrne's take on her in The Sensational She-Hulk is often regarded as the most iconic ‚Äì both for further developing her as a character, and for satirizing the comic book tropes of the time In the decades since, She-Hulk has consistently remained spirited and feisty, but also incredibly intelligent, empathetic, and altruistic, both in her life as a superhero and as a lawyer.\" [154] Deidre Kaye of Scary Mommy called She-Hulk a \"role model\" and a \"truly heroic\" female character [155] Peyton Hinckle of ComicsVerse referred to

\"Although she has had a slew of different comic interpretations over the years, John Byrne's take on her in The Sensational She-Hulk is often regarded as the most iconic ‚Äì both for further developing her as a character, and for satirizing the comic book tropes of the time In the decades since, She-Hulk has consistently remained spirited and feisty, but also incredibly intelligent, empathetic, and altruistic, both in her life as a superhero and as a lawyer.\" [154] Deidre Kaye of Scary Mommy called She-Hulk a \"role model\" and a \"truly heroic\" female character [155] Peyton

is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema, she first appeared in Savage She-Hulk #1 (February 1980).\n\n**Publication History**\n\nShe-Hulk was created by Stan Lee, who wrote only the first issue, and was the last character he created for Marvel Comics. The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of The Incredible Hulk (1977‚Äì1982) and The Bionic Woman television series. Marvel was afraid that the show's executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, so Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the television series, Marvel would own the rights.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nJennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner (Hulk), is the small and somewhat shy daughter of Los Angeles County Sheriff William Morris Walters and Elaine (n√©e Banner) Walters (who died in a car crash when Jennifer was 17). Operatives of Nicholas Trask, a crime boss who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on the day that Banner visited her to tell her about his transformation into the Hulk. Since no other donors with her blood type were available, Banner provided his blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and DNA, his gamma-irradiated blood, combined with the adrenaline from emotional stress, transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital.\n\n**The Savage She-Hulk**\n\nThe Savage She-Hulk was a 16-issue comic book series that ran from February 1980 to May 1981. The series was written by Stan Lee and illustrated by John Buscema. The series follows She-Hulk's adventures as she battles various supervillains, including the Abomination and the Juggernaut.\n\n**The Sensational She-Hulk**\n\nThe Sensational She-Hulk was a 50-issue comic book series that ran from November 1989 to February 1994. The series was written by John Byrne and illustrated by various artists. The series follows She-Hulk's adventures as she battles various supervillains, including the Beyonder and the Mad Thinker.\n\n**JLA/Avengers**\n\nIn the DC/Marvel crossover JLA/Avengers, She-Hulk first appears being brainwashed by Starro when the Avengers battle her, grabbing a startled Ms Marvel (Carol Danvers) by her leg, before the latter blasts her away with her powers. She later assists the Avengers in the subsequent hunt for the 12 artifacts needed to trap the DC villain Krona, first battling Aquaman in Asgard, and later in the Savage Land with the rest of the heroes.\n\n**Single Green Female**\n\nThe events of The Search for She-Hulk, combined with her own lack of personal responsibility and the potential legal ramifications of her saving the world, lead Jennifer back to the legal profession in a more full-time capacity, when she is asked to practice law in the Superhuman Law division of the New York firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (GLK&H).\n\n**Civil War**\n\nShe-Hulk registered under the Superhuman Registration Act, and is a supporter of Tony Stark (Iron Man). However, as an attorney, she advised individuals on both sides of the Civil War. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, Daily Bugle publisher J Jonah Jameson, with the intention of keeping the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely.\n\n**World War Hulk**\n\nDue to her involvement in S.H.I.E.L.D., She-Hulk derives a bit of information suggesting that the organization knows of her cousin's whereabouts. Anticipating a problem, Tony Stark has She-Hulk secretly injected with S.P.I.N (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology that transforms her to human form. Enraged, she tells Stark that, although he may have taken She-Hulk out of the equation, he still has to face Jennifer Walters, one of the best lawyers in the country.\n\n**Post-World War Hulk**\n\nAt some point after World War Hulk, Jennifer was brought before the Living Tribunal, and asked to weigh her universe against a newer, better \"cosmic trophy wife\" version. Her universe wins, and she resigns from the Magistrati.\n\n**Secret Invasion**\n\nDuring the Skrull takeover of Earth during Secret Invasion, She-Hulk and Jazinda hunt down a member of the Skrulls who functions as their religious leader X-Factor initially impedes her progress, but they part ways on uncertain terms. She-Hulk and Jazinda capture the Skrull and the two heroines take the Skrull to New York, where they encounter the Super-Skrull, Kl'rt. Kl'rt came to kill his daughter, Jazinda, going so far as to shoot her in the head. Due to her regenerative properties, Jazinda was still not fully dead.\n\n**Lady Liberators**\n\nSome time after the Skrull invasion is defeated, the country of Marinmer suffers a devastating earthquake. Because the victims of the earthquake are members of a minority religious group, the Marinmer government has confiscated all humanitarian aid packages, and because of Marinmer's strong ties to powerful countries such as Russia and China, other nations refuse to intervene for fear of sparking a war. She-Hulk and several members of the Lady Liberators secretly enter Marinmer, intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims.\n\n**Dark Reign**\n\nIn the four-issue miniseries All-New Savage She-Hulk, Jennifer fights Lyra, the alternate reality daughter of Hulk and Thundra after she comes to the Earth-616 reality for the DNA of the strongest man.\n\n**M.I.A.**\n\nIn Incredible Hulk #600, Jennifer tasks Ben Urich to discover the identity of Red Hulk.

Shortly after the events of World War Hulks, Skaar becomes aware that his brother Hiro-Kala is approaching and that he intends to crash the planet K'ai into the Earth. She-Hulk is on the team as they manage to successfully avert disaster.\n\n**Fearsome Four**\n\nDuring the Fear Itself storyline, She-Hulk joins with Howard the Duck, Nighthawk, and the Frankenstein Monster to form a four-person team called the Fearsome Four to stop the Man-Thing from its destructive path.\n\n**Future Foundation**\n\nPrior to a time- and multiverse-spanning trip by the Fantastic Four and family, the Thing asks She-Hulk to be a member of the Future Foundation.\n\n**Doc Green**\n\nWhen the Hulk is elevated into \"Doc Green\" ‚Äì a version of the Hulk possessing Bruce Banner's intellect ‚Äì after he is treated for a shot to the head as Bruce Banner by use of the Extremis virus, he sets out to attack and cure other gamma-based mutations. Steve Rogers attempts to order the Hulk to stop before he goes after She-Hulk.\n\n**Gwenpool**\n\nIn Gwenpool's first Christmas special, Howard the Duck invites her to She-Hulk's Christmas party on the proviso that she has not killed any good guys recently. She shows up and karaokes with Ms Marvel. Also there was a one-shot image of her holding mistletoe over her head and inviting She-Hulk to kiss her while Ms Marvel looked on in girlish glee.\n\n**Civil War II**\n\nDuring the 2016 Civil War II storyline, after the Inhuman Ulysses predicts Thanos' arrival on Earth, She-Hulk is mortally wounded by a direct attack from the villain in question. When Iron Man learns that they used Ulysses' precognitive power to ambush Thanos, he vows to make sure that no one uses it again. Before She-Hulk goes into cardiac arrest, she tells Captain Marvel to fight for the future.\n\n**Post-Civil War II**\n\nFollowing Bruce Banner's funeral, Jennifer Walters left the superhero business and continued to work as a lawyer, where she gained her first client: Maise Brewn, who was an Inhuman descendant. Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals. Jennifer helped Maise when she was recovering from the trauma and being evicted by her landlord Mr Tick. When Maise got impatient with Jennifer and summoned a Fear Golem that killed Mr Tick and some police officers, Jennifer is nearly killed by it and transforms into the Hulk. She defeated the Fear Golem and prevented Maise from committing suicide when Maise was arrested for reckless endangerment afterwards.\n\n**Jack of Hearts**\n\nAfter Jennifer managed to get her mind back in order, she decided to try to reassemble her life and professional career again, and was hired by her old rival Mallory Book, and Mallory's romantic and professional partner Awesome Andy, to handle legal representation and counselling for other superhumans. To help Jennifer, her good friend Janet van Dyne, The Wasp, also gave her a spacious new apartment.\n\n**Characterization**\n\nJennifer Walters is a strong and self-confident woman who completely ignores female stereotypes. She happily accepts the things that make her different and doesn't try to hide herself just because others disapprove. She struggles with things too, but at the end of the day, she proves that with the right thinking, anything is possible. For male and female comic readers alike, that's an important message.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nShe-Hulk possesses enormous superhuman strength, potentially making her the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high. She is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America and Gamora.

She is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a skilled detective.\n\n**Personality**\n\nThe character's personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance. Originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, extremely kind, empathetic, and vivacious.\n\n**Breaking the fourth wall**\n\nFor a time, starting with the Sensational She-Hulk series by John Byrne in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of \"cross-dimensional\" or metafictional awareness to break the fourth wall. In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her \"tearing the page\" or \"walking through a page of advertisements\" to reach an enemy's control center.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nShe-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.\n\n**Costumes**\n\nDue to her affiliation with different supergroups over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous costumes. Her personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.\n\n**Cultural Impact and Legacy**\n\nShe-Hulk has consistently remained a popular character in the Marvel Universe. She has been featured in various comic book series, animated television shows, and video games. Her impact on popular culture has been significant, with her character inspiring numerous fans.\n\n**Impact**\n\nIn January 2016, She-Hulk was ranked 18th in the \"Top 100 Marvel Characters\" list

Hawkeye was acquitted for shooting Bruce Banner, Captain Marvel visited She-Hulk, who came out of her coma When She-Hulk angrily demanded to know the verdict of Hawkeye's trial, Captain Marvel

Brewn, who was an Inhuman descendant Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals Jennifer helped

She-Hulk form, she possesses enormous superhuman strength, that potentially makes her the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high [98]

possesses enormous superhuman strength, that potentially makes her the physically strongest known woman in the Marvel Universe when her emotional state is sufficiently high [98] [99] [100] [101]\n\n\nSkills\nShe-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Captain America and Gamora Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the martial arts to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is She once displayed sufficient knowledge of acupressure to render the Abomination insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him [117]\n\n\nPersonality\nThe character's personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance: originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, extremely kind, empathetic, yet still feisty woman who frequently uses humor when fighting She has stated that she does not want to kill her foes, especially ones which she has already subdued [118]\n\n\nBreaking the fourth wall\nFor a time, starting with the Sensational She-Hulk series by John Byrne in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of \"cross-dimensional\" or metafictional awareness to break the fourth wall In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her \"tearing the page\" or \"walking through a page of advertisements\" to reach an enemy's control center She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer (John Byrne), or appealed to the comic's editor, Ren√©e Witterstaetter The Sensational She-Hulk #50 (Byrne's last issue) involved Ren√©e locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book's new writer This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the Heroes for Hire, when she \"spoke\" to the book's narrator and \"fired\" him for losing the plot Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly \"address\" the audience include She-Hulk's friend Louise Mason, Uatu the Watcher (who narrates a majority of the issues of What If by speaking directly to the reader), and Deadpool On occasion, this practice has also been used for Loki, Rick Jones, Wyatt Wingfoot, and Howard the Duck The Dan Slott series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk's, save for a coda in vol 2 #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm \"researcher\" asks Jen if she can \"really do stuff like that.\" She somewhat wistfully replies \"No I can't\" ‚Äì however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking \"out\" of the comic at the reader She-Hulk's most recent profile in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe continues to list this \"ability\" of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her [99]\n\n\nRelationships\nShe-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.\n\n\nCostumes\nDue to her affiliation with different supergroups over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous costumes She-Hulk's personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.\n\n\nCultural impact and legacy\nJenna Anderson of ComicBook.com wrote, \"Although she has had a slew of different comic interpretations over the years, John Byrne's take on her in The Sensational She-Hulk is often regarded as the most iconic ‚Äì both for further developing her as a character, and for satirizing the comic book tropes of the time In the decades since, She-Hulk has consistently remained spirited and feisty, but also incredibly intelligent, empathetic, and altruistic, both in her life as a superhero and as a lawyer.\" [154] Deidre Kaye of Scary Mommy called She-Hulk a \"role model\" and a \"truly heroic\" female character [155] Peyton Hinckle of ComicsVerse referred to She-Hulk as a female role model, saying, \"As a strong, self-confident woman who completely ignores female stereotypes, she's the kind of character more people ‚Äî especially younger readers ‚Äî need to see She happily accepts the things that make her different and she doesn't try to hide herself just because others disapprove She struggles with things too, but at the end of the day, she proves that with the right thinking, anything is possible For male and female comic readers alike, that's an important

{"title": "Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "content": "\n2020 election\nJoe Biden officially announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election on April 25, 2019, having previously sought the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, being unsuccessful both times [24] In June 2020, Biden clinched the nomination by winning a majority of the delegates Biden selected Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, and they were officially nominated as the Democratic ticket at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n\n\nTransition period, inauguration, and first 100 days\nThough Biden was generally acknowledged as the winner, [26] [27] [28] [29] General Services Administration head Emily W Murphy initially refused to begin the transition to the president-elect, thereby denying funds and office space to his team [33] [34] On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition [35]\n\n\nInaugural address\nBiden's inaugural speech laid out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice [46] Biden called for an end to the \"uncivil war\" of political, demographic, and ideological American cultures through a greater embrace of diversity [47] He cited the American Civil War, Great Depression, world wars, and September 11 attacks as moments in American history where citizens' \"better angels\" prevailed, saying that the unity, the solution, must again be invoked to rise from the \"cascading\" crises of the present; this unity, he proclaimed, exists in the \"common objects\" that define America: \"opportunity, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and .. truth.\" [48] [49] He explicitly decried white supremacy and nativism, calling them an \"ugly reality\" of American life he vows to defeat that clouds the \"American ideal\" set out in the U.S Declaration of Independence ‚Äî that all Americans are equal [47] [49] [50] Biden pledged that the U.S would \"engage with the world once again\", \"repair our alliances\", and act as a \"trusted partner for peace and security\" [51] Near the conclusion of his speech, Biden held a moment of silence for those who died in the COVID-19 pandemic [48] Quoting the Gene Scheer composition \"American Anthem\", [52] he implored Americans to consider their legacy in answering the \"call of history\" to protect \"democracy, hope, truth, and justice\", \"secure liberty\", and make America a \"beacon to the world\", insisting that generations of their descendants would judge them on their actions [48]\n\n\nAdministration\nBiden was inaugurated alongside Kamala Harris, the first woman, first African American, and first Asian American vice president [53]\n\n\nCabinet\nBiden selected Antony Blinken to be secretary of state, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the United Nations, and Jake Sullivan as national security advisor [60] [61]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nAs of September¬†25, 2024 [update], the United States Senate has confirmed 213 Article III judges nominated by Biden: one associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, 44 judges for the United States courts of appeals, 166 judges for the United States district courts and two judges for the United States Court of International Trade.\n\n\nUnited States Supreme Court nominations\nBiden strongly campaigned for the presidency on the public option, a policy that, if enacted into law, would have offered Americans a choice between maintaining their private healthcare insurance or buying into Medicare The idea was viewed as a compromise between the progressive and moderate flanks of the Democratic Party The Biden campaign described the public option as a \"plan to protect and build on ObamaCare\" [84]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nBiden strongly campaigned for the presidency on the public option, a policy that, if enacted into law, would have offered Americans a choice between maintaining their private healthcare insurance or buying into Medicare The idea was viewed as a compromise between the progressive and moderate flanks of the Democratic Party The Biden campaign described the public option as a \"plan to protect and build on ObamaCare\" [84]\n\n\nHealth care\nBiden strongly campaigned for the presidency on the public option, a policy that, if enacted into law, would have offered Americans a choice between maintaining their private healthcare insurance or buying into Medicare The idea was viewed as a compromise between the progressive and moderate flanks of the Democratic Party The Biden campaign described the public option as a \"plan to protect and build on ObamaCare\" [84]\n\n\nOpioid epidemic\nDrug overdoses killed 106,699 in the United States in 2021 [93] Opioids were involved in 80,411 overdose deaths in 2021, up from around 10,000 in 1999 [94]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn January 20, 2021, his first day as president, Biden implemented a federal mask mandate, requiring the use of masks and social distancing in all federal buildings, on federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors [100] [101] [6] Biden also signed an executive order that reversed the withdrawal of the U.S from the World Health Organization (WHO), making Dr Anthony Fauci the head of the delegation to the WHO [101] On January 21, the administration released a 200-page document titled \"National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness\" [102] [103] On his second day in office, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up the vaccination process and ensure the availability of glass vials, syringes, and other vaccine supplies at the federal level [104] [105] In justifying his use of the act, Biden said: \"And when I say wartime, people kind of look at me like 'wartime?' Well, as I said last night, 400,000 Americans have died That's more than have died in all of World War II 400,000 This is a wartime undertaking.\" [106] Biden established the White House COVID-19 Response Team, a White House Office dedicated to coordinating a unified federal government response [107]\n\n\nCancer research\nBiden gave a speech at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on September 12, 2022, the 60th anniversary of Kennedy's We Choose to Go to the Moon speech, promoting his administration's revival of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot, including the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health [135]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe New Republic praised Biden's economic record in July 2024, highlighting record low unemployment leading to a growth in wages at the lower end of the wage distribution as workers had more bargaining power While inflation was painful, it has returned near its pre-pandemic rate and was similar to peer countries, though the U.S has grown faster than its peers [136] The expansion of the Affordable Care Act, the child tax credit, $1400 stimulus checks, and the expansion of SNAP benefits also boosted balance sheets for low and middle-income Americans [136] New business formation rose 30% from pre-pandemic levels, and was notably strong among women [136] Biden also signed three major pieces of longer-term economic legislation to repair infrastructure like roads, bridges and water pipes, boost semiconductor investment, and expand green energy [136]\n\n\nBuild Back Better Plan\nThe Build Back Better Plan was a proposed framework of public investment in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs It was eventually divided into three parts The American Rescue Plan was focused on COVID-19 pandemic relief, and was passed and signed into law in March 2021 as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 The second part called for investment in infrastructure and addressing climate change, and was called the American Jobs Plan Elements of the American Jobs Plan were the basis for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021 The third part, the American Families Plan, proposed investment in social policies, such as paid parental leave The American Families Plan was merged with elements of the American Jobs Plan to form the Build Back Better Act, introduced in September 2021 This passed the House of Representatives, but failed to pass the Senate Continued negations led to the a new proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which included proposals addressing climate change, healthcare, and tax reform proposals while excluding Build Back Better's social safety net proposals This was passed and signed into law in August 2022.\n\n\nConsumer price reductions\nThe administration also pursued lower drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices it pays and capping the price of insulin [136]\n\n\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021\nOn January 14, 2021, Biden revealed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [139] The plan includes $1 trillion in direct aid, including $1,400 per-person checks, for working Americans, and would provide for direct housing and nutrition assistance, expanding access to safe and reliable childcare and affordable healthcare, increasing the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, and giving families with kids and childless workers an emergency boost this year [140] [141] It would also expand the eligibility of these checks to adult dependents who have been left out of previous rounds of relief [140] [141] [139] The plan additionally includes $440 billion in community support, providing $350 billion of community support to first responders while the rest goes to grants for small businesses and transit agencies; $400 billion for a national vaccination plan and school reopenings; and $10 billion for information technology, modernizing federal cybersecurity infrastructure [139] [141] In her first press briefing, press secretary Psaki said the plan was likely to change as negotiations continued, with the provision to increase the minimum wage later being excluded from the relief plan [142] Biden signed the Plan into law on March 11, 2021, passing through both chambers of Congress with a party-line vote [143] [144]\n\n\nAmerican Families Plan\nOn 28 April, during Biden's speech to Congress he unveiled the American Families Plan, a roughly $1.8 trillion proposal to significantly increase federal spending in areas related to childcare, paid leave, pre-kindergarten, community college, and healthcare [145] [146] It is considered to be the third part of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda (the first being the American Rescue Plan and the second being the American Jobs Plan) [147] The bill was effectively merged with climate change and other provisions that didn't make it into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, for a total $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act However, the bill did not have Republican support, and Democrats struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion [148] After the bill ultimately failed to match his envisioned cost, Manchin publicly rejected it, dooming its passage [149]\n\n\nLabor\nOn January 22, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump's policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions [150] [151] Biden's executive order also promotes a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and repeals three of Trump's executive orders which made the employee discipline process stricter and restricted union representatives' access to office space As well as promoting a $15 minimum wage, Biden's executive order increases the amount of money going to the families of children who are missing meals because of school closures due to the pandemic by 15% [152] The repealing of Trump's three executive orders comes as the orders were used to transfer civil servants and career scientists and replace them with employees friendly to the Trump administration [153]\n\n\nBanking\nAfter the Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout that was borne by taxpayers [167] He also claimed that the partial roll-back of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank failures [168]\n\n\nDomestic manufacturing\nBiden signed an executive order intended to support domestic manufacturers by increasing a federal preference for purchasing goods made wholly or partly in the U.S Using the broad term \"Made in America laws\", the executive order's stated goal is to strengthen \"all statutes, regulations, rules, and Executive Orders relating to Federal financial assistance awards or Federal procurement, including those that refer to 'Buy America' or 'Buy American.'\" [169] [170]\n\n\nTrade\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that instead of negotiating access to Chinese markets for large American financial-service firms and pharmaceutical companies, the Biden administration may focus on trade policies that boost exports or domestic jobs U.S Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the administration wants a \"worker-centered trade policy\" [174] [175] U.S Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo aggressively enforced trade rules to combat unfair practices by China [176]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAs a part of the Build Back Better Plan, the Biden administration aimed for massive spending on the nation's infrastructure on the order of $2 trillion [182] Several of the physical infrastructure provisions featured in the proposal were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Biden signed the Act into law on November 15, 2021 [183]\n\n\nInternational taxation\nFinance officials from 130 countries agreed on July 1, 2021, to plans for a new international taxation policy All the major economies agreed to pass national laws that would require corporations to pay at least 15% income tax in the countries they operate This new policy would end the practice of locating world headquarters in small countries with very low taxation rates Governments hope to recoup some of the lost revenue, estimated at $100 billion to $240 billion each year The new system was promoted by the Biden administration and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General Mathias Cormann of the OECD said: \"This historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere.\" [186]\n\n\nInflation\nLonger-term variables that preceded the pandemic and contributed to the rise in inflation include structural housing shortages, [188] [189] [190] impacts of climate change on food, energy and home insurance prices, [191] [192] [193] as well as the size of government debt and deficits [194] [195] [196]\n\n\nEnergy, environment, and climate\nDuring his first week in office, Biden established the position of White House National Climate Advisor, appointing environmental health and air quality expert Gina McCarthy to the role Biden also created the position of U.S Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, appointing former secretary of state John Kerry [209]\n\n\nGeneral\nDuring his first week in office, Biden established the position of White House National Climate Advisor, appointing environmental health and air quality expert Gina McCarthy to the role Biden also created the position of U.S Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, appointing former secretary of state John Kerry [209]\n\n\nOil, gas extraction and transportation\nOn January 21, 2021, the Biden administration issued a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases and permits on federal land and waters [221] On January 27, 2021, Biden signed a number of executive orders aimed at combating climate change, [222] one of them setting climate change as a key consideration for U.S national security and foreign policy [223] In an attempt to encourage U.S membership to the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement aimed to reduce the production of hydrofluorocarbons, Biden's executive order directed the U.S Department of State to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate [224] [225]\n\n\nEnvironmental science\nIn May 2021, the EPA rolled back a Trump administration rule that prohibited the EPA from using certain studies [228] [229] The previous rule, which made it more difficult to use major scientific studies to justify pollution reduction policies, [230] had already been invalidated by a federal court [231]\n\n\nRenewable energy\nThe Biden administration set a goal of achieving 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generated in the U.S by 2030 (sufficient to provide electricity to about 10 million homes) In 2021, the Biden administration

failed to invoke cloture [250] However, the rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it [251]\n\n\nHousing\nDue to ongoing decreases in housing affordability exacerbated by the pandemic, inflation, and snarls in the global supply chain, Biden launched the Housing Supply Action Plan on May 16, 2022, to increase housing supply and construction through executive initiatives, administrative deregulation and funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Due to the statutory limits upon federal intervention in housing policy, the plan relied heavily upon partnerships with willing municipal governments and the private sector to reform zoning and permitting laws and secure construction supply, issuing financial incentives to municipal governments for cooperation with the plan, issuing financial support to renters, landlords and first-time homeowners, and disincentivizing large institutional investors from acquiring government-owned or funded home properties [258] Biden also called upon Congress to pass an Unlocking Possibilities Program to allow HUD to issue grants to states and localities to help reform

require the border to be closed if border encounters reached an average of 5,000 per day over several days Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans asserted the bill allowed 5,000 illegal border crossings per day, though this was misleading, as the 5,000 encounters would only be allowed into the country if they passed asylum hearings or were being held under government supervision [309] The bill would end the practice of \"catch and release\" that allows migrants entry into the country while they await immigration hearings; instead, migrants would be detained pending hearings [309] The plan included a tighter asylum application and approval process with speedy removal of migrants who do not qualify, the hiring of thousands more border patrol and asylum officers and an increase in detention capacity The bill also provided for thousands of work visas for migrant spouses of U.S citizens awaiting immigrant visas, and 250,000 new visas over five years for people seeking

laid out a plan for creating term limits for Supreme Court justices Under his plan, every two years presidents would appoint justices to 18 year terms Lastly, he pushed for \"a binding code of

Research Projects Agency for Health [135]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe New Republic praised Biden's economic record in July 2024, highlighting record low unemployment leading to a growth in wages at the lower end of the wage distribution as workers had more bargaining power While inflation was painful, it has returned near its pre-pandemic rate and was similar to peer countries, though the U.S has grown faster than its peers [136] The expansion of the Affordable Care Act, the child tax credit, $1400 stimulus checks, and the expansion of SNAP benefits also boosted balance sheets for low and middle-income Americans [136] New business formation rose 30% from pre-pandemic levels, and was notably strong among women [136] Biden also signed three major pieces of longer-term economic legislation to repair infrastructure like roads, bridges and water pipes, boost semiconductor investment, and expand green energy [136]\n\n\nBuild Back Better Plan\nThe Build Back Better Plan was a proposed framework of public investment in social, infrastructural, and environmental programs It was eventually divided into three parts The American Rescue Plan was focused on COVID-19 pandemic relief, and was passed and signed into law in March 2021 as the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 The second part called for investment in infrastructure and addressing climate change, and was called the American Jobs Plan Elements of the American Jobs Plan were the basis for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law in November 2021 The third part, the American Families Plan, proposed investment in social policies, such as paid parental leave The American Families Plan was merged with elements of the American Jobs Plan to form the Build Back Better Act, introduced in September 2021 This passed the House of Representatives, but failed to pass the Senate Continued negations led to the a new proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which included proposals addressing climate change, healthcare, and tax reform proposals while excluding Build Back Better's social safety net proposals This was passed and signed into law in August 2022.\n\n\nConsumer price

insurance, and giving families with kids and childless workers an emergency boost this year [140] [141] It would also expand the eligibility of these checks to adult dependents who have been left out of previous rounds of relief [140] [141] [139] The plan additionally includes $440 billion in community support, providing $350 billion of community support to first responders while the rest goes to grants for small businesses and transit agencies; $400 billion for a national vaccination plan and school reopenings; and $10 billion for information technology, modernizing federal cybersecurity

April, during Biden's speech to Congress he unveiled the American Families Plan, a roughly $1.8 trillion proposal to significantly increase federal spending in areas related to childcare, paid leave, pre-kindergarten, community college, and healthcare [145] [146] It is considered to be the third part of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" agenda (the first being the American Rescue Plan and the second being the American Jobs Plan) [147] The bill was effectively merged with climate change and other provisions that didn't make it into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, for a total $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act However, the bill did not have Republican support, and Democrats struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion [148] After the bill ultimately failed to match his envisioned cost, Manchin publicly rejected it, dooming its passage [149]\n\n\nLabor\nOn January 22, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump's policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions

restricted union representatives' access to office space As well as promoting a $15 minimum wage, Biden's executive order increases the amount of money going to the families of children who are missing meals because of school closures due to the pandemic by 15% [152] The repealing of Trump's three executive orders comes as the orders were used to transfer civil servants and career scientists

administration set a goal of achieving 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy generated in the U.S by 2030 (sufficient to provide electricity to about 10 million homes) In 2021, the Biden administration

failed to invoke cloture [250] However, the rules change failed when two Democratic senators joined Senate Republicans in opposing it [251]\n\n\nHousing\nDue to ongoing decreases in housing affordability exacerbated by the pandemic, inflation, and snarls in the global supply chain, Biden launched the Housing Supply Action Plan on May 16, 2022, to increase housing supply and construction through executive initiatives, administrative deregulation and funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Due to the statutory limits upon federal intervention in housing policy, the plan relied heavily upon partnerships with willing municipal governments and the private sector to reform zoning and permitting laws and secure construction supply, issuing financial incentives to municipal governments for cooperation with the plan, issuing financial support to renters, landlords and first-time homeowners, and disincentivizing large institutional investors from acquiring government-owned or funded home properties [258] Biden also called upon Congress to pass an Unlocking Possibilities Program to allow HUD to issue grants to states and localities to help reform

require the border to be closed if border encounters reached an average of 5,000 per day over several days Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans asserted the bill allowed 5,000 illegal border crossings per day, though this was misleading, as the 5,000 encounters would only be allowed into the country if they passed asylum hearings or were being held under government supervision [309] The bill would end the practice of \"catch and release\" that allows migrants entry into the country while they await immigration hearings; instead, migrants would be detained pending hearings [309] The plan included a tighter asylum application and approval process with speedy removal of migrants who do not qualify, the hiring of thousands more border patrol and asylum officers and an increase in detention capacity The bill also provided for thousands of work visas for migrant spouses of U.S citizens awaiting immigrant visas, and 250,000 new visas over five years for people seeking

laid out a plan for creating term limits for Supreme Court justices Under his plan, every two years presidents would appoint justices to 18 year terms Lastly, he pushed for \"a binding code of conduct\" to replace the Supreme Court's existing self-enforced ethics code [374]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nOn January 22, 2021, Biden signed his first bill, [375] H.R 335 into law, providing a waiver to

daytime host and producer Mike Douglas Vivian Vance appeared as a guest [22] Arnaz also headlined a Kraft Music Hall special on NBC that featured his two children, with a brief appearance by Vance Arnaz suffered a severe attack of diverticulitis in 1971, which required an operation and several years of recovery [23] He worked with Universal Studios for two years working on development deals for two shows that eventually fell through, Dr Domingo (the character did appear on one episode of Ironside) and Chairman of the Board starring Elke Sommer [24] Arnaz moved on to work on his autobiography for two years.\n\n\nPersonal life\nArnaz and Ball decided that I Love Lucy would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid ethnic jokes, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking [4]\n\n\nBeliefs\nArnaz and Ball decided that I Love Lucy would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid ethnic jokes, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking [4]\n\n\nPolitics\nA lifelong Republican, Arnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had [4] He was a supporter of Richard Nixon and member of the Spanish-Speaking Committee for the Re-Election of the President in 1972 [33] Nixon appointed Arnaz as the U.S roving ambassador to Latin America in the early 1970s [34] He was a supporter of Ronald Reagan and spoke at campaign rallies, such as one hosted by the National Republican Hispanic Assembly in 1980 [35] He was an advocate for the Hispanic community, encouraging them to take the 1980 census to increase federal funding for their communities [36]\n\n\nMarriages\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940 Their marriage was always turbulent Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her, along with him coming home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944 [37] The interlocutory decree became final in October 1944, but because they had spent the night together the day before, California state law at the time had declared it null and void [38] Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors Lucie Arnaz (born 1951) and Desi Arnaz Jr (born 1953).\n\n\nHealth\nArnaz suffered from knee injuries as a young man shortly before and during his military service in World War II The pain was troublesome enough that he was disqualified from serving overseas In the late 1960s, he was seriously injured in an accident when the floor collapsed and he was impaled by a tree stump in his home in Baja California An operation saved his life, although his health was never the same after the incident [45] Throughout his life he periodically had to seek medical treatment for diverticulitis and intestinal issues, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\n\nArrests\nArnaz had a few run-ins with the law He was arrested in 1959 on an intoxication charge while he was walking Hollywood Blvd [47] In 1966, he was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after an altercation with youth parking in front of his house Two young men were allegedly partying nearby and harassing his then-15-year-old daughter Lucie and her friend Arnaz confronted them, threatened to shoot their tires and cars, and then fired two shots that went into the ground He spent three hours at the San Diego jail and was released on $1,100 bail [48] [49]\n\n\nLater life\nDesi Arnaz spent his retirement doing activities he enjoyed including sailing his yacht (he was a skilled yachtsman since childhood), fishing, and cooking Cuban dishes [50] He suffered from numerous health issues later in life He contributed to charitable and nonprofit organizations, including San Diego State University He was active in politics and made occasional public appearances He was the guest of honor at the Carnival Miami in March 1982 where he performed with his children, Lucie and Desi Jr., in front of a crowd of 35,000 [50]\n\n\nThoroughbred racing\nArnaz and his second wife eventually moved to Del Mar, California where he lived the rest of his life in semi-retirement He owned a horse-breeding farm in Corona, California and raced Thoroughbreds The Desi Arnaz Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack is named in his honor [51]\n\n\nDeath\nArnaz was a regular smoker for much of his life and often smoked cigarettes on the set of I Love Lucy [52] He smoked cigars until he was in his sixties [53] Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1986 and underwent treatment Lucille Ball visited him during this time in the hospital and the two watched VHS tapes of I Love Lucy [46] His daughter Lucie was by his side constantly during his final days.\n\n\nLegacy\nDesi Arnaz has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard for contributions to motion pictures and one at 6250 Hollywood Boulevard for television [57] Unlike his co-stars, Arnaz was never nominated for an Emmy for his performance in I Love Lucy; however, as executive producer of the series, he was nominated four times in the Best Situation Comedy category, winning twice [58] In 1956, he won a Golden Globe for Best Television Achievement for helping to shape the American Comedy through his contributions in front of and behind the camera of I Love Lucy He was inducted into the Television Academy's Hall of Fame [59]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\n\nSoundtracks\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nSee

of the England under-15 championship in 1998, [4] Selby joined the professional tour a year later in 1999, at the age of 16 [5] [6] In early 2002, he reached the semi-finals of the China Open, despite

semi-finals in the 2007 Shanghai Masters, but was defeated by Dominic Dale, who went on to win the tournament [25] Selby also had a strong run in the UK Championship, reaching the semi-finals as well, where he met the eventual winner of the event, Ronnie O'Sullivan Selby led 7‚Äì5, but fell 7‚Äì8 behind before levelling the match at 8‚Äì8; however, O'Sullivan made a 147 break in the deciding frame to win 9‚Äì8 [26]\n\n\n2008‚Äì09 season\nThe following season Selby was defeated at the 2008 Shanghai Masters, once again in the semi-final stage by the event's eventual winner, this time Ricky Walden [34] Then at the beginning of the new year, he reached the final of the Masters again, where he was runner-up to Ronnie O'Sullivan, losing the match 8‚Äì10 after leading 7‚Äì5 [35] In the Welsh Open quarter-finals he was handed a writ by a member of the audience, supposedly his former manager George Barmby Selby commented that all he could think about was the envelope that had been given to him before he was defeated 3‚Äì5 by Anthony Hamilton [36] Later on in the season, he made it to the final once more in the 2009 Championship League, [32] and also reached the quarter-finals of the 2009

Championship, he set the record for the most century breaks compiled in a world championship match when he made six in his second-round tie with Stephen Hendry [44] This was also a record for a best-of-25-frames match, and took Selby's century tally for the season to 54, setting a new record for the most centuries compiled by one player in a single season [45]\n\n\n2011‚Äì12 season\nSelby started the season by winning the non-ranking Wuxi Classic with a 9‚Äì7 victory over Ali Carter [46] He won his second ranking event at the Shanghai Masters, where he defeated Mark Williams 10‚Äì9 in the final, winning the last three frames from 7‚Äì9 behind [47] With this victory, Selby replaced Williams as world number one, [48] moving to the top of the world rankings for the first time in his career [4]\n\n\n2012‚Äì13 season: first UK Championship and third Masters titles\nSelby announced he felt \"90 per cent fit\" just before the start of the season, as he continued his recovery from the disc bulge in his neck [59] His first event was the Wuxi Classic where he played Barry Hawkins in the last 32; having been eliminated from the World Championship by Hawkins two months earlier, Selby this time won 5‚Äì2, and then whitewashed Jamie Cope 5‚Äì0 to set up a quarter-final match with in-form Stuart Bingham, but lost in the deciding frame 4‚Äì5 [60] [61] He won seven matches in a row to reach the quarter-finals of the Six-red World Championship, where he was defeated 5‚Äì7 by Judd Trump [60] He then suffered a shock 3‚Äì5 first-round defeat to Jamie Burnett in the Australian

that his opponent had deserved to win the match [130] He then eliminated Dechawat Poomjaeng and Matthew Selt both 6‚Äì1, before being whitewashed 6‚Äì0 by Neil Robertson in the semi-finals [131] [132] In early 2016, Selby lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the quarter-finals of both the Masters and Welsh Open, [133] [134] but won the Gdynia Open with a 4‚Äì1 victory over Martin Gould [135]\n\n\n2016‚Äì17 season: third World Championship and second UK Championship titles\nSelby won his first ranking title of the season at the Paul Hunter Classic, beating Tom Ford 4‚Äì2 in the final [139] His semi-final against Stuart Bingham at the Shanghai Masters in September, was a meeting between the top-two ranked players in the world, Selby winning 6‚Äì5, having trailed 3‚Äì5 [140] After taking an early 3‚Äì1 advantage over Ding Junhui in the final, he eventually lost the match 6‚Äì10 [141] The following month, he was defeated 2‚Äì6 by Judd Trump in the semi-finals of the European Masters [142] He then won 9‚Äì3 in another semi-final encounter with Bingham, to reach the final of the International Championship in Daqing, China, winning the event for the first time by overcoming Ding 10‚Äì1; Selby dominated their encounter, winning all of the last seven frames, in the most one-sided ranking event final since the 2012 World Open when Mark Allen had defeated Stephen Lee by the same scoreline Selby made seven 50+ breaks, while Ding's highest was just 47 [143]\n\n\n2017‚Äì18 season\nIn the 2017‚Äì18 snooker season, Selby was eliminated in the first round of the Hong Kong Masters after a 3‚Äì5 defeat to eventual champion Neil Robertson [151] His first ranking tournament of the season was the China Championship where he was defeated 4‚Äì5 by Zhou Yuelong in the second round [152] He

Championship [168] At the 2019 Masters, he lost 2‚Äì6 to Judd Trump in a \"nervy\" quarter-final, despite making a 110 break in the seventh frame of the match [169]\n\n\n2019‚Äì20 season\nIn the 2019‚Äì20 season, Selby reached the semi-finals of the International Championship, losing 4‚Äì9 to Judd Trump, [177] and in defending his title at the China Championship, he lost 3‚Äì6 to Shaun

[180] In the Champion of Champions, he fell short 2‚Äì6 to Mark Allen in the group final [181] Despite recovering from 1‚Äì4 behind to tie at 4‚Äì4, he was defeated in the quarter-finals of the Northern Ireland Open by John Higgins [182] He took more than six minutes to play one of his shots in the seventh frame of this match, leading to criticism from the Eurosport commentator Neal Foulds [183] He won the Scottish Open in December, beating Jack Lisowski 9‚Äì6 in the final Having also won the English Open earlier in the season, he became the first player to win more than one tournament in the Home Nations Series in a single season [184]\n\n\n2020‚Äì21 season: fourth World Championship title\nAfter the delayed start to the new season, Selby won his 18th ranking title at the 2020 European Masters in September, defeating Martin Gould 9‚Äì8 in the final [203] [204] The score was level at 4‚Äì4 by the end of the afternoon session, despite Selby taking an early 4‚Äì0 lead [204] The two players were evenly matched throughout the evening session, but Selby eventually won the match in the  deciding final frame with a break of 72 [203] The win moved him to a joint sixth place, alongside Neil Robertson, on the list of players with the most world ranking titles [204]\n\n\n2021‚Äì22 season\nIn contrast with his last two snooker years, this was a poor season for Selby His first tournament was the 2021 British Open [223] He was defeated in the second round, but returned to the top of the rankings for the first time since March 2019 [224] After that, he suffered many early round exits, failed to qualify for tournaments or has withdrawn from them Selby said that snooker seemed \"irrelevant right now\" to him, [225] as he spoke about his struggles with depression that was affecting his life and snooker form [226] He reached the semi-finals of the 2021 World Grand Prix in December though, but after levelling the match at 2‚Äì2, he was defeated 3‚Äì6 by Neil Robertson [227] The only other highlights of the season were his quarter-final appearances at the 2021 Champion of Champions, where he made his 700th century break in his opening match against David Gilbert, becoming the sixth player to reach that milestone, [228] and the 2022 Masters, where Selby avenged his 6‚Äì3 loss to Stephen Maguire from last year's tournament by beating the Scotsman by the exact same scoreline, [229] but then he suffered a 6‚Äì1 defeat by Barry Hawkins [230]\n\n\n2022‚Äì23 season\nCompared to his last season performance, Selby's form had improved, as he was in the final of the 2022 World Mixed Doubles, teamed up with Rebecca Kenna, though they ended up losing 2‚Äì4 to Neil Robertson and Mink Nutcharut; [231] then he reached the quarter-finals of the British, [232] the Northern Ireland [233] and the Scottish Open, [234] and the semi-finals of the 2022 Champion of Champions [235] After that, he went on and became the first player to win the English Open for the second time, claiming his first ranking trophy since his World Championship win in 2021, [236] and becoming the second player, after Judd Trump, to win four Home Nations tournaments [237] In the semi-final of the tournament, he also recorded his first win over Neil Robertson in two years, after seven consecutive losses to him, [238] including this year's Northern Ireland and Scottish Open defeats Towards the end of the season, Selby also won the inaugural 2023 WST Classic tournament, beating Pang Junxu 6‚Äì2 in the final [239] In the next event, the 2023 Tour Championship, he made it to the semi-final, losing 9‚Äì10 to Shaun Murphy, forcing a decider after being 6‚Äì9 down [240]\n\n\n2023‚Äì24 season\nAt the start of the season, Selby was a semi-finalist in the 2023 European Masters and the 2023 Shanghai Masters, losing 4‚Äì6 to Barry Hawkins in the former, [245] and 7‚Äì10 to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the latter tournament [246] Then he reached the final of the 2023 British Open, facing Mark Williams and eventually losing to him 10‚Äì7, despite coming back from 5‚Äì1 down to 8‚Äì7 throughout the match [247] Going that far in the tournament took its toll, as in the next event, the 2023 English Open, Selby won his held-over qualifying match, but then he lost 4‚Äì2 to world number 104 Martin O'Donnell in the last 64, having played nine matches in nine days altogether [248] He also exited in the last 64 round at the following 2023 Wuhan Open, losing 4‚Äì5 to Xu Si [249] His last notable result for the calendar year was reaching the quarter-finals of the 2023 UK Championship, where he lost 3‚Äì6 to Judd Trump [250]\n\n\n2024‚Äì25 season\nIn September, Selby reached the quarter-finals at the English Open, where he suffered a shock 4‚Äì5 loss to world number 77 Ishpreet Singh Chadha [263] The following week, he won the British Open, defeating John Higgins 10‚Äì5 in the final to claim his first ranking tournament title since March 2023 [264] [265]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in Leicester on 19 June 1983, [4] [266] Selby began playing pool at the age of eight and snooker aged nine [109] Malcolm Thorne, brother of Leicester-born snooker player Willie Thorne, spotted Selby's snooker ability and offered him free practice at his brother's snooker club, which Selby took full advantage of, practising in the evenings after school [109] [110] Abandoned by his mother at the age of eight, [267] Selby lost his father to cancer when he was 16, after which he lived with family friend and snooker coach, Alan Perkins He contemplated suicide after his father's death, but Perkins encouraged him to devote himself to snooker, telling him his father would have wanted him to keep playing and trying his best [268] Two months later, Selby joined the main professional tour, [5] [269] having left school with no qualifications His nickname, \"The Jester from Leicester\", [6] [270] was given to him by snooker compere Richard Beare because Selby liked

"article": "Mark Selby\nMark Selby (born 19 June 1983) is an English professional snooker player. He has won 19 ranking titles, including four World Championships, and was world number one for the first time in 2012. Selby has also been a finalist in 35 ranking finals and has won over ¬£4 million in prize money.\n\nCareer\nSelby began playing pool at the age of eight and snooker at the age of nine. Malcolm Thorne, brother of Leicester-born snooker player Willie Thorne, spotted Selby's snooker ability and offered him free practice at his brother's snooker club. Selby took full advantage of this opportunity, practising in the evenings after school. He was abandoned by his mother at the age of eight and lost his father to cancer when he was 16. After his father's death, Selby contemplated suicide but was encouraged by his family friend and snooker coach, Alan Perkins, to devote himself to snooker.\n\nSelby joined the main professional tour two months after his father's death, having left school with no qualifications. His nickname, \"The Jester from Leicester\", was given to him by snooker compere Richard Beare because Selby liked to have \"a laugh and a joke\" with him.\n\n1998‚Äì2007\nSelby won the England under-15 championship in 1998 and joined the professional tour a year later in 1999, at the age of 16. In early 2002, he reached the semi-finals of the China Open, despite leaving his hotel room at 2 a.m instead of 2 p.m for one of his matches due to jetlag. In April 2003, aged 19, he reached his first ranking final at the Scottish Open, where he finished runner-up to David Gray. He earned himself a place in the top 32 for the first time.\n\n2007‚Äì08 season: first Masters title\nIn the 2007‚Äì08 season, Selby made it to the semi-finals in the 2007 Shanghai Masters, but was defeated by Dominic Dale, who went on to win the tournament. Selby also had a strong run in the UK Championship, reaching the semi-finals as well. He met the eventual winner of the event, Ronnie O'Sullivan, and led 7‚Äì5, but fell 7‚Äì8 behind before levelling the match at 8‚Äì8. O'Sullivan made a 147 break in the deciding frame to win 9‚Äì8.\n\n2008‚Äì09 season\nThe following season, Selby was defeated at the 2008 Shanghai Masters, once again in the semi-final stage by the event's eventual winner, this time Ricky Walden. Then at the beginning of the new year, he reached the final of the Masters again, where he was runner-up to Ronnie O'Sullivan, losing the match 8‚Äì10 after leading 7‚Äì5.\n\n2009‚Äì10 season: second Masters title\nSelby recovered from 4‚Äì8 behind to beat Jamie Cope 9‚Äì8 in the first round of the 2009 UK Championship. However, he was beaten in the quarter-finals 3‚Äì9 by Ronnie O'Sullivan. On 17 January 2010, having reached the final for the third time in as many years, he won his second Masters title, in a repeat of the previous year's final where he had lost to O'Sullivan. This time, after falling behind 6‚Äì9, with O'Sullivan needing one more frame for another victory, Selby took the next four frames to win the championship 10‚Äì9.\n\n2010‚Äì11 season\nIn July 2010, Selby won the Six-red World Championship in Bangkok, with an 8‚Äì6 victory over Ricky Walden in the final. At the 2011 China Open, he beat Tian Pengfei, Robert Milkins, Ali Carter, and home favourite Ding Junhui, but was defeated 8‚Äì10 by Judd Trump in the final. At the 2011 World Championship, he set the record for the most century breaks compiled in a world championship match when he made six in his second-round tie with Stephen Hendry.\n\n2011‚Äì12 season\nSelby started the season by winning the non-ranking Wuxi Classic with a 9‚Äì7 victory over Ali Carter. He won his second ranking event at the Shanghai Masters, where he defeated Mark Williams 10‚Äì9 in the final, winning the last three frames from 7‚Äì9 behind. With this victory, Selby replaced Williams as world number one, moving to the top of the world rankings for the first time in his career.\n\n2012‚Äì13 season: first UK Championship and third Masters titles\nSelby announced he felt \"90 per cent fit\" just before the start of the season, as he continued his recovery from the disc bulge in his neck. His first event was the Wuxi Classic where he played Barry Hawkins in the last 32; having been eliminated from the World Championship by Hawkins two months earlier, Selby this time won 5‚Äì2, and then whitewashed Jamie Cope 5‚Äì0 to set up a quarter-final match with in-form Stuart Bingham, but lost in the deciding frame 4‚Äì5.\n\n2013‚Äì14 season: first World Championship title\nIn the first ranking event of the season, Selby suffered a 3‚Äì5 defeat to Andrew Pagett in the qualifying rounds of the Wuxi Classic in China. The tournament was the first to use a new format requiring the top 16 players to compete in the qualifying rounds at most ranking events. In minor-ranking tournaments, he was runner-up at the Yixing Open, losing 1‚Äì4 to Joe Perry, and at the Rotterdam Open, where he lost 3‚Äì4 to Mark Williams. He won the Antwerp Open in November, defeating Ronnie O'Sullivan 4‚Äì3 in the final.\n\n2014‚Äì15 season\nAt the first ranking event of the season, the Wuxi Classic, Selby lost 3‚Äì5 to Liang Wenbo in the last 32. He won the minor-ranking Riga Open in August, defeating Mark Allen 4‚Äì3 in the final, but was defeated by Allen the following month in a final-frame decider in the semi-finals of the ranking Shanghai Masters tournament. He made an unexpected early exit from the ranking International Championship, when he was eliminated in the last 128 by 19-year-old tour rookie Oliver Lines, who had recovered from 0‚Äì4 behind to defeat him 6‚Äì4.\n\n2015‚Äì16 season: second World Championship title\nAt the 2015 International Championship, Selby reached the semi-finals but then lost 4‚Äì9 to John Higgins. He did not drop a frame in reaching the third round of the UK Championship where he defeated Jamie Jones 6‚Äì5, later acknowledging that his opponent had deserved to win the match. He then eliminated Dechawat Poomjaeng and Matthew Selt both 6‚Äì1, before being whitewashed 6‚Äì0 by Neil Robertson in the semi-finals.\n\n2016‚Äì17 season: third World Championship and second UK Championship titles\nSelby won his first ranking title of the season at the Paul Hunter Classic, beating Tom Ford 4‚Äì2 in the final. His semi-final against Stuart Bingham at the Shanghai Masters in September was a meeting between the top-two ranked players in the world, with Selby winning 6‚Äì5, having trailed 3‚Äì5. After taking an early 3‚Äì1 advantage over Ding Junhui in the final, he eventually lost the match 6‚Äì10. The following month, he was defeated 2‚Äì6 by Judd Trump in the semi-finals of the European Masters. He then won 9‚Äì3 in another semi-final encounter with Bingham, to reach the final of the International Championship in Daqing, China, winning the event for the first time by overcoming Ding 10‚Äì1.\n\n2017‚Äì18 season\nIn the 2017‚Äì18 snooker season, Selby was eliminated in the first round of the Hong Kong Masters after a 3‚Äì5 defeat to eventual champion Neil Robertson. His first ranking tournament of the season was the China Championship where he was defeated 4‚Äì5 by Zhou Yuelong in the second round. He failed to progress past the fourth round of the Paul Hunter Classic in defence of his title, losing 1‚Äì4 to eventual champion Michael White. He was defeated 2‚Äì5 by Lee Walker in the first round of the World Open, followed by a 2‚Äì4 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals of the European Masters, and a third-round exit at the English Open where he lost 1‚Äì4 to Xiao Guodong.\n\n2018‚Äì19 season\nAt the World Open in August, Selby lost 4‚Äì5 to world number 53 Noppon Saengkham in the last 16, losing the deciding frame by just three points. He won his 15th ranking title at the China Championship in September, defeating John Higgins 10‚Äì9 in a very close-fought final. He reached the semi-finals of the Northern Ireland Open in November, losing 5‚Äì6 to Ronnie O'Sullivan on the final black. He faced disappointments in other tournaments too, including an unexpected 3‚Äì6 loss to amateur James Cahill in the first round of the UK Championship. At the 2019 Masters, he lost 2‚Äì6 to Judd Trump in a \"nervy\" quarter-final, despite making a 110 break in the seventh frame of the match.\n\n2019‚Äì20 season\nIn the 2019‚Äì20 season, Selby reached the semi-finals of the International Championship, losing 4‚Äì9 to Judd Trump, and in defending his title at the China Championship, he lost 3‚Äì6 to Shaun Murphy, again in the semi-finals. He defeated David Gilbert 9‚Äì1 in the final to win the English Open. The following week, he lost 2‚Äì5 to Stuart Bingham in the last 16 of the World Open. In the Champion of Champions, he fell short 2‚Äì6 to Mark Allen in the group final. Despite recovering from 1‚Äì4 behind to tie at 4‚Äì4, he was defeated in the quarter-finals of the Northern Ireland Open by John Higgins. He took over six minutes to play one of his shots in the seventh frame of this match, leading to criticism from the Eurosport commentator Neal Foulds. He won the Scottish Open in December, beating Jack Lisowski 9‚Äì6 in the final. Having also won the English Open earlier in the season, he became the first player to win more than one tournament in the Home Nations Series in a single season.\n\n2020‚Äì21 season: fourth World Championship title\nAfter the delayed start to the new season, Selby won his 18th ranking title at the 2020 European Masters in September, defeating Martin Gould 9‚Äì8 in the final. The score was level at 4‚Äì4 by the end of the afternoon session, despite Selby taking an early 4‚Äì0 lead. The two players were evenly matched throughout the evening session, but Selby eventually won the match in the deciding final frame with a break of 72. The win moved him to a joint sixth place, alongside Neil Robertson, on the list of players with the most world ranking titles.\n\n2021‚Äì22 season\nIn contrast with his last two snooker years, this was a poor season for Selby. His first tournament was the 2021 British Open, where he was defeated in the second round. However, he returned to the top of the rankings for the first time since March 2019. After that, he suffered many early round exits, failed to qualify for tournaments, or withdrew from them. Selby said that snooker seemed \"irrelevant right now\" to him, as he spoke about his struggles with depression that was affecting his life and snooker form. He reached the semi-finals of the 2021 World Grand Prix in December, but was defeated 3‚Äì6 by Neil Robertson. The only other highlights of the season were his quarter-final appearances at the 2021 Champion of Champions, where he made his 700th century break in his opening match against David Gilbert, becoming the sixth player to reach that milestone, and the 2022 Masters, where Selby avenged his 6‚Äì3 loss to Stephen Maguire from last year's tournament by beating the Scotsman by the exact same scoreline, but then he suffered a 6‚Äì1 defeat by Barry Hawkins.\n\n2022‚Äì23 season\nCompared to his last season performance, Selby's form had improved, as he was in the final of the 2022 World Mixed Doubles, teamed up with Rebecca Kenna, though they ended up losing 2‚Äì4 to Neil Robertson and Mink Nutcharut. Then he reached the quarter-finals of the British, Northern Ireland, and Scottish Open, and the semi-finals of the 2022 Champion of Champions. After that, he won the English Open, defeating Mark King 9‚Äì6 in the final to claim his first ranking trophy since his World Championship win in 2021. He became the second player, after Judd Trump, to win four Home Nations tournaments. In the semi-final of the tournament, he also recorded his first win over Neil Robertson in two years, after seven consecutive losses to him, including this year's Northern Ireland and Scottish Open defeats. Towards the end of the season, Selby also won the inaugural 2023 WST Classic tournament, beating Pang Junxu 6‚Äì2 in the final. In the next event, the 2023 Tour Championship, he made it to the semi-final, losing 9‚Äì10 to Shaun Murphy, forcing a decider after being 6‚Äì9 down.\n\n2023‚Äì24 season\nAt the start of the season, Selby was a semi-finalist in the 2023 European Masters and the 2023 Shanghai Masters, losing 4‚Äì6 to Barry Hawkins in the former, and 7‚Äì10 to Ronnie O'Sullivan in the latter tournament. Then he reached the final of the 2023 British Open, facing Mark Williams and eventually losing to him 10‚Äì7, despite coming back from 5‚Äì1 down to 8‚Äì7 throughout the match. Going that far in the tournament took its toll, as in the next event, the 2023 English Open, Selby won his held-over qualifying match, but then he lost 4‚Äì2 to world number 104 Martin O'Donnell in the last 64, having played nine matches in nine days altogether. He also exited in the last 64 round at the following 2023 Wuhan Open, losing 4‚Äì5 to Xu Si. His last notable result for the calendar year was reaching the quarter-finals of the 2023 UK Championship, where he lost 3‚Äì6 to Judd Trump.\n\n2024‚Äì25 season\nIn September, Selby reached the quarter-finals at the English Open, where he suffered a shock 4‚Äì5 loss to world number 77 Ishpreet Singh Chadha. The following week, he won the British Open, defeating John Higgins 10‚Äì5 in the final to claim his first ranking tournament title since March 2023.\n\nPerformance and Rankings Timeline\nBelow is a list of competition results for professional seasons starting from 1999:\n\nCareer Finals\nBelow is a list of professional finals played by Selby:\n\nRanking Finals: 35 (23 titles)\n\nMinor-Ranking Finals: 10 (7 titles)\n\nNon-Ranking Finals: 19 (11 titles)\n\nPro-Am Finals: 1\n\nTeam Finals: 2\n\nAmateur Finals: 1 (1 title)\n\nPool Career\nAs well as being a professional snooker player, Selby is also adept at playing pool, specifically blackball (also known as English eight-ball) and Chinese eight-ball.

and former photo editor, best known for her experience with the socialite Anna Sorokin, who impersonated a wealthy heiress and defrauded numerous individuals, including Williams.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRachel DeLoache Williams was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to two clinical psychologists. She grew up in a family that valued education and encouraged her to pursue her interests. Williams developed a passion for art and writing from a young age and was particularly drawn to the creative fields of studio art and English.\n\nWilliams attended Kenyon College in Ohio, where she graduated cum laude in 2010 with degrees in English and studio art. During her time at college, she interned at various organizations in New York City, including Art + Commerce, Harper's Bazaar, and Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. These experiences not only honed her skills but also provided her with valuable connections in the industry.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter graduating from college, Williams began working at Vanity Fair, where she spent nearly a decade in the photo department. She started as an assistant and later became an editor and producer, working alongside renowned photographers such as Annie Leibovitz and Mark Seliger. Williams was responsible for producing photoshoots with high-profile subjects, including Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Bruce Springsteen, Amy Schumer, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Caitlyn Jenner, Rihanna, and Patti Smith.\n\nDuring her time at Vanity Fair, Williams developed a reputation as a skilled and dedicated producer, known for her attention to detail and ability to work under pressure. Her work on the magazine's photo shoots was widely praised, and she became a respected figure in the industry.\n\nHowever, in 2019, Williams was laid off due to company-wide restructuring. She has since worked as a freelance creative producer, using her skills and experience to take on various projects and collaborations.\n\n**Ordeal with Anna Sorokin**\n\nWilliams met Anna Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey, through friends in February 2016. At the time, Sorokin was impersonating a wealthy heiress, claiming to have a trust fund worth millions of dollars. Williams and Sorokin became friends, and Sorokin invited Williams to join her on a week-long trip to Marrakesh in 2017.\n\nDuring the trip, Sorokin's credit card stopped working, and Williams was left with a $62,000 bill for flights, meals, and the La Mamounia hotel stay. Sorokin promised to wire Williams the money the following week, but she never did. Williams was forced to cover the costs, eventually paying off the debt herself.\n\nWilliams reported the incident to the New York City Police Department and the New York County District Attorney. In 2017, she helped law enforcement find and arrest Sorokin in Los Angeles, and later testified against her in court. Although Sorokin was found guilty of various charges, including theft of services and grand larceny, she was not found guilty of stealing from Williams.\n\n**Working with Law Enforcement**\n\nWilliams's experience with Sorokin led her to work closely with law enforcement to bring the socialite to justice. In 2017, she helped the police find and arrest Sorokin, who was eventually charged with various crimes.\n\nWilliams also testified against Sorokin in court, providing evidence of her crimes and helping to secure her conviction. Although Sorokin was not found guilty of stealing from Williams, the incident had a significant impact on her life and career.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nIn 2018, Williams published an article for Vanity Fair about her experience with Sorokin, detailing the events that led up to the socialite's arrest and conviction. The article sparked widespread interest and attention, with many people expressing sympathy for Williams and outrage at Sorokin's actions.\n\nIn 2019, Williams authored the book \"My Friend Anna: The True Story of a Fake Heiress,\" published by Gallery Publishing Group. The book became a New York Times bestseller, providing a detailed and intimate account of her experience with Sorokin.\n\n**Netflix Portrayal**\n\nIn 2022, Netflix released the drama series \"Inventing Anna,\" which was based on Williams's experience with Sorokin. The series was created by Shonda Rhimes and starred Katie Lowes as Williams. However, the show's portrayal of Williams was widely criticized, with many people accusing it of villainizing her and making her out to be a selfish and entitled character.\n\nWilliams herself was critical of the show, calling it a \"dangerous distortion\" of the truth. She pointed out that the show's title card, which reads \"This story is completely true, except for all the parts that aren't,\" gave the show enough credibility to make people believe the fictional elements. Williams argued that the show was effectively running a con woman's PR campaign, using her story to attract attention and viewers.\n\n**Response and Lawsuit**\n\nWilliams's response to the show was met with widespread attention and interest. Many people expressed sympathy for her and outrage at the show's portrayal of her. Williams further argued that the show was a shell game that proffered irresistible thrills for low stakes, while a sleight of hand carried out the high-roller business unseen.\n\nIn an essay for Air Mail, Williams wrote that \"for Sorokin and Netflix alike, attention is stock-in-trade.\" She argued that the show was effectively running a con woman's PR campaign, using her story to attract attention and viewers. Williams also pointed out that the show's portrayal of her was a distortion of the truth, and that she was not the selfish and entitled character that the show made her out to be.\n\nOverall, Williams's experience with Sorokin and the Netflix show \"Inventing Anna\" has had a significant impact on her life and career. She has spoken out against the show's portrayal of her, and has argued that it is a distortion of the truth.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

underlying risk factors such as lymphedema or radiation therapy [citation needed]\n\n\nLymphedema associated angiosarcoma\nAlso called Stewart-Treves syndrome, it is a lymphangiosarcoma resulting from chronic lymphedema, swelling due to the build up of lymphatic fluid It typically happens in the breast following a mastectomy that removes the lymph nodes of the breast However it can happen anywhere [3] [7]\n\n\nParenchymal angiosarcoma\nAngiosarcoma in parenchymal organs such as the liver, breast or heart These makes up about 40% of angiosarcoma [citation needed]\n\n\nPrimary breast angiosarcoma\nThis refers to angiosarcoma of the breast without underlying causes such as radiation therapy or lymphedema It is rare and makes up only 0.04% of breast tumors and 8% of breast sarcomas It is very aggressive, usually presents in younger females and is often noticeable by a palpable mass Prognosis is poor with a five-year survival between 8 and 50% [7]\n\n\nSecondary breast angiosarcoma\nThese are angiosarcoma that arise in the breast from underlying causes such as lymphedema or radiation, usually from radiation therapy for breast cancer The link between radiation therapy and angiosarcoma has been disputed by some who profess the angiosarcoma is caused by concurrent lymphedema Secondary breast angiosarcoma tends to have a bad prognosis Radiation-associated angiosarcoma has a five-year survival of 10 to 54% Distant metastases are present in 27‚Äì42% of individuals and is associated with a far worse prognosis Other prognostic factors include size of tumor, age and how much can be removed by surgery [3] [7]\n\n\nPrimary brain angiosarcoma\nPrimary brain angiosarcoma are angiosarcoma that arise in the brain (i.e not metastasised from elsewhere) They are exceedingly rare with only a few cases reported Imaging is non specific and differential diagnosis includes most other brain tumors such as gliomas or cavernomas, [3] requiring biopsy to confirm diagnosis, usually after surgery Prognosis is generally poor with a median survival rate of eight months However it varies greatly depending on whether or not the tumor has metastasised, some individuals may be rid of the disease following surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy [11]\n\n\nPrimary cardiac angiosarcoma\nPrimary cardiac angiosarcoma is an angiosarcoma that arises in the heart Despite being very rare they are the most common malignant primary heart tumor with 10‚Äì25% [12] [3] of cases being angiosarcomas Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain (46% [12]), hypotension and syncope Superior vena cava syndrome is reportedly a complication of cardiac angiosarcoma [7] Due to the non-specificity of symptoms and rarity of the disease it is often missed by doctors and initial diagnosis may be delayed A 2012 study reported that 56% of patients presented with pericardial effusion with or without cardiac tamponade [12] The most common finding on imaging is cardiomegaly Prognosis is generally very poor with a mean survival rate of three months to four years following diagnosis [7] Metastasis at time of diagnosis is common [12]\n\n\nPrimary liver angiosarcoma\nPrimary angiosarcoma of the liver is the third most common type of liver cancer however it only makes up 0.1‚Äì2.0% of all liver cancers It is rapidly fatal with most individuals dying within six months or a year even with surgical resection Despite being associated with arsenic, vinyl chloride, thorotrast and other chemicals, 75% of liver angiosarcomas have no known cause Men are more commonly affected in a ratio of 3‚Äì4:1 however in children girls are more often affected If symptomatic it often presents with non-specific liver related symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, unintended weight loss and distension [13]\n\n\nDeep soft tissue angiosarcoma\nAngiosarcoma in the deep soft tissue such as adipose tissue, ligaments or muscles These make up about 10% of angiosarcoma [citation needed]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nCutaneous angiosarcoma may initially look like a bruise or a purplish-red papule It may look like a benign tumor which can delay correct diagnosis and treatment Fungation, ulceration and bleeding may develop [3]\n\n\nCauses\nAngiosarcoma develops when damage to the DNA of endothelial cells causes them to divide uncontrollably and prevents programmed death This allows them to grow into a mass invading other parts of the body and consuming its resources If part of the mass breaks off and enters the circulatory or lymphatic system (which is very common due to angiosarcomas arising from the lining of said systems) it allows them to lodge elsewhere in the body This process is called metastasis and is a negative prognostic factor [14] The underlying causes of DNA damage is not understood but several risk factors are widely accepted [citation needed]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of angiosarcoma can be difficult due to its asymptomatic nature or non-specific symptoms Initial diagnosis is typically done by MRI, CT or ultrasound scan, however it is typically difficult to discern if a mass is an angiosarcoma or other type of tumor such as a melanoma or carcinoma This means that while the initial diagnosis is typically done via imaging, conclusive diagnosis has to be performed via biopsy and subsequent histological and immunohistochemical analysis [5]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nAngiosarcomas are rare with one in a million people being diagnosed with it each year in the US [4] Older adults are more commonly affected and there is no gender bias, [1] except in angiosarcoma of the liver where males are affected in a ratio of 3-4:1 [13] and cutaneous angiosarcoma where males are again affected more commonly, particularly elderly white men [3] [7]\n\n\nOther animals\nIn dogs, hemangiosarcoma is relatively common with the golden retriever, boxer and labrador retriever at higher risk of the disease than other breeds It

She was raised as a Roman Catholic in the mill village of Hadfield, where she attended St Charles Roman Catholic Primary School. Mantel's early life was marked by a strong sense of community and a deep connection to her Catholic heritage.\n\n**Literary Career**\n\nMantel's first novel, _Every Day Is Mother's Day_, was published in 1985, and its sequel, _Vacant Possession_, a year later.

ruling the country from 1990 to 2019 [26] During this time, international observers did not recognize any of the elections in Kazakhstan as being free or fair, [26] with Nazarbayev ruling the nation through authoritarianism, nepotism and detaining opponents, according to The Daily Telegraph and many other sources [50]\n\n\nZhanaozen strike\nZhanaozen, an oil-producing city in Mangystau Region, has had a history of labour strikes and demonstrations In 2011, a riot broke out in the city amidst the 20th anniversary of Independence Day that led to 16 deaths and 100 injuries according to official numbers Kazakh security forces opened fire on protestors who demanded better working conditions During that time, the price for a litre of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a mix of butane and propane that is a common vehicle fuel in Zhanaozen, was around 30‚Äì35 tenge and has repeatedly risen since then.\n\n\nAims\nAims of the protests reported after the protests had started included calls for major political changes According to Darkhan Sharipov of the Oyan, Qazaqstan activist group, protestors wanted \"real political reforms\" and \"fair elections\", and were angry about \"corruption

morning of 2 January, residents in the city of Zhanaozen in Mangystau Region blocked roads in protest against an increase in gas prices [60] The demonstrators called on the akim of the region, Nurlan Nogaev, and Zhanaozen akim Maksat Ibagarov to take measures in stabilising prices and preventing fuel shortages [60] The residents were met with acting Zhanaozen akim Galym Baijanov who advised the

as well as Kazakh Gas Processing Plant director Nakbergen Tulepov arrived at the square and pledged for the gas prices to be reduced down to 85‚Äì90 tenge, which failed to please the demonstrators

cars and setting some of them ablaze [68] [69] Armoured military vehicles were spotted throughout the streets of Almaty during the night of unrest which videos on social media later showed them fleeing by chasing protesters [70]\n\n\n5 January\nAt 04:00, Almaty akim Bakhytzhan Sagintayev made a video address to the residents, asserting that the situation in the city had been brought under

analyst, said that the Kazakh government would mainly use force to respond to protests, stating: \"The authorities are trying everything to calm things down, with a mix of promises and threats, but so far it's not working.¬†..

Nursultan Nazarbayev became Kazakhstan's first president after the dissolution, ruling the country from 1990 to 2019. During this time, international observers did not recognize any of the elections in Kazakhstan as being free or fair, with Nazarbayev ruling the nation through authoritarianism, nepotism, and detaining opponents, according to The Daily Telegraph and many other sources.\n\n## Zhanaozen Strike\n\nZhanaozen, an oil-producing city in Mangystau Region, has had a history of labor strikes and demonstrations. In 2011, a riot broke out in the city amidst the 20th anniversary of Independence Day that led to 16 deaths and 100 injuries, according to official numbers. Kazakh security forces opened fire on protestors who demanded better working conditions. During that time, the price for a liter of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a mix of butane and propane that is a common vehicle fuel in Zhanaozen, was around 30-35 tenge and has repeatedly risen since then.\n\n## Aims\n\nAims of the protests reported after the protests had started included calls for major political changes. According to Darkhan Sharipov of the Oyan, Qazaqstan activist group, protestors wanted \"real political reforms\" and \"fair elections,\" and were angry about \"corruption and nepotism.\" According to The New York Times, protestors wanted heads of local governments (akims) to be directly elected rather than appointed by the president.\n\n## Protests\n\nOn the morning of 2 January, residents in the city of Zhanaozen in Mangystau Region blocked roads in protest against an increase in gas prices. The demonstrators called on the akim of the region, Nurlan Nogaev, and Zhanaozen akim Maksat Ibagarov to take measures in stabilizing prices and preventing fuel shortages. The residents were met with acting Zhanaozen akim Galym Baijanov who advised the crowd to write a complaint letter to the city administration in which the protestors recalled that their complaints were supposedly ignored by the city officials.\n\n## 2 January\n\nOn the morning of 2 January, residents in the city of Zhanaozen in Mangystau Region blocked roads in protest against an increase in gas prices.

As other residents joined the crowd by the afternoon, an estimated 1,000 people were at the square, chanting and demanding direct elections of local leaders. The police officers, while standing at the perimeter of the square during the demonstration, did not intervene. Mangystau akim Nurlan Nogaev and Zhanaozen akim Maksat Ibagarov as well as Kazakh Gas Processing Plant director Nakbergen Tulepov arrived at the square and pledged for the gas prices to be reduced down to 85-90 tenge, which failed to please the demonstrators. Nogaev and his subordinates were forced to flee the square by the angry crowd.\n\n## 4 January\n\nOn the night of 4 January, around 1,000 marched to the Republic Square in Almaty which was cordoned off by the police. From there, clashes broke out between both parties with the security forces using stun grenades and tear gas to disperse the protesters who in-turn vandalized police cars and setting some of them ablaze. Armoured military vehicles were spotted throughout the streets of Almaty during the night of unrest which videos on social media later showed them fleeing by chasing protesters.\n\n## 5 January\n\nAt 04:00, Almaty akim Bakhytzhan Sagintayev made a video address to the residents, asserting that the situation in the city had been brought under control. From there, he accused of \"provocateurs from within and outside\" being behind in destabilization and extremist actions and urged people not to succumb to \"provocations and lawlessness.\" In spite of Sagintayev's remarks, explosions of stun grenades were continued to be heard throughout Almaty in early morning with protesters setting up barricades and clashing with the National Guard in central streets.\n\n## 6 January\n\nOil production at Kazakhstan's highest-producing oil field Tengiz was reduced. US oil producer Chevron Corporation holds a 50% stake in Tengizchevroil (TCO) which operates the Tengiz oil field.\n\n## 7 January\n\nOn 7 January, as a concession, President Tokayev said that the vehicle fuel price caps of 50 tenge per liter had been restored for six months.\n\n## 8 January\n\nProtests continued in Zhanaozen.\n\n## 9 January\n\nOn 9 January, the interior ministry, said initial estimates put property damage at about 175 million euros, adding that more than 100 businesses and banks had been attacked and looted and about 400 vehicles destroyed.

Interior Minister Erlan Turgumbayev held a press conference, saying, \"Today the situation is stabilised in all regions of the country... the counterterror operation is continuing in a bid to re-establish order in the country.\"\n\n## 10 January\n\nOn 10 January, the government declared a day of mourning for the victims of the protests. Kazakhstan's Interior Ministry reported that a total of 7,939 people have been detained across the country. The National Security Committee, Kazakhstan's counterintelligence and anti-terrorism agency, said that the situation in the country had \"stabilized and is under control.\" Tokayev called the protests a \"coup attempt.\" The government also stated that \"foreign-trained Islamist radicals\" were among those who had attacked government buildings and security forces in the last week and that police had then detained almost 8,000 people to bring the situation under control.\n\n## 11 January\n\nOn 11 January, in a speech to an online meeting of the CSTO military alliance by video link, Tokayev said that order had now been restored in Kazakhstan and called the protests over. He announced that the CSTO had completed its mission in Kazakhstan and would begin withdrawing from the country on January 13 and would be fully withdrawn in the next 10 days. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in defending Kazakhstan from what he described as a \"foreign-backed terrorist uprising,\" and promised leaders of other ex-Soviet states that a Moscow-led alliance (CSTO) would protect them too.\n\n## Violence\n\nOn 5 January, authorities in Almaty reported that over 400 businesses were damaged from the protests and that 200 people had been arrested; police in Atyrau fired into protesters which resulted in the death of at least one individual. The government reported on 5 January that eight law enforcement personnel were killed and 317 were wounded.

On 6 January, dozens of protestors were killed during an operation, while the number of security forces killed rose to 18. According to local authorities, two of the security officers were found decapitated.\n\n## Analysis\n\nDossym Satpaev, a Kazakh political analyst, said that the Kazakh government would mainly use force to respond to protests, stating: \"The authorities are trying everything to calm things down, with a mix of promises and threats, but so far it's not working... There will be imitations of dialogue but essentially the regime will respond with force because they have no other tools.\" Political scientist Arkady Dubnov of the Carnegie Moscow Center observed that such protests were unsettling for the Russian government, with Dubnov saying: \"There is no doubt that the Kremlin would not want to see an example of such a regime beginning to talk to the opposition and conceding to their demands.\"\n\n## Economic Impact\n\nAs Kazakhstan produces more than 40% of the world's uranium, uranium prices rose after the protests erupted. Canadian uranium company Cameco stated that \"any disruption in Kazakhstan could of course be a significant catalyst in the uranium market If nothing else, it's a reminder for utilities that an over-reliance on any one source of supply is risky.\" The internet blackout also impacted cryptocurrency mining operations, with the global cryptocurrency computational capacity (hashrate) dropping by 12 per cent Prior to the protests, Kazakhstan accounted for around 18 per cent of global hashrate for Bitcoin, due to the fact that neighbouring China in 2021 banned the mining of cryptocurrencies and many of the cryptominers moved to Kazakhstan.\n\n## Global Market\n\nAs Kazakhstan produces more than 40% of the world's uranium, uranium prices rose after the protests erupted.

at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the

events shortly before his 15th birthday [11] He did not have much success at tournaments that were Grade 2 and above until the following year when he reached back-to-back doubles finals with Spencer Papa at the Grade A Copa Gerdau and the Grade 1 USTA International Spring Championships [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAt the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different

He has won two ATP Masters 1000 titles and has reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2. Zverev has also won the gold medal in singles at the 2021 Olympic Games and has reached the final of the 2020 US Open.\n\nEarly life and background\nZverev was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany to Russian parents Irina Zvereva and Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev. His older brother, Mischa, was also a professional tennis player. Both of Zverev's parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father, ranked as high as No 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union.\n\nThey moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the country.\n\nJunior career\nZverev played his first junior match in January 2011 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Poland. He is a former world No 1 junior. He entered his first event on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior circuit in early 2011 when he was 13. Near the beginning of 2012, Zverev won his first ITF title at the Fujairah Junior Championships, a low-level Grade 4 tournament in the United Arab Emirates. He would pick up a lower level Grade 5 title at the Oman International Junior 2 a few weeks later, which led him to begin competing in higher-level events shortly before his 15th birthday.\n\nProfessional career\nAt the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the 2011 Moselle Open on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches. He won his professional main draw debut against compatriot Christian Lichtenegger at a Futures event in Germany in August 2012. At the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner-up to Florian Reynet at an ITF $10K event in Florida. Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro-level final that year, but he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut at his hometown tournament, the International German Open.\n\nHe also made his ATP Challenger Tour debut, losing to M√°ximo Gonz√°lez at the Meerbusch Challenger in August.

Seeded third at the Australian Open, he reached the fourth round where he was defeated by 14th seed, Denis Shapovalov, in straight sets.\n\nPlaying style\nZverev is an aggressive baseliner. He often stands way back behind the baseline and aims to hit powerful groundstrokes either for winners or to wear down his opponent. Although his height slows him down on the court, it also adds to his reach and gives him the ability to get more balls back in play. Novak Djokovic has commented, \"He moves well for his height.\" His backhand, in particular, is regarded as his strength and one of the best in the game. He can generate a lot of power off it with high accuracy, and his ability to absorb pace makes it one of the best shots in the modern game for rally tolerance. He often uses a semi-open stance and employs a western grip on his forehand. He has a continental-eastern grip on his backhand. Zverev can also slice his backhands that require a low centre of gravity, despite his height. He is often criticized for being too passive and having a weaker forehand than that of other top 10 players.\n\nCoaching team\nZverev has been coached by his parents since he was very young. His mother was initially his primary coach before his father took over at some point. Zverev made the decision to hire former world No 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Washington Open in the summer of 2017. He fired Ferrero following the 2018 Australian Open after Ferrero criticized the rest of Zverev's coaching team. Ivan Lendl, another former world No 1, joined Zverev's team in August 2018. They split up in July 2019 due to disappointing results and personal differences. Zverev has stated that Lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching. In 2020, Zverev started to work with former World Number 3 and 2013 French Open Finalist David Ferrer. They announced their split in January 2021.\n\nControversies\nIn June 2020, following Novak Djokovic's Adria Tour, several players tested positive for COVID-19. Due to his possible exposure, Zverev announced on Twitter that he would be following self-isolation procedures after testing negative for the virus. However, one week later, Zverev was captured on video at a party in Monaco, prompting criticism from fellow tennis players Nick Kyrgios and Katie Boulter.\n\nFirst allegation of domestic abuse\nIn October 2020, Zverev's ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, in an article in Racquet magazine by journalist Ben Rothenberg, accused Zverev of physically and emotionally abusing her over the course of their relationship. Sharypova named multiple instances where Zverev allegedly became violent towards her, including punching her in the face during an argument that took place in the pair's hotel room while Zverev was competing at the 2019 Laver Cup. Zverev denied the allegations and issued a statement after Sharypova's initial accusations: \"I very much regret that she makes such statements. Because the accusations are simply not true.\"\n\n2022 Mexican Open default\nAfter a first-round doubles loss at the 2022 Mexican Open, Zverev repeatedly struck umpire Alessandro Germani's chair with his racket, believing that Germani had incorrectly called a ball out during a tiebreak. Zverev was subsequently defaulted from the tournament, forfeiting all points and prize money that he had won thus far. He received the maximum fine of $40,000 by the ATP, an additional $25,000 fine, and a suspended eight-week ban. He was also placed on probation for one year. Zverev later issued an apology on social media.\n\nSecond allegation of domestic abuse\nAbout six months after the ATP declined to take action against Zverev, in July 2023, allegations from a second woman became public through a court filing. A penalty order in a Berlin criminal court was requested over alleged bodily harm against Brenda Patea, Zverev's ex-girlfriend and the mother of his daughter. On 2 October 2023, the court issued a penalty order against Zverev for \"physically abusing and damaging the health of a woman during an argument in Berlin in May 2020.\" The order included a fine of ‚Ç¨450,000. Zverev lodged an appeal against the order which, under German law, results in a public trial.\n\nAwards and recognition\nZverev has received the following awards:\n\n* Youngest player to win an ATP

The film follows a young woman named Rose Cotter, a therapist who becomes embroiled in a mysterious and terrifying situation involving an entity that appears to her as various smiling people.\n\n**Plot**\n\nAt a psychiatric ward, therapist Rose Cotter meets graduate student Laura Weaver, who explains that she recently witnessed her professor kill himself. Laura claims to be terrorized by an invisible entity that appears as various smiling people and has foretold her death. She begins screaming and choking, prompting Rose to call for help; Laura suddenly calms down and smiles uncannily, then fatally slits her own throat, terrifying Rose.\n\nAs Rose tries to make sense of the events, she begins to experience similar visions and becomes increasingly unhinged. She discovers that Laura's death is just the beginning of a series of tragic events, all connected to an ancient and malevolent force that seems to be manipulating people into harming themselves. Rose must confront her own dark past and the entity's sinister presence to prevent further tragedy.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film stars Sosie Bacon as Rose Cotter, a young and ambitious therapist struggling to cope with her own personal demons. Jessie T. Usher and Kyle Gallner play supporting roles as Rose's colleagues and friends, while Caitlin Stasey plays the role of Laura Weaver, the graduate student who sets off the chain of events.\n\n**Production**\n\nPrincipal photography for Smile began on October 11, 2021, in New Jersey, with filming locations including the city of Hoboken, the Murphy Varnish Lofts, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, and Lewis Morris Park in Morristown. The film was shot on a relatively low budget, with a reported $20 million expenditure.\n\n**Development and Casting**\n\nSmile was written and directed by Parker Finn, who drew inspiration from his own experiences as a therapist and a horror fan. Finn has stated that he was influenced by classic horror films such as The Exorcist and The Shining, as well as more modern works like It Follows and The Babadook. The film's cast was assembled through a combination of auditions and recommendations from industry professionals.\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming for Smile took place over several weeks in New Jersey, with a team of around 50 crew members and a cast of around 20 actors. The film's cinematographer, Ryan Samul, worked closely with Finn to create a distinctive and unsettling visual style, using a combination of natural lighting and practical effects to create the film's eerie atmosphere.\n\n**Release**\n\nSmile had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2022, followed by screenings at Beyond Fest on September 27. The film was released in the United States on September 30, 2022, by Paramount Pictures.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its tense atmosphere and standout performances. However, some critics were less impressed, citing the film's predictable plot and lack of originality.\n\n**Home Media**\n\nSmile was released for VOD platforms, including Paramount+, on November 15, 2022, followed by a DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD release on December 13, 2022. The home media release includes a range of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with the cast and crew, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe trailer and poster for Smile were released on June 22, 2022, generating significant buzz and attention from horror fans. Paramount spent an estimated $50 million promoting the film, with a focus on social media and online marketing.\n\n**Reception**\n\nSmile received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its tense atmosphere and standout performances.

The film grossed $105.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $111.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $217.4 million.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nSmile was a commercial success, grossing over $217 million worldwide. The film's box office performance was boosted by positive word-of-mouth and strong reviews from critics. Paramount Pictures reported that the film's net profit was $101 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nSmile received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising its tense atmosphere and standout performances.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B‚Äì\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an overall 69% positive score, with 53% saying they would definitely recommend it.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nSmile was nominated for Best Movie and Most Frightened Performance (Sosie Bacon) at the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards. The film was also nominated for Best Horror Film at the 51st Saturn Awards.\n\n**Future**\n\nFollowing the release of Smile, writer and director Parker Finn stated that he had intentionally left portions of the first movie ambiguous, with various plotlines unresolved. Finn expressed interest in exploring those details in a potential sequel film, while keeping the mysterious nature of the entity intact. A follow-up movie would be notably different from the first, with Finn stating that he believed \"there is still a lot of interesting stuff to explore in the world of Smile... I'd want to make sure that there's a new, exciting, fresh way into it that the audience isn't anticipating. I also want to find some new ways to scare them and unnerve them.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Smile_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nAt a psychiatric ward, therapist Rose Cotter meets graduate student Laura Weaver, [a] who explains that she recently witnessed her professor kill himself Laura claims to be terrorized by an invisible entity that appears as various smiling people and has foretold her death She begins screaming and choking, prompting Rose to call for help;

Tamil literature of the Sangam period (c 600 BCE), [b] oral traditions, religious texts, temple and copperplate inscriptions Later medieval Cholas also claimed a long and ancient lineage The Cholas are mentioned in Ashokan Edicts (inscribed 273 BCE‚Äì232 BCE) as one of the Mauryan empire's neighbours to the South (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13), [5] [6] who, thought not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him [c] There are also brief references to the Chola country and its towns, ports and commerce in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Periplus Maris Erythraei), and in the slightly later work of the geographer Ptolemy MahƒÅva·πÉsa, a Buddhist text written down during the 5th century CE, recounts several conflicts between the inhabitants of Sri Lanka and Cholas in the 1st century BCE [8]\n\n\nHistory\nThe history of the Cholas falls into four periods: the Early Cholas of the Sangam literature, the interregnum between the fall of the Sangam Cholas and the rise of the Imperial medieval Cholas under Vijayalaya (c.¬†848), the dynasty of Vijayalaya, and finally the Later Chola dynasty of Kulothunga Chola¬†I from the third quarter of the 11th century [d]\n\n\nEarly Cholas\nThe earliest Chola kings for whom there is tangible evidence are mentioned in the Sangam literature Scholars generally agree that this literature belongs to the late centuries before the common era and the early centuries of the common era [14] The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived It records the names of the kings and the princes, and of the poets who extolled them [15]\n\n\nInterregnum\nThere is not much information about the transition period of around three centuries from the end of the Sangam age (c.¬†300) to that in which the Pandyas and Pallavas dominated the Tamil country An obscure dynasty, the Kalabhras invaded Tamil country, displaced the existing kingdoms and ruled during that time [24] [25] [26] They were displaced by the Pallava dynasty and the Pandyan dynasty in the 6th century [18] [27] Little is known of the fate of the Cholas in Tamil land during the succeeding three centuries The Cholas disappeared from the Tamil land almost completely in this debacle, though a branch of them can be traced towards the close of the fifth century CE in Rayalaseema‚Äîthe Telugu-Cholas, whose kingdom is mentioned by Yuan Chwang in the seventh-century CE [28] Due to Kalabhra invasion and the growing power of Pallavas, Cholas migrated from their native land Uraiyur to Telugu country and ruled from there as chieftains of Pallavas at least since 540 CE Several Telugu Chola families like Renati Cholas, Pottapi Cholas, Nellore Cholas, Velanati Cholas, Nannuru Cholas, Kondidela Cholas existed and claimed descent from ancient Tamil king Karikala Chola [29] The Cholas had to wait for another three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya Chola belonging to Pottapi Chola family in the second quarter of the ninth century to re-establish their dynasty as independent rulers by overthrowing Pallavas and Pandyas [30] As per inscriptions found in and around Thanjavur, Thanjavur kingdom was ruled by Mutharaiyars / Muthurajas for three centuries Their reign was ended by Vijayalaya Chola who captured Thanjavur from Ilango Mutharaiyar between 848 and 851 CE   \n\n\nImperial Cholas\nThe Chola Empire was founded in 848 CE by Vijayalaya, a descendant of Early Cholas [36]\n\n\nOverseas conquests\nDuring the reign of Rajaraja Chola¬†I and his successors Rajendra Chola¬†I, Virarajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola¬†I the Chola armies invaded Sri Lanka, the Maldives and parts of Southeast Asia like Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Thailand [55] of the Srivijaya Empire in the 11th century Rajaraja Chola¬†I launched several naval campaigns that resulted in the capture of Sri Lanka, Maldives and the Malabar Coast [56] In 1025, Rajendra Chola launched naval raids on the ports of Srivijaya and against the Burmese kingdom of Pegu [57] A Chola inscription states that he captured or plundered 14 places, which have been identified with Palembang, Tambralinga and Kedah among others [58] A second invasion was led by Virarajendra Chola, who conquered Kedah in Malaysia of Srivijaya in the late 11th century [59] Chola invasion ultimately failed to install direct administration over Srivijaya, since the invasion was short and only meant to plunder the wealth of Srivijaya However, this invasion gravely weakened the Srivijayan hegemony and enabled the formation of regional kingdoms Although the invasion was not followed by direct Cholan occupation and the region was unchanged geographically, there were huge consequences in trade Tamil traders encroached on the Srivijayan realm traditionally controlled by Malay traders and the Tamil guilds' influence increased on the Malay Peninsula and the north coast of Sumatra.\n\n\nLater Cholas (1070‚Äì1279)\nMarital and political alliances between the Eastern Chalukyas began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi Rajaraja Chola's daughter married Chalukya prince Vimaladitya [60] and Rajendra Chola's daughter Ammanga Devi was married to the Eastern Chalukya prince Rajaraja Narendra [61] Virarajendra Chola's son, Athirajendra Chola, was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070, and Kulothunga Chola¬†I, the son of Ammanga Devi and Rajaraja Narendra, ascended the Chola throne Thus began the Later Chola dynasty [62]\n\n\nDecline\nThe setbacks suffered during the final years of Kulothunga I left a somewhat diminished empire Kulothunga's successors Vikrama Chola (1118‚Äì1135 CE) and Kulothunga Chola II (1133‚Äì1150 CE) were capable and compassionate leaders who took care not to involve their subjects in unnecessary and unwinnable wars [66] Rajaraja II (1146‚Äì1173 CE), Rajadhiraja II (1166‚Äì1178 CE) and Kulothunga Chola III (1178‚Äì1218 CE) took active roles in the politics of the emerging revival of the Pandyas [67] Meanwhile, the Chola succession was getting murkier and murkier with disputes and intrigues during the periods of Rajadhiraja II and Kulothunga III [68]\n\n\nAdministration and society\nAccording to Tamil tradition, the Chola country comprised the region that includes the modern-day Tiruchirapalli District, Tiruvarur District, Nagapattinam District, Ariyalur District, Perambalur district, Pudukkottai district, Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu and Karaikal District The river Kaveri and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the sea, unbroken by major hills or valleys The river, which is also known as the Ponni (Golden) river, had a special place in the culture of Cholas The annual floods in the Kaveri marked an occasion for celebration, known as Adiperukku, in which the whole nation took part [citation needed]\n\n\nChola

followers of Hinduism They were not swayed by the rise of Buddhism and Jainism as were the kings of the Pallava and Pandya dynasties Kocengannan, an Early Chola, was celebrated in both Sangam

Ponniyin Selvan (The son of Ponni), a historical novel in Tamil written by Kalki Krishnamurthy [105] Written in five volumes, this narrates the story of Rajaraja Chola, dealing with the events leading up to the ascension of Uttama Chola to the Chola throne Kalki had used the confusion in the succession to the Chola throne after the demise of Parantaka Chola¬†II [106] The book was serialised in the

leaders who took care not to involve their subjects in unnecessary and unwinnable wars [66] Rajaraja II (1146‚Äì1173 CE), Rajadhiraja II (1166‚Äì1178 CE) and Kulothunga Chola III (1178‚Äì1218 CE) took active roles in the politics of the emerging revival of the Pandyas [67] Meanwhile, the Chola succession was getting murkier and murkier with disputes and intrigues during the periods of Rajadhiraja II and Kulothunga III [68]\n\n\nAdministration and society\nAccording to Tamil tradition, the Chola country comprised the region that includes the modern-day Tiruchirapalli District, Tiruvarur District, Nagapattinam District, Ariyalur District, Perambalur district, Pudukkottai district, Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu and Karaikal District The river Kaveri and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the sea, unbroken by major hills or valleys The river, which is also known as the Ponni (Golden) river, had a special place in the culture of Cholas The annual floods in the Kaveri marked an occasion for celebration, known as Adiperukku, in which the whole nation took part [citation needed]\n\n\nChola territory\nAccording to Tamil tradition, the Chola country comprised the region that includes the modern-day Tiruchirapalli District, Tiruvarur District, Nagapattinam District, Ariyalur District, Perambalur district, Pudukkottai district, Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu and Karaikal District The river Kaveri and its tributaries dominate this landscape of generally flat country that gradually slopes towards the

celebration, known as Adiperukku, in which the whole nation took part [citation needed]\n\n\nCultural contributions\nUnder the Cholas, the Tamil country reached new heights of excellence in art, religion, music and literature [74] In all of these spheres, the Chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun at an earlier age under the Pallavas [75] Monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in India [76]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe Imperial Chola era was the golden age of Tamil culture, marked by the importance of literature Chola records cite many works, including the Rajarajesvara Natakam, Viranukkaviyam and Kannivana Puranam [83]\n\n\nReligion\nIn general, Cholas were followers of Hinduism They were not swayed by the rise of Buddhism and Jainism as were the kings of the Pallava and Pandya dynasties Kocengannan, an Early Chola, was celebrated in both Sangam literature and in the Shaivite canon as a Hindu saint [20]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Chola dynasty has inspired many Tamil authors [104] The most important work of this genre is the popular Ponniyin Selvan (The son of Ponni), a historical novel in Tamil written by Kalki Krishnamurthy [105] Written in five volumes, this narrates the story of Rajaraja Chola, dealing with the events leading up to the ascension of Uttama Chola to the Chola throne Kalki had used the confusion in the succession to the Chola throne after the demise of Parantaka Chola¬†II [106] The book was serialised in the Tamil periodical Kalki during the mid-1950s [107] The serialisation lasted for nearly five years and every week its publication was awaited with great interest [108]\n\n\nSee

recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points [89] Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach

Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves [113] [114] Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114‚Äì108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics During the series, the Knicks

in a Knicks loss The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs [115]\n\n\nNew York Knicks (2011‚Äì2017)\nOn February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard

season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity [116] However, the team found themselves with an 18‚Äì24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense [117] Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago [118] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18‚Äì6, a vast improvement from the 18‚Äì24

record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96‚Äì86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks [124]\n\n\n2013‚Äì14 season\nEarly in the 2013‚Äì14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3‚Äì13 record Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine

list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder [183]\n\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (2017‚Äì2018)\nOn November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the

the club called an unspecified \"illness.\" [198] During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark [199] Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games Morey said that Anthony \"accepted every role\" asked by D'Antoni, but that the \"fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best

with an 18‚Äì24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense [117] Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago [118] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18‚Äì6, a vast improvement from the 18‚Äì24 record they had under D'Antoni [119]\n\n\n2012‚Äì13 season\nOn December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012 [120] On January

six rebounds and six assists) on January 5 [121] On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7 [122] On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games) [123] Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96‚Äì86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks [124]\n\n\n2013‚Äì14 season\nEarly in the 2013‚Äì14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3‚Äì13 record Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine

the club called an unspecified \"illness.\" [198] During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark [199] Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games Morey said that Anthony \"accepted every role\" asked by D'Antoni, but that the \"fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best

basket and get to the free throw line [259] Anthony is often known for having been one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005‚Äì06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in

She is played by Millie Bobby Brown and has become a cultural icon since the show's debut in 2016.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEleven is a young girl with psychokinetic abilities and a mysterious past. She is one of the main characters in the series and plays a crucial role in the show's storyline. As the series progresses, Eleven's character evolves, and her relationships with the other characters become more complex.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nEleven was born Jane Ives, the daughter of Teresa \"Terry\" Ives. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and raised as a test subject at Hawkins National Laboratory to develop her psychokinetic skills. Eleven's abilities include telekinesis, telepathy, and the ability to open and close portals to a parallel dimension called the Upside Down.\n\n**Season 1**\n\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins National Laboratory wearing only her hospital gown and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She is encountered by Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair, who are looking for their missing friend Will Byers. The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short and allows Eleven to live in his basement while providing her with some new clothes.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nAfter defeating the Demogorgon, Eleven wakes up in the Upside Down and escapes through a portal that leads her back to Hawkins Middle School. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the Eggos that Hopper has left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a fortified cabin in the woods, where Hopper forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety.\n\n**Season 3**\n\nAt the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together.

They also drew inspiration from the anime Elfen Lied and Akira, saying they \"wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary.\" Originally planned as a feature film, Stranger Things was then pitched to Netflix as a limited series, and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series. After Netflix was keen for the show to be continued in a second season, the brothers decided to change the ending to keep the character alive.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe brothers believed Eleven was the most difficult role to cast, as the character had few lines. They wanted a child actor who was able to convey much emotion. The Duffers were concerned they would not find someone who could stay in character when not speaking. They were relieved after meeting Millie Bobby Brown, whom they described as \"something special, alright, with a downright spooky preternatural talent.\" Brown had to shave her head for the role, something she and her parents were worried would \"diminish her beauty\" until shown a photo of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\n**In Other Media**\n\nEleven makes a silent cameo appearance in Odder Stuff, an in-universe television series in The Simpsons thirty-first season episode \"I'm Dancing as Fat as I Can\", released February 10, 2019.

she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.\n\n\nSeason 3\nAt the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together When Hopper confesses to Joyce that he feels uncomfortable about the situation, she suggests that he sit down and calmly talk to El and Mike about how he feels However, this backfires, and Hopper resorts to directly instructing Mike to stay away from Eleven, threatening to end their relationship if he does not comply When Mike is forced to lie to Eleven about why he can no longer visit her, she becomes suspicious and seeks advice from Max, who asserts that Mike is pushing Eleven aside to spend time with the boys To take her mind off of the situation, Max suggests that they have some fun of their own by going shopping at the newly built Starcourt Mall.\n\n\nSeason 4\nAt the start of season four, Eleven begins going to school in California alongside Will and struggles with the loss of her powers, as well as being bullied by a girl named Angela (Elodie Grace Orkin) When Mike comes to visit, Eleven pretends she has many friends to please Mike, but Will isn't convinced She is humiliated at a roller rink and strikes Angela in the face in retaliation She is taken into police custody, but Dr Owens intercepts her arrest and takes her with him He explains that Hawkins is in danger and he has been working in a program that may be able to bring back Eleven's powers Eleven agrees to participate, risking that she may never see her friends ever again Eleven is taken to a facility in Nevada and discovers Dr Brenner is still alive Eleven tries to run only to end up tranquilized.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe Duffer Brothers based the character of Eleven on survivors of the Project MKUltra experiments, with influences from E.T and the idea of being an outsider They also drew inspiration from the anime Elfen Lied and Akira, [6] saying they \"wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary.\" [7] Originally planned as a feature film, Stranger Things was then pitched to Netflix as a limited series, and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series After Netflix was then keen for the show to be continued in a second season, the brothers decided to change the ending to keep the character alive [8]\n\n\nConception and writing\nThe Duffer Brothers based the character of Eleven on survivors of the Project MKUltra experiments, with influences from E.T and the idea of being an outsider They also drew inspiration from the anime Elfen Lied and Akira, [6] saying they \"wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary.\" [7] Originally planned as a feature film, Stranger Things was then pitched to Netflix as a limited series, and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series After Netflix was then keen for the show to be continued in a second season, the brothers decided to change the ending to keep the character alive [8]\n\n\nCasting\nThe brothers believed Eleven was the most difficult role to cast, as the character had few lines They wanted a child actor who was able to convey much emotion The Duffers were concerned they would not find someone who could stay in character when not speaking The brothers were relieved after meeting Millie Bongiovi, whom they described as \"something special, alright, with a downright spooky preternatural talent.\" Brown had to shave her head for the role, something she and her parents were worried would \"diminish her beauty\" until shown a photo of Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road [6]\n\n\nIn other media\nEleven makes a silent cameo appearance in Odder Stuff, an in-universe television series in The Simpsons thirtieth season episode \"I'm Dancing as Fat as I Can\", released February 10, 2019 Eleven's Stranger Things role is then embodied by Lisa Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) in the 31st season \"Treehouse of Horror XXX\" segment \"Danger Things\", released October 20, 2019.\n\n\nReception\nThe character and Brown's performance have received critical acclaim;

The attack, which was attributed to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, resulted in the deaths of 12 children and injured at least 42 others.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe attack occurred in the context of a long-standing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which has been ongoing since the 2006 Lebanon War. The conflict has resulted in significant damage to buildings and land along the border, as well as the displacement of entire communities in Israel and Lebanon. As of July 2024, Israel reports having killed approximately 366 Hezbollah operatives, while over 90,000 people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes.\n\n**Attack**\n\nEarly in the morning, Hezbollah took responsibility for multiple attacks, including one with a Falaq-type rocket on the military headquarters of the Hermon Brigade, which was 3 km from the football pitch. At 6:18 pm, alarms sounded in Majdal Shams, and a projectile hit and exploded at a soccer field in the town, located near a playground. According to initial reports, eleven people were wounded, with five in critical condition and six in serious condition. Emergency services, including Magen David Adom (MDA), treated the critically injured, aged between 10 and 20, some of whom were transferred to local clinics.\n\n**Victims**\n\nTwelve children, ranging in age between ten and sixteen years old, were killed in the attack.

The Israeli army posted pictures of Falaq-1 shrapnel that it said was found at the scene of the attack.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nFollowing the attack, Israel's military stated that it had launched strikes against Hezbollah weapon storage and infrastructure in Lebanon, specifically in the areas of Chabriha, Borj Ech Chemali, Beqaa, Kafr Kila, Khiam, Rab El Thalathine, and Tayr Harfa. The IDF also said that it struck the launch site of the projectile with artillery.\n\n**International Reaction**\n\nThe attack provoked widespread outrage among Druze in Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.

qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet [295] Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions Despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker, he has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area He became more of a team player as his career progressed, having been criticised by pundits earlier in his career for his perceived selfishness.\n\n\nOutside football\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer [298] Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), [302] was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division [303] His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno [303] His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team [303]\n\n\nPersonal

for various charitable organisations and for children throughout their career, including Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, for which they've raised more than PLN 150,000 during Anna's birthday party on 25 August 2018 [324] Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gawe≈Ç, a three-year-old boy from Hel; [325] and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions [326] [327] [328]\n\n\nSponsorship and media appearances\nSince 2011 until 2018, he had a sponsorship contract with Gillette and appeared in numerous advertising campaigns of the brand [340] In 2020, the contract was renewed [341] In 2013, Lewandowski signed a sponsorship deal with Nike

{"title": "Mohammed_bin_Salman", "content": "\nEarly life, education and career\nMohammed bin Salman was born on 31 August 1985 [5] [6] [7] to Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz and his third spouse, [8] Fahda bint Falah Al Hithlain He is the eldest of his mother's six children and the eighth child and seventh son of his father [8] His full siblings include Prince Turki and Prince Khalid [9] Mohammed holds a bachelor's degree in law from King Saud University, where he graduated second in his class [10]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from university, Mohammed spent several years in the private sector before becoming an aide to his father He worked as a consultant for the Experts Commission, working for the Saudi Cabinet [11] On 15 December 2009, at the age of 24, he entered politics as a special advisor to his father when the latter was the governor of Riyadh Province [12] At this time Mohammed began to switch from one position to another, such as secretary-general of the Riyadh Competitive Council, special advisor to the chairman of the board for the King Abdulaziz Foundation for Research and Archives, and a member of the board of trustees for Albir Society in the Riyadh region [13] In October 2011, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz died Prince Salman began his ascent to power by becoming second deputy prime minister and minister of defence He made Mohammed his private advisor [14]\n\n\nChief of the Court\nIn June 2012, Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz died Mohammed moved up into the number two position in the hierarchy, as his father became the new crown prince and first deputy prime minister On 2 March 2013, Chief of the Crown Prince Court Saud bin Nayef Al Saud was appointed governor of the Eastern Province, and Mohammed succeeded him as chief of the court He was also given the rank of minister [15] [16] [17] On 25 April 2014, Mohammed was appointed state minister [13]\n\n\nRise to power\nOn 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died and Salman ascended the throne Mohammed was appointed minister of defence [18] and secretary general of the royal court [19] In addition, he retained his post as the minister of state [20] [21]\n\n\nMinister of Defence\nOn 23 January 2015, King Abdullah died and Salman ascended the throne Mohammed was appointed minister of defence [18] and secretary general of the royal court [19] In addition, he retained his post as the minister of state [20] [21]\n\n\nCrown prince\nMohammed was appointed crown prince on 21 June 2017, following the King's decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef and make his own son the heir to the throne [31] The change of succession had been predicted in December 2015 by an unusually blunt and public memo published by the German Federal Intelligence Service, [32] [33] which was subsequently rebuked by the German government [34]\n\n\n2017 purge\nIn May 2017, Mohammed launched a purge against competing Saudi business and political elites under the auspices of anti-corruption He said, \"no one will survive in a corruption case‚Äîwhoever he is, even if he's a prince or a minister\" [37] In November 2017, he ordered some 200 wealthy businessmen and princes to be placed under house arrest in The Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh [38] On 4 November 2017, the Saudi press announced the arrest of the Saudi prince and billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal, a frequent English-language news commentator and a major shareholder in Citi, News Corp and Twitter, as well as over 40 princes and government ministers at the behest of the Crown Prince on corruption and money laundering charges [39] Others arrested or fired in the purge included Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard; Minister of Economy and Planning Adel Fakeih; and the commander of the Royal Saudi Navy, Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan [39] [40]\n\n\nPrime minister\nOn 27 September 2022, Mohammed was appointed as prime minister of Saudi Arabia by King Salman Traditionally, the king has held the title of prime minister [63]\n\n\nAdministration\nMohammed's ideology has been described as nationalist [64] [65] and populist, [66] [67] with a conservative attitude towards politics, and a liberal stance on economic and social issues [68] [69] It has been heavily influenced by the views of his former adviser Saud al-Qahtani [70] [71] and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed [72] [73] His style of ruling has been described as extremely brutal by journalist Rula Jebreal and authoritarian by Jamal Khashoggi [74] and Theodor Winkler [69] Mohammed bin Salman has also been championing an Arab nationalist ideology domestically and through foreign policy; with a focus on opposing Islamist movements [75]\n\n\nIdeology\nMohammed's ideology has been described as nationalist [64] [65] and populist, [66] [67] with a conservative attitude towards politics, and a liberal stance on economic and social issues [68] [69] It has been heavily influenced by the views of his former adviser Saud al-Qahtani [70] [71] and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed [72] [73] His style of ruling has been described as extremely brutal by journalist Rula Jebreal and authoritarian by Jamal Khashoggi [74] and Theodor Winkler [69] Mohammed bin Salman has also been championing an Arab nationalist ideology domestically and through foreign policy; with a focus on opposing Islamist movements [75]\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\nMohammed heads a repressive authoritarian government in Saudi Arabia Human rights activists and women's rights activists in Saudi Arabia have faced abuse and torture by the regime [76] Critics, journalists and former insiders are tortured and killed [76] [77] The government has targeted Saudi dissidents who are located abroad Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist of The Washington Post, was murdered by the regime [77] Mohammed has justified the mass arrests of human rights activists as being as necessary for enacting reforms in Saudi Arabia and for establishing a state based on Arab nationalism [78] [79]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nAccording to David Ottaway of the Wilson Center, \" [o]f all  [Mohammed's] domestic reforms,\" the most \"consequential\" has been his work limiting the influence of Saudi Wahhabi clergy, \"who still command millions of followers in the country and beyond\" [82] Mohammed's inviting of \"a constant stream of Western male and female singers, bands, dancers and even American female wrestlers\" to perform in Saudi Arabia is in complete conflict with religious conservatives who have spoken \"against the opening up of the kingdom to secular Western culture\" [82] Under Mohammed, the Saudi government has promoted a new Saudi identity and nationalist history that downplays religious heritage and restricts Islamic influence in the cultural sphere [83] Journalist Graeme Wood writes, \"it is hard to exaggerate how drastically this sidelining of Islamic law will change Saudi Arabia.\" [84] Gabriella Perez argues that the new social changes implemented by MBS are oriented towards secularist repression, with the potential to adversely impact freedom of religion in the country [85]\n\n\nReligious policy\nAccording to David Ottaway of the Wilson Center, \" [o]f all  [Mohammed's] domestic reforms,\" the most \"consequential\" has been his work limiting the influence of Saudi Wahhabi clergy, \"who still command millions of followers in the country and beyond\" [82] Mohammed's inviting of \"a constant stream of Western male and female singers, bands, dancers and even American female wrestlers\" to perform in Saudi Arabia is in complete conflict with religious conservatives who have spoken \"against the opening up of the kingdom to secular Western culture\" [82] Under Mohammed, the Saudi government has promoted a new Saudi identity and nationalist history that downplays religious heritage and restricts Islamic influence in the cultural sphere [83] Journalist Graeme Wood writes, \"it is hard to exaggerate how drastically this sidelining of Islamic law will change Saudi Arabia.\" [84] Gabriella Perez argues that the new social changes implemented by MBS are oriented towards secularist repression, with the potential to adversely impact freedom of religion in the country [85]\n\n\nRestrictions on religious police\nIn 2016, Mohammed took steps to drastically curtail the powers of the \"Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\" (CPVPV), or Islamic religious police [87] [88] The \"feared\" CPVPV, which had thousands of officers on the streets and powers to arrest, detain, and interrogate those suspected of violating sharia, was banned \"from pursuing, questioning, asking for identification, arresting and detaining anyone suspected of a crime\" [89] The cinema industry was reinstated, social liberties were expanded, gender mixing and dating have been normalised by the state in the public sphere Schmidt-Feuerheerd argues that the new state policies are also accompanied by an increasing clampdown on political and religious activities independent of the government [83]\n\n\nChanges to legal system\nMohammed has stated that \"in Islamic law, the head of the Islamic establishment is wali al-amr [90] (Arabic: ŸàŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸë ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖÿ± ), the ruler [84] While Saudi rulers \"have historically stayed away from religion\", and \"outsourced\" issues of theology and religious law to \"the big beards\", traditionally conservative and orthodox religious scholars, Mohammed has \"a law degree from King Saud University\" and \"flaunts his knowledge and dominance over the clerics\", according to Graeme Wood He is \"probably the only leader in the Arab world who knows anything about Islamic epistemology and jurisprudence\", according to American historian Professor Bernard Haykel In an interview televised in Saudi Arabia on 25 April 2021, Mohammed criticised the devotion of Saudi religious leaders to Wahhabi doctrines \"in language never before used by a Saudi monarch\", saying \"there are no fixed schools of thought and there is no infallible person\", and that fatwas \"should be based on the time, place and mindset in which they are issued\", rather than regarded as immutable [82]\n\n\nAbaya ban\nIn December 2022, Saudi Arabia's Education and Training Evaluation Commission (ETEC) declared a governmental ban on Muslim female students from wearing the traditional abaya clothing to examination centres; insisting that students should wear only school uniforms [91] [92] [93] A later clarification from ETEC reported by The Milli Chronicle stated that the ban on abayas was restricted only for all-female examination centres run by the ETEC [94]\n\n\nEconomic policy\nMohammed took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia's economy, which he officially announced in April 2016 when he introduced Vision 2030, the country's strategic orientation for the next 15 years Vision 2030 plans to reform Saudi Arabia's economy towards a more diversified and privatised structure It details goals and measures in various fields, from developing non-oil revenues and privatisation of the economy to e-government and sustainable development [95]\n\n\nVision 2030\nMohammed took the leadership in the restructuring of Saudi Arabia's economy, which he officially announced in April 2016 when he introduced Vision 2030, the country's strategic orientation for the next 15 years Vision 2030 plans to reform Saudi Arabia's economy towards a more diversified and privatised structure It details goals and measures in various fields, from developing non-oil revenues and privatisation of the economy to e-government and sustainable development [95]\n\n\nSaudi petroleum industry\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, has the second-largest amount of oil reserves in the world On 28 September 2021, Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met with Mohammed in Saudi Arabia to discuss the high oil prices [108] In October 2022 in protest of Saudi Arabia cutting oil production, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Saudi Arabia knew the cut would \"increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions\" and accused Saudi Arabia of \"coercing\" other oil producing countries to agree [109] The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nSport sector\nMohammed has presided over unprecedented spending on sport since becoming Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler in 2017 He has also been assiduous in striking deals to bring top sports events to Saudi, including the FIFA Club World Cup in 2034 and the Asian Games in 2029 In 2023, Mohammed said this approach is central to the country's goal of becoming one of the world's top 10 tourist destinations, stating: \"When you want to diversify an economy you have to work in all sectors: mining, infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, logistics all this‚Ä¶ Part of it is tourism and if you want to develop tourism part of it is culture, part of it is your sport sector, because you need to create a calendar.\" [115]\n\n\nDomestic reforms\nMohammed established an entertainment authority that began hosting comedy shows, professional wrestling events, and monster truck rallies [24] In 2016, he shared his idea for \"Green cards\" for non-Saudi foreigners with Al Arabiya journalist Turki Aldakhil [116] In 2019 the Saudi cabinet approved a new residency scheme (Premium Residency) for foreigners [117] The scheme will enable expatriates to permanently reside, own property and invest in the Kingdom [118] [119]\n\n\nHuman rights\nEarly in his leadership tenure, Mohammed sought to cultivate an image of Saudi Arabia as implementing various reforms Human rights groups say that repression has worsened under his tenure [76] [78] According to human rights groups, arrests of human rights activists have risen under Mohammed [137] He has reportedly created the Tiger Squad, a team of assassins that act as a death squad, to target Saudi critics inside and outside Saudi Arabia [138] [139] Among those detained in a wave of arrests in September 2017 were Abdulaziz al-Shubaily, a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA); Mustafa al-Hassan, an academic and novelist; and Essam al-Zamel, an entrepreneur [140] [141] Ahead of the lifting of the ban on women driving in June 2018, 17 women's rights activists were arrested, including the women to drive and anti-male guardianship campaigner Loujain al-Hathloul [142] [143] Eight of the 17 were subsequently released [144] Hatoon al-Fassi, an associate professor of women's history at King Saud University, [145] was arrested shortly afterwards [146] [147]\n\n\nArrest of Muhammad bin Nayef\nMuhammad bin Nayef was arrested on 6 March 2020, along with his half-brother Nawwaf bin Nayef and King Salman's brother Ahmed bin Abdulaziz The three princes were charged with treason The Saudi government claimed the princes were trying to overthrow Mohammed bin Salman [163]\n\n\nAccusations of poisoning attempt against King Abdullah\nIn 2021, the former Saudi intelligence official Saad al-Jabri said in an interview with CBS that Mohammed bin Salman mentioned to Interior Minister Muhammad bin Nayef Al Saud plans to kill King Abdullah in 2014 This would allow Mohammed's father to take the throne Al-Jabri has called Mohammed \"a psychopath, killer .. with infinite resources, who poses threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet\" [164] Mohammed has rejected all allegations; the Saudi embassy called al-Jabri \"a discredited former government official with a long history of  [fabrication]\" [165]\n\n\nForeign policy\nSome have called Mohammed the architect of the war in Yemen [166] [167] On 10 January 2016, The Independent reported that \"the BND, the German intelligence agency, portrayed...Saudi defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman...as a political gambler who is destabilising the Arab world through proxy wars in Yemen and Syria.\" [168] [28] [169] German officials reacted to the BND's memo, saying the published statement \"is not the position of the federal government\" [34]\n\n\nInterventions in Syria and Yemen\nSome have called Mohammed the architect of the war in Yemen [166] [167] On 10 January 2016, The Independent reported that \"the BND, the German intelligence agency, portrayed...Saudi defence minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman...as a political gambler who is destabilising the Arab world through proxy wars in Yemen and Syria.\" [168] [28] [169] German officials reacted to the BND's memo, saying the published statement \"is not the position of the federal government\" [34]\n\n\nRelations with Israel\nIn December 2017, Mohammed criticised the United States' decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel [199] In 2018, he voiced his support for a Jewish homeland of Israel, [200] the first time that a senior Saudi royal has expressed such sentiments publicly [201] [202] In September 2019, Mohammed condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to annex the eastern portion of the West Bank known as the Jordan Valley [203] In 2020, Mohammed met with Netanyahu and Israeli head of the Mossad, Yosi Cohen, in Neom [204] The United States were pushing for Israel's normalization for years, calling in this context the Abraham Accords the ‚Äúdeal of the century‚Äù, but Riyadh rejected reports of progress In 2023, there were ongoing U.S lead negotiations to establish diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel [205] Mohammed also said that his country was moving steadily closer to normalising relations with Israel [206] Due to Israel's war against Hamas, Mohammed called for a global arms embargo against Israel [207] Mohammed reportedly told Antony Blinken in January 2024: \"Do I care personally about the Palestinian issue? I don‚Äôt, but my people do.\" [208]\n\n\nRelationship with Russia\nUnder Mohammed's leadership, Saudi Arabia strengthened its relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin [215] In 2016, Mohammed signed an agreement to cooperate with Russia in global oil markets [215] After Mohammed was accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, Putin was one of few world leaders to publicly embrace the prince [216] Russia has also abstained from criticising Saudi-led intervention in Yemen and has supported the United Nations arms embargo against the Houthis in the Security Council [217] [218] In 2021, Mohammed signed a military cooperation agreement with Russia [219]\n\n\nRelations with Turkey\nIn March 2018, Mohammed referred to Turkey as part of a \"triangle of evil\" alongside Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood [225] [226] However, Mohammed later led a reconciliation with Turkey in 2022, leading to improved relations between the countries [227] In July 2023, the Crown Prince and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan agreed a major deal for Saudi Arabia to purchase Turkish Baykar Bayraktar Akƒ±ncƒ± drones [228]\n\n\nRelations with United States\nIn August 2016 Donald Trump Jr., the son of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, had a meeting with an envoy representing Mohammed bin Salman and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed The envoy offered help to the Trump campaign [229] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli social media expert, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince [230] [229]\n\n\nRelations with the Trump Administration\nIn August 2016 Donald Trump Jr., the son of US presidential candidate Donald Trump, had a meeting with an envoy representing Mohammed bin Salman and the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed The envoy offered help to the Trump campaign [229] The meeting included Joel Zamel, an Israeli social media expert, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader, and Blackwater founder Erik Prince [230] [229]\n\n\nRelations with the Biden administration\nIn 2019, during the Trump administration, Joe Biden criticised Mohammed, describing him as a pariah due to the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi [240] In July 2021, six months into the Biden presidency, Saudi deputy defence minister Khalid bin Salman Al Saud (Mohammed's brother) visited the United States It was the first meeting between senior US and Saudi officials after Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in 2018 [241] In September 2021, Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Mohammed In the meeting, Mohammed reportedly ended up shouting at Sullivan after he raised the killing of Khashoggi [240]\n\n\nRelations with Qatar\nOn 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia under Mohammed spearheaded a diplomatic crisis with Qatar together with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, with the countries severing diplomatic relations with Qatar and effectively imposing a blockade on the country The countries cited Qatar's alleged support for terrorism as the main reason for the actions, also citing Al Jazeera and Qatar's relations with Iran Reuters reported that Mohammed \"said the dispute with Qatar could be long-lasting, comparing it to the US embargo against Cuba imposed 60 years before, but played down its impact, dismissing the Gulf emirate as \"smaller than a Cairo street\" [226] In August 2018, a report by The Intercept cited unnamed sources claiming that former US secretary of state Rex Tillerson had in June 2017 intervened to stop a Saudi-Emirati plan to invade Qatar, resulting in increased pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE for his removal from office [251]\n\n\nResignation of Saad Hariri\nIn November 2017, Mohammed forced Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri to resign when he visited Saudi Arabia Mohammed believed that Hariri was in the pocket of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which is a major political force in Lebanon Hariri eventually was released, went back to Lebanon and annulled his resignation [38]\n\n\nSaudi‚ÄìCanadian dispute\nChrystia Freeland, Canada's minister of foreign affairs, issued a statement via Twitter on 2 August 2018 expressing Canada's concern over the recent arrest of Samar Badawi, a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, and called for the release of human rights activists [253] In response to Canada's criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled Canada's ambassador and froze trade with Canada [254] [255] The Toronto Star reported that the consensus among analysts indicated that the actions taken by Mohammed were a \"warning to the world ‚Äî and to Saudi human rights activists ‚Äî that his Saudi Arabia is not to be trifled with\" [256] The diplomatic ties were restored on 24 May 2023 [257]\n\n\nAssassination of Jamal Khashoggi\nIn October 2018, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Mohammed, went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish officials reportedly believe that Khashoggi was murdered at the consulate, claiming to have specific video and audio recordings proving that he was first tortured and then murdered, and that a medical forensics expert was part of the 15-man Saudi team seen entering and leaving the consulate at the time of the journalist's disappearance [258] Saudi Arabia denied the accusations and 13 days later Mohammed invited Turkish authorities to search the building as they \"have nothing to hide\" Saudi officials said they are \"working to search for him\" [259] The Washington Post reported that Mohammed had earlier sought to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and detain him [260]\n\n\nIntimidation of Saad al-Jabri\nOn 9 July 2020, four United States senators urged President Trump to secure the freedom of Saad al-Jabri's children Omar and Sarah, calling it a \"moral obligation\" to support a man who aided the US intelligence for years and had close ties with key members of the Saudi royal family The Saudi government detained Omar and Sarah in March 2020 and, to date, their whereabouts remain unknown [289] [290] Saudi Arabia had issued an extradition request and Interpol notices to bring back Saad al-Jabri, who was the US anti-terrorism contact in the Middle East and was staying in Canada since 2018 The Interpol notice against al-Jabri was removed, citing that he was a political opponent of Mohammed [291]\n\n\nRelations with China\nRelations between China and Saudi Arabia have deepened under the leadership of Mohammed; since he became crown prince in 2017, trade between the two countries have increased from $51.5 billion to $87.5 billion in 2021 [297] In February 2019, Mohammed defended China's policies in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs were put into internment camps, saying \"China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism and de-extremisation work for its national security.\" [298] [299] [300] Miqdaad Versi, spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain, called Mohammed's remarks \"disgusting\" and a defence of \"the use of concentration camps against Uighur Muslims\" [301] China has been Saudi Arabia's largest economic partner since 2014 and Saudi Arabia is

Arabia and for establishing a state based on Arab nationalism [78] [79]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nAccording to David Ottaway of the Wilson Center, \" [o]f all  [Mohammed's] domestic reforms,\" the most \"consequential\" has been his work limiting the influence of Saudi Wahhabi clergy, \"who still command millions of followers in the country and beyond\" [82] Mohammed's inviting of \"a constant stream of Western male and female singers, bands, dancers and even American female wrestlers\" to perform in Saudi Arabia is in complete conflict with religious conservatives who have spoken \"against the opening up of the kingdom to secular Western culture\" [82] Under Mohammed, the Saudi government has promoted a new Saudi identity and nationalist history that downplays religious heritage and restricts Islamic influence in the cultural sphere [83] Journalist Graeme Wood writes, \"it is hard to exaggerate how drastically this sidelining of Islamic law will change Saudi Arabia.\" [84] Gabriella Perez argues that the new social changes implemented by MBS are oriented towards secularist repression, with the potential to adversely impact freedom of religion in the country

oriented towards secularist repression, with the potential to adversely impact freedom of religion in the country [85]\n\n\nRestrictions on religious police\nIn 2016, Mohammed took steps to drastically curtail the powers of the \"Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\" (CPVPV), or Islamic religious police [87] [88] The \"feared\" CPVPV, which had thousands of officers on the streets and powers to arrest, detain, and interrogate those suspected of violating sharia, was banned \"from pursuing, questioning, asking for identification, arresting and detaining anyone suspected of a crime\" [89] The cinema industry was reinstated, social liberties were expanded, gender mixing and dating have been normalised by the state in the public sphere Schmidt-Feuerheerd argues that the new state policies are also accompanied by an increasing clampdown on political and religious activities independent of the government [83]\n\n\nChanges to legal system\nMohammed has stated that \"in Islamic law, the head of the Islamic establishment is wali al-amr [90] (Arabic: ŸàŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸë ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖÿ± ), the ruler [84] While Saudi rulers \"have historically stayed away from religion\", and \"outsourced\" issues of theology and religious law to \"the big beards\", traditionally conservative and orthodox religious scholars, Mohammed has \"a law degree from King Saud University\" and \"flaunts his knowledge and dominance over the clerics\", according to Graeme Wood He is \"probably the only leader in the Arab world who knows anything about Islamic epistemology and jurisprudence\", according to American historian Professor Bernard Haykel In an interview televised in Saudi Arabia on 25 April 2021, Mohammed criticised the devotion of Saudi religious leaders to Wahhabi doctrines \"in language never before used by a Saudi monarch\", saying \"there are no fixed schools of thought and there is no infallible person\", and that fatwas \"should be based on the time, place and mindset in which they are issued\", rather than regarded as immutable [82]\n\n\nAbaya ban\nIn December 2022, Saudi Arabia's Education and Training Evaluation Commission (ETEC) declared a governmental ban on Muslim female students from wearing the traditional abaya clothing to examination centres; insisting that students should wear only school uniforms

Sullivan, met with Mohammed in Saudi Arabia to discuss the high oil prices [108] In October 2022 in protest of Saudi Arabia cutting oil production, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Saudi Arabia knew the cut would \"increase Russian revenues and blunt the effectiveness of sanctions\" and accused Saudi Arabia of \"coercing\" other oil producing countries to agree [109] The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nSport sector\nMohammed has presided over unprecedented spending on sport since becoming Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler in 2017 He has also been assiduous in striking deals to bring top sports events to Saudi, including the FIFA Club World Cup in 2034 and the Asian Games in 2029 In 2023, Mohammed said this approach is central to the country's goal of becoming one of the world's top 10 tourist destinations, stating: \"When you want to diversify an economy you have to work in all sectors: mining, infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, logistics all this‚Ä¶ Part of it is tourism and if you want to develop tourism part of it is culture, part of it is your sport sector, because you need to create a calendar.\" [115]\n\n\nDomestic reforms\nMohammed established an entertainment authority that began hosting comedy shows, professional wrestling events, and monster truck rallies [24] In 2016, he shared his idea for \"Green cards\" for non-Saudi foreigners with Al

{"title": "Aung_San_Suu_Kyi", "content": "\nName\nAung San Suu Kyi, like other Burmese names, includes no surname, but is only a personal name, in her case derived from three relatives: \"Aung San\" from her father, \"Suu\" from her paternal grandmother, and \"Kyi\" from her mother Khin Kyi [22]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now Yangon), British Burma According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung [28] Her father, Aung San, allied with the Japanese during World War II Aung San founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was assassinated by his rivals in the same year She is a niece of Thakin Than Tun who was the husband of Khin Khin Gyi, the elder sister of her mother Khin Kyi [29]\n\n\nPolitical career\nCoincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the ruling party, General Ne Win, stepped down [48] Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8‚Äì8‚Äì88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the 8888 Uprising On 24 August 1988, she made her first public appearance at the Yangon General Hospital, addressing protestors from a podium [49] On 26 August, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in the capital, calling for a democratic government [33] However, in September 1988, a new military junta took power [33]\n\n\nPolitical beginning\nCoincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the ruling party, General Ne Win, stepped down [48] Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8‚Äì8‚Äì88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the 8888 Uprising On 24 August 1988, she made her first public appearance at the Yangon General Hospital, addressing protestors from a podium [49] On 26 August, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in the capital, calling for a democratic government [33] However, in September 1988, a new military junta took power [33]\n\n\n1990 general election and Nobel Peace Prize\nIn 1990, the military junta called a general election, in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats [57] Some claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of Prime Minister [58] Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue (16¬∞49‚Ä≤32‚Ä≥N 96¬∞9‚Ä≤1‚Ä≥EÔªø / Ôªø16.82556¬∞N 96.15028¬∞EÔªø / 16.82556; 96.15028) in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the Nobel Peace Prize one year later Her sons Alexander and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's US$1.3¬†million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people [59] Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose nonviolence as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, \"I do not hold to nonviolence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons.\" [60]\n\n\n1996 attack\nOn 9 November 1996, the motorcade that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other National League for Democracy leaders Tin Oo and Kyi Maung, was attacked in Yangon About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered It is believed the offenders were members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) who were allegedly paid Ks.500/- (@ USD $0.50) each to participate [63] The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken (Amnesty International 120297) [64] [65]\n\n\nHouse arrest\nAung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career, [66] during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her [67] She also passed the time playing the piano and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician [68]\n\n\nUnited Nations involvement\nThe United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi [33] On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move \"because we are confident that we can trust each other\" Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed \"a new dawn for the country\" However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters [78] Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon [79]\n\n\nPeriods under detention\nProtests led by Buddhist monks during  Saffron Revolution began on 19 August 2007 following steep fuel price increases, and continued each day, despite the threat of a crackdown by the military [94]\n\n\n2007 anti-government protests\nProtests led by Buddhist monks during  Saffron Revolution began on 19 August 2007 following steep fuel price increases, and continued each day, despite the threat of a crackdown by the military [94]\n\n\n2009 trespass incident\nOn 3 May 2009, an American man, identified as John Yettaw, swam across Inya Lake to her house uninvited and was arrested when he made his return trip three days later [102] He had attempted to make a similar trip two years earlier, but for unknown reasons was turned away [103] He later claimed at trial that he was motivated by a divine vision requiring him to notify her of an impending terrorist assassination attempt [104] On 13 May, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for violating the terms of her house arrest because the swimmer, who pleaded exhaustion, was allowed to stay in her house for two days before he attempted the swim back Aung San Suu Kyi was later taken to Insein Prison, where she could have faced up to five years' confinement for the intrusion [105] The trial of Aung San Suu Kyi and her two maids began on 18 May and a small number of protesters gathered outside [106] [107] Diplomats and journalists were barred from attending the trial; however, on one occasion, several diplomats from Russia, Thailand and Singapore and journalists were allowed to meet Aung San Suu Kyi [108] The prosecution had originally planned to call 22 witnesses [109] It also accused John Yettaw of embarrassing the country [110] During the ongoing defence case, Aung San Suu Kyi said she was innocent The defence was allowed to call only one witness (out of four), while the prosecution was permitted to call 14 witnesses The court rejected two character witnesses, NLD members Tin Oo and Win Tin, and permitted the defence to call only a legal expert [111] According to one unconfirmed report, the junta was planning to, once again, place her in detention, this time in a military base outside the city [112] In a separate trial, Yettaw said he swam to Aung San Suu Kyi's house to warn her that her life was \"in danger\" [113] The national police chief later confirmed that Yettaw was the \"main culprit\" in the case filed against Aung San Suu Kyi [114] According to aides, Aung San Suu Kyi spent her 64th birthday in jail sharing biryani rice and chocolate cake with her guards [115]\n\n\nLate 2000s: International support for release\nAung San Suu Kyi has received vocal support from Western nations in Europe, [130] Australia [130] and North [131] and South America, as well as India, [26] Israel, [132] Japan [133] the Philippines and South Korea [134] In December 2007, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously 400‚Äì0 to award Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal; the Senate concurred on 25 April 2008 [135] On 6 May 2008, President George W Bush signed legislation awarding Aung San Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal [136] She is the first recipient in American history to receive the prize while imprisoned More recently, there has been growing criticism of her detention by Burma's neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly from Indonesia, [137] Thailand, [138] the Philippines [139] [140] and Singapore [141] At one point Malaysia warned Burma that it faced expulsion from ASEAN as a result of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi [142] Other nations including South Africa, [143] Bangladesh [144] and the Maldives [145] also called for her release The United Nations has urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights [146] In December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the human rights situation in Burma and calling for Aung San Suu Kyi's release‚Äî80 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions [147] Other nations, such as China and Russia, are less critical of the regime and prefer to cooperate only on economic matters [148] Indonesia has urged China to push Burma for reforms [149] However, Samak Sundaravej, former Prime Minister of Thailand, criticised the amount of support for Aung San Suu Kyi, saying that \"Europe uses Aung San Suu Kyi as a tool If it's not related to Aung San Suu Kyi, you can have deeper discussions with Myanmar.\" [150]\n\n\n2010 release\nOn the evening of 13 November 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest [164] This was the date her detention had been set to expire according to a court ruling in August 2009 [165] and came six days after a widely criticised general election She appeared in front of a crowd of her supporters, who rushed to her house in Rangoon when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces Aung San Suu Kyi had been detained for 15 of the past 21 years [166] The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported the release positively, [167] saying she had been granted a pardon after serving her sentence \"in good conduct\" [168] The New York Times suggested that the military government may have released Aung San Suu Kyi because it felt it was in a confident position to control her supporters after the election [167]\nHer son Kim Aris was granted a visa in November 2010 to see his mother shortly after her release, for the first time in 10 years [169] He visited again on 5 July 2011, to accompany her on a trip to Bagan, her first trip outside Yangon since 2003 [170] Her son visited again on 8 August 2011, to accompany her on a trip to Pegu, her second trip [171]\n\n\n2012 by-elections\nIn December 2011, there was speculation that Aung San Suu Kyi would run in the 2012 national by-elections to fill vacant seats [181] On 18 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi formally registered to contest a Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) seat in the Kawhmu Township constituency in special parliamentary elections to be held on 1 April 2012 [182] [183] The seat was previously held by Soe Tint, who vacated it after being appointed Construction Deputy Minister, in the 2010 election [184] She ran against Union Solidarity and Development Party candidate Soe Min, a retired army physician and native of Twante Township [185]\n\n\n2015 general election\nOn 16 June 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was finally able to deliver her Nobel acceptance speech (Nobel lecture) at Oslo's City Hall, two decades after being awarded the peace prize [203] [204] In September 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi received in person the United States Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest Congressional award Although she was awarded this medal in 2008, at the time she was under house arrest, and was unable to receive the medal Aung San Suu Kyi was greeted with bipartisan support at Congress, as part of a coast-to-coast tour in the United States In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi met President Barack Obama at the White House The experience was described by Aung San Suu Kyi as \"one of the most moving days of my life\" [205] [206] In 2014, she was listed as the 61st-most-powerful woman in the world by Forbes [207] [208] [209] [210]\n\n\nState counsellor and foreign minister (2016‚Äì2021)\nAs soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion and Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni in April and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in May and discussed how to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries [219] [220] [221]\n\n\nResponse to the genocide of Rohingya Muslims and refugees\nIn 2017, critics called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar [228] [229]\nSome activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis), and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority [230] [231] In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the Rohingya could be regarded as Burmese citizens [232] In a 2013 interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Aung San Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to ethnic cleansing, insisting that the tensions were due to a \"climate of fear\" caused by \"a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is 'very great'\" She did condemn \"hate of any kind\" in the interview [233] According to Peter Popham, in the aftermath of the interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim [234] Husain had challenged Aung San Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Aung San Suu Kyi's claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain [235]\n\n\nArrests and prosecution of journalists\nIn December 2017, two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were arrested while investigating the Inn Din massacre of Rohingyas [272] [273] Suu Kyi publicly commented in June 2018 that the journalists \"weren't arrested for covering the Rakhine issue\", but because they had broken Myanmar's Official Secrets Act [273] [274] As the journalists were then on trial for violating the Official Secrets Act, Aung San Suu Kyi's presumption of their guilt was criticized by rights groups for potentially influencing the verdict [273] [275] American diplomat Bill Richardson said that he had privately discussed the arrest with Suu Kyi, and that Aung San Suu Kyi reacted angrily and labelled the journalists \"traitors\" [276] A police officer testified that he was ordered by superiors to use entrapment to frame and arrest the journalists; he was later jailed and his family evicted from their home in the police camp [277] The judge found the journalists guilty in September 2018 and to be jailed for seven years [273] Aung San Suu Kyi reacted to widespread international criticism of the verdict by stating: \"I don't think anyone has bothered to read\" the judgement as it had \"nothing to do with freedom of expression at all\", but the Official Secrets Act She also challenged critics to \"point out where there has been a miscarriage of justice\", and told the two Reuters journalists that they could appeal their case to a higher court [278]\n\n\n2021 arrest and trial\nOn 1 February 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested and deposed by the Myanmar's military, along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party, after Myanmar's military declared the November 2020 general election results fraudulent [279] [280] A 1 February court order authorized her detainment for 15 days, stating that soldiers searching her Naypyidaw villa had uncovered imported communications equipment lacking proper paperwork Aung San Suu Kyi was transferred to house arrest on the same evening, and on 3 February was formally charged with illegally importing ten or more walkie-talkies She faces up to three years in prison for the charges According to The New York Times, the charge \"echoed previous accusations of esoteric legal crimes (and) arcane offenses\" used by the military against critics and rivals [281] As of 9 February, Aung San Suu Kyi continues to be held incommunicado, without access to international observers or legal representation of her choice [282]\n\n\nPolitical beliefs\nIt is not power that corrupts, but fear Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.\n\n\nRelated organisations\nThe life of Aung San Suu Kyi and her husband Michael Aris is portrayed in Luc Besson's 2011 film The Lady, in which they are played by Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis Yeoh visited Aung San Suu Kyi in 2011 before the

Myanmar from 2016 to 2021.\n\n**Name**\n\nAung San Suu Kyi's name is derived from three relatives: \"Aung San\" from her father, Aung San, who founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; \"Suu\" from her paternal grandmother; and \"Kyi\" from her mother, Khin Kyi. Her name is often rendered in English as Aung San Suu Kyi, although other variations exist.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nAung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in Rangoon (now Yangon), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung. Her father, Aung San, allied with the Japanese during World War II. Aung San founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma's independence from the United Kingdom in 1947; he was assassinated by his rivals in the same year. She is a niece of Thakin Than Tun, who was the husband of Khin Khin Gyi, the elder sister of her mother Khin Kyi.\n\n**Political career**\n\nWhen Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the ruling party, General Ne Win, stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on August 8, 1988 (8‚Äì8‚Äì88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the 8888 Uprising. On August 24, 1988, she made her first public appearance at the Yangon General Hospital, addressing protestors from a podium. On August 26, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in the capital, calling for a democratic government. However, in September 1988, a new military junta took power.\n\n**1990 general election and Nobel Peace Prize**\n\nIn 1990, the military junta called a general election, in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats. Some claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of Prime Minister. Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the Nobel Peace Prize one year later. Her sons Alexander and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's $1.3 million prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people.\n\n**1996 attack**\n\nOn November 9, 1996, the motorcade that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other National League for Democracy leaders Tin Oo and Kyi Maung was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones, and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 kyat ($0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports, the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.\n\n**House arrest**\n\nAung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career, during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics, and biographies that her husband had sent her. She also passed the time playing the piano and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.\n\n**United Nations involvement**\n\nThe United Nations has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi. On May 6, 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move \"because we are confident that we can trust each other.\" Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed \"a new dawn for the country.\" However, on May 30, 2003, in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon. After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.\n\n**2007 anti-government protests**\n\nProtests led by Buddhist monks during the Saffron Revolution began on August 19, 2007, following steep fuel price increases, and continued each day, despite the threat of a crackdown by the military.\n\n**2009 trespass incident**\n\nOn May 3, 2009, an American man, identified as John Yettaw, swam across Inya Lake to her house uninvited and was arrested when he made his return trip three days later. He had attempted to make a similar trip two years earlier, but for unknown reasons was turned away. He later claimed at trial that he was motivated by a divine vision requiring him to notify her of an impending terrorist assassination attempt. On May 13, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested for violating the terms of her house arrest because the swimmer, who pleaded exhaustion, was allowed to stay in her house for two days before he attempted the swim back. Aung San Suu Kyi was later taken to Insein Prison, where she could have faced up to five years' confinement for the intrusion.\n\n**2010 release**\n\nOn November 13, 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. This was the date her detention had been set to expire according to a court ruling in August 2009, and came six days after a widely criticized general election. She appeared in front of a crowd of her supporters, who rushed to her house in Rangoon when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces. Aung San Suu Kyi had been detained for 15 of the past 21 years. The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported the release positively, saying she had been granted a pardon after serving her sentence \"in good conduct.\"\n\n**2012 by-elections**\n\nIn December 2011, there was speculation that Aung San Suu Kyi would run in the 2012 national by-elections to fill vacant seats. On January 18, 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi formally registered to contest a Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) seat in the Kawhmu Township constituency in special parliamentary elections to be held on April 1, 2012. She ran against Union Solidarity and Development Party candidate Soe Min, a retired army physician and native of Twante Township.\n\n**2015 general election**\n\nOn June 16, 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was finally able to deliver her Nobel acceptance speech (Nobel lecture) at Oslo's City Hall, two decades after being awarded the peace prize. In September 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi received in person the United States Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest Congressional award. Although she was awarded this medal in 2008, at the time she was under house arrest, and was unable to receive the medal. Aung San Suu Kyi was greeted with bipartisan support at Congress, as part of a coast-to-coast tour in the United States. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi met President Barack Obama at the White House. The experience was described by Aung San Suu Kyi as \"one of the most moving days of my life.\"\n\n**State Counsellor and Foreign Minister (2016‚Äì2021)**\n\nAs soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion, and Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni in April and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in May to discuss how to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.\n\n**Response to the genocide of Rohingya Muslims and refugees**\n\nIn 2017, critics called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar. Some activists criticized Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riots (later repeated during the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis) and her indifference to the plight of the Rohingya, Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority. In a 2013 interview with the BBC's Mishal Husain, Aung San Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to ethnic cleansing, insisting that the tensions were due to a \"climate of fear\" caused by \"a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is 'very great.'\" She did condemn \"hate of any kind\" in the interview.\n\n**Arrests and prosecution of journalists**\n\nIn December 2017, two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were arrested while investigating the Inn Din massacre of Rohingyas. Suu Kyi publicly commented in June 2018 that the journalists \"weren't arrested for covering the Rakhine issue,\" but because they had broken Myanmar's Official Secrets Act. As the journalists were then on trial for violating the Official Secrets Act, Aung San Suu Kyi's presumption of their guilt was criticized by rights groups for potentially influencing the verdict. American diplomat Bill Richardson said that he had privately discussed the arrest with Suu Kyi, and that Aung San Suu Kyi reacted angrily and labelled the journalists \"traitors.\"\n\n**2021 arrest and trial**\n\nOn February 1, 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested and deposed by the Myanmar's military, along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party, after Myanmar's military declared the November 2020 general election results fraudulent. A court order authorized her detainment for 15 days, stating that soldiers searching her Naypyidaw villa had uncovered imported communications equipment lacking proper paperwork. Aung San Suu Kyi was transferred to house arrest on the same evening, and on February 3 was formally charged with illegally importing ten or more walkie-talkies. She faces up to three years in prison for the charges.\n\n**Political beliefs**\n\nAung San Suu Kyi has stated, \"It is not power that corrupts, but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

aftermath of the interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim [234] Husain had challenged Aung San Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Aung San Suu Kyi's claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain [235]\n\n\nArrests and prosecution of journalists\nIn December 2017, two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were arrested while investigating the Inn Din massacre of Rohingyas [272] [273]

officer testified that he was ordered by superiors to use entrapment to frame and arrest the journalists; he was later jailed and his family evicted from their home in the police camp [277] The judge found the journalists guilty in September 2018 and to be jailed for seven years [273] Aung San Suu Kyi reacted to widespread international criticism of the verdict by stating: \"I don't think anyone has bothered to read\" the judgement as it had \"nothing to do with freedom of expression at all\", but the Official Secrets Act She also challenged critics to \"point out where there has been a miscarriage of justice\", and told the two Reuters journalists that they could appeal their case to a higher court [278]\n\n\n2021 arrest and trial\nOn 1 February 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested

The palace is located in the St James's district of London, just north of St James's Park.\n\n## History\n\nThe palace was commissioned by Henry VIII on the remote site of a former leper hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less. He first used it as a hunting lodge for his newly enclosed deer park, St James's Park. The new palace, secondary in the king's interest to Henry's Whitehall Palace, was constructed between 1531 and 1536 as a smaller residence to escape formal court life. Much smaller than the nearby Whitehall, St James's is arranged around four courtyards, the Colour Court, the Ambassador's Court, the Engine Court, and the Friary Court. The four courts remain enclosed, except for Friary Court, which in modern times is only enclosed by apartments on three sides, with the fourth side open to Marlborough Road to accommodate public gatherings.\n\nThe most recognisable feature of the palace is the north gatehouse; constructed with four storeys, the gatehouse has two crenellated flanking octagonal towers at its corners, and a central clock dominating the uppermost floor and gable. The clock is a later addition and dates from 1731, refurbished 1834. The palace is decorated with the initials H.A for Henry and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry had the palace constructed in red brick, with detail picked out in darker brick.\n\n## Tudors\n\nPrince Henry, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King James and Anne of Denmark, lived at St James's Palace until his death in 1612. The gardens were improved for him by Alphonsus Fowle. A riding school, one of the first in England, was built for Henry at St James's Palace between 1607 and 1609, and then a library with sculptural decoration by Maximilian Colt. Henry also installed a menagerie with pet birds including a pair of ostriches.\n\n## Stuarts\n\nThe first two monarchs of the House of Hanover used St James's Palace as their principal London residence. George I and George II both housed their mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of Suffolk respectively, at the palace. In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the British Museum.\n\n## Hanoverians\n\nThe first two monarchs of the House of Hanover used St James's Palace as their principal London residence. George I and George II both housed their mistresses, the Duchess of Kendal and the Countess of Suffolk respectively, at the palace. In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the British Museum.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn 1912-1913 the palace was the venue for the international conference that arranged the treaty between the Balkan states and Turkey following the two Balkan Wars. Edward VIII when Prince of Wales used the palace as his 'town' residence until he moved into Marlborough House, and George VI as Duke of York resided there prior to his marriage in 1923. The Second Round Table Conference (September-December 1931), pertaining to Indian independence, was held at the palace. On 12 June 1941, Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as General Charles de Gaulle of France, met and signed the Declaration of St James's Palace, which was the first of six treaties signed that established the United Nations and composed the Charter of the United Nations.\n\n## Proclamation Gallery\n\nThe Proclamation Gallery is a part of St James's Palace, and it is used after the death of a reigning monarch. The Accession Council meets to declare the new monarch. Once the monarch has made a sacred oath to the council, the Garter King of Arms steps onto the Proclamation Gallery, which overlooks Friary Court, to proclaim the new monarch. Such an event last occurred on 10 September 2022 at the proclamation of King Charles III. To allow the Garter King of Arms and the trumpeters access to the balcony, workers removed the centre window the prior day and installed a temporary door.\n\n## Today\n\nSt James's Palace is still a working palace, and the Royal Court is still formally based there, despite the monarch residing elsewhere. It is also the London residence of Princess Anne, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Alexandra. The palace is used to host official receptions, such as those of visiting heads of state, and charities of which members of the royal family are patrons. It forms part of a sprawling complex of buildings housing Court offices and officials' apartments. The immediate palace complex includes York House, the former home of Charles III and his sons, Princes William and Harry. Lancaster House, located next door, is used by HM Government for official receptions, and the attached Clarence House, the former home of the Queen Mother, is the residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. The palace also served as the official residence of Princess Eugenie until April 2018.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe palace is a significant historical and cultural landmark in London, and it continues to play an important role in the life of the British royal family.

Angela's father, Domenico Barra, emigrated from Monasterolo del Castello, Bergamo Martin's first language was Italian and he spoke no English until starting school at the age of five Martin attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his broken English As a teenager, Martin played the drums as a hobby He dropped out of Steubenville High School in the tenth grade because, according to Martin, he thought he was smarter than his teachers [4] Martin bootlegged liquor, worked in a steel mill, served as a croupier at a speakeasy and a blackjack dealer, and was a welterweight boxer [5]\n\n\nCareer\nMartin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming Martin met comic Jerry Lewis at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in New York City in August 1944 [14] [15] According to Lewis, the two men met initially in the lobby, where Martin approached him and said, \"Hey, I saw your act, you're a funny kid.\" [16] Martin was singing at the hotel's famous Glass Hat Club at the time and the two happened to be on the same bill [17] [16] Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team Their debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material [18] Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with bread rolls [19]\n\n\nTeaming with Jerry Lewis\nMartin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia

career\nMartin's first solo film, Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), was a box-office failure [29] Although \"Volare\" reached number 15 in the U.S and number 2 in the UK, the era of the pop crooner was waning with the advent of rock and roll Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, The Young Lions (1958), Martin's part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift [30] Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback [31] He starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, Some Came Running (1958) [32]\n\n\nRat Pack\nAs Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis Jr., formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination) The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F Kennedy) [56]\n\n\nThe Dean Martin Show\nIn 1965, Martin launched his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974 He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years [59] The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, inappropriately hitting on women, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, Martin stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them Martin's TV show was a success The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language The show was often in the Top Ten Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.\n\n\nLater career\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for Reprise Records Martin recorded his final Reprise album, Once in a While in 1974, which was not issued until 1978 His final recordings were made for Warner Bros Records The Nashville Sessions was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song\", which was recorded with Conway Twitty and made a respectable showing on the country charts A follow-up single, \"L.A Is My Home\"/\"Drinking Champagne\", came in 1985 The 1974 film drama Mr Ricco marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer [citation needed]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMartin was married three times He wed Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 ‚Äì July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania in 1941 The couple had four children: [69]\n\n\nIllness and death\nMartin, a lifelong heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993 He was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it Martin retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995, at the age of 78 [85] The lights of the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor Martin was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles [86] The crypt features the epitaph \"Everybody loves somebody sometime\", the first line of his signature song [87]\n\n\nTributes and legacy\nIn 1997, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear In 2005, Clark County, Nevada,

The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer, capitalizing on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, inappropriately hitting on women, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts.\n\n**Later Career**\n\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for Reprise Records. He recorded his final Reprise album, \"Once in a While\" (1974), which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made for Warner Bros. Records. \"The Nashville Sessions\" was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song,\" which was recorded with Conway Twitty and made a respectable showing on the country charts.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMartin was married three times. He wed Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald in 1941, and the couple had four children.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nMartin, a lifelong heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993. He was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it. Martin retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995, at the age of 78.\n\n**Tributes and Legacy**\n\nIn 1997, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville.\n\nMartin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for \"Dino: The Essential Dean Martin,\" his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified \"Platinum.\"\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nA number of Martin songs have been featured across popular culture for decades. Hits such as \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head,\" \"Sway,\" \"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You,\" \"That's Amore,\" and Martin's signature song \"Everybody Loves Somebody\" have been in films (such as the Oscar-winning \"Logorama,\" \"A Bronx Tale,\" \"Casino,\" \"Goodfellas,\" \"Payback,\" \"Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol,\" \"Sexy Beast,\" \"Moonstruck,\" \"Vegas Vacation,\" \"Swingers,\" and \"Return to Me\"), television series (such as \"American Dad!\", \"Friends,\" \"The Sopranos,\" \"Mad Men,\" \"House MD,\" \"Samurai Jack,\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\"), video games (such as \"The Godfather: The Game,\" \"The Godfather II,\" \"Fallout: New Vegas,\" and \"Mafia II\"), and fashion shows (such as the 2008 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show).\n\n**Discography**\n\nThe list below shows the singer's studio albums only.

outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMartin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894‚Äì1967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (n√©e Barra; 1897‚Äì1966) Gaetano, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, Pescara, and Angela was born December 18, 1897, in Fernwood, Ohio Angela's father, Domenico Barra, emigrated from Monasterolo del Castello, Bergamo Martin's first language was Italian and he spoke no English until starting school at the age of five Martin attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his broken English As a teenager, Martin played the drums as a hobby He dropped out of Steubenville High School in the tenth grade because, according to Martin, he thought he was smarter than his teachers [4] Martin bootlegged liquor, worked in a steel mill, served as a croupier at a speakeasy and a blackjack dealer, and was a welterweight boxer [5]\n\n\nCareer\nMartin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming Martin met comic Jerry Lewis at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in New York City in August 1944 [14] [15] According to Lewis, the two men met initially in the lobby, where Martin approached him and said, \"Hey, I saw your act, you're a funny kid.\" [16] Martin was singing at the hotel's famous Glass Hat Club at the time and the two happened to be on the same bill [17] [16] Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team Their debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material [18] Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with bread rolls [19]\n\n\nTeaming with Jerry Lewis\nMartin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming Martin met comic Jerry Lewis at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in New York City in August 1944 [14] [15] According to Lewis, the two men met initially in the lobby, where Martin approached him and said, \"Hey, I saw your act, you're a funny kid.\" [16] Martin was singing at the hotel's famous Glass Hat Club at the time and the two happened to be on the same bill [17] [16] Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team Their debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \"go for broke\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material [18] Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with bread rolls [19]\n\n\nSolo career\nMartin's first solo film, Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), was a box-office failure [29] Although \"Volare\" reached number 15 in the U.S and number 2 in the UK, the era of the pop crooner was waning with the advent of rock and roll Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, The Young Lions (1958), Martin's part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift [30] Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback [31] He starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, Some Came Running (1958) [32]\n\n\nRat Pack\nAs Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis Jr., formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination) The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F Kennedy) [56]\n\n\nThe Dean Martin Show\nIn 1965, Martin launched his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974 He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years [59] The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, inappropriately hitting on women, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, Martin stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them Martin's TV show was a success The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language The show was often in the Top Ten Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.\n\n\nLater career\nFor nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for Reprise Records Martin recorded his final Reprise album, Once in a While in 1974, which was not issued until 1978 His final recordings were made for Warner Bros Records The Nashville Sessions was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with \"(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song\", which was recorded with Conway Twitty and made a respectable showing on the country charts A follow-up single, \"L.A Is My Home\"/\"Drinking Champagne\", came in 1985 The 1974 film drama Mr Ricco marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer [citation needed]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMartin was married three times He wed Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 ‚Äì July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania in 1941 The couple had four children: [69]\n\n\nIllness and death\nMartin, a lifelong heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993 He was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it Martin retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995, at the age of 78 [85] The lights of the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor Martin was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles [86] The crypt features the epitaph \"Everybody loves somebody sometime\", the first line of his signature song [87]\n\n\nTributes and legacy\nIn 1997, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear In 2005, Clark County, Nevada, renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in Rancho Mirage, California Martin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for Dino: The Essential Dean Martin, his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified \"Platinum\" [88]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nA number of Martin songs have been featured across popular culture for decades Hits such as \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head\", \"Sway\", \"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\", \"That's Amore\", and Martin's signature song \"Everybody Loves Somebody\" have been in

social media for its increasingly campy and outlandish storylines, as well as for subverting teen drama conventions and the expectations of the source material [160] [161] [162] [163] Rebecca Atler of Vulture deemed the series \"one of the weirdest teen soaps ever made,\" adding that it \"took tropes from gothic horror, fantasy, telenovelas, soap operas, comic books, gay art-house films, dark high-school comedies, musicals, and mafia movies and smushed them together into a pop-culture polycule‚Äîwhile the ensemble held it all together, putting it on like some sort of weekly vaudeville act.\" [163] Sam Bramesco of The Guardian called it \"a sprawling soap opera with a liberated relationship to reality, the finest specimen of its genre in its era\" and an \"unending parade of camp  [that] never once committed the cardinal sin of being boring.\" [160] Emma Stefansky of The Ringer opined that while some fans and journalists criticized subsequent seasons for \"relying less and less on coherent plotting to craft its mazelike narrative,\" such storylines \"only enhanced an already heightened experience.\" [161] Critics have attributed the escalation to more absurd storytelling to the series' standard-length seasons of approximately 20 episodes, no longer the norm, especially for teen dramas, in the wake of the streaming boom [160] [161] [163] [164] [165] Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly opined that \"the world where a network allows a lavish, sexy, teen genre drama to run off the rails for seven gloriously outlandish seasons no longer exists,\" and also noted that Riverdale amid the CW's programming shift toward unscripted, sports, and acquired content under its new ownership by Nexstar Media Group [165] Stefansky praised the CW for allowing a show such as Riverdale to run for seven seasons while a majority of shows are canceled prematurely in the current television landscape, [161] while Monteil opined that \"it feels like a miracle that a show as strange and eager for reinvention as Riverdale has existed for so long\" in a reboot- and IP-driven market [162] Ahead of the series finale, Mary Kate Carr of The A.V Club stated that Riverdale is the \"dying gasp\" of the teen drama of its era, as \"streaming services have saturated the market so much that it's hard to imagine a new teen soap cultivating enough hype or strong enough fandom to command an entire hall at Comic-Con.\" [164]\n\n\nControversy\nThe series changed the character Jughead Jones' sexual and romantic orientation from aromantic and asexual to heterosexual This deviation from the source material was met with criticism who described it as a-spec erasure [167] [168]\n\n\nPopularity on Netflix\nRiverdale has also been noted as being one of the most popular shows

most popular program on the streaming service in May [173]\n\n\nPopularity in Australia\nRiverdale notably enjoyed widespread success in Australia during its original run [174] During its original

[28] Dan Lin and Roy Lee became producers on the project, which eventually stalled as priorities shifted at the studio towards larger tentpole films, and was reimagined as a television series [27] The series Riverdale was in development at Fox, with the network landing the project in 2014 with a script deal plus penalty [29] However, Fox did not go forward with the project In 2015, the show's development was moved to the CW, [30] which officially ordered a pilot on January 29, 2016 [31] On March 7, 2017, The CW announced that the series had been renewed for a second season [32] On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a third season, which premiered October 10, 2018 [33] [34] On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a fourth season, that was planned to consist of 22 episodes [35] [36] [37] However, season four got shortened to 19 episodes instead because production was suspended on March 11, 2020, as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic [38] Only 19 of the 22 ordered episodes of the fourth season were completed before the coronavirus pandemic [39] [40] The fourth season premiered on October 9, 2019 [41]\n\n\nCasting\nOn February 9, 2016, Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse were cast as Betty Cooper and Jughead Jones, respectively [53] Lili Reinhart almost didn't land the role after her video-based audition, but after moving to LA and attending in-person casting, she managed to get chosen to play Betty Cooper [54] On February 24, 2016, KJ Apa was cast as Archie Andrews after a four-month worldwide talent search Apa was one of the last to audition and landed the role just days later Also that day, Ashleigh Murray was cast as Josie McCoy, the lead singer for the popular band Josie and the Pussycats, [55] and Luke Perry and Madelaine Petsch were also added as Fred Andrews, Archie's father, and Cheryl Blossom, respectively [56] [57] Two days later, Camila Mendes was cast as Veronica Lodge marking her first acting role in a television show [58]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming of the pilot began on March 14, 2016, and ended on March 31 in Vancouver, British Columbia [83] [84] Production on the remaining 12 episodes of season one began on September 7, 2016, in Vancouver [85] Sets included Pop Tate's Chock'lit Shoppe, a copy of the functioning diner used in the pilot that is so realistic a truck driver parked his 18-wheeler there, believing that it was open [86] Season two was also filmed in Vancouver and the nearby Fraser Valley [87] The aerial view of Riverdale is actually drawn from stock footage used in the series Pretty Little Liars and Gilmore Girls, and the landmark settings are the same used in both of the aforementioned series as well as in Hart of Dixie [88] Filming for the second season started on June 22, 2017, [89] and concluded on March 27, 2018 [90] Filming for the third season started on July 6, 2018 [91]\n\n\nHomages to other films and television shows\nSeveral reviewers have noted that the series' episode titles are often taken directly or slightly altered from the titles of older films [103] [104] For example, De Elizabeth of Teen Vogue points out that Riverdale's pilot episode was named \"River's Edge\" after the 1986 film of the same name, and the season finale takes its name from 1997's The Sweet Hereafter [105] Executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa notes that this is a deliberate choice, in order to hint at what will happen in that episode [105] References to the fictional setting of the Black Mirror episode \"San Junipero\" can be seen in season one as well as heard amongst dialogue in season two and three [106]\n\n\nMusic\nMusical performances are featured throughout the series, a blend of cover versions and originals Songs performed in episodes are released as digital

\"generally favorable reviews\" [153] Dave Nemetz of TVLine gave the series a \"B+\" saying that it turned out \"to be an artfully crafted, instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential.\"

out \"to be an artfully crafted, instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential.\" [159]\n\n\nLegacy\nOver the course of its run, Riverdale received widespread attention from critics and on social media for its increasingly campy and outlandish storylines, as well as for subverting teen drama conventions and the expectations of the source material [160] [161] [162] [163] Rebecca Atler of Vulture deemed the series \"one of the weirdest teen soaps ever made,\" adding that it \"took tropes from gothic horror, fantasy, telenovelas, soap operas, comic books, gay art-house films, dark high-school comedies, musicals, and mafia movies and smushed them together into a pop-culture polycule‚Äîwhile the ensemble held it all together, putting it on like some sort of weekly vaudeville act.\" [163] Sam Bramesco of The Guardian called it \"a sprawling soap opera with a liberated relationship to reality, the finest specimen of its genre in its era\" and an \"unending parade of camp  [that] never once committed the cardinal sin of being boring.\" [160] Emma Stefansky of The Ringer opined that while some fans and journalists criticized subsequent seasons for \"relying less and less on coherent plotting to craft its mazelike narrative,\" such storylines \"only enhanced an already heightened experience.\" [161] Critics have attributed the escalation to more absurd storytelling to the series' standard-length seasons of approximately 20 episodes, no longer the norm, especially for teen dramas, in the wake of the streaming boom [160] [161] [163] [164] [165] Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly opined that \"the world where a network allows a lavish, sexy, teen genre drama to run off the rails for seven gloriously outlandish seasons no longer exists,\" and also noted that Riverdale amid the CW's programming shift toward unscripted, sports, and acquired content under its new ownership by Nexstar Media Group [165] Stefansky praised the CW for allowing a show such as Riverdale to run for seven seasons while a majority of shows are canceled prematurely in the current television landscape, [161] while Monteil opined that \"it feels like a miracle that a show as strange and eager for reinvention as Riverdale has existed for so long\" in a reboot- and IP-driven market [162] Ahead of the series finale, Mary Kate Carr of The A.V Club stated that Riverdale is the \"dying gasp\" of the teen drama of its era, as \"streaming services have saturated the market so much that it's hard to imagine a new teen soap cultivating enough hype or strong enough fandom to command an entire hall at Comic-Con.\" [164]\n\n\nControversy\nThe series changed the character Jughead Jones' sexual and romantic orientation from aromantic and asexual to heterosexual This deviation from the source material was met with criticism who described it as a-spec erasure [167] [168]\n\n\nPopularity on Netflix\nRiverdale has also been noted as being one of the most popular shows worldwide on the popular streaming platform Netflix [169] The large number of fans watching the series on the platform also gave the show a large bump in the ratings for its season two premiere [170] This was later referenced on multiple occasions by The CW's president, Mark Pedowitz, who noted that they would watch Netflix numbers more closely for new series after seeing how Riverdale did on the platform [171] Season four was posted onto the website in the US on May 15, 2020, and remained in the top ten titles on the entire platform for the following month [172] In the UK, it was also the most popular program on the streaming service in May [173]\n\n\nPopularity in Australia\nRiverdale notably enjoyed widespread success in Australia during its original run [174] During its original broadcast, Riverdale was broadcast in the country as a Netflix Original Series hours after its US broadcast and during the late 2010s, was one of the most popular shows in the country regularly entering the national top 10 of the most viewed TV shows [169] [175] During the last week of October 2018 Riverdale was the number 1 show in Australia [169]\n\n\nRatings\nIn September 2017, it was

The party is led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election as a candidate from the party.\n\n**History**\n\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: –ü–∞—Ä—Ç—ñ—è —Ä—ñ—à—É—á–∏—Ö –∑–º—ñ–Ω), which existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga. The Party of Decisive Change was registered as a political party in Ukraine in April 2016 and was a minor player in Ukrainian politics.\n\n**Founding**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party was founded in 2019 by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a Ukrainian actor and comedian who won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. Zelenskyy founded the party as part of his presidential campaign, with the aim of creating a new, anti-corruption party that would appeal to young, urban Ukrainians.\n\n**Party winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election**\n\nIn late December 2018, Zelenskyy was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election. While lagging behind in January 2019, Zelenskyy began to lead the polls by March. He would go on to win the first round of the presidential elections, taking first place and moving on to the run-off against incumbent President Petro Poroshenko on 21 April 2019. Zelenskyy won the election with over 73% of the votes cast. Zelenskyy stated that the party would enter a coalition government with neither the Petro Poroshenko Bloc nor Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life.\n\n**Party since winning the 2019 parliamentary election**\n\nOn 11 November 2019, Oleksandr Korniyenko replaced Dmytro Razumkov as party chairman. Razumkov had been the party's chairman since its founding in 2019, but resigned from the position in November 2019, citing personal reasons.\n\n**Ideology and position**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party is positioned in the center on the political spectrum. Its political ideology has been described as populist and liberal. The party has been described as a valence populist party, which means that it appeals to a broad range of voters by promoting a vague, non-ideological agenda.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party has performed well in Ukrainian elections since its founding in 2019. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the party won 254 seats in the Verkhovna Rada, becoming the largest party in the parliament. In the 2020 Ukrainian local elections, the party won a majority of seats in many Ukrainian cities and regions.\n\n**Verkhovna Rada**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party has a strong presence in the Verkhovna Rada, the unicameral parliament of Ukraine. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the party won 254 seats in the Verkhovna Rada, becoming the largest party in the parliament. The party has used its majority in the parliament to pass several important pieces of legislation, including a law on the language of instruction in Ukrainian schools.\n\n**Presidential elections**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party has performed well in Ukrainian presidential elections since its founding in 2019. In the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, the party's candidate, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, won the election with over 73% of the votes cast. The party's candidate, Zelenskyy, has been widely credited with his victory in the election, which was seen as a rejection of the old, corrupt elite in Ukraine.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Servant of the People Party has been described as a populist party, which means that it appeals to a broad range of voters by promoting a vague, non-ideological agenda. The party has been seen as a threat to the old, corrupt elite in Ukraine, and has been praised for its anti-corruption efforts.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the Servant of the People Party", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Servant_of_the_People_(political_party)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: –ü–∞—Ä—Ç—ñ—è —Ä—ñ—à—É—á–∏—Ö –∑–º—ñ–Ω) [4] [5] that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga [15]\n\n\nFounding\nLegally, the party is the successor of the Party of Decisive Change (Ukrainian: –ü–∞—Ä—Ç—ñ—è —Ä—ñ—à—É—á–∏—Ö –∑–º—ñ–Ω) [4] [5] that existed since April 2016 and was founded by Eugene Yurdiga [15]\n\n\nParty winning the 2019 presidential and parliamentary election\nIn late December 2018, Zelenskyy was declared a presidential candidate from the party at the 2019 presidential election [17] While lagging behind in January 2019, Zelenskyy began to lead the polls by March [18] He would go on to win the first round of the presidential elections, taking first place and moving on to the run off against incumbent President Poroshenko on 21 April 2019, [19] winning the election with over 73% of the votes cast [20] Zelenskyy stated that the party would enter a coalition government with neither the Petro Poroshenko Bloc nor Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life [21]\n\n\nParty since winning the 2019 parliamentary election\nOn 11 November 2019, Oleksandr Korniyenko replaced Razumkov as party chairman [38]\n\n\nIdeology and position\nIt is positioned in the centre on the political spectrum, [58] [59] [60] while its political ideology has been described as populist [61] [62] [63] and liberal [64] It has been described as a valence populist party [65]\n\n\nElectoral performance\n\n\nVerkhovna Rada\n\n\nPresidential elections\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on May 1, 1994, in the village of Gvardeyskoye, Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, which is now part of Russia's Chechnya.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nChimaev was born to a Chechen family. He started wrestling at the age of five in the village of Gvardeyskoye. Chimaev won a bronze medal at the Russian National Championships in the junior level. In 2013, when he was 18, he emigrated to Sweden with his mother, joining his older brother. However, despite living in Sweden for years, Chimaev never acquired a Swedish citizenship, keeping his Russian citizenship. In 2023, Chimaev moved to the UAE.\n\nCombat sports career\n\nAfter moving to Sweden, Chimaev wrestled at multiple clubs, including BK Ath√©n. Considered one of the best freestyle wrestlers in the country, Chimaev won a gold medal at the 2016 and 2017 Swedish Freestyle National Championships at 86 kilograms, and in 2018 he did so at 92 kilograms. Chimaev has had a series of dominant performances in the tournament, posting an overall record of 12‚Äì0, which includes three pins, seven technical falls, and holds a combined score of 105 points, while only surrendering two himself, across all of his three showdowns. Chimaev has competed in a few judo tournaments and in four combat sambo fights.\n\nWrestling\n\nAfter moving to Sweden, Chimaev wrestled at multiple clubs, including BK Ath√©n.

Chimaev has had a series of dominant performances in the tournament, posting an overall record of 12‚Äì0, which includes three pins, seven technical falls, and holds a combined score of 105 points, while only surrendering two himself, across all of his three showdowns. Chimaev has competed in a few judo tournaments and in four combat sambo fights.\n\nMixed martial arts career\n\nChimaev first started training in MMA when he was 23 years old. He trained at Allstars Training Center in Stockholm, along with three-time UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir Latifi, and Reza Madadi among others. Gustafsson (one of his main training partners) told a Swedish reporter that Chimaev was one of the best fighters he had ever trained with, during a press conference in June 2019.\n\nEarly career\n\nIn an interview with ESPN, Chimaev claimed he was inspired to start training in MMA during a night at work where he took a 15-minute break to watch the Aldo vs McGregor main event. Chimaev stated, \"I was watching his [McGregor's] fight I was watching him fight Aldo I was sitting in night and was working I was taking rest for 15 minutes and watched his fight I always look at that like if the guys make so many money like millions and this stuff, why I can't do it now I'm a fighter, I'm a warrior and I have something special inside me I had to find some way and take out this to show to the people.\"\n\nBrave Combat Federation\n\nAfter having his first two professional fights in Sweden, Chimaev signed with Middle Eastern organization Brave Combat Federation. He was scheduled to make his promotional debut against Benjamin Bennett on 16 November 2018, at Brave CF 18. However, Bennett withdrew from the bout and was replaced by undefeated prospect Marko Kisiƒç. Chimaev won the fight via technical knockout in the first round after dropping his opponent with a left hand.\n\nUltimate Fighting Championship\n\nChimaev made his promotional debut in a middleweight bout against John Phillips, replacing Du≈°ko Todoroviƒá, on 16 July 2020, at UFC on ESPN 13. He won the fight via submission in the second round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award.\n\nTraining\n\nChimaev has trained at Allstar Training Center in Stockholm, Sweden since he was 23 years of age. He moved there to start his MMA career in 2017, after previously living in another Swedish town, Kalmar, where he trained at the local wrestling club. Chimaev continues to train alongside current and former UFC fighters such as Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir Latifi, and Reza Madadi, with the latter being his main trainer.\n\nFighting style\n\nChimaev often utilizes his freestyle wrestling in his fights to get his opponents to the ground. Once he is on top control, he employs different techniques to gain control over his opponents and land heavy ground-and-pound or seek submissions, while forcing his weight towards them. His grappling is very often compared to Khabib Nurmagomedov's, due to the similarities of the techniques, such as the handcuff lock and hooking the legs. Regarding strikes, Chimaev landed 192‚Äì2 in his first two UFC bouts utilizing this strategy. Chimaev also proved its effectiveness on the regional circuit as well, with a quick win over former two-time GHSA wrestling champion Sidney Wheeler after taking him down with an outside trip.\n\nPersonal life\n\nKhamzat carries a notable scar on his lip, which he got at the age of two when he fell down on concrete stairs, leaving him unable to breathe correctly through one nostril.\n\nAssociation with Ramzan Kadyrov\n\nChimaev is close to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov gifted Chimaev a Mercedes-Benz, which he crashed months later. Kadyrov also allegedly convinced Chimaev to not retire in March 2021 and go back to Chechnya, which led to speculation on the media on whether Chimaev had been forced to do so. Chimaev has sparred with Kadyrov, and appeared in multiple photoshoots with Kadyrov. In 2022, Chimaev began training Kadyrov's two teenage sons, Zelimkhan (Ali) and Adam. He was in Ali's corner at his professional MMA debut at ACA 150 in December, accompanied him to UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi, and took him to train to Tiger Muay Thai in Thailand.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n\nKhamzat Chimaev is a highly decorated mixed martial artist, having won numerous championships and awards throughout his career. He has competed in various organizations, including the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Brave Combat Federation, and others.

{"title": "Typhoon_Gaemi", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nThe origins of Typhoon Gaemi can be traced back to July 17, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed east of Palau [1] Environment was generally favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures of 27‚Äì28¬†¬∞C (81‚Äì82¬†¬∞F), low vertical wind shear and excellent poleward and equatorward outflow Satellite imagery indicated that formative convective banding had begun to wrap into the centre of circulation [2] After slowly consolidating for two days, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system on July 19, due to its rapidly consolidating broad low-level circulation center [3] Shortly after, both the JMA and the JTWC followed suit and upgraded the tropical depression, with the latter designating the system as 05W [4] [5] The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration followed suit a few hours later, upgrading the system from a low-pressure area to a depression and assigning it the name Carina [6] Early the following day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Gaemi by the JMA [7]\n\n\nPreparations\nAs Gaemi developed in the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA began issuing weather advisories on the system, as it interacted with the southwest Tropical Storm Prapiroon over the South China Sea [25] Initial forecasts issued by the agency projected that Gaemi would not make landfall on the Philippines, however, moisture from the storm would be drawn into the southwest monsoon and bring heavy rainfall and strong winds to the archipelago [26] Therefore, on July 22, the PAGASA issued a Signal No 1 wind warning in parts of the Babuyan Islands, Batanes, Cagayan, and Isabela The PAGASA expected winds of up to 61 km/h (69 mph) in these provinces [27] On the morning of July 23, PAGASA raised to Signal No 2 warning in Batanes as Gaemi's outer rainbands began to affect the province [28] Classes in all levels and several local government units were suspended in some areas of Luzon including Metro Manila on July 23 due to the storm [29] [30] Several commercial flights were cancelled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as well as flights in Basco, Cagayan, and Tuguegarao Ship travel was suspended in Itbayat [31] The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) in La Union raised a red alert on July 21, requiring all personnel to be readied for deployment Emergency staff were deployed to operations centers where stockpiles of supplies and vehicles were prepared Government offices in the province closed on the afternoon of July 23, with only emergency staff remaining Immuki Island was isolated as a result of suspended sailing Beaches in San Juan were closed to visitors, as well as Tangadan Falls in San Gabriel [32]\n\n\nPhilippines\nCombined with moisture from the southwest monsoon, the influence of Gaemi produced heavy rainfall across parts of the Philippines Heavy rainfall occurred in Albay, Aklan, Antique, Bataan, Batangas, Cavite, Capiz, Oriental Mindoro, Rizal, and Zambales Residents of Romblon received flood warnings and a yellow warning for heavy rainfall Two thoroughfares in the Zamboanga Peninsula and Cordillera Administrative Region, respectively, were blocked due to rockfalls, with access only possible to small vehicles [55] The Angat Dam saw water level increases of up to 3.8¬†m (12¬†ft) amidst rainfall from Gaemi [56] Downstream, the reservoir of La Mesa Dam in Quezon City also rose up causing water to overflow [57] On July 24, the third and highest alarm was raised on the Marikina River after it rose to 18.4¬†m (60¬†ft) before peaking at 20.7¬†m (68¬†ft), prompting evacuations [58] Strong water currents along the river also caused several barges to collide into the F Manalo Bridge in Pasig [59] In Taguig, floodwaters reached waist-level [60] Houses in coastal villages of Orani, Bataan were inundated by floodwaters Homes were also inundated by floodwaters in Samal, where rice and other crops received partial losses due to the flooding Soil erosion occurred in Baguio, damaging a riprap Strong winds impacted Olongapo, toppling electrical poles [31] A downed tree also blocked traffic in Quezon City [61] Several sections of the North Luzon Expressway were rendered impassable due to the torrential rain brought by the two weather conditions [62] Highways connecting Nueva Vizcaya with Benguet and Pangasinan were blocked by landslides, [63] with 34 houses in Kayapa also damaged [64] Severe weather conditions forced vessels to remain in ports, stranding 70 people in Southern Tagalog and Bicol Region, combined An additional 48 passengers were stranded in Pasacao, Camarines Sur [56] A total of 224 families were affected by the storm across Bataan, Camarines Sur, Iloilo City, Masbate, and Pampanga [61] A total of 1,215 schools were forced to postpone the start of the school year on July 29 due to damage or conversion into evacuation shelters [65] [66]A state of calamity was declared in Metro Manila and in the provinces of Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Ilocos Norte, Oriental Mindoro and Pampanga [67] [68] [69] due to the widespread floods that occurred in various areas of the region [70] The monsoon enhanced by Gaemi's impact on Luzon led to comparisons to 2009's Typhoon Ketsana, which was known locally as Tropical Storm Ondoy [71] [72] [73] The oil tanker MT Terra Nova, carrying around 1.5 million liters of industrial fuel, capsized and sank in 34¬†m (112¬†ft) depth of water [74] in Manila Bay off the coast of Limay, Bataan, causing an oil spill with a length of four kilometers [75]\n\n\nTaiwan\nGaemi killed 10 people in Taiwan as it approached the island; [51] a woman killed by a falling tree in Kaohsiung, and another death caused by a falling excavator in Sanxia District, New Taipei [76] Additionally, a woman was killed and her son was critically injured after a wall collapsed and struck their car in Hualien City, [77] three more died in Chiayi County, [78] an elderly man was killed by a landslide in Cishan District, [79] another was killed in a related car accident in Yunlin County, [80] and one more death occurred in Tainan [81] While docked in southern Taiwan, the freighter Fu Shun capsized, [75] killing the ship's captain [82] Three other vessels ran aground near Tainan [83] Across the island, 902 people were injured, two others were missing and 262,000 were left without power [84] [40] [85] Up to 1,204.5 mm (47.4 in) of rainfall was observed in the Maolin District of Kaohsiung [86] A total of 1,232 people were displaced by the typhoon and were placed into 279 emergency camps [87] Initial estimates indicate that Gaemi caused economic losses of US$245¬†million [52]\n\n\nJapan\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said that rainfall on July 25 could reach 8¬†in (200¬†mm) in the Yaeyama Islands, 5.9¬†in (150¬†mm) on Okinawa Island and nearby areas, and 4¬†in (100¬†mm) in Miyako-jima within a 24-hour period [47] Authorities in Okinawa Prefecture warned residents of the Sakishima Islands to remain indoors and for boats to not leave port [48] Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways cancelled 100 flights in and out of Ishigaki, Miyako-jima, and Naha [49]\n\n\nImpact and aftermath\nCombined with moisture from the southwest monsoon, the influence of Gaemi produced heavy rainfall across parts of the Philippines

cyclone that affected several countries in East Asia in July 2019. The storm caused widespread damage and loss of life, particularly in the Philippines, Taiwan, and China.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTyphoon Gaemi was a tropical cyclone that formed in the western Pacific Ocean in July 2019. The storm caused significant damage and loss of life in several countries, including the Philippines, Taiwan, and China. This article provides an overview of the storm's impact, including the evacuation and rescue efforts, damage and loss of life, and the economic impact of the storm.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nThe origins of Typhoon Gaemi can be traced back to July 17, when the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area had formed east of Palau. The environment was generally favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with warm sea surface temperatures of 27‚Äì28 ¬∞C (81‚Äì82 ¬∞F), low vertical wind shear, and excellent poleward and equatorward outflow. Satellite imagery indicated that formative convective banding had begun to wrap into the centre of circulation.\n\nAfter slowly consolidating for two days, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system on July 19, due to its rapidly consolidating broad low-level circulation center. Shortly after, both the JMA and the JTWC followed suit and upgraded the tropical depression, with the latter designating the system as 05W. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration followed suit a few hours later, upgrading the system from a low-pressure area to a depression and assigning it the name Carina.\n\nEarly the following day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Gaemi by the JMA.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nAs Gaemi developed in the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA began issuing weather advisories on the system, as it interacted with the southwest Tropical Storm Prapiroon over the South China Sea. Initial forecasts issued by the agency projected that Gaemi would not make landfall on the Philippines, however, moisture from the storm would be drawn into the southwest monsoon and bring heavy rainfall and strong winds to the archipelago.\n\nTherefore, on July 22, the PAGASA issued a Signal No 1 wind warning in parts of the Babuyan Islands, Batanes, Cagayan, and Isabela. The PAGASA expected winds of up to 61 km/h (69 mph) in these provinces. On the morning of July 23, PAGASA raised to Signal No 2 warning in Batanes as Gaemi's outer rainbands began to affect the province.\n\nClasses in all levels and several local government units were suspended in some areas of Luzon, including Metro Manila, on July 23 due to the storm. Several commercial flights were cancelled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as well as flights in Basco, Cagayan, and Tuguegarao. Ship travel was suspended in Itbayat.\n\n**Philippines**\n\nCombined with moisture from the southwest monsoon, the influence of Gaemi produced heavy rainfall across parts of the Philippines. Heavy rainfall occurred in Albay, Aklan, Antique, Bataan, Batangas, Cavite, Capiz, Oriental Mindoro, Rizal, and Zambales.\n\nResidents of Romblon received flood warnings and a yellow warning for heavy rainfall. Two thoroughfares in the Zamboanga Peninsula and Cordillera Administrative Region, respectively, were blocked due to rockfalls, with access only possible to small vehicles.\n\nThe Angat Dam saw water level increases of up to 3.8 m (12 ft) amidst rainfall from Gaemi. Downstream, the reservoir of La Mesa Dam in Quezon City also rose up causing water to overflow.\n\nOn July 24, the third and highest alarm was raised on the Marikina River after it rose to 18.4 m (60 ft) before peaking at 20.7 m (68 ft), prompting evacuations. Strong water currents along the river also caused several barges to collide into the F Manalo Bridge in Pasig.\n\nIn Taguig, floodwaters reached waist-level. Houses in coastal villages of Orani, Bataan were inundated by floodwaters. Homes were also inundated by floodwaters in Samal, where rice and other crops received partial losses due to the flooding.\n\nSoil erosion occurred in Baguio, damaging a riprap. Strong winds impacted Olongapo, toppling electrical poles. A downed tree also blocked traffic in Quezon City.\n\nSeveral sections of the North Luzon Expressway were rendered impassable due to the torrential rain brought by the two weather conditions. Highways connecting Nueva Vizcaya with Benguet and Pangasinan were blocked by landslides, with 34 houses in Kayapa also damaged.\n\nSevere weather conditions forced vessels to remain in ports, stranding 70 people in Southern Tagalog and Bicol Region, combined. An additional 48 passengers were stranded in Pasacao, Camarines Sur.\n\nA total of 224 families were affected by the storm across Bataan, Camarines Sur, Iloilo City, Masbate, and Pampanga. A total of 1,215 schools were forced to postpone the start of the school year on July 29 due to damage or conversion into evacuation shelters.\n\n**Taiwan**\n\nGaemi killed 10 people in Taiwan as it approached the island. A woman was killed by a falling tree in Kaohsiung, and another death caused by a falling excavator in Sanxia District, New Taipei.\n\nAdditionally, a woman was killed and her son was critically injured after a wall collapsed and struck their car in Hualien City. Three more died in Chiayi County, an elderly man was killed by a landslide in Cishan District, and another was killed in a related car accident in Yunlin County.\n\nWhile docked in southern Taiwan, the freighter Fu Shun capsized, killing the ship's captain. Three other vessels ran aground near Tainan.\n\nAcross the island, 902 people were injured, two others were missing, and 262,000 were left without power. Up to 1,204.5 mm (47.4 in) of rainfall was observed in the Maolin District of Kaohsiung.\n\nA total of 1,232 people were displaced by the typhoon and were placed into 279 emergency camps. Initial estimates indicate that Gaemi caused economic losses of US$245 million.\n\n**China**\n\nGaemi made landfall in China as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of around 120 km/h (75 mph) in the Xiuyu District of Putian in Fujian Province.\n\nThere were 49 deaths confirmed in the country, 48 of them in Hunan Province, where 35 others were missing. 15 people were killed, 21 were missing, and six more were injured after a mudslide struck a homestay in Hengyang, Hunan.\n\nAbout 1,000 homes were damaged and 1,345 road collapses were reported in Zixing, where 30 people died.\n\n**North Korea**\n\nGaemi's remnants also hit North Korea, resulting in heavy flooding in North Pyongan Province which stranded 5,000 people.

He is best known for developing the Mixtur-Trautonium, an electronic instrument that opened up new possibilities for sound and music.\n\nEarly life\n---------\n\nOskar Sala was born in Greiz, Thuringia, Germany. During his youth, he studied piano and organ, performing classical piano concerts as a teenager. His early musical education laid the foundation for his future work in composition and electronic music.\n\nIn 1929, Sala moved to Berlin to study piano and composition with composer and violist Paul Hindemith at the Berlin Conservatory. He was exposed to a wide range of musical styles and techniques, which would later influence his work with electronic music. While at the conservatory, Sala also followed the experiments of Dr. Friedrich Trautwein, at the school's laboratory, learning to play with Trautwein's pioneer electronic instrument, the Trautonium.\n\nMixtur-Trautonium\n-----------------\n\nIn 1948, Sala further developed the Trautonium into the Mixtur-Trautonium. This instrument allowed for the creation of new sounds and timbres, opening up new possibilities for electronic music. Sala's invention of the Mixtur-Trautonium also opened up the field of subharmonics, the symmetric counterpart to overtones, so that a thoroughly distinct tuning evolved.\n\nPioneering music therapist Maria Sch√ºppel studied and worked with Sala during the 1950s. Sch√ºppel was one of the first music therapists to use electronic music in her work, and her collaboration with Sala helped to establish the Mixtur-Trautonium as a valuable tool in music therapy.\n\nFilm work\n---------\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Sala worked on many film scores. He collaborated with prominent directors such as Veit Harlan and Fritz Lang, creating electronic soundtracks for their films.

The idea of reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh is a popular concept in Christmas folklore and has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature, film, and television.\n\n**Origins and History**\n\nThe first reference to Santa's sleigh being pulled by a reindeer appears in \"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\", an 1821 illustrated children's poem published in New York. The names of the author and the illustrator are not known. The poem, with eight colored lithographic illustrations, was published by William B Gilley as a small paperback book entitled The Children's Friend: A New-Year's Present, to the Little Ones from Five to Twelve. The illustration to the first verse features a sleigh with a sign saying \"REWARDS\" being pulled by an unnamed single reindeer.\n\nThe concept of reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh gained popularity in the 19th century, particularly with the publication of Clement C Moore's poem \"A Visit from St Nicholas\" in 1823. This poem, also known as \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\", is largely credited for the modern Christmas lore that includes eight named reindeer. However, it was not until the 20th century that the concept of reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh became a central part of Christmas folklore.\n\n**Single Reindeer**\n\nThe first reference to Santa's sleigh being pulled by a reindeer appears in \"Old Santeclaus with Much Delight\", an 1821 illustrated children's poem published in New York. The names of the author and the illustrator are not known. The poem, with eight colored lithographic illustrations, was published by William B Gilley as a small paperback book entitled The Children's Friend: A New-Year's Present, to the Little Ones from Five to Twelve. The illustration to the first verse features a sleigh with a sign saying \"REWARDS\" being pulled by an unnamed single reindeer.\n\nThe concept of a single reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh is a relatively rare concept in Christmas folklore. However, it has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature and film. The idea of a single reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh may have originated from the idea of a single horse or oxen pulling a sleigh, which was a common mode of transportation in rural areas during the 19th century.\n\n**Eight Reindeer**\n\nThe 1823 poem by Clement C Moore, A Visit from St Nicholas (also known as 'Twas the Night Before Christmas), is largely credited for the modern Christmas lore that includes eight named reindeer. The names of the eight reindeer are:\n\n1. Dasher\n2. Dancer\n3. Prancer\n4. Vixen\n5. Comet\n6. Cupid\n7. Donner\n8. Blitzen\n\nThe concept of eight reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh has become a central part of Christmas folklore and has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature, film, and television. The idea of eight reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh may have originated from the idea of a team of eight horses or oxen pulling a sleigh, which was a common mode of transportation in rural areas during the 19th century.\n\n**L. Frank Baum's Ten Reindeer**\n\nL Frank Baum's story The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1902) includes a list of ten reindeer, none of which match those in A Visit from St Nicholas. Santa's principal reindeer are Flossie and Glossie, and he gathers others named Racer and Pacer, Reckless and Speckless, Fearless and Peerless, and Ready and Steady. The concept of ten reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh is a relatively rare concept in Christmas folklore and has been depicted in only a few forms of media, including literature and film.\n\nThe idea of ten reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh may have originated from the idea of a team of ten horses or oxen pulling a sleigh, which was a common mode of transportation in rural areas during the 19th century. However, the concept of ten reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh has not gained widespread popularity and remains a relatively obscure concept in Christmas folklore.\n\n**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer**\n\nRudolph's story was originally written in verse by Robert L May for the Montgomery Ward chain of department stores in 1939, and it was published as a book to be given to children in the store at Christmas time. The story tells the tale of a young reindeer named Rudolph who is born with a glowing red nose. Despite his initial rejection by the other reindeer, Rudolph's unique ability to light the way for Santa's sleigh on foggy nights makes him a valuable member of the team.\n\nThe concept of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has become a central part of Christmas folklore and has been depicted in various forms of media, including literature, film, and television. The idea of Rudolph as a misfit reindeer who finds acceptance and success through his unique abilities has become a powerful and enduring theme in Christmas folklore.\n\n**Appearances in Popular Media**\n\nSanta Claus's reindeer have appeared in various forms of media, including literature, film, and television.

notably the Palatine Chapel of Charlemagne at his palace in Aix-la-Chapelle (now Aachen) It was built in about 800 and served as the  oratory of the Emperor In 1238 Louis IX had already built one royal chapel, attached to the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye This earlier chapel had only one level; its plan, on a much grander scale, was adapted for Sainte-Chapelle  [4]\n\n\nThe Royal Chapel\nSainte-Chapelle, in the courtyard of the royal palace on the √éle de la Cit√© (now part of a later administrative complex known as La Conciergerie), was built to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ, which included the crown of thorns, the Image of Edessa, and some thirty other items Louis purchased his Passion relics from Baldwin II, the Latin emperor at Constantinople, for the sum of 135,000 livres This money was paid to the Venetians to whom the relics had been pawned \n\n\nModifications (16th‚Äì18th century)\nThe chapel underwent considerable modification in the centuries that followed A new two-story building, the Treasury of Chartres, was attached to the chapel on the north side shortly after it was completed It remained until 1783, when it was demolished to build the new Palace of Justice  Another building, which served as a vestiary and sacristy, as well as residence for the guardian of the treasury, was placed on the north side In the 15th century, Louis X of France built a monumental enclosed stairway from the courtyard on the south side to the upper level This was damaged by fire in 1630, rebuilt, but finally demolished Fires in the palace in 1630 and 1776 also caused considerable damage, especially to the furniture, and a flood in the winter of 1689‚Äì1690 caused major damage to the painted walls of the lower chapel The original stained glass on the ground floor was removed, and the floor raised The original ground floor glass was replaced by Gothic-style windows in the 19th century [10]\n\n\nRevolutionary vandalism (18th century)\nSainte-Chapelle, as both a symbol of religion and royalty, was a prime target for vandalism during the French Revolution The chapel was turned into a storehouse for grain, and the sculpture and royal emblems on the exterior were smashed [11] The spire was pulled down Some of  the stained glass was broken or dispersed, but nearly two-thirds of the glass today is original; some of the original glass was relocated in other windows, The sacred relics were dispersed although some survive as the \"relics of Sainte-Chapelle\" in the treasury of Notre-Dame de Paris  Various reliquaries, including the grande ch√¢sse, were melted down for their precious metal.\n\n\nRestoration (19th‚Äì21st century)\nBetween 1803 and 1837, the upper chapel was turned into a depository for the archives of the Palace of Justice next door [12] The lower two meters (6¬†ft 7¬†in) of stained glass was removed to facilitate working light Some of the glass was used to replace broken glass in other windows, and other panes were put on the market [13] \nBeginning in 1835, scholars, archeologists and writers demanded that the church be preserved and restored to its medieval state In 1840, under King Louis-Philippe, a long campaign of restoration began It was first conducted by F√©lix Duban, then by Jean-Baptiste Lassus and √âmile Boeswillwald, with the young Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc as an assistant The work continued for twenty-eight years, and served as a training ground for a generation of archeologists and restorers [12] It was faithful to the original drawings and descriptions of the chapel that survived [14]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe royal chapel is a prime example of the phase of Gothic architectural style called \"Rayonnant\", marked by its sense of weightlessness and strong vertical emphasis It stands squarely upon a lower chapel, which served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace, which was the seat of government.\n\n\nDescription\nThe royal chapel is a prime example of the phase of Gothic architectural style called \"Rayonnant\", marked by its sense of weightlessness and strong vertical emphasis It stands squarely upon a lower chapel, which served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace, which was the seat of government.\n\n\nExterior\nThe contemporary visitor entering the courtyard of the Royal Palace would have been met by the sight of a grand ceremonial staircase (the Grands Degres) to their right and the north flank and eastern apse of the Sainte-Chapelle to their left The chapel exterior shows many of the typical characteristics of Rayonnant architecture‚Äîdeep buttresses surmounted by pinnacles, crocketted gables around the roof-line and vast windows subdivided by bar tracery The internal division into upper and lower chapels is clearly marked on the outside by a string-course, the lower walls pierced by smaller windows with a distinctive spherical triangle shape Despite its decoration, the exterior is relatively simple and austere, devoid of flying buttresses or major sculpture and giving little hint of the richness within.\n\n\nWest front\nThe west front is composed of a porch two levels high, beneath a flamboyant Gothic rose window installed in the upper chapel in the 15th century At the top is a pointed arch an oculus window, and a balustrade around the bottom of the roof, decorated with interlaced fleur-de-lys emblems placed by Charles V of France On either side of the porch are towers which contain the narrow winding stairways to the upper chapel, and which also hide the buttresses The spires of the towers are also decorated with royal fleur-des-lys beneath a sculpted crown of thorns This decoration dates to the 15th century, and was restored in about 1850 by Geoffroy-Dechaume [21]\n\n\nSpire\nThe current spire, thirty-three meters (108¬†ft) high, is the fifth to be built at Sainte-Chapelle since the 13th century The appearance of the first is unknown, but the second, built in 1383 under Charles V, is pictured in an illustration of the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry [21] He replaced it with another in about 1460, but this spire burned in 1630 It was replaced by another, which was destroyed following the French Revolution in 1793 The present spire was built of cedar wood by the architect Lassus beginning in 1852 The sculpture decorating the spire was designed in 1853 by Geoffroy-Dechaume The painter-designer Steinheil designed the sculpture at the base of the spire, and his face appears as two of the apostles, Saint Thomas and Saint Bartholomew Above the gables are statues representing angels carrying the instruments of The Passion Above the chevet is a statue of the Archangel Michael slaying a dragon Around the feet of the archangel are sculptures, also designed by Geoffroy-Dechaume, of eight persons, portrayed by workers of the reconstruction, laying wreaths at the Archangel's feet [21]\n\n\nInterior\nSaint Chapelle, built to house a reliquary, was itself like a precious reliquary turned inside out (with the richest decoration on the inside) [22] Although the interior is dominated by the stained glass (see below), every inch of the remaining wall surface and the vault was also richly coloured and decorated Analysis of remaining paint fragments reveals that the original colours were much brighter than those favoured by the 19th-century restorers and would have been closer to the colours of the stained glass The quatrefoils of the dado arcade were painted with scenes of saints and martyrs and inset with painted and gilded glass, emulating Limoges enamels, while rich textiles hangings added to the richness of the interior.\n\n\nLower Chapel\nThe lower chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was used by the non-royal inhabitants of the neighbouring Royal Palace The portal of the chapel represents the Virgin Mary as a column statue The portal, and almost all the decoration of the chapel, was created by Geoffroy-Duchaume between 1854 and 1858 The primary decorative themes of the sculpture, columns and murals are the Fleur-de-Lys emblem of Louis IX and a stylised castle, the coat of arms of Blanche of Castile, the mother of Louis IX [24]\n\n\nUpper Chapel\nThe upper chapel is reached by narrow stairways in the towers from lower level The structure is simple; a rectangle 33 by 10.7 meters (108 by 35¬†ft), with four traverses and an apse at the east end with seven bays of windows The most striking features are the walls, which appear to be almost entirely made of stained glass; a total of 670 square meters (7,200¬†sq¬†ft) of glass, not counting the rose window at the west end  This was a clever illusion created by the master builder; each vertical support of the windows is composed of seven slender columns, which disguise their full thickness In addition, the walls and windows are braced on the exterior by two belts of iron chain, one at the mid-level of the bays and the other at the top of the lancets; these are hidden behind the bars holding the stained glass Additional metal supports are hidden under the eaves of the roof to brace the windows against the wind or other stress Furthermore, the windows of the nave are slightly higher than the windows in the apse (15.5 meters, 51¬†ft compared with 13.7 meters, 45¬†ft), making the chapel appear longer than it actually is [26]\n\n\nVaults of the upper chapel\nThe most famous features of the chapel, among the finest of their type in the world, are the fifteen great stained-glass windows in the nave and apse of the upper chapel, which date from the mid-13th century, as well as the later rose window (put in place in the 15th century) The stone wall surface is reduced to little more than a delicate framework The thousands of small pieces of glass turn the walls into great screens of coloured light, largely deep blues and reds, which gradually change in intensity from hour to hour [28]\n\n\nStained glass\nThe

walls into great screens of coloured light, largely deep blues and reds, which gradually change in intensity from hour to hour [28]\n\n\nThe west rose window\nThe rose window at the west of the upper chapel was made in the late 15th century, later than the other windows It is a very fine example of the flamboyant Gothic style, named for the flamelike curling designs It is nine meters in diameter, and is composed of eighty-nine separate panels representing scenes of the Apocalypse The 15th-century glass artists used a new technique, called silver stain, which allowed them to paint on the glass with enamel paints, and to use fire to fuse the paint onto the glass  This allowed them to modify the color, and create shading and other fine details It was thoroughly cleaned in 2014‚Äì15, giving it greater brightness and clarity [31]\n\n\nStained glass from Saint-Chapelle in other museums\nSome of the early stained glass that was removed from Saint-Chapelle is now found in the other museums, including the National Museum of the Middle Ages, or Musee de Cluny, in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London \n\n\nArt and decoration\nMost of the sculpture of the portals was destroyed during the French Revolution, but between 1855 and 1870 the sculptor Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume was able to recreate it, using 18th century descriptions and engravings One of the major works he recreated was the tympanum over the portal of the upper chapel, with a figure of Christ giving a blessing, with the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist alongside him  Two angels are behind him, holding the crown of thorns and the cross, the most famous relics of the chapel On the lintel below, the sculpture depicts Saint Michael weighing the souls of the dead, with those sent to heaven on the left and those damned on the right [26]  Sculpted Biblical scenes from the Old Testament fill the panels on lower walls, including the Creation and Noah's ark They were made by Geoffroy-Dechaume in 1869‚Äì70.\n\n\nSculpture\nMost of the sculpture of the portals was destroyed during the French Revolution, but between 1855 and 1870 the sculptor Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume was able to recreate

including the Creation and Noah's ark They were made by Geoffroy-Dechaume in 1869‚Äì70.\n\n\nPainting\nThe goal of the two principal architects of the 19th century restoration, Durban and Lassus, was to recreate the interior, as much as possible, as it appeared in the 13th century They collected traces of the original polychrome paint from the columns, and in 1842 presented a comprehensive plan for interior decoration In the soubassements, the lower portions where no traces of original color were found, they used a neutral tone, to avoid conflicting with the colors of the stained glass windows For their palette of colors on other decoration, they drew upon the illuminations of a 13th-century book of Psalm from the Royal Library They systematically repainted the forty-four 13th-century quadrilobe medallions on the stone arches of the soubassements, which depicted the martyrdom of saints presented against a gilded background  In 1845 Steinheil continued by repainting all of the medallions of the nave, with the exception of those in the two royal alcoves, following the original compositions  In 1983 the Service of Historic Monuments cleaned four of the medallions which had not been restored, and un-restored two which had been repainted, to study the original traces of paint from before 1845 [33]\n\n\nThe relics and the reliquary\nThe principal relics for which the chapel was built were the crown of thorns, believed to have been worn by Christ during his Passion, and a small piece of the cross on which he was crucified These were found Constantinople, which had been captured by the Crusaders in 1204, and was then ruled by Baudouin II of Cortenay Baudouin agreed to sell the crown for 135,000 livres, which went primarily to Venetian bankers, to whom he had mortgaged the crown to pay for the defence of the city By purchasing the crown, Louis gained the prestige of funding the conquest of Constantinople, as well as displaying his personal devotion The crown arrived in August 1239 and was placed in the earlier royal chapel of St Nicholas, near the palace Two years later, he made an additional purchase from Baudouin of a piece of the true cross and other relics related to the Passion, which were brought to Paris in September 1241 Thereafter, on each Holy Friday, the day of the Crucifixion, he conducted a solemn ceremony at Sainte-Chapelle, in which the relic was brought out and displayed to the faithful [12]\n\n\nOrgan\nAn organ is attested from the beginning; it was replaced in 1493, 1550 and 1762 it was not until July 1791 when the organ was transferred from the Sainte-Chapelle to Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois due to the French Revolution The organ was built by Fran√ßois-Henri Clicquot, in a case designed by Pierre-No√´l Rousset in 1752 However, its Neoclassical style seems to some writers to be too modern for that date.\n\n\nOther Saintes-Chapelles\nPrior to the dissolution of the Sainte-Chapelle in 1803, following the French Revolution, the term \"Sainte-Chapelle royale\" also referred not only to the building but to the chapelle itself, the choir of Sainte-Chapelle However, the term was also applied to a number of other buildings \nLouis IX's chapel inspired several \"copies\", in the sense of royal or ducal chapels of broadly similar architectural form, built to house relics, particularly fragments of Louis' Passion Relics given by the King [36] Such chapels were normally attached to a ducal palace (e.g Bourges, Riom), or else to an Abbey with particular links to the royal family (e.g St-Germer-de-Fly) As with the original, such Holy Chapels were nearly always additional to the regular palatine or abbatial chapel, with their own dedicated clergy‚Äîusually established as a college of canons [37] For the patrons, such chapels served not only as public expressions of personal piety but also as valuable diplomatic tools, encouraging important visitors to come and venerate their relics and showing their connection to the French crown Notable Saintes-Chapelles in France include:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal

stairways to the upper chapel, and which also hide the buttresses The spires of the towers are also decorated with royal fleur-des-lys beneath a sculpted crown of thorns This decoration dates to the 15th century, and was restored in about 1850 by Geoffroy-Dechaume [21]\n\n\nSpire\nThe current spire, thirty-three meters (108¬†ft) high, is the fifth to be built at Sainte-Chapelle since the 13th century The appearance of the first is unknown, but the second, built in 1383 under Charles V, is pictured in an illustration of the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry [21] He replaced it with another in about 1460, but this spire burned in 1630 It was replaced by another, which was destroyed following the French Revolution in 1793 The present spire was built of cedar wood by the architect Lassus beginning in 1852 The sculpture decorating the spire was designed in 1853 by Geoffroy-Dechaume The painter-designer Steinheil designed the sculpture at the base of the spire, and his face appears as two of the apostles, Saint Thomas and Saint Bartholomew Above the gables are statues representing angels carrying the instruments of The Passion Above the chevet is a statue of the Archangel Michael slaying a dragon Around the feet of the archangel are sculptures, also designed by Geoffroy-Dechaume, of eight persons, portrayed by workers of the reconstruction, laying wreaths at the Archangel's feet [21]\n\n\nInterior\nSaint Chapelle, built to house a reliquary, was itself like a precious reliquary turned inside out (with the richest decoration on the inside) [22] Although the interior is dominated by the stained glass (see below), every inch of the remaining wall surface and the vault was also richly coloured and decorated Analysis of remaining paint fragments reveals that the original colours were much brighter than those favoured by the 19th-century restorers and would have been closer to the colours of the stained glass The quatrefoils of the dado arcade were painted with scenes of saints and martyrs and inset with painted and gilded glass, emulating Limoges enamels, while rich textiles hangings added to the richness of the interior.\n\n\nLower Chapel\nThe lower chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was used by the non-royal inhabitants of the neighbouring Royal Palace The portal of the chapel represents the Virgin Mary as a column statue The portal, and almost all the decoration of the chapel, was created by Geoffroy-Duchaume between 1854 and 1858 The primary decorative themes of the sculpture, columns and murals are the Fleur-de-Lys emblem of Louis IX and a stylised castle, the coat of arms of Blanche of Castile, the mother of Louis IX [24]\n\n\nUpper Chapel\nThe upper chapel is reached by narrow stairways in the towers from lower level The structure is simple; a rectangle 33 by 10.7 meters (108 by 35¬†ft), with four traverses and an apse at the east end with seven bays of windows The most striking features are the walls, which appear to be almost entirely made of stained glass; a total of 670 square meters (7,200¬†sq¬†ft) of glass, not counting the rose window at the west end  This was a clever illusion created by the master builder; each vertical support of the windows is composed of seven slender columns, which disguise their full thickness In addition, the walls and windows are braced on the exterior by two belts of iron chain, one at the mid-level of the bays and the other at the top of the lancets; these are hidden behind the bars holding the stained glass Additional metal supports are hidden under the eaves of the roof to brace the windows against the wind or other stress Furthermore, the windows of the nave are slightly higher than the windows in the apse (15.5 meters, 51¬†ft compared with 13.7 meters, 45¬†ft), making the chapel appear longer than it actually is [26]\n\n\nVaults of the upper chapel\nThe most famous features of the chapel, among the finest of their type in the world, are the fifteen great stained-glass windows in the nave and apse of the upper chapel, which date from the mid-13th century, as well as the later rose window (put in place in the 15th century) The stone wall surface is reduced to little more than a delicate framework The thousands of small pieces of glass turn the walls into great screens of coloured light, largely deep blues and reds, which gradually change in intensity from hour to hour [28]\n\n\nStained glass\nThe most famous features of the chapel, among the finest of their type in the world, are the fifteen great stained-glass windows in the nave and apse of the upper chapel, which date from the mid-13th century, as well as the later rose window (put in place in the 15th century) The stone wall surface is reduced to little more than a delicate framework The thousands of small pieces of glass turn the walls into great screens of coloured light, largely deep blues and reds, which gradually change in intensity from hour to hour [28]\n\n\nThe west rose window\nThe rose window at the west of the upper chapel was made in the late 15th century, later than the other windows It is a very fine example of the flamboyant Gothic style, named for the flamelike curling designs It is nine meters in diameter, and is composed of eighty-nine separate panels representing scenes of the Apocalypse The 15th-century glass artists used a new technique, called silver stain, which allowed them to paint on the glass with enamel paints, and to use fire to fuse the paint onto the glass  This allowed them to modify the color, and create shading and other fine details It was thoroughly cleaned in 2014‚Äì15, giving it greater brightness and clarity [31]\n\n\nStained glass from Saint-Chapelle in other museums\nSome of the early stained glass that was removed from Saint-Chapelle is now found in the other museums, including the National Museum of the Middle Ages, or Musee de Cluny, in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London \n\n\nArt and decoration\nMost of the sculpture of the portals was destroyed during the French Revolution, but between 1855 and 1870 the sculptor Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume was able to recreate it, using 18th century descriptions and engravings One of the major works he recreated was the tympanum over the portal of the upper chapel, with a figure of Christ giving a blessing, with the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist alongside him  Two angels are behind him, holding the crown of thorns and the cross, the most famous relics of the chapel On the lintel below, the sculpture depicts Saint Michael weighing the souls of the dead, with those sent to heaven on the left and those damned on the right [26]  Sculpted Biblical scenes from the Old Testament fill the panels on lower walls, including the Creation and Noah's ark They were made by Geoffroy-Dechaume in 1869‚Äì70.\n\n\nSculpture\nMost of the sculpture of the portals was destroyed during the French Revolution, but between

principal architects of the 19th century restoration, Durban and Lassus, was to recreate the interior, as much as possible, as it appeared in the 13th century They collected traces of the original polychrome paint from the columns, and in 1842 presented a comprehensive plan for interior decoration In the soubassements, the lower portions where no traces of original color were found, they used a neutral tone, to avoid conflicting with the colors of the stained glass windows For their palette of colors on other decoration, they drew upon the illuminations of a 13th-century book of Psalm from the Royal Library They systematically repainted the forty-four 13th-century quadrilobe medallions on the stone arches of the soubassements, which depicted the martyrdom of saints presented against a gilded background  In 1845 Steinheil continued by repainting all of the medallions of the nave, with the exception of those in the two royal alcoves, following the original compositions  In 1983 the Service of Historic Monuments cleaned four of the medallions which had not been restored, and un-restored two which had been repainted, to study the original traces of paint from before 1845 [33]\n\n\nThe relics and the reliquary\nThe principal relics for which the chapel was built were the crown of thorns, believed to have been worn by Christ during his Passion, and a small piece of the cross on which he was crucified These were found Constantinople, which had been captured by the Crusaders in 1204, and was then ruled by Baudouin II of Cortenay Baudouin agreed to sell the crown for 135,000 livres, which went primarily to Venetian bankers, to whom he had mortgaged the crown to pay for the defence of the city By purchasing the crown, Louis gained the prestige of funding the conquest of Constantinople, as well as displaying his personal devotion The crown arrived in August 1239 and was placed in the earlier royal chapel of St Nicholas, near the palace Two years later, he made an additional purchase from Baudouin of a piece of the true cross and other relics related to the Passion, which were brought to Paris in September 1241 Thereafter, on each Holy Friday, the day of the Crucifixion, he conducted a solemn ceremony at Sainte-Chapelle, in which the relic was brought out and displayed to the faithful [12]\n\n\nOrgan\nAn organ is attested from the beginning; it was replaced in 1493, 1550 and 1762 it was not until July 1791 when the organ was transferred from the Sainte-Chapelle to Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois due to the French Revolution The organ was built by Fran√ßois-Henri Clicquot, in a case designed by Pierre-No√´l Rousset in 1752 However, its Neoclassical style seems to some writers to be too modern for that date.\n\n\nOther Saintes-Chapelles\nPrior to the dissolution of the Sainte-Chapelle in 1803, following the French Revolution, the term \"Sainte-Chapelle royale\" also referred not only to the building but to the chapelle itself, the choir of Sainte-Chapelle However, the term was also applied to a number of other buildings \nLouis IX's chapel inspired several \"copies\", in the sense of royal or ducal chapels of broadly similar architectural form, built to house relics, particularly fragments of Louis' Passion Relics given by the King [36] Such chapels were normally attached to a ducal palace (e.g Bourges, Riom), or else to an Abbey with particular links to the royal family (e.g St-Germer-de-Fly) As with the original, such Holy Chapels were nearly always additional to the regular palatine or abbatial chapel, with their own dedicated clergy‚Äîusually established as a college of canons [37] For the patrons, such chapels served not only as public expressions of personal piety but also as valuable diplomatic tools, encouraging important visitors to come and venerate their relics and showing their connection to the French crown Notable Saintes-Chapelles in France include:\n\n\nSee

accommodate the students who previously disintegrated five years earlier as a result of Thanos's actions; they had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers [a] The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker‚Äîwho is still mourning the death of his mentor Tony Stark‚Äîplans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.\n\n\nCast\nAngourie Rice and Jorge Lendeborg Jr reprise their roles from Homecoming as Parker's classmates Betty Brant, Ned's on-and-off girlfriend, [13] [24] and Jason Ionello [25] Peter Billingsley reprises his role from Iron Man (2008) as scientist William Ginter Riva, a former employee of Stark Industries who now works with Beck [26] J K Simmons appears as J Jonah Jameson in the mid-credits scene, [27] marking the first time an actor has reprised a non-MCU role in an MCU film after Simmons portrayed a different incarnation of Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy [28] Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn make uncredited cameo appearances in the post-credits scene as the Skrulls Talos and Soren, reprising their roles from Captain Marvel (2019); [27] this scene reveals that they have been posing as Fury and Hill during the film [29]\n\n\nProduction\nIn June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future Spider-Man films after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) [43] The following month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said if additional films were made, the company had an early idea to follow the model of the Harry Potter film series, and have the plot of each film cover a new school year, [44] with a second film intended to take place during Peter Parker / Spider-Man's junior year of high school [45] By October, discussions had begun for a second film, including which villain would be featured, according to Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who was signed for two more Spider-Man films after Homecoming [46] [47] In December, after the successful release of the first Homecoming trailer, Sony slated a sequel to the film for July 5, 2019 [48] Sony's insistence that the sequel be released in 2019 complicated Marvel's preference for secrecy regarding their plans for Spider-Man in this film and their other MCU films, since the character would die at the end of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and would not be resurrected before Avengers: Endgame in April 2019 by which time marketing for this film would have already begun [49]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future Spider-Man films after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)

Endgame in April 2019 by which time marketing for this film would have already begun [49]\n\n\nPre-production\nAt the end of August 2017, as the film was entering pre-production, [53] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were in final negotiations to return from Homecoming to write the sequel [58] In early October, Jacob Batalon confirmed he would reprise his role of Ned Leeds in the sequel [15] [9] Feige confirmed that Watts was returning to direct the sequel in December [59] By February 2018, Zendaya was slated to return for the film, reprising her role as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson [60] [9] Location scouting for the film began at the end of the month, as did the pre-visualisation process for the creative team to begin planning action sequences and visual effects for the film [61] By late April, Feige stated that filming was scheduled to begin in early July 2018, and would primarily occur in London This was a change from the first film, which was mostly produced in Atlanta Feige explained that one of the reasons behind this change in location was because a majority of the sequel would be spent around the world, outside New York City [62]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on location in Hertfordshire, England, on July 2, 2018, [74] under the working title Fall of George [75] Matthew J Lloyd served as director of photography, after previously working with Watts on Cop Car (2015) Watts had wanted to work with Lloyd on Homecoming, but the cinematographer was working on Power Rangers (2017) at the time [76] Filming moved to London, [62] with locations including East London, [77] and at London Stansted Airport [78] Studio work occurred at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden near Watford, England, where a Venice set was created on one of the studio's backlots [13] [33] Shortly after filming began, set photos revealed Hemky Madera would return as bodega owner Mr Delmar, [79] while J.B Smoove and Numan Acar joined the cast [80] [30] By early August, Samuel L Jackson and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be appearing in the film, reprising their respective roles of Nick Fury and Maria Hill from previous MCU films, [6] and Remy Hii joined the cast later in the month [32] Filming took place in Prague and Liberec in the Czech Republic in September, [81] [82] and moved to Venice by the end of the month [82] Filming moved to New York City and Newark, New Jersey in October, where it used the working title Bosco [83] [84] Locations included areas around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, [84] and Newark Liberty International Airport [78] Filming wrapped on October 16, 2018 [85]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn late October 2018, Sony Pictures reached a new multi-film agreement with IMAX Corporation to release their films in IMAX, including Far From Home [86] At Sony's CCXP Brazil panel in December 2018, it was revealed that the Elementals‚Äîa group of characters based on the elements of water, earth, air, and fire‚Äîwould appear in the film [87] The four Elementals are modeled after different Spider-Man villains from Marvel comic books: the water Elemental borrows from Hydro-Man, the fire Elemental borrows from Molten Man, the Earth Elemental borrows from Sandman, and the air Elemental borrows from Cyclone [88] [89] [90] [91] The names of these other villains are not given to the characters in the film, [13] [33] albeit Hydro-Man's public identity as Morris Bench is mentioned at one point [92] In addition to these characters, there were also discussions about using the villain Swarm as a model for a potential fifth Elemental in the film [93] Martin Starr was confirmed to be reprising his role as Roger Harrington from Homecoming the next month [94] [17] In April 2019, Sony moved the film's release date up to July 2, 2019 [95] While promoting Endgame at a fan event in Shanghai, Feige said Far From Home would be the final film of the MCU's Phase Three, rather than the start of Phase Four as some had believed [96] Also in April, Jackson returned to do reshoots for the film [97]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Image Engine, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Luma Pictures, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Territory Studio, and Method Studios [104] Janek Sirrs served as visual effects supervisor on the film, and explained that following the release of the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) the effects team looked for ways to use similarly inventive visuals in Far From Home They ultimately did not use added effects to represent Spider-Man's Spider-sense because these did not fit within the live-action world or were too similar to previous effects, such as Daredevil's sonar vision They did try to use Spider-Man's actions and the use of his abilities to show his growth since Homecoming, but to also show his \"reach as always exceeding his grasp as he refines his superhero skills\" [105] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception [106]\n\n\nMusic\nSpider-Man: Homecoming composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to return to score Far From Home in October 2018 [112] [113] Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" plays during the Marvel Studios opening logo as part of the film's opening \"in memoriam\" scene [114] The end credits song is \"Vacation\" by The Go-Go's [115] The soundtrack album was released by Sony Classical on June 28, 2019 [116]\n\n\nMarketing\nDue to Parker dying at the end of Infinity War and not being resurrected until Endgame, [117] [118] [49] Germain Lussier of io9 noted in May 2018 that Sony would either have to begin marketing this film only two months before its release or spoil the fact that Parker is resurrected for general audiences that may not realize that this would happen in Endgame Lussier suggested the latter approach be taken, while a representative of Sony said the studio would be working with Marvel to \"figure out the Spider-Man strategy\" [117] Holland and Gyllenhaal debuted the first trailer for Far From Home at Sony's CCXP Brazil panel on December 8, 2018 The footage does not acknowledge the events of Infinity War or Endgame, with Steven Weintraub of Collider describing it as a continuation of \"the Spider-Man universe\" only [119] Holland debuted the trailer publicly on his Instagram account on January 15, 2019 [120] A slightly different \"international version\" was also released [121] Several news outlets commented on Parker's appearance in the trailer following the events of Infinity War, [121] [122] [123] with Zack Straf of IndieWire pointing out that while the trailer reveals Parker's return, it does not explain how [122]\n\n\nRelease\nSpider-Man: Far From Home had its world premiere at the TCL

Peter's friends, including Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson (Zendaya), and Betty Brant (Angourie Rice), are trying to help him cope with his loss, but Peter is still feeling the weight of his responsibilities as Spider-Man.\n\nAs the school year begins, Peter is tasked with leading a group of students on a field trip to Europe, where they will be attending a science conference. However, things take a turn when Peter discovers that the Elementals, a group of powerful beings from another dimension, are wreaking havoc on the world. The Elementals are a group of four beings, each with the ability to control a different element: water, earth, air, and fire.\n\nPeter knows that he cannot face the Elementals alone, so he turns to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) for help. They send him to meet with Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), a.k.a. Mysterio, a former superhero who has been living in hiding. Beck is a skilled special effects artist and stuntman who has been using his skills to create illusions and deceptions to keep people safe from the Elementals.\n\nHowever, as Peter spends more time with Beck, he begins to realize that Beck's true intentions are not what they seem. Beck is using Peter to further his own agenda, and Peter must decide whether to trust him or not. Meanwhile, MJ and Ned are trying to help Peter navigate his feelings and relationships, but Peter is struggling to balance his life as a superhero with his life as a high school student.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man\n* Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck / Mysterio\n* Samuel L.

contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.\n\n\nCast\nAngourie Rice and Jorge Lendeborg Jr reprise their roles from Homecoming as Parker's classmates Betty Brant, Ned's on-and-off girlfriend, [13] [24] and Jason Ionello [25] Peter Billingsley reprises his role from Iron Man (2008) as scientist William Ginter Riva, a former employee of Stark Industries who now works with Beck [26] J K Simmons appears as J Jonah Jameson in the mid-credits scene, [27] marking the first time an actor has reprised a non-MCU role in an MCU film after Simmons portrayed a different incarnation of Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man film trilogy [28] Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn make uncredited cameo appearances in the post-credits scene as the Skrulls Talos and Soren, reprising their roles from Captain Marvel (2019); [27] this scene reveals that they have been posing as Fury and Hill during the film [29]\n\n\nProduction\nIn June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future Spider-Man films after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) [43] The following month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said if additional films were made, the company had an early idea to follow the model of the Harry Potter film series, and have the plot of each film cover a new school year, [44] with a second film intended to take place during Peter Parker / Spider-Man's junior year of high school [45] By October, discussions had begun for a second film, including which villain would be featured, according to Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who was signed for two more Spider-Man films after Homecoming [46] [47] In December, after the successful release of the first Homecoming trailer, Sony slated a sequel to the film for July 5, 2019 [48] Sony's insistence that the sequel be released in 2019 complicated Marvel's preference for secrecy regarding their plans for Spider-Man in this film and their other MCU films, since the character would die at the end of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and would not be resurrected before Avengers: Endgame in April 2019 by which time marketing for this film would have already begun [49]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn

marketing for this film would have already begun [49]\n\n\nPre-production\nAt the end of August 2017, as the film was entering pre-production, [53] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were in final negotiations to return from Homecoming to write the sequel [58] In early October, Jacob Batalon confirmed he would reprise his role of Ned Leeds in the sequel [15] [9] Feige confirmed that Watts was returning to direct the sequel in December [59] By February 2018, Zendaya was slated to return for the film, reprising her role as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson [60] [9] Location scouting for the film began at the end of the month, as did the pre-visualisation process for the creative team to begin planning action sequences and visual effects for the film [61] By late April, Feige stated that filming was scheduled to begin in early July 2018, and would primarily occur in London This was a change from the first film, which was mostly produced in Atlanta Feige explained that one of the reasons behind this change in location was because a majority of the sequel would be spent around the world, outside New York City [62]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on location in Hertfordshire, England, on July 2, 2018, [74] under the working title Fall of George [75] Matthew J Lloyd served as director of photography, after previously working with Watts on Cop Car (2015) Watts had wanted to work with Lloyd on Homecoming, but the cinematographer was working on Power Rangers (2017) at the time [76] Filming moved to London, [62] with locations including East London, [77] and at London Stansted Airport [78] Studio work occurred at Warner Bros Studios, Leavesden near Watford, England, where a Venice set was created on one of the studio's backlots [13] [33] Shortly after

Smulders were confirmed to be appearing in the film, reprising their respective roles of Nick Fury and Maria Hill from previous MCU films, [6] and Remy Hii joined the cast later in the month [32]

October, where it used the working title Bosco [83] [84] Locations included areas around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, [84] and Newark Liberty International Airport [78] Filming wrapped on October 16, 2018 [85]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn late October 2018, Sony Pictures reached a new multi-film agreement with IMAX Corporation to release their films in IMAX, including Far From Home [86] At Sony's CCXP Brazil panel in December 2018, it was revealed that the Elementals‚Äîa group of characters based on the elements of water, earth, air, and fire‚Äîwould appear in the film [87] The four Elementals are modeled after different Spider-Man villains from Marvel comic books: the water Elemental borrows from Hydro-Man, the fire Elemental borrows from Molten Man, the Earth Elemental borrows from Sandman, and the air Elemental borrows from Cyclone [88] [89] [90] [91] The names of these other villains are not given to the characters in the film, [13] [33] albeit Hydro-Man's public identity as Morris Bench is mentioned at one point [92] In addition to these characters, there were also discussions about using the villain Swarm as a model for a potential fifth Elemental in the film [93] Martin Starr was confirmed to be reprising his role as Roger Harrington from Homecoming the next month [94] [17] In April 2019, Sony moved the film's release date up to July 2, 2019 [95] While promoting Endgame at a fan event in Shanghai, Feige said Far From Home would be the final film of the MCU's Phase Three, rather than the start of Phase Four as some had believed [96] Also in April, Jackson returned to do reshoots for the film [97]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Image Engine, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Luma Pictures, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Territory Studio, and Method Studios [104] Janek Sirrs served as visual effects supervisor on the film, and explained that following the release of the animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) the effects team looked for ways to use similarly inventive visuals in Far From Home They ultimately did not use added effects to represent Spider-Man's Spider-sense because these did not fit within the live-action world or were too similar to previous effects, such as Daredevil's sonar vision They did try to use Spider-Man's actions and the use of his abilities to show his growth since Homecoming, but to also show his \"reach as always exceeding his grasp as he refines his superhero skills\" [105] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception [106]\n\n\nMusic\nSpider-Man: Homecoming composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to return to score Far From Home in October 2018 [112] [113] Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" plays during the Marvel Studios opening logo as part of the film's opening \"in memoriam\" scene [114] The end credits song is \"Vacation\" by The Go-Go's [115] The soundtrack album was released by Sony Classical on June 28, 2019 [116]\n\n\nMarketing\nDue to Parker dying at the end of Infinity War and not being resurrected until Endgame, [117] [118] [49] Germain Lussier of io9 noted in May 2018 that Sony would either have to begin marketing this film only two months before its release or spoil the fact that Parker is resurrected for general audiences that may not realize that this would happen in Endgame Lussier suggested the latter approach be taken, while a representative of Sony said the studio would be working with Marvel to \"figure out the Spider-Man strategy\" [117] Holland and Gyllenhaal debuted the first trailer for Far From Home at Sony's CCXP Brazil panel on December 8, 2018 The footage does not acknowledge the events of Infinity War or Endgame, with Steven Weintraub of Collider describing it as a continuation of \"the Spider-Man universe\" only [119] Holland debuted the trailer publicly on his Instagram account on January 15, 2019 [120] A slightly different \"international version\" was also released [121] Several news outlets commented on Parker's appearance in the trailer following the events of Infinity War, [121] [122] [123] with Zack Straf of IndieWire pointing out that while the trailer reveals Parker's return, it does not explain how [122]\n\n\nRelease\nSpider-Man: Far From Home had its world premiere at the TCL
