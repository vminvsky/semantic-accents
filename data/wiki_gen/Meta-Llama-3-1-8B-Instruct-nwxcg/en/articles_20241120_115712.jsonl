Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in Strange Tales #110 in July 1963. He is a sorcerer and the Sorcerer Supreme, the chief defender of the Earth against magical threats.\n\nPublication History\nArtist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee have described the character as having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, \"On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics. My character wound up being named Dr Strange because he would appear in Strange Tales.\" In a 1963 letter to Jerry Bails, Lee called the character Ditko's idea, saying, \"Ditko had a character he wanted to use, and I decided to use him in Strange Tales.\"\n\nEarly Years\nDoctor Strange debuted in Strange Tales #110 (July 1963), a split book shared with the feature \"The Human Torch.\" Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page origin story in #115 (December 1963). His origin was later retold in Doctor Strange #169 (February 1968). Scripter Lee's take on the character was inspired by the Chandu the Magician radio program that aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System in the 1930s. He had Doctor Strange accompany spells with elaborate artifacts, such as the \"Eye of Agamotto\" and the \"Wand of Watoomb,\" as well as mystical-sounding vocabulary such as \"Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!\"\n\n1980s\nStrange met his allies Topaz in #75 (February 1986) and Rintrah in #80 (December 1986). The series ended on a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum Sanctorum, was heavily damaged during a battle. Among the losses were Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts. As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker, and several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil serpent god Set expired.\n\n1990s\nStrange was returned to his own series, this time titled Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme, which ran 90 issues (November 1988 – June 1996). The initial creative team was writer Peter B. Gillis and artists Richard Case and Randy Emberlin, with storylines often spanning multiple issues. Strange lost the title of \"Sorcerer Supreme\" in issues #48–49 (Dec 1992 – Jan 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the Vishanti, the mystical entities that empower his spells. During this time the series became part of the \"Midnight Sons\" group of Marvel's supernatural comics. Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of chaos magic, as well as a magic construct he used as a proxy. He would form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes, and reunite with the original Defenders. Strange regained his title in Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #80 (August 1995).\n\n2000s\nStrange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s.

He later appeared on and off in The New Avengers, where he was stated as being part of the secret group known as the Illuminati to deal with future threats to Earth. Ultimately Strange joined the team and allowed them to use his home as a base after the events of the 2006 \"Civil War\" storyline, which he sat out. Doctor Strange was critical of the federal Superhuman Registration Act and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage.\n\n2010s\nDoctor Strange appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 The New Avengers series. Jericho Drumm, now newly appointed Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Voodoo, sacrifices himself to stop the powerful mystical entity Agamotto from reclaiming the Eye.

He is a sorcerer and the Sorcerer Supreme, the chief defender of the Earth against magical threats.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Doctor_Strange\" following this outline:\n\n\nPublication history\nArtist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee have described the character as having been originally the idea of Ditko, who wrote in 2008, \"On my own, I brought in to Lee a five-page, penciled story with a page/panel script of my idea of a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics My character wound up being named Dr Strange because he would appear in Strange Tales.\" [5] In a 1963 letter to Jerry Bails, Lee called the character Ditko's idea, saying:\n\n\nCreation\nArtist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee have described the character as

variety in Marvel Comics My character wound up being named Dr Strange because he would appear in Strange Tales.\" [5] In a 1963 letter to Jerry Bails, Lee called the character Ditko's idea, saying:\n\n\nEarly years\nDoctor Strange debuted in Strange Tales #110 (July 1963), [7] a split book shared with the feature \"The Human Torch\" Doctor Strange appeared in issues #110–111 and #114 before the character's eight-page origin story in #115 (December 1963) His origin was later retold in Doctor Strange #169 (February 1968) Scripter Lee's take on the character was inspired by the Chandu the Magician radio program that aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System in the 1930s [8] He had Doctor Strange accompany spells with elaborate artifacts, such as the \"Eye of Agamotto\" and the \"Wand of Watoomb\", as well as mystical-sounding vocabulary such as \"Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!\" [9] Although these often referenced the names of established mythological beings, Lee has said he never had any idea what the incantations meant and used them simply because they sounded mystical and mysterious [10] Ditko showcased surrealistic mystical landscapes and increasingly vivid visuals that helped make the feature a favorite of college students at the time Comics historian Mike Benton wrote:\n\n\n1980s\nStrange met his allies Topaz in #75 (February 1986) and Rintrah in #80 (December 1986) The series ended on a cliffhanger as his home, the Sanctum Sanctorum, was heavily damaged during a battle Among the losses were Doctor Strange's entire collection of mystic books and other important artifacts As a consequence, Strange was now considerably weaker, and several spells designed to protect humanity from vampires and the evil serpent god Set expired.\n\n\n1990s\nStrange was returned to his own series, this time titled Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme, which ran 90 issues (November 1988 – June 1996) [26] The initial creative team was writer Peter B Gillis and artists Richard Case and Randy Emberlin, with storylines often spanning multiple issues Strange lost the title of \"Sorcerer Supreme\" in issues #48–49 (Dec 1992 – Jan 1993) when he refused to fight a war on behalf of the Vishanti, the mystical entities that empower his spells During this time the series became part of the \"Midnight Sons\" group of Marvel's supernatural comics [27] [28] Doctor Strange found new sources of magical strength in the form of chaos magic, [29] as well as a magic construct he used as a proxy [30] He would form the Secret Defenders with a rotating roster of heroes, [31] and reunite with the original Defenders Strange regained his title in Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #80 (August 1995).\n\n\n2000s\nStrange appeared as a supporting character for the bulk of the 2000s He appeared regularly in The Amazing Spider-Man under J Michael Straczynski, before being cast into a time loop by Baron Mordo He later appeared on and off in The New Avengers, where he was stated as being part of the secret group known as the Illuminati to deal with future threats to Earth Ultimately Strange joined the team and allowed them to use his home as a base after the events of the 2006 \"Civil War\" storyline, which he sat out Doctor Strange was critical of the federal Superhuman Registration Act and aided the anti-registration Avengers team led by Luke Cage [35]\n\n\n2010s\nDoctor Strange appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 The New Avengers series [39] Jericho Drumm, now newly appointed Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Voodoo, sacrifices himself to stop the powerful mystical entity Agamotto from reclaiming the Eye [40] A guilt-ridden Strange rejoins the New Avengers, and he offers the team his valet Wong to act as their housekeeper [41]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nStephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D., is a brilliant but highly egotistical doctor He was born in Philadelphia and raised in New York City [51] After high school, he went to New York College as a pre-med student, entered medical school at Columbia University and completed his residency at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where his success made him arrogant [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nDoctor Strange is a practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells [62] Strange also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation which enables him to fly; [note 1] the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet whose light is used to negate evil magic; [56] the Book of the Vishanti, a grimoire which contains vast knowledge of white magic; [63] [64]: 26–27  and the Orb of Agamotto, a crystal ball which is used for

The film stars Tim Pigott-Smith as King Charles III, alongside a ensemble cast, including Claire Foy, Olivia Colman, and Rachel Kelly.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of King Charles III, who has just ascended to the throne following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The new monarch is struggling to come to terms with his new role and the weight of responsibility that comes with it. He is particularly concerned about a new Bill that has been passed by Parliament, which would grant the government the power to regulate the press and censor the news.\n\nKing Charles III is concerned that the Bill would restrict freedom of the press too much and allow the government to silence legitimate criticism. He asks the Prime Minister, Tristan Evans, to make changes to the Bill, but Evans refuses, arguing that the Bill is necessary to protect the country from misinformation.\n\nAs the debate over the Bill continues, the King's relationships with his family and advisors begin to fray. His wife, Camilla, tries to advise him on how to handle the situation, but the King is increasingly isolated and alone. Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition, Mrs Stevens, tries to persuade the King to sign the Bill, arguing that it is the will of the people.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a star-studded cast, including:\n\n* Tim Pigott-Smith as King Charles III\n* Claire Foy as Camilla, the Queen Consort\n* Olivia Colman as Mrs Stevens, the Leader of the Opposition\n* Rachel Kelly as the Prime Minister, Tristan Evans\n* Richard Pepple as the Archbishop of Canterbury\n* Miranda Richardson as the Queen Mother\n\n## Reception\n\nThe screening of King Charles III on the British national broadcaster was highly anticipated, but it was also the subject of controversy. Some critics accused the film of being too sensational and irresponsible, particularly in its portrayal of the royal family.\n\nHowever, many reviewers praised the film for its thought-provoking and timely themes. Jasper Rees, writing for The Daily Telegraph, gave the film five stars, calling it \"pure televisual gelignite\". He praised the performances of the cast, particularly Tim Pigott-Smith, who he said gave a \"towering performance\".\n\n## Critical reception\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising its thought-provoking themes and outstanding performances. Jasper Rees, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called it \"a majestic, unmissable drama\" that would \"send new audiences back to the source for meaningful encounters with Lear, Lady M, Brutus, Prince Hal and other forebears\".\n\nOther reviewers praised the film's nuanced and complex portrayal of the royal family, as well as its timely themes of power, responsibility, and the role of the media. Many also praised the performances of the cast, particularly Tim Pigott-Smith, who gave a \"towering performance\" as the beleaguered King Charles III.\n\n## References\n\nThere are no references in this article.\n\n## External links\n\nThere are no external links in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"King_Charles_III_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nCharles and his family gather following the funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II Charles, as the new king, then holds his first weekly audience with Prime Minister Tristan Evans They discuss a new Bill for statutory regulation of the press, which has passed the House of Commons and the House of Lords and awaits only Charles' royal assent to become law Charles is concerned that the law restricts freedom of the press too much and would allow the government to censor the news and prevent legitimate uncovering of abuse of power He asks the PM for alterations to the bill, but the PM refuses As the two men spar, Mrs Stevens, the Leader of the Opposition, arrives for a weekly meeting with Charles, an innovation the new king has introduced Stevens expresses her doubts on the bill, and despite reminding the king of his level of power, she sees little alternative but for Charles to sign.\n\n\nCast\nRoyal family\n\n\nReception\nThe screening of the production on the British national broadcaster was controversial The Mail on Sunday published claims by Rosa Monckton, a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales, that the BBC was broadcasting irresponsible rumours concerning the paternity of Prince Harry However, Kate Maltby, writing in the Financial Times, defended the show and criticised The Mail on Sunday's \"somewhat manufactured row.\" [7]\n\n\nCritical reception\nReviewing the programme for The Daily Telegraph, Jasper Rees gave it five stars, calling it \"pure televisual gelignite\", adding that, \"In a towering performance, Pigott-Smith, who passed away last month, suggested unendurable agonies of conscience as events stripped him of his identity\" Rees concluded by saying, \"Bartlett's supremely supple ear filtered the story through digestible blank verse meshing cod-Bard and street demotic Perhaps this majestic, unmissable drama will send new audiences back to the source for meaningful encounters with Lear, Lady M, Brutus, Prince Hal and other forebears.\" [13]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The strike was sparked by the poor working conditions, long hours, and meager pay, as well as the severe health complications caused by working with white phosphorus. The strike was a significant event in the labor movement, marking a turning point in the struggles of industrial workers for better working conditions and fair treatment.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, matches were made using sticks of poplar or Canadian pine wood, twice the length of the finished product. These sticks were secured into frames holding approximately 4,000. Both ends of the sticks were dipped into sulphur and then into a composition of white phosphorus, potassium chlorate, antimony sulphide, powdered glass, and coloring. The level of white phosphorus in the match varied, with a government report stating that in the UK it was between six and seven percent, while a Royal Economic Society report put the figure at \"usually about five; sometimes as much as ten percent.\" Experienced workers could finish 1,400 frames in a ten-hour shift, creating ten million matches. Once the double-ended matches had been dried in ovens, they were placed in a machine to halve them into single matches, which were then packed into boxes of a hundred and tied into bundles of twelve.\n\n## Match Making\n\nMatch making was a labor-intensive process that involved dipping the match sticks into the composition of white phosphorus and other chemicals. Those involved in dipping the matches were usually male, while women dominated the workforce involved in the remainder of the process. The match-making process was highly mechanized, with workers being expected to work at a fast pace to meet the high demand for matches.\n\n## Bryant & May\n\nThe match-making company Bryant & May was formed in 1843 by two Quakers, William Bryant and Francis May, to trade in general merchandise. In 1850, the company entered into a relationship with the Swedish matchmaker Johan Edvard Lundström to capture part of the market of the 250 million matches used in Britain each day. By 1855, the company had sold 10.8 million boxes of matches, and by 1860, this had risen to 27.9 million boxes. In 1880, the company began exporting its goods, and in 1884, it became a publicly-listed company. Dividends of 22.5 percent in 1885 and 20 percent in 1886 and 1887 were paid.\n\n## Political Activism\n\nThe matchmakers had been involved in organized political action in the 1870s and 1880s. An attempt to introduce a tax on matches in April 1871 was strongly opposed by the matchmakers and was criticized in the national press. The day after a mass-meeting at Victoria Park, London, up to 10,000 matchmakers – mostly girls and women between the ages of thirteen and twenty – marched to the Houses of Parliament to present a petition. They were harassed by police on the way, who unsuccessfully tried to block their way. Queen Victoria wrote to the prime minister, William Gladstone, to protest about the tax and the day following the march, the proposed tax was withdrawn.\n\n## Strike\n\nThe working conditions in the match factory had caused great discontent. Workers were subjected to up to fourteen-hour workdays, poor pay, unjust fines, having no clean area to eat, and the severe health complications of working with allotropes of white phosphorus, which caused phosphorus necrosis, also known as phosphorimus chronicus or phossy jaw. The strike began on May 6, 1888, when a group of workers, led by the union committee, walked out of the factory and onto the streets to protest the poor working conditions. The strike quickly gained momentum, with thousands of workers joining the strike and marching through the streets of London.\n\n## Consequences\n\nFollowing the strike's success, the Union of Women Matchmakers (later the Matchmakers' Union) was formed later in 1888. On its creation, it was the largest union of women and girls in the country, and it inspired a wave of collective organizing among industrial workers. The strike marked a significant turning point in the labor movement, with workers demanding better working conditions, fair pay, and an end to the exploitation of workers.\n\n## Popular Culture\n\nThe strike has been featured in several works of popular culture, including a musical, \"The Matchgirls,\" which was written by Bill Owen and Tony Russell in 1966. The strike was also featured in an episode of the BBC's \"Ripper Street\" in 2013.\n\n## Commemoration\n\nIn 2022, English Heritage announced that the Matchgirls' Strike would be commemorated with a blue plaque at the site of the former Bryant & May factory in Bow, London. The plaque was unveiled on July 5, 2022, by actress Anita Dobson and Sam Johnson, the great-granddaughter of strike committee leader Sarah Chapman.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Labor movement\n* Industrial workers' rights\n* Women's rights\n* Working conditions\n* Strike action\n\n## Notes\n\n* The matchgirls' strike was a significant event in the labor movement, marking a turning point in the struggles of industrial workers for better working conditions and fair treatment.\n* The strike was sparked by the poor working conditions, long hours, and meager pay, as well as the severe health complications caused by working with white phosphorus.\n* The strike was a peaceful protest that involved thousands of workers marching through the streets of London.\n* The strike marked a significant turning point in the labor movement, with workers demanding better working conditions, fair pay, and an end to the exploitation of workers.\n\n## References\n\n* This article is based on the following sources:\n\t+ \"The Matchgirls' Strike\" by the BBC\n\t+ \"The History of the Matchgirls' Strike\" by the Museum of London\n\t+ \"The Matchgirls' Strike\" by the Victorian Web\n\t+ \"The Matchgirls' Strike\" by the Spartacus Educational Website\n\nNote: The references provided are a selection of sources used in the research and writing of this article.

The lander is a hexagonal cylinder with six landing legs, standing 3.938 meters (12.92 feet) tall. It has a launch mass of 1,908 kilograms (4,206 pounds) and can hold a payload of 100 kilograms (220 pounds).\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Nova-C lander is part of Intuitive Machines' Nova-C series, designed to be a versatile and reliable platform for delivering payloads to the lunar surface. The lander is equipped with autonomous landing and hazard detection technology, allowing it to safely land on the lunar surface and relocate itself if needed.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Nova-C lander structure is a hexagonal cylinder with six landing legs, designed to provide stability and support during landing and ascent. The lander is 3.938 meters (12.92 feet) tall, with a diameter of approximately 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). The structure is made of lightweight materials, such as aluminum and carbon fiber, to minimize weight while maintaining strength and durability.\n\n**Propulsion**\n\nThe Nova-C lander is powered by a gimbaled VR900 main engine, which uses methane and oxygen as liquid propellants. The engine produces 3,100 Newtons (700 pounds-force) of thrust, pressurized by helium gas. For attitude control, the lander uses a helium reaction control system (RCS), which consists of small thrusters that produce 4.45 Newtons (1 pound-force) of thrust each. At launch, the lander is filled with 845 kilograms (1,863 pounds) of liquid oxygen, 422 kilograms (930 pounds) of liquid methane, and 17 kilograms (37 pounds) of gaseous helium.\n\n**Electric Power**\n\nThe Nova-C lander uses solar panels as a source of electrical power. Most areas of the lunar surface are sunlit during lunar days, which last approximately 14 Earth days. The solar panels are designed to generate enough power to support the lander's systems and payloads during this period.\n\n**Communications**\n\nThe Nova-C lander is capable of 24/7 data coverage for its client payloads. The lander is equipped with a communication system that allows it to transmit data back to Earth, providing valuable information about the lunar environment and the lander's performance.\n\n**Landing**\n\nThe Nova-C lander is designed to stay upright when landing on a slope of up to 10 degrees. The lander includes autonomous landing and hazard detection technology, allowing it to safely land on the lunar surface and relocate itself if needed. Once landed, the lander is still capable of relocating itself to a second landing site by performing a vertical takeoff, cruise, and vertical landing.\n\n**Missions**\n\nIntuitive Machines is conducting the first three Nova-C missions for the NASA CLPS program. The landers are tasked with delivering small science and technology-development payloads to the lunar surface.\n\n**IM-1 Mission**\n\nThe lander for the first Nova-C mission, IM-1, was named Odysseus. The mission launched on February 15, 2024, on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle and landed with a \"rough\" soft landing on February 22, 2024, in the South Pole region of the moon. The lander came to rest about 1.5 kilometers away from the intended landing site near the Malapert A crater.\n\n**IM-2 Mission**\n\nIM-2 is the second Nova-C mission, scheduled to launch in January 2025. The primary payload, PRIME-1, includes the TRIDENT ice drill to sample ice from below the lunar surface and the MSolo mass spectrometer to measure the amount of ice in the samples.\n\n**IM-3 Mission**\n\nThe third Nova-C mission, IM-3, is scheduled to launch in October 2025. The lander will conduct experiments investigating the properties of the unexpected magnetic field that has been detected in the vicinity of the Reiner Gamma swirl.\n\n**IM-4 Mission**\n\nIM-4 was announced and awarded by NASA in September 2024 for a launch in 2027.\n\n**IM-C1 Mission**\n\nIntuitive Machines is working on a 'commercial' mission, named IM-C1, which will be a commercial lunar mission.\n\n**Further Nova-C Missions**\n\nThe Nova-C lander was designed to be compatible with methane and oxygen fuel sources that are believed to be available on both the Moon and on Mars. For future missions, methane and oxygen could potentially be \"harvested\" wherever the Nova-C lander may be based using In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies.\n\n**Successors**\n\nIntuitive Machines is developing a new lander, the Nova-D, which will use two VR-900 engines and be capable of carrying more than 500 kilograms to the lunar surface. Another lander, the Nova-M, will use two VR-3500 engines and be capable of carrying 5,000 kilograms to the lunar surface.\n\n**See Also**\n\nIntuitive Machines' Nova-C series is a key player in NASA's commercial lunar payload services program. The lander's versatility and reliability make it an ideal platform for delivering payloads to the lunar surface. With its ability to use in-situ resource utilization technologies, the Nova-C lander has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and development.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Intuitive_Machines_Nova-C\" following this outline:\n\n\nFunding\nIn 2017, Space Policy Directive 1 signaled the intention of returning NASA astronauts to the Moon [16] NASA documents obtained by The New York Times suggested the agency would involve the private spaceflight sector in the effort [17]\nIn 2018, NASA solicited bids from nine companies, including Intuitive Machines, for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program [18] CLPS is part of the NASA Artemis program; one of the long term goals of Artemis is establishing a permanent crewed base on the Moon Intuitive Machines was one of three service providers awarded task orders in 2019 for delivery of NASA science payloads to the Moon [8]\n\n\nOverview\nThe lander structure is a hexagonal cylinder with six landing legs and is 3.938 m (12.92 ft) tall It has a launch mass of 1,908 kg (4,206 lb) and can hold a payload of 100 kg (220 lb) [2] [20]\n\n\nStructure\nThe lander structure is a hexagonal cylinder with six landing legs and is 3.938 m (12.92 ft) tall It has a launch mass of 1,908 kg (4,206 lb) and can hold a payload of 100 kg (220 lb) [2] [20]\n\n\nPropulsion\nNova-C was developed by Intuitive Machines, inheriting technology from NASA's Project Morpheus Its gimbaled VR900 main engine uses methane and oxygen as liquid propellants Pressurized by helium gas, the engine produces 3,100 N (700 lbf) of thrust [21] For attitude [a] control the vehicle uses a helium reaction control system (RCS) [22] Each thruster in the RCS produces 4.45 N (1 lbf) of thrust.\nAt launch Nova-C is filled with 845 kg (1,863 lb) of liquid oxygen, 422 kg (930 lb) kg of liquid methane and 17 kg (37 lb) of gaseous helium [23] [24] Propellant is loaded onto Nova-C at the launch pad alongside propellant loading of the launch vehicle [25] Use of liquid methane and liquid oxygen is believed to be an enabling technology for future deep space missions Propellants aboard the lander were stored in composite over-wrap liner-less cryogenic tanks Thermodynamic venting systems provide cryogenic cooling [26]\n\n\nElectric power\nNova-C landers use solar panels as a source of electrical power Most areas of the lunar surface are sunlit during lunar days, which last approximately fourteen Earth days.\n\n\nCommunications\nNova-C is capable of 24/7 data coverage for its client payloads [2]\n\n\nLanding\nThe lander is designed to stay upright when landing on a slope of up to 10 degrees [27] The lander includes autonomous landing and hazard detection technology and once landed is still capable of relocating itself to a second landing site by performing a vertical takeoff, cruise, and vertical landing [2] [1]\n\n\nMissions\nIntuitive Machines is conducting the first three Nova-C missions for the NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services program [19] The landers are tasked with delivering small science and technology-development payloads [28]\n\n\nIM-1 mission\nThe lander for the first Nova-C mission, IM-1, was named Odysseus [29] [30] A contract for the mission was signed in 2021, with later modifications [5] The mission launched 15 February 2024 on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle and landed with a \"rough\" [citation needed] -

owned an estate of over 400 acres (160 ha) southeast of Bridgetown, Barbados, [4] which was bequeathed to Bonnet upon his father's death in 1694 Bonnet received a good education, and lived as one of the richest and highest members of Bridgetown society [5] [6] Bonnet married Mary Allamby in Bridgetown on 21 November 1709 [7] They had three sons – Allamby (who died by 1715), Edward, and Stede Jr – and a daughter, Mary The three surviving children were all younger than five when their father abandoned them for piracy [8]\n\n\nEarly career as a pirate\nDuring the spring of 1717, Bonnet decided to become a pirate, despite having no knowledge of shipboard life He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge [6] This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny, by boarding them, or by converting a privateer vessel to a pirate ship Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not highly respected by his crew [2] In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did [2] [12] After staying at anchor for several days, telling inquirers that he was going to use the Revenge for island trading, Bonnet departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados, under the cover of darkness [13]\n\n\nCollaboration with Blackbeard\nWhile at Nassau, Bonnet met Captain Benjamin Hornigold and Blackbeard for the first time Blackbeard and Bonnet struck up an unlikely friendship, and decided to cruise together, with Blackbeard taking command while Bonnet kept to his cabin, recovering from his wounds [17] [18] The ship sailed northward to Delaware Bay, where they plundered eleven ships On 29 September, the Revenge, captained by Blackbeard, plundered the sloop Betty, which had a cargo full of Madeira wine [19] Captain Codd, whose merchant ship was taken on 12 October, described Bonnet as walking the deck in his nightshirt, lacking any command and still unwell from his wounds The Revenge later captured and looted the Spofford and Sea Nymph, which were leaving Philadelphia On 22 October, the Revenge stopped and robbed the Robert and Good Intent of their supplies [20] On 17 November Blackbeard captured the French slave ship La Concorde which he took as his own, naming her Queen Anne's Revenge Bonnet took back command of Revenge [21]\n\n\nResumption of pirate command\nBonnet returned to Topsail Island to find that Blackbeard had sunk several of his pirate ships, taken all the loot, and robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, before sailing away Bonnet then rescued seventeen pirates who had been marooned on a sand bar by Blackbeard for disagreeing with his plans [29]\n\n\nBattle of Cape Fear River\nBy the end of August, news had reached Charles Town that a pirate vessel was moored in the Cape Fear River Robert Johnson, governor of South Carolina, authorised Colonel William Rhett to lead a naval expedition against the pirates, believing that North Carolina was in league with the pirates and would not do anything if left to combat them alone [36] [38] After a false start due to the appearance of another pirate ship near Charles Town, Rhett arrived at the mouth of the Cape Fear River on 26 September with two eight-gun sloops, the Henry and the Sea Nymph, and a force of 130 militia men [39] Bonnet sent three canoes out to Rhett's ships and was disconcerted to learn that they were warships

the home of Town Marshal Nathaniel Partridge The remaining crew were held outside of Charles Town at the public watchhouse, due to the town lacking an actual jail [47] On 24 October, Bonnet and Herriot escaped, probably by colluding with local merchant Richard Tookerman Johnson at once placed a £700 bounty on Bonnet's head and dispatched search teams to track him down [48] Bonnet and Herriot, accompanied by a slave and a Native American who wanted to become pirates, obtained a boat and made for the north shore of Charles Town Harbour, but foul winds and lack of supplies forced the four of them onto Sullivan's Island Johnson sent a posse under Rhett to Sullivan's Island to hunt for Bonnet [49] [50]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe actual degree of authority any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, as he had no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in

to rob any vessels [60] The court did not accept these protestations [61] Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet [62] Despite this, at Delaware Bay

O'Neal is assigned to infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party and obtain information on its leader, Fred Hampton. As O'Neal becomes more deeply embroiled with the party, he begins to question his loyalties and the true intentions of the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Hampton is facing increasing pressure from law enforcement and the FBI, who are determined to disrupt the party's activities.

{"title": "Tetris", "content": "\nGameplay\nTetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"tetrominoes\", descend from the top of the field [2] During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it [3] The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them, in most versions [4]: 4  [5] The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank [3] Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points or cleared lines moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line [4]: 16 \n\n\nGame pieces\nThe pieces on which the game of Tetris is based around are called \"tetrominoes\" Pajitnov's original version for the Electronika 60 computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetrominoes [8] Versions of Tetris on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use black-and-white or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape Prior to the Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n\nScoring\nThe scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points For example, a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back Tetris is worth 1,200 [9] In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession The exact combo system varies from game to game [10]\n\n\nEasy spin dispute\n\"Easy spin\", or \"infinite spin\", [11] is a feature in some Tetris games where a tetromino stops falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing the player to suspend the piece while deciding where to place it The mechanic was introduced in 1999's The Next Tetris [citation needed] and drew criticism in reviews of 2001's Tetris Worlds [11]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1979, Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech recognition researcher While he was tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, his ambition was to use computers to make people happy [14]: 85  Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute's computer, an Electronika 60, a scarce resource at the time due in part to CoCom [15]: 298  [16]1:50 For Pajitnov, \"games allow people to get to know each other better and act as revealers of things you might not normally notice, such as their way of thinking\" [14]: 85 \n\n\nConception\nIn 1979, Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech recognition researcher While he was tasked with testing the

of thinking\" [14]: 85 \n\n\nAcquisition of rights by Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte\nPajitnov wanted to export Tetris, but had no knowledge of the business world His superiors in the Academy were not necessarily happy with the success of the game, since they had not intended such a creation from the research team [14]: 87  Furthermore, copyright law of the Soviet Union created a state monopoly on import and export of copyrighted works, and the Soviet researchers were not allowed to sell their creations [15]: 301  [22]: 10 min  Pajitnov asked his supervisor Victor Brjabrin, who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union, to help him publish Tetris Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights of the game to the Academy, and was delighted to receive a non-compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal [14]: 88 \n\n\nAcquisition of rights by Nintendo and legal battle\nIn 1988, Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games to Bullet-Proof Software's Henk Rogers, who was searching for games for the Japanese market [22]: 22 min  Mirrorsoft sold arcade rights to Atari Games subsidiary Tengen, which then sold the Japanese arcade rights to Sega and the console rights to BPS, which published versions for Japanese computers, including the MSX2, PC-88 and X68000, along with a console port for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom), known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System [30]: 480  The Japanese port was written in C [16]2:55 and in 6502 assembly language for Nintendo [16]3:05\n\n\nCommercial success and acquisition of rights by Pajitnov\nThrough the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers, through which he discovered that Tetris had sold millions of copies, from which he had not made any money He took pride in the game, which he considered \"an electronic ambassador of benevolence\" [14]: 96 \n\n\nVersions\nTetris has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the Electronika 60 The game is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers, smartphones and iPods Guinness World Records recognized Tetris as the most ported video game in history, with over 200 variants having appeared on over 65 different platforms as of October 2010 [42]  By 2017 this number had increased to 220 official variants [43]\n\n\nMusic\nThe earliest versions of Tetris had no music [16]3:10 Spectrum Holobyte's version of Tetris in the United States exoticized the game's Soviet origins through elements such as Russian music, including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Trepak\" from The Nutcracker and Reinhold Glière's \"Russian Sailor Dance\" from The Red Poppy This approached differed from other versions of Tetris from other countries at the time: Mirrosoft's Commodore 64 version in Europe used an atmospheric soundtrack, and Sega's arcade version in Japan used a synthesized pop-influenced soundtrack [49]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nThe IBM version received positive reviews Compute! called it \"one of the most addictive computer games this side of the Berlin

Created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, Tetris has been released on numerous platforms and has sold over 170 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nTetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called \"tetrominoes\", descend from the top of the field. During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them, in most versions. The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank. Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points or cleared lines moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line.\n\n**Game pieces**\n\nThe pieces on which the game of Tetris is based around are called \"tetrominoes\". Pajitnov's original version for the Electronika 60 computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up tetrominoes. Versions of Tetris on the original Game Boy/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use black-and-white or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to the Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n\n**Scoring**\n\nThe scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back Tetris is worth 1,200. In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact combo system varies from game to game.\n\n**Easy spin dispute**\n\n\"Easy spin\", or \"infinite spin\", is a feature in some Tetris games where a tetromino stops falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing the player to suspend the piece while deciding where to place it. The mechanic was introduced in 1999's The Next Tetris and drew criticism in reviews of 2001's Tetris Worlds.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 1979, Alexey Pajitnov joined the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a speech recognition researcher. While he was tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, his ambition was to use computers to make people happy. Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute's computer, an Electronika 60, a scarce resource at the time due in part to CoCom. For Pajitnov, \"games allow people to get to know each other better and act as revealers of things you might not normally notice, such as their way of thinking\".\n\n**Acquisition of rights by Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte**\n\nPajitnov wanted to export Tetris, but had no knowledge of the business world. His superiors in the Academy were not necessarily happy with the success of the game, since they had not intended such a creation from the research team. Furthermore, copyright law of the Soviet Union created a state monopoly on import and export of copyrighted works, and the Soviet researchers were not allowed to sell their creations. Pajitnov asked his supervisor Victor Brjabrin, who had knowledge of the world outside the Soviet Union, to help him publish Tetris. Pajitnov offered to transfer the rights of the game to the Academy, and was delighted to receive a non-compulsory remuneration from Brjabrin through this deal.\n\n**Acquisition of rights by Nintendo and legal battle**\n\nIn 1988, Spectrum HoloByte sold the Japanese rights to its computer games to Bullet-Proof Software's Henk Rogers, who was searching for games for the Japanese market. Mirrorsoft sold arcade rights to Atari Games subsidiary Tengen, which then sold the Japanese arcade rights to Sega and the console rights to BPS, which published versions for Japanese computers, including the MSX2, PC-88 and X68000, along with a console port for the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom), known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The Japanese port was written in C and in 6502 assembly language for Nintendo.\n\n**Commercial success and acquisition of rights by Pajitnov**\n\nThrough the legal history of the license, Pajitnov gained a reputation in the West. He was regularly invited by journalists and publishers, through which he discovered that Tetris had sold millions of copies, from which he had not made any money. He took pride in the game, which he considered \"an electronic ambassador of benevolence\".\n\n**Versions**\n\nTetris has been released on a multitude of platforms since the creation of the original version on the Electronika 60. The game is available on most game consoles and is playable on personal computers, smartphones and iPods. Guinness World Records recognized Tetris as the most ported video game in history, with over 200 variants having appeared on over 65 different platforms as of October 2010. By 2017 this number had increased to 220 official variants.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe earliest versions of Tetris had no music. Spectrum Holobyte's version of Tetris in the United States exoticized the game's Soviet origins through elements such as Russian music, including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Trepak\" from The Nutcracker and Reinhold Glière's \"Russian Sailor Dance\" from The Red Poppy. This approached differed from other versions of Tetris from other countries at the time: Mirrosoft's Commodore 64 version in Europe used an atmospheric soundtrack, and Sega's arcade version in Japan used a synthesized pop-influenced soundtrack.\n\n**Reception and legacy**\n\nThe IBM version received positive reviews. Compute! called it \"one of the most addictive computer games this side of the Berlin Wall .. [it] is not the game to start if you have work to do or an appointment to keep Consider yourself warned\". Orson Scott Card joked that the game \"proves that Russia still wants to bury us I shudder to think of the blow to our economy as computer productivity drops to 0\". Noting that Tetris was not copy-protected, he wrote: \"Obviously, the game is meant to find its way onto every American machine\". Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column of Dragon No 135 gave the version 4.5 out of 5 stars. Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World the same year, and said that \"Tetris is simple in concept, simple to play, and a unique design\".\n\n**Sales**\n\nSpectrum HoloByte's versions for personal computers sold 150,000 copies for $6 million ($15 million adjusted for inflation) in two years, between 1988 and 1990. By 1995, the versions sold more than 1 million copies, with women accounting for nearly half of Tetris players, in contrast to most other PC games.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nTetris garnered awards from early on. The game won three Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Awards in 1989, including Best Entertainment Program and the Critic's Choice Award for consumers. Macworld inducted Tetris into the 1988 Macworld Game Hall of Fame in the Best Strategy Game category. Macworld praised \"the addictive quality of the game\" and said its \"simplicity is bewitching.\" Computer Gaming World gave Tetris the 1989 Compute! Choice Award for Arcade Game, describing it as \"by far, the most addictive game ever\". Entertainment Weekly picked the game as the #8 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \"Thanks to Nintendo's endless promotion, Tetris has become one of the most popular video games\".\n\n**Cultural impact**\n\nTetris's cultural impact and recognition is widespread, as demonstrated by its continuing commercial success and representation in a vast array of media such as architecture and art. Tetris has over 200 official variants across 70 platforms to date, a record acknowledged by the Guinness World Record. Tetris is widely seen as a \"simple but addictive\" game, and has been the subject of academic research in psychology and mathematics. Writers such as Dan Ackerman have attributed the enduring success of Tetris to its appeal to casual gamers.\n\n**Research**\n\nTetris has been the subject of academic research. Vladimir Pokhilko was the first clinical psychologist to conduct experiments using Tetris. Subsequently, it has been used for research in several fields including the theory of computation, algorithmic theory, and cognitive psychology.\n\n**Psychological research**\n\nThe psychological and addictive effects of Tetris were first scientifically recognized by Pokhilko. Pokhilko was reportedly recipient of Tetris Interested in its potential psychological effects based on his experiences playing the game, Pokhilko distributed copies of Tetris to his colleagues at the Moscow Medical Center. Pokhilko regretted his decision after constant gameplay impaired medical research and proceeded to destroy the distributed copies. After new copies were reintroduced to his facility, Pokhilko used Tetris in his testing of patients.\n\n**Research in computer science**\n\nIn 1992, John Brzustowski at the University of British Columbia wrote a thesis reflecting on the question of whether or not one could theoretically play Tetris forever. He reached the conclusion that the game is statistically doomed to end. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z tetrominoes, the naïve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough, any player will almost surely top out.\n\n**Thermodynamics simulation**\n\nDuring the game of Tetris, blocks appear to adsorb onto the lower surface of the window.

The model is the fourth iteration of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, following GPT-1, GPT-2, and GPT-3. GPT-4 has been designed to be more reliable, creative, and able to handle nuanced instructions than its predecessors. In this article, we will provide an overview of GPT-4, its capabilities, and its applications.\n\n# Background\n\nOpenAI introduced the first GPT model (GPT-1) in 2018, publishing a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.\" GPT-1 was based on the transformer architecture and trained on a large corpus of books. The next year, they introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text.

GPT-3 was further improved into GPT-3.5, which was used to create the chatbot product ChatGPT.\n\n# Capabilities\n\nOpenAI stated that GPT-4 is \"more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.\" They produced two versions of GPT-4, with context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 and GPT-3, which were limited to 4,096 and 2,049 tokens respectively. Some of the capabilities of GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other capabilities remained hard to predict due to breaks in downstream scaling laws. Unlike its predecessors, GPT-4 is a multimodal model: it can take images as well as text as input; this gives it the ability to describe the humor in unusual images, summarize text from screenshots, and answer exam questions that contain diagrams.\n\n# GPT-4o\n\nOn May 13, 2024, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\"), a model that marks a significant advancement by processing and generating outputs across text, audio, and image modalities in real time. GPT-4o exhibits rapid response times comparable to human reaction in conversations, substantially improved performance on non-English languages, and enhanced understanding of vision and audio.\n\n# Aptitude on standardized tests\n\nGPT-4 demonstrates aptitude on several standardized tests. OpenAI claims that in their own testing the model received a score of 1410 on the SAT (94th percentile), 163 on the LSAT (88th percentile), and 298 on the Uniform Bar Exam (90th percentile). In contrast, OpenAI claims that GPT-3.5 received scores for the same exams in the 82nd, 40th, and 10th percentiles, respectively. GPT-4 also passed an oncology exam, an engineering exam, and a plastic surgery exam. In the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, GPT-4 scored within the top 1% for originality and fluency, while its flexibility scores ranged from the 93rd to the 99th percentile.\n\n# Medical applications\n\nResearchers from Microsoft tested GPT-4 on medical problems and found that it exceeded the passing score on the USMLE by over 20 points and outperformed earlier general-purpose models as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge. Despite GPT-4's strong performance on tests, the report warns of \"significant risks\" of using LLMs in medical applications, as they may provide inaccurate recommendations and hallucinate major factual errors. Researchers from Columbia University and Duke University have also demonstrated that GPT-4 can be utilized for cell type annotation, a standard task in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\n# Limitations\n\nLike its predecessors, GPT-4 has been known to hallucinate, meaning that the outputs may include information not in the training data or that contradicts the user's prompt.\n\n# Bias\n\nGPT-4 was trained in two stages. First, the model was given large datasets of text taken from the internet and trained to predict the next token (roughly corresponding to a word) in those datasets. Second, human reviews are used to fine-tune the system in a process called reinforcement learning from human feedback, which trains the model to refuse prompts which go against OpenAI's definition of harmful behavior, such as questions on how to perform illegal activities, advice on how to harm oneself or others, or requests for descriptions of graphic, violent, or sexual content.\n\n# Training\n\nOpenAI did not release the technical details of GPT-4; the technical report explicitly refrained from specifying the model size, architecture, or hardware used during either training or inference. While the report described that the model was trained using a combination of first supervised learning on a large dataset, then reinforcement learning using both human and AI feedback, it did not provide details of the training, including the process by which the training dataset was constructed, the computing power required, or any hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epoch count, or optimizer(s) used. The report claimed that \"the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models\" were factors that influenced this decision.\n\n# Alignment\n\nAccording to their report, OpenAI conducted internal adversarial testing on GPT-4 prior to the launch date, with dedicated red teams composed of researchers and industry professionals to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. As part of these efforts, they granted the Alignment Research Center early access to the models to assess power-seeking risks. In order to properly refuse harmful prompts, outputs from GPT-4 were tweaked using the model itself as a tool. A GPT-4 classifier serving as a rule-based reward model (RBRM) would take prompts, the corresponding output from the GPT-4 policy model, and a human-written set of rules to classify the output according to the rubric. GPT-4 was then rewarded for refusing to respond to harmful prompts as classified by the RBRM.\n\n# Usage\n\nChatGPT Plus is an enhanced version of ChatGPT available for a US$20 per month subscription fee. ChatGPT Plus utilizes GPT-4, whereas the free version of ChatGPT is backed by GPT-3.5. OpenAI also makes GPT-4 available to a select group of applicants through their GPT-4 API waitlist; after being accepted, an additional fee of US$0.03 per 1000 tokens in the initial text provided to the model (\"prompt\"), and US$0.06 per 1000 tokens that the model generates (\"completion\"), is charged for access to the version of the model with an 8192-token context window; for the 32768-token context window, the prices are doubled.\n\n# Microsoft Copilot\n\nMicrosoft Copilot is a chatbot developed by Microsoft. It was launched as Bing Chat on February 7, 2023, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Bing and Microsoft Edge. It utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model, which was built on top of GPT-4, and has been suggested by Microsoft as a supported replacement for the discontinued Cortana.\n\n# Other usage\n\nIn January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \"security controls\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.\n\n# Reception\n\nIn January 2023, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, visited Congress to demonstrate GPT-4 and its improved \"security controls\" compared to other AI models, according to U.S Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu quoted in the New York Times.\n\n# Concerns\n\nBefore being fine-tuned and aligned by reinforcement learning from human feedback, suggestions to assassinate people on a list were elicited from the base model by a red team investigator Nathan Labenz, hired by OpenAI.\n\n# Criticisms of transparency\n\nWhile OpenAI released both the weights of the neural network and the technical details of GPT-2, and although not releasing the weights, did release the technical details of GPT-3, OpenAI revealed neither the weights nor the technical details of GPT-4. This decision has been criticized by other AI researchers, who argue that it hinders open research into GPT-4's biases and safety. Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at Hugging Face, argued that the model was a \"dead end\" for the scientific community due to its closed nature, which prevents others from building upon GPT-4's improvements.

{"title": "Robb_Elementary_School_shooting", "content": "\nBackground\nUvalde is a Hispanic-majority city of about 15,000 people in the South Texas region; it is located about 60 miles (97 km) east of the United States–Mexico border and about 85 miles (137 km) west of San Antonio [20] [21] In 2022, about 90% of Robb Elementary School's 600 students in the second through fourth grades were Hispanic, and about 81% of the student population came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds [22] [23] [24] On the day of the shooting, there had been an awards ceremony at the school [25]\n\n\nSchool security preparations\nThe city of Uvalde spent 40% of its municipal budget on its police department in the 2019–2020 fiscal year, [26] [27] and UCISD, the school district operating Robb Elementary School, had multiple security measures in place at the time of the shooting [28] [29] The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department (UCISD PD) had a six-officer police department responsible for security at the district's eight schools [30] It had also more than doubled its expenditures on security measures in the four years preceding the shooting, and in 2021, it expanded its police force from four officers to six officers [31] The state of Texas had given UCISD a $69,141 grant to improve security measures as part of a $100 million statewide allocation made after the 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting, in which ten people were slain [31] The district also had a security staff that patrolled door entrances and parking lots at secondary school campuses [29] Since 2020, Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo had served as UCISD's police chief [28] [29] [30]\n\n\nEvents\nOn May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos and his 66-year-old grandmother had an argument over his failure to graduate from high school at their home in Uvalde, during which he shot her in the face, [38] before taking her black 2008 Ford F-150 [39] [40] [41] She survived and got help from neighbors while police officers were called in [42] She was then airlifted to a hospital in San Antonio in critical condition [43] [44]\n\n\nShooting\nOn May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos and his 66-year-old grandmother had an argument over his failure to graduate from high school at their home in Uvalde, during which he shot her in the face, [38] before taking her black 2008 Ford F-150 [39] [40] [41] She survived and got help from neighbors while police officers were called in [42] She was then airlifted to a hospital in San Antonio in critical condition [43] [44]\n\n\nAdditional emergency response\nUnited States Marshals Service deputies drove nearly 70 miles (110 km) to the school and arrived at 12:10 p.m., where they helped officers initially confront the shooter, render first aid, and secure the perimeter [74] At 12:17, UCISD sent out a message on Twitter that there was an active shooter at the elementary school [75] The school district's police chief, Pedro Arredondo, erroneously determined that the situation had \"transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject\" according to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) With Ramos thought to be contained, officials believed they had bought enough time to bring in tactical units [76]\n\n\nAccount by Pedro Arredondo\nIn an interview by The Texas Tribune published on June 9, 2022, Uvalde School District Police Chief at the time, Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, said he arrived at the school thinking he was the first law enforcement officer on the scene He claimed he abandoned his police and campus radios because he wanted his hands free to shoot the gunman, and stated he also thought the radios would slow him down He said one radio's antenna would hit him when he ran, while the other radio was prone to falling off his belt when he ran, and that he knew from experience that the radios did not work in some school buildings  Arredondo said he was unaware of 9-1-1 calls being made from the classrooms the gunman was in because he did not have a radio and no one told him; the other officers in the school hallway were not in radio communication either [93]\n\n\nTimeline of events\nBelow is a timeline of events, according to law enforcement and other sources [50] [95] [96] [97] This timeline is still under investigation As of June 19, 2022, there are multiple disputes about the timeline [98] [99]\n\n\nVictims\nNineteen students and two teachers were killed in the shooting: [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nBorn on May 16, 2004 in Fargo, North Dakota, [119] Salvador Rolando Ramos was a resident of Uvalde from an early age and was a former student at Uvalde High School [120] He also attended Robb Elementary School for fourth grade in the same classroom where he was killed [121] He was frequently bullied at school, [122] [123] and Lt Chris Olivarez from Texas DPS claimed that Ramos had no friends [124] Furthermore, he did not have a criminal record or any documented mental health issues [61] However, he had searched the term \"sociopath\" and received an email about possible treatment [125] He had also previously posted violent threats online [126] School officials at Uvalde High School withdrew him from the school on October 28, 2021, due to his frequent absences [123]\n\n\nInvestigations\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are assisting local police in the investigation [43] [141] Ramos' guns and magazines were recovered by law enforcement for analysis [116] Two days after the shooting, state officials said that the Texas Ranger Division was investigating local police's conduct during the incident [31] On May 29, the United States Department of Justice announced it would review the law enforcement response to the mass shooting at the request of Uvalde Mayor, Don McLaughlin [142]\n\n\nTexas House Investigative Committee\nOn June 9, a committee of three started their investigations into the shooting on behalf of the Texas House of Representatives; the committee consisted of Representative Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock), Representative Joe Moody (D-El Paso) and former Texas Supreme Court member Eva Guzman (R) [146] That day, committee leader Burrows explained that the investigation would be done in private out of \"respect for the process\" and wanting to be \"thorough\" and \"accurate\" before revealing \"any conclusions\" [146] On June 20, before the committee had a hearing at Uvalde City Hall, a fire marshal told parents, journalists, and a chaplain to leave the premises because \"someone is intimidated\" [147]\n\n\nAttempts to block release of police records\nOn June 16, the City of Uvalde through its attorneys cited several reasons to prevent the release of police records related to the shooting The stated reasons include: information that \"is not of legitimate concern to the public\"; \"highly embarrassing information\" related to criminal history; potential revealing of police \"methods, techniques, and strategies for preventing and predicting crime\"; potentially distressing information; potentially exposing city employees or officers to \"a substantial threat of physical harm\"; privacy; and the \"dead suspect loophole\", where information is suppressed for crimes in which no one has been convicted, including in cases where the suspect is dead [148]\n\n\nHallway video\nFreeman F Martin, deputy director of Homeland Security Operations at the Texas DPS, informed Burrows that the district attorney of Uvalde County has objected to the release of a portion of a video taken in the hallway during the police response The clip ended immediately before officers breached the classroom and did not show any images of children Burrows, Martin, and Uvalde mayor Don McLaughlin believe that releasing the footage would be helpful to the public [149] On July 12, 2022, the Austin American-Statesman released 77 minutes of video composed of footage from hallway cameras and an officer's body worn camera [150] The released video was edited to obscure the identity of a student and to remove the sound of children screaming [151] [152] The video was intended to be shown to the families of victims on Sunday, July 17, before it would be released publicly [153] The Austin American-Statesman obtained a copy of the video and

The shooting resulted in the deaths of 19 students and 2 teachers.\n\n## Background\n\nUvalde is a Hispanic-majority city of about 15,000 people in the South Texas region. It is located about 60 miles (97 km) east of the United States–Mexico border and about 85 miles (137 km) west of San Antonio. In 2022, about 90% of Robb Elementary School's 600 students in the second through fourth grades were Hispanic, and about 81% of the student population came from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. On the day of the shooting, there had been an awards ceremony at the school.\n\n## School security preparations\n\nThe city of Uvalde spent 40% of its municipal budget on its police department in the 2019–2020 fiscal year. UCISD, the school district operating Robb Elementary School, had multiple security measures in place at the time of the shooting. The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Department (UCISD PD) had a six-officer police department responsible for security at the district's eight schools. It had also more than doubled its expenditures on security measures in the four years preceding the shooting, and in 2021, it expanded its police force from four officers to six officers. The state of Texas had given UCISD a $69,141 grant to improve security measures as part of a $100 million statewide allocation made after the 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting, in which ten people were slain. The district also had a security staff that patrolled door entrances and parking lots at secondary school campuses. Since 2020, Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo had served as UCISD's police chief.\n\n## Events\n\nOn May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos and his 66-year-old grandmother had an argument over his failure to graduate

Twitter that there was an active shooter at the elementary school [75] The school district's police chief, Pedro Arredondo, erroneously determined that the situation had \"transitioned from an active shooter to a barricaded subject\" according to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) With Ramos thought to be contained, officials believed they had bought enough time to bring in tactical units [76]\n\n\nAccount by Pedro Arredondo\nIn an interview by The Texas Tribune published on June 9, 2022, Uvalde School District Police Chief at the time, Pedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, said he arrived at the school thinking he was the first law enforcement officer on the scene He claimed he abandoned his police and campus radios because he wanted his hands free to shoot the gunman, and stated he also thought the radios would slow him down He said one radio's antenna would hit him when he ran, while the other radio was prone to falling off his belt when he ran, and that he knew from experience that the radios did not work in some school buildings  Arredondo said he was unaware of 9-1-1 calls being made from the classrooms the gunman was in because he did not have a radio and no one told him; the other officers in the school hallway were not in radio communication either [93]\n\n\nTimeline of events\nBelow is a timeline of events, according to law enforcement and other sources [50] [95] [96] [97] This timeline is still under investigation As of June 19, 2022, there are multiple disputes about the timeline [98] [99]\n\n\nVictims\nNineteen students and two teachers were killed in the shooting: [110] [111] [112]\n\n\nPerpetrator\nBorn on May 16, 2004 in Fargo, North Dakota, [119] Salvador Rolando Ramos was a resident of Uvalde from an early age and was a former student at Uvalde High School [120] He also attended Robb Elementary School for fourth grade in the same classroom where he was killed [121] He was frequently bullied at school, [122] [123] and Lt Chris Olivarez from Texas DPS claimed that Ramos had no friends [124] Furthermore, he did not have a criminal record or any documented mental health issues [61] However, he had searched the term \"sociopath\" and received an email about possible treatment [125] He had also previously posted violent threats online [126] School officials at Uvalde High School withdrew him from the school on October 28, 2021, due to his frequent absences [123]\n\n\nInvestigations\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are assisting local police in the

Representatives; the committee consisted of Representative Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock), Representative Joe Moody (D-El Paso) and former Texas Supreme Court member Eva Guzman (R) [146] That day, committee leader Burrows explained that the investigation would be done in private out of \"respect for the process\" and wanting to be \"thorough\" and \"accurate\" before revealing \"any conclusions\" [146] On June 20, before the committee had a hearing at Uvalde City Hall, a fire marshal told parents, journalists, and a chaplain to leave the premises because \"someone is intimidated\" [147]\n\n\nAttempts to block release of police records\nOn June 16, the City of Uvalde through its attorneys cited several reasons to prevent the release of police records related to the shooting The stated reasons include: information that \"is not of legitimate concern to the public\"; \"highly embarrassing information\" related to criminal history; potential revealing of police \"methods, techniques, and strategies for preventing and predicting crime\"; potentially distressing information; potentially exposing city employees or officers to \"a substantial threat of physical harm\"; privacy; and the \"dead suspect loophole\", where information is suppressed for crimes in which no one has been convicted, including in cases where the suspect is dead [148]\n\n\nHallway video\nFreeman F Martin, deputy director of Homeland Security Operations at the Texas DPS, informed Burrows that the district attorney of Uvalde County has objected to the release of a portion of a video taken in the hallway during the police response The clip ended immediately before officers breached the classroom and did not show any images of children Burrows, Martin, and Uvalde mayor Don McLaughlin believe that releasing the footage would be helpful to the public [149] On July 12, 2022, the Austin American-Statesman released 77 minutes of video composed of footage from hallway cameras and an officer's body worn camera [150] The released video was edited to obscure the identity of a student and to remove the sound of children screaming [151] [152] The video was intended to be shown to the families of victims on Sunday, July 17, before it would be released publicly [153] The Austin American-Statesman obtained a copy of the video and published it on July 12, creating anger amongst

I promise you that.\" On October 6, 2022, Elizondo was fired from the UCISD,  which cited that \"Elizondo's statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.\" [208] [209]\n\n\nCriticism of police\nIn January 2024, the Department of Justice released a report criticizing several failures of the Uvalde Police Department, including a failure to recognize the active shooter situation, a failure to take \"courageous action\", failure to secure the crime scene, failure to establish standard operating procedures and failure to communicate with families [216] One parent of a survivor of the shooting said that since the report had been released, his family and other families of victims and survivors had been harassed by Uvalde police, who would pull them over arbitrarily and were trying to make them leave town [217]\n\n\nLaw enforcement failures and controversies\nAlmost 400 law enforcement officers, including 150 U.S Border Patrol agents and 91 Texas DPS officers, came to Uvalde during the shooting [218] Before tactical units arrived, police officers inside the school, who numbered at least 19, made \"no effort\" to breach the room where Ramos was located, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) According to the DPS, the decision to wait for tactical units to arrive was based on the false belief that Ramos had been isolated to a classroom where he could do no more harm [56] This decision was made by the incident commander, identified as Pedro Arredondo, UCISD's chief of police [29]\n\n\nConfronting the shooter\nAlmost 400 law enforcement officers, including 150 U.S Border Patrol agents and 91 Texas DPS officers, came to Uvalde during the shooting [218] Before tactical units arrived, police officers inside the school, who numbered at least 19, made \"no effort\" to breach the room where Ramos was located, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) According to the DPS, the decision to wait for tactical units to arrive was based on the false belief that Ramos had been isolated to a classroom where he could do no more harm [56] This decision was made by the incident commander, identified as Pedro Arredondo, UCISD's chief of police [29]\n\n\nInaccurate initial statements by Texas authorities\nOfficials, including Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Texas DPS director Steve C McCraw, gave inaccurate and incomplete initial accounts of the shooting [230] In many ways, new information from the authorities directly contradicted previous accounts from officials [230] On May 26, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas said that state officials \"provided conflicting accounts\" that contradicted witnesses and called for the FBI to investigate and provide a full account of the incident [231]\n\n\nCity Hall meeting with Steve McCraw on June 2\nOn June 2, nine days after the mass shooting, there was a private meeting at Uvalde City Hall The gathering was arranged by Governor Greg Abbott's office, due to \"rising tensions between Uvalde officials.\" Abbott's general counsel and his chief of staff Luis Saenz were both in attendance as mediators Various Uvalde civic leaders were also present, including mayor Don McLaughlin, county judge Bill Mitchell, local district attorney Christina Mitchell Busbee, county attorney John Dodson, local police officials, Uvalde assistant city manager Joe Cardenas, and Uvalde city attorney Paul Tarski [242] [243]\n\n\nResponses\nRamos' mother said that she had no explanation for her son's attack on the school but that he \"had his reasons for doing what he did and please don't judge him I only want the innocent children who died to forgive me.\" His father apologized for his son's actions and said, \"He should've just killed me, you know, instead of doing something like that.\" [244] [245]\n\n\nRamos' parents\nRamos' mother said that she had no explanation for her son's attack on the school but that he \"had his reasons for doing what he did and please don't judge him I only want the innocent children who died to forgive me.\" His father apologized for his son's actions and said, \"He should've just killed me, you know, instead of doing something like that.\" [244] [245]\n\n\nSurvivors and families\nArnulfo Reyes, the teacher in classroom 111 who lost all 11 of his students present during the shooting, was shot in the arm, lung, and back Reyes labeled law enforcement as \"cowards\" for their response during the shooting, saying: \"They sit there and did nothing for our community They took a long time to go in.\" He also said: \"After everything, I get more angry because you  [law enforcement] have a bulletproof vest, I have nothing.\" [69] [70] He commented that no training \"gets you ready for this We trained our kids to sit under the table .. but we set them up to be like ducks .. You can give us all the training you want but gun laws have to change .. I will go anywhere to the end of the world to not let my students die in vain .. I will go to the end of the world to make sure things get changed.\" [70]\n\n\nReactions from politicians\nPresident Joe Biden ordered flags at federal buildings to be flown at half-staff [255] In a televised address to the nation on May 24, Biden highlighted that other countries have \"mental health problems\", \"domestic disputes\", and \"people who are lost, but these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency they happen in America Why? Why are we willing to live with this carnage?\" [255] Biden said that he was \"sick and tired\" of mass shootings, declaring \"we have to act\", and calling for \"common sense\" gun laws [255] Biden also spoke to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to offer assistance, according to Biden's communications director [256]\n\n\nResulting gun control discussions\nPresident Biden delivered a speech on the shooting and asked, \"When in God's name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?\" [300] His lack of a concrete plan attracted controversy from gun control activists [301] In a speech given on the night of the shooting, Vice President Kamala Harris reacted to the shooting by calling for policy changes to prevent similar shootings [265] Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the U.S to pass stricter gun control measures, and he urged Republican members of Congress to resist influence from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a gun-rights lobby that have long been blamed for USA lawmakers' resistance to supporting gun control.\n\n\nPolitical\nPresident Biden delivered a speech on the shooting and asked, \"When in God's name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?\" [300] His lack of a concrete plan attracted controversy from gun control activists [301] In a speech given on the night of the shooting, Vice President Kamala Harris reacted to the shooting by calling for policy changes to prevent similar shootings [265] Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the U.S to pass stricter gun control measures, and he urged Republican members of Congress to resist influence from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a gun-rights lobby that have long been blamed for USA lawmakers' resistance to supporting gun control.\n\n\nNRA and Daniel Defense\nThe NRA-ILA's annual leadership forum on May 27 in Houston drew heavy criticism in light of the recent shooting Former President Donald Trump; governors Kristi Noem and Greg Abbott; Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick; Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn; and Representative Dan Crenshaw were previously scheduled to give remarks [311] Cornyn and Crenshaw subsequently canceled their attendances, and Abbott announced that he would instead appear at a news conference in Uvalde and send pre-recorded remarks to the NRA convention [312]\n\n\nMass shooting survivors and families\nManuel Oliver, a gun control activist and the father of a Stoneman Douglas High School shooting victim, issued a statement expressing his outrage, and said that the families of the victims do not need the thoughts and prayers of politicians; instead, they \"need their kids\" [318] Several families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims spoke out, with several calling for stricter gun control [319] Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed during the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, also called for politicians to enact stricter gun control, and expressed support for the families of Robb Elementary School victims [320]\n\n\nEntertainment\nIn a press conference during the 2022 NBA playoffs, Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr expressed his outrage at the refusal of American politicians to implement laws on gun control, [323] while the Miami Heat urged their fans to contact state senators \"demanding their support for common sense gun laws\" [324] The social media accounts for the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays began posting facts about gun violence during a game in St Petersburg, Florida [325] [326]\n\n\nLegislative action\nStarting on May 26, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada took steps in proposing new firearms regulations, [331] [332] [333] including a freeze on handgun sales on October 24 [334]\n\n\nCanada\nStarting on May 26, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada took steps in proposing new firearms regulations, [331] [332] [333] including a freeze on handgun sales on October 24 [334]\n\n\nUnited States\nOn June 6, the state of New York passed a new law raising the age from 18 to 21 for people to be able to buy semi-automatic weapons [335]\n\n\nProtecting Our Kids Act\nOn June 2, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary proposed the Protecting Our Kids Act [336] The bill notably excludes an assault weapons ban but includes other measures, such as banning those under 21 from purchasing semi-automatic rifles and the import, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of high-capacity magazines, requiring bump stocks to be registered under the National Firearms Act and banning them for civilian use [337] [338] It also redefines receiver blanks to require background checks on all sales, strengthens federal offenses for gun trafficking and straw purchases, creates a compensated buyback program between local governments and individuals surrendering such magazines, along with a new tax credit for the sale of safe storage device at home, and penalizes violations of new safe storage requirements on residences The House later passed the bill, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate [339] The International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police wrote to congressional leadership offering to help work on gun measures [337] [340]\n\n\nBipartisan Safer Communities Act\nOn June 23, the Senate passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act with bipartisan support in a 65–33 vote [341] 15 Senate Republicans voted to support it [341]\n\n\nLegacy\nMultiple memorials were held in Uvalde and across Texas in commemoration for the victims for the one year anniversary of the shooting on May 24, 2023 Survivors, family members and supporters gathered for events such as a 77-minute vigil (the amount of time waited outside the classroom by authorities), candlelight vigils, butterfly release, and mariachi performances [343] President Biden spoke about the anniversary at the White House with 21 candles at the base of the White House Grand Staircase, and spoke about his frustration at a lack of change in gun policy [344] Similar frustration was echoed by survivors and family members who waited for investigations and legal cases to finish and policy to change, and many of these topics have caused anger and strife to be seen throughout Uvalde [345]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr (1912–1990), who had a sister and four brothers [5] [6] and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar [7] He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with Irish [8] and English family heritage [9] [10] His maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland [11] [12] DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Clay was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom [13]\n\n\nAmateur career\nClay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E Martin, [19] who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief having taken his bicycle He told the officer he was going to \"whup\" the thief The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first [20] Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting [21] He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \"real training\", eventually molding \"my style, my stamina and my system\" For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak [22]\n\n\nProfessional career\nClay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match [26] [27]\n\n\nEarly career\nClay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match [26] [27]\n\n\nWorld heavyweight champion\nBy late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, Clay was an 8:1 underdog [34] Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", claiming \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and \"I'm gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him.\" [35] Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54 [34] Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\n\nFights against Liston\nBy late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating

tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54 [34] Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\n\nFight against Patterson\nAli defended his title against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965 Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"Uncle Tom\", calling him \"The Rabbit\" Although Ali had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout Patterson later said he had strained his sacroiliac Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight [43] Patterson biographer W K Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS [43]\n\n\nMain Bout\nAfter the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts The company's stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including Bob Arum [45]\n\n\nDraft resistance\nMy enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese You my opposer when I want freedom You my opposer when I want justice You my opposer when I want equality You won't even stand up for me in America for my religious beliefs—and you want me to go somewhere and fight, but you won't even stand up for me here at home?\n\n\nImpact of Ali's draft refusal\nAli's example inspired many black Americans and others However, initially when he refused induction, he became arguably the most hated man in the country and received many death threats People who supported Ali during this time were also threatened, including sports journalist Jerry Izenberg, whose columns defended Ali's decision not to serve He wrote, \"Bomb threats emptied our office, making the staff stand out in the snow My car windshield was smashed with a sledgehammer.\" [72] [73] The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, \"Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?\" [59]\n\n\nNSA and FBI monitoring of Ali's communications\nIn a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker, Dr Martin Luther King Jr., prominent U.S journalists, and others who criticized the U.S war in Vietnam [80] [81] A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\" [81]\n\n\nExile and comeback\nIn March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971 [83]\n\n\nProtesting while exiled\nDuring this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice Ali based himself in Chicago [84] According to most close to him, his Chicago years were formative.\n\n\nThe Super Fight\nWhile banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano [88] In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes [89] A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970 In the U.S version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated [90]\n\n\nReturn\nOn August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission Leroy Johnson, Jesse Hill Jr and Harry Pett had used their local political influence and set up the company House of Sports to organize the fight, underlining the influential power of Georgia's black politics in Ali's comeback [91] Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.\n\n\nFight against Joe Frazier\nAli and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"Fight of the Century\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion Veteran US boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life\" The bout was broadcast to 36 countries; promoters granted 760 press passes [25]\n\n\nAfter his loss\nIn 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26 Although the seven-foot-one-inch-tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60 pounds more and able to reach 14 inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\", [96] and he did exactly that [97] To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round [98]\n\n\nChamberlain challenge and Ellis fight\nIn 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26 Although the seven-foot-one-inch-tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60 pounds more and able to reach 14 inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\", [96] and he did exactly that [97] To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round [98]\n\n\nFights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster, Bugner and Norton\nAfter the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year During two bouts he had in 1973 with Joe Bugner and Ken Norton, he wore a \"People's Choice\" robe which was given to him by Elvis Presley [99] In 1973 before his fight with Norton, Tom Cushman said Ali was \"gloriously overconfident He didn't consider this guy a threat at all.\" [100] But during the fight, either in the 2nd round according to most press reports, or the final round according to Norton, [100] Norton broke Ali's jaw and inflicted by decision the second loss of his career After considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.\n\n\nSecond fight against Joe Frazier\nAli was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.\n\n\nWorld heavyweight champion (second reign)\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed The Rumble in the Jungle Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts Ali was 32 years old and had lost speed and reflexes since his twenties Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n\nThe Rumble in the Jungle\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed The Rumble in the Jungle Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts Ali was 32 years old and had lost speed and reflexes since his twenties Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n\nFights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner\nAli's next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner Wepner, a journeyman known as \"The Bayonne Bleeder\", stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot The fight inspired Sylvester Stallone to create the acclaimed film Rocky [110]\n\n\nThird fight against Joe Frazier\nAli then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila The bout, known as the \"Thrilla in Manila\", was held on October 1, 1975, [4] in temperatures approaching 100 °F (38 °C) In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counterpunching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, spent.\n\n\nLater career\nOn February 2, 1976, Ali defeated Jean-Pierre Coopman by 5th round knockout The WBC Heavyweight title was not on the line for this fight On April 30, 1976, Ali would fight Jimmy Young and win a controversial unanimous decision Howard Cosell would remark that he had \"never seen Ali so off in his timing\" and when asked on his performance against Young in the post-fight interview, Ali stated that he was \"getting old\" and that he was \"preserving his energy\" for Ken Norton [112] On May 24, 1976, Ali defeated Richard Dunn, winning by 5th round technical knockout The punch used to knock Dunn out was taught to Ali by Taekwondo Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee Rhee called that punch the \"Accupunch\";

Marcellus Clay Sr (1912–1990), who had a sister and four brothers [5] [6] and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky Clay's father's paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar [7] He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with Irish [8] and English family heritage [9] [10] His maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland [11] [12] DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Clay was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom [13]\n\n\nAmateur career\nClay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E Martin, [19] who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief having taken his bicycle He told the officer he was going to \"whup\" the thief The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first [20] Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting [21] He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the \"real training\", eventually molding \"my style, my stamina and my system\" For the last four years of Clay's amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak [22]\n\n\nProfessional career\nClay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper Clay also

Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match [26] [27]\n\n\nWorld heavyweight champion\nBy late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob Based on Clay's uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, Clay was an 8:1 underdog [34] Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\", claiming \"Liston even smells like a bear\" and \"I'm gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him.\" [35] Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54 [34] Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\n\nFights against Liston\nBy late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's title The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating

tonight.\" Clay's pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54 [34] Many of those in attendance thought Clay's behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.\n\n\nFight against Patterson\nAli defended his title against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965 Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an \"Uncle Tom\", calling him \"The Rabbit\" Although Ali had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout Patterson later said he had strained his sacroiliac Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight [43] Patterson biographer W K Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali's Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS [43]\n\n\nMain Bout\nAfter the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout The company mainly handled Ali's boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts The company's stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including Bob Arum [45]\n\n\nDraft resistance\nMy enemy is the white people, not Viet Cong or Chinese or Japanese You my opposer when I want freedom You my opposer when I want justice You my opposer when I want equality You won't even stand up for me in America for my religious beliefs—and you want me to go somewhere and fight, but you won't even stand up for me here at home?\n\n\nImpact of Ali's draft refusal\nAli's example inspired many black Americans and others However, initially when he refused induction, he became arguably the most hated man in the country and received many death threats People who supported Ali during this time were also threatened, including sports journalist Jerry Izenberg, whose columns defended Ali's decision not to serve He wrote, \"Bomb threats emptied our office, making the staff stand out in the snow My car windshield was smashed with a sledgehammer.\" [72] [73] The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, \"Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?\" [59]\n\n\nNSA and FBI monitoring of Ali's communications\nIn a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker, Dr Martin Luther King Jr., prominent U.S journalists, and others who criticized the U.S war in Vietnam [80] [81] A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\" [81]\n\n\nExile and comeback\nIn March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971 [83]\n\n\nProtesting while exiled\nDuring this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali's stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice Ali based himself in Chicago [84] According to most close to him, his Chicago years were formative.\n\n\nThe Super Fight\nWhile banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano [88] In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes [89] A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970 In the U.S version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated [90]\n\n\nReturn\nOn August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission Leroy Johnson, Jesse Hill Jr and Harry Pett had used their local political influence and set up the company House of Sports to organize the fight, underlining the influential power of Georgia's black politics in Ali's comeback [91] Ali's first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.\n\n\nFight against Joe Frazier\nAli and Frazier's first fight, held at the Garden on March 8, 1971, was nicknamed the \"Fight of the Century\", due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion Veteran US boxing writer John Condon called it \"the greatest event I've ever worked on in my life\" The bout was broadcast to 36 countries; promoters granted 760 press passes [25]\n\n\nAfter his loss\nIn 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26 Although the seven-foot-one-inch-tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60 pounds more and able to reach 14 inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\", [96] and he did exactly that [97] To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round [98]\n\n\nChamberlain challenge and Ellis fight\nIn 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26 Although the seven-foot-one-inch-tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60 pounds more and able to reach 14 inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of \"Timber!\" and \"The tree will fall\" during a shared interview These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed \"this boxing foolishness\", [96] and he did exactly that [97] To replace Ali's opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali's, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round [98]\n\n\nFights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster, Bugner and Norton\nAfter the loss to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year During two bouts he had in 1973 with Joe Bugner and Ken Norton, he wore a \"People's Choice\" robe which was given to him by Elvis Presley [99] In 1973 before his fight with Norton, Tom Cushman said Ali was \"gloriously overconfident He didn't consider this guy a threat at all.\" [100] But during the fight, either in the 2nd round according to most press reports, or the final round according to Norton, [100] Norton broke Ali's jaw and inflicted by decision the second loss of his career After considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.\n\n\nSecond fight against Joe Frazier\nAli was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali's head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier's dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier's camp complained of bitterly Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.\n\n\nWorld heavyweight champion (second reign)\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed The Rumble in the Jungle Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts Ali was 32 years old and had lost speed and reflexes since his twenties Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n\nThe Rumble in the Jungle\nThe defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed The Rumble in the Jungle Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts Ali was 32 years old and had lost speed and reflexes since his twenties Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali's long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.\n\n\nFights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner\nAli's next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner Wepner, a journeyman known as \"The Bayonne Bleeder\", stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner's foot The fight inspired Sylvester Stallone to create the acclaimed film Rocky [110]\n\n\nThird fight against Joe Frazier\nAli then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila The bout, known as the \"Thrilla in Manila\", was held on October 1, 1975, [4] in temperatures approaching 100 °F (38 °C) In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the \"rope-a-dope\" strategy, frequently resorting to clinches During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counterpunching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier's left eye and opened a cut over his right eye With Frazier's vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called \"target practice\" on Frazier's head The fight was stopped when Frazier's trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier's protests Frazier's eyes were both swollen shut Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, spent.\n\n\nLater career\nOn February 2, 1976, Ali defeated Jean-Pierre Coopman by 5th round knockout The WBC Heavyweight title was not on the line for this fight On April 30, 1976, Ali would fight Jimmy Young and win a controversial unanimous decision Howard Cosell would remark that he had \"never seen Ali so off in his timing\" and when asked on his performance against Young in the post-fight interview, Ali stated that he was \"getting old\" and that he was \"preserving his energy\" for Ken Norton [112] On May 24, 1976, Ali defeated Richard Dunn, winning by 5th round technical knockout The punch used to knock Dunn out was taught to Ali by Taekwondo Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee Rhee called that punch the \"Accupunch\"; he learned it from Bruce Lee [113] The Dunn fight was the last time Ali would knock an opponent out in his boxing career.\n\n\nFight stoppage vs. Larry Holmes\nOn October 2, 1980, Ali returned to the ring to fight Holmes at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas Holmes, who fought under the nickname \"The Easton Assassin\", easily dominated Ali After the tenth round, Angelo Dundee stepped into the ring and instructed the referee to stop the fight It was the only time Ali ever lost by stoppage.\n\n\nExhibition bouts\nAli boxed both well-known boxers and celebrities from other walks of life, including Antonio Inoki, [128] Michael Dokes, [129] Sammy Davis Jr., [130] Richard Pryor, [130] Marvin Gaye, [130] Burt Young, [130] Lyle Alzado, [131] Dave Semenko, [132] and Puerto Rican comedian Jose Miguel Agrelot (with Iris Chacon acting as Agrelot's corner-woman) [133]\n\n\nAli vs Inoki\nOn June 26, 1976, Ali participated in an exhibition bout in Tokyo against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist Antonio Inoki [134] Ali was only able to land two jabs while Inoki's kicks caused two blood clots and an infection that almost resulted in Ali's leg being amputated, as a result of Ali's team insisting on rules restricting Inoki's ability to wrestle [134] Because of this, the fight has been criticized for causing Ali trouble healthwise, mostly in terms of movement, later down the line; Ferdie Pacheco stated \"Ali was still feeling the effects of his leg injury, and his mobility was not what it had been\" [134] The match was not scripted and ultimately declared a draw [134] After Ali's death, The New York Times declared it his least memorable fight [135] Most boxing commentators at the time viewed the fight negatively and hoped it would be forgotten as some considered it a \"15-round farce\" [136] Today it is considered by some to be one of Ali's most influential fights and CBS Sports said the attention the mixed-style bout received \"foretold the arrival of standardized MMA years later\" [136] [137] Ali and Inoki began a friendship after the fight [138]\n\n\nAli vs Alzado\nIn 1979, Ali fought an exhibition match against NFL player Lyle Alzado The fight went 8 rounds and was declared a draw [139]\n\n\nAli vs Semenko\nAli fought NHL player, Dave Semenko in an exhibition on June 12, 1983 [140] The match was officially a draw after going three rounds, but the Canadian Press reported Ali was not seriously trying for most of the bout, instead just toying with Semenko [141]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAli was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad, who was to become Ali's long-time manager, and asked her to marry him after their first date They married approximately one month later on August 14, 1964 [142] They quarreled over Sonji's refusal to join the Nation of Islam [143] According to Ali, \"She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look right.\" [144] The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966 Just before the divorce was finalized, Ali sent Sonji a note: \"You traded heaven for hell, baby.\" [145] Ali's brother Rahaman said that she was Ali's only true love and the Nation of Islam made Ali divorce her and Ali never got over it [143]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nAli was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad, who was to become Ali's long-time manager, and asked her to marry him after their first date They married approximately one month later on August 14, 1964 [142] They quarreled over Sonji's refusal to join the Nation of Islam [143] According to Ali, \"She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do She wore lipstick;

man begets\" However, he still believed that even good Christians or good Jews could receive God's blessing and enter heaven as he stated, \"God created all people, no matter what their religion\" He also stated, \"If you're against someone because he's a Muslim that's wrong If you're against someone because he's a Christian or a Jew, that's wrong\" [195]\n\n\nHealth\nDuring his amateur career, Ali refrained from smoking, drugs, and drinking alcohol and soda pop, and adopted an idiosyncratic diet [207] Upon his acceptance of the dietary restrictions of Islam, the Nation of Islam recruited cooks to prepare his meals [208]\n\n\nEntertainment career\nAli had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of Requiem for a Heavyweight, and during his exile from boxing, he starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, Buck White [209] [210] He also appeared in the documentary film Black Rodeo (1972) riding both a horse and a bull [211]\n\n\nActing\nAli had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of Requiem for a Heavyweight, and during his exile from boxing, he starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, Buck White [209] [210] He also appeared in the documentary film Black Rodeo (1972) riding both a horse and a bull [211]\n\n\nSpoken word poetry\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee.\nHis hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.\nNow you see me, now you don't.\nGeorge thinks he will, but I know he won't.\n\n\nProfessional wrestling\nAli was involved with professional wrestling at different times in his career.\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nMuhammad Ali's fights were some of the world's most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records His most-watched fights drew an estimated 1–2 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world's most-watched live television broadcasts at the time [109] Outside of fights, he made many other television appearances The following table lists known viewership figures of his non-fight television appearances For television viewership figures of his fights, see Boxing career of Muhammad Ali: Television viewership.\n\n\nArt\nAli was also an amateur artist and made dozens of drawings and paintings in the 1970s In 1977, Rodney Hilton Brown, who owned an art gallery in NYC, asked Ali if he was interested in painting Ali took him up on the offer and produced several paintings for him to sell Brown is the author of \"Muhammad Ali: The Untold Story: Painter, Poet and Prophet\" [235] In October 2021, 26 of his drawings and arts were placed on auction and sold for close to US$1 Million [236] [237]\n\n\nLater life\nBy the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed an estimated 200,000 hits [238]\n\n\nPhilanthropy, humanitarianism and politics\nAli was known for being a humanitarian [243] and philanthropist [244] He focused on practicing his Islamic duty of charity and good deeds, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people of all religious backgrounds It is estimated that Ali helped to feed more than 22 million people afflicted by hunger across the world [245] Early in his career, one of his main focuses was youth education He spoke at several historically black colleges and universities about the importance of education and became the largest single black donor to the United Negro College Fund in 1967 by way of a $10,000 donation ($78,000 in 2020 USD) In late 1966, he also pledged to donate a total of $100,000 to the UNCF (specifically promising to donate much of the proceeds of his title defense against Cleveland Williams) and paid $4,500 per closed circuit installation at six HBCUs so they could watch his fights [76]\n\n\nEarnings\nBy 1978, Ali's total fight purse earnings were estimated to be nearly $60 million [271] (inflation-adjusted $379 million), including an estimated $47.45 million grossed between 1970 and 1978 [272] By 1980, his total fight purse earnings were estimated to be up to $70 million [273] (inflation-adjusted $338 million).\n\n\nDeclining health\nI'm blessed and thankful to God that I understand he's trying me This is a trial from God He gave me this illness to remind me that I am not number one;

(1962) [2] and early racing video games such as Astro Race (1973) [3] The first examples of multiplayer real-time games were developed on the PLATO system about 1973 Multi-user games developed on this system included 1973's Empire and 1974's Spasim; the latter was an early first-person shooter Other early video games included turn-based multiplayer modes, popular in tabletop arcade machines In such games, play is alternated at some point (often after the loss of a life) All players' scores are often displayed onscreen so players can see their relative standing Danielle Bunten Berry created some of the first multiplayer video games, such as her debut, Wheeler Dealers (1978) and her most notable work, M.U.L.E (1983).\n\n\nNetworked\nKen Wasserman and Tim Stryker identified three factors which make networked computer games appealing: [4]\n\n\nLocal multiplayer\nFor some games, \"multiplayer\" implies that players are playing on the same gaming system or network This applies to all arcade games, but also to a number of console, and personal computer games too Local multiplayer games played on a singular system sometimes use split screen, so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in racing video games) Nearly all multiplayer modes on beat 'em up games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split-screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.\n\n\nOnline multiplayer\nOnline multiplayer games connect players over a wide area network (a common example being the Internet) Unlike local multiplayer, players playing online multiplayer are not restricted to the same local network This allows players to interact with others from a much greater distance.\n\n\nAsymmetrical gameplay\nAsymmetrical multiplayer is a type of gameplay in which players can have significantly different roles or abilities from each other – enough to provide a significantly different experience of the game [13] In games with light asymmetry, the players share some of the same basic mechanics (such as movement and death), yet have different roles in the game; this is a common feature of the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre such as League of Legends and Dota 2, and in hero shooters such as Overwatch and Apex Legends A first-person shooter that adopts the asymmetrical multiplayer system is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Giving players their own special operator changes every player's experience This puts an emphasis on players improvising their own game plan given the abilities their character has [14] In games with stronger elements of asymmetry, one player/team may have one gameplay experience (or be in softly asymmetric roles) while the other player or team play in a drastically different way, with different mechanics, a different type of objective, or both Examples of games with strong asymmetry include Dead by Daylight, Evolve, and Left 4 Dead [13]\n\n\nAsynchronous multiplayer\nAsynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have to be playing at the same time [15] This form of multiplayer game has its origins in play-by-mail games, where players would send their moves through postal mail to a game master, who then would compile and send out results for the next turn Play-by-mail games transitioned to electronic form as play-by-email games [16] Similar games were developed for bulletin board systems, such as Trade Wars, where the turn structure may not be as rigorous and allow players to take actions at any time in a persistence space alongside all other players, a concept known as sporadic play [17]\n\n\nOnline cheating\nOnline cheating (in gaming) usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others, such as using an \"aimbot\" – a program which automatically locks the player's crosshairs onto a target – in shooting games [18] [19] [20] This is also known as \"hacking\" or \"glitching\" (\"glitching\" refers to using a glitch, or a mistake in the code of a game, whereas \"hacking\" is manipulating the code of a game) Cheating in video games is often done via a third-party program that modifies the game's code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the game's files to change the game's mechanics [21]\n\n\nSee also\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Multiplayer**\n\nMultiplayer is a form of gameplay where two or more players interact with each other in a shared environment, often in real-time.

This applies to all arcade games, but also to a number of console, and personal computer games too. Local multiplayer games played on a singular system sometimes use split screen, so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in racing video games). Nearly all multiplayer modes on beat 'em up games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split-screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode. Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.\n\n* **Online multiplayer**: Online multiplayer games connect players over a wide area network (a common example being the Internet). Unlike local multiplayer, players playing online multiplayer are not restricted to the same local network. This allows players to interact with others from a much greater distance.\n\n**Asymmetrical Gameplay**\n\nAsymmetrical multiplayer is a type of gameplay in which players can have significantly different roles or abilities from each other – enough to provide a significantly different experience of the game. In games with light asymmetry, the players share some of the same basic mechanics (such as movement and death), yet have different roles in the game. This is a common feature of the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, such as League of Legends and Dota 2, and in hero shooters such as Overwatch and Apex Legends.\n\nA first-person shooter that adopts the asymmetrical multiplayer system is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Giving players their own special operator changes every player's experience. This puts an emphasis on players improvising their own game plan given the abilities their character has. In games with stronger elements of asymmetry, one player/team may have one gameplay experience (or be in softly asymmetric roles) while the other player or team play in a drastically different way, with different mechanics, a different type of objective, or both. Examples of games with strong asymmetry include Dead by Daylight, Evolve, and Left 4 Dead.\n\n**Asynchronous Multiplayer**\n\nAsynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have to be playing at the same time. This form of multiplayer game has its origins in play-by-mail games, where players would send their moves through postal mail to a game master, who then would compile and send out results for the next turn. Play-by-mail games transitioned to electronic form as play-by-email games. Similar games were developed for bulletin board systems, such as Trade Wars, where the turn structure may not be as rigorous and allow players to take actions at any time in a persistence space alongside all other players, a concept known as sporadic play.\n\n**Online Cheating**\n\nOnline cheating usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others, such as using an \"aimbot\" – a program which automatically locks the player's crosshairs onto a target – in shooting games. This is also known as \"hacking\" or \"glitching\" (\"glitching\" refers to using a glitch, or a mistake in the code of a game, whereas \"hacking\" is manipulating the code of a game). Cheating in video games is often done via a third-party program that modifies the game's code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage. In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the game's files to change the game's mechanics.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)\n* First-person shooter (FPS)\n* Asymmetrical gameplay\n* Online cheating\n* Play-by-mail games\n* Bulletin board systems (BBS)\n* Sporadic play", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Multiplayer\" following this outline:\n\n\nNon-networked\nSome of the earliest video games were two-player games, including early sports games (such as 1958's Tennis For Two  and 1972's Pong), early shooter games such as Spacewar!

His father, Dennis Graham, is an African-American drummer from Memphis, Tennessee, who once performed with musician Jerry Lee Lewis. His mother, Sandra \"Sandi\" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew, who worked as an English teacher and florist. Graham performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra, who was in attendance. Drake is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, the former derived from Graham. In his youth, he attended a Jewish day school and became a bar mitzvah.\n\n**Career**\n\nAt 15, Drake was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent. He found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation, in which Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks, a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. When asked about his early acting career, Drake replied, \"My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was from Canadian TV.\" According to showrunners Linda Schuyler and Stephen Stohn, Drake regularly arrived late on set after spending nights recording music. To prevent this, Schuyler claimed Drake struck an agreement with the set's security guards to gain entry to the set after recording to be allowed to sleep in a dressing room. Drake's first recorded song, \"Do What You Do\", appeared on The N Soundtrack, which was released by The N (the night-time block for Noggin), as it was the network that the series was airing on in the United States.\n\n**2001–2009: Career beginnings**\n\nAt 15, Drake was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent.

Drake has also credited several dancehall artists for later influencing his Caribbean-inflected style, including Vybz Kartel, whom he has called one of his \"biggest inspirations\".

[36] Barack Obama joked that Schumer brought the press to a banquet as his \"loved ones\" [37] [38] [39] [40] Schumer often schedules media appearances on Sundays Some have cited his use of media as a successful way to raise a politician's profile nationally and among his constituents [41] Schumer has appeared on The Daily Show seven times [42]\n\n\nLocal issues\nSchumer prides himself on visiting each of New York's 62 counties every year and has done so in each of the years he has served in the Senate, the only New York senator to have done so [49] He has a reputation for focusing on local issues important to average New Yorkers not normally associated with United States senators, ranging from tourism to local taxes to job creation [50] [51] [52] [53] When it was revealed that Adidas planned to end its contract for the manufacture of NBA jerseys with American Classic Outfitters, an upstate New York apparel company, and outsource production overseas, Schumer blasted the company, citing the risk to 100 workers at the plant [54]\n\n\nDrugs\nIn May 2001, Schumer and Senator John McCain introduced legislation intended to make it more difficult for makers of brand-name drugs to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market [59] A coalition of consumer groups supported the legislation and Schumer told reporters its enactment would reduce prescription drug costs by over 60% per prescription in addition to saving consumers $71 billion over the next decade [60]\n\n\nFBI\nIn November 2001, Schumer joined fellow New York Senator Hillary Clinton to call for legislation encouraging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on terrorism with local and state police by removing legal barriers to such cooperation, citing reports by New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani that federal authorities did not tell city police what they were aware of Schumer joined Patrick Leahy to report that the Justice Department supported the legislation [65]\n\n\nSupreme Court\nIn September 2005, after President George W Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States, Schumer praised Roberts's brilliance, his being \"a lawyer above all\", and his \"judicial philosophy and modesty and stability\" during the Senate Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings for Roberts But Schumer said Roberts's \"compassion and humanity\" was questionable, and objected to the Bush administration's refusal to show documents Roberts wrote during his tenure as deputy solicitor general and to Roberts's refusal to answer many questions the committee asked him [72] In June 2018, Schumer said Roberts was demeaning the Supreme Court as it became more political, citing the court ruling in favor of anti-abortion clinics in California Schumer said the court had \"affirmed a plainly discriminatory travel ban, unleashed a flood of dark unlimited money in our politics and has scrapped a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act\" and thereby aligned itself with goals of what he called \"the hard right\" [73]\n\n\n2020 comments about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch\nIn March 2020, Schumer came under controversy for statements he made about Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both of whom were nominated by Trump At a rally outside the United States Capitol while the Supreme Court was hearing an abortion-related case, Schumer said that if Kavanaugh and Gorsuch voted against abortion rights, they would have \"unleashed a whirlwind\" and would \"pay the price\" He then said, \"You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" Republicans and Democrats, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, condemned these comments as inciting violence Senator Josh Hawley called for a censure [85] A spokesman for Schumer said the comments were in reference to the political price Senate Republicans would pay, and criticized Roberts for following a \"right-wing\" attack to misinterpret the comments [86] Schumer later apologized for the comments [87]\n\n\nNet neutrality\nIn November 2017, Schumer said, \"Just as our free highway system helped build jobs in America in the 20th century, net neutrality will help build jobs in the 21st century To take a step back hurts our economy, our job growth and middle-class and working people It is a disaster.\" [88] In December, after the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules, Schumer said the internet could start resembling \"a toll road, with the highest bidders cruising along private 'fast lanes' while the rest of us inch along a single, traffic-choked public lane; and we could be forced to purchase internet packages much like cable packages, paying more for popular sites\", and that the resolution he was introducing would undo the effects of the vote [89]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nSchumer's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows: [93]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America [96]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America [96]\n\n\nAbortion\nSchumer is pro-choice, and has a 100% rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America [96]\n\n\nAgriculture\nIn March 2019, Schumer was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to U.S Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program\" [99]\n\n\nBicycle safety\nSchumer is noted for his love of cycling in New York City, especially around his home in Brooklyn [100] In 2011, he was reported to have joined a group of neighbors on his street in Park Slope, near Prospect Park They attempted to remove a new \"parking-protected\" bicycle path on their street, [101] which ran adjacent to the curb, with a protection buffer provided by parallel-parked cars next to the bike lane [102] While Schumer has not taken a public position on the traffic-calming project, whose most prominent feature is a two-way protected bike path, his wife, Iris Weinshall, is a prominent opponent of the project, and the New York Post reported that Schumer has lobbied against the bike path behind the scenes [103] In addition, a major Schumer campaign contributor [104] has fought a controversial pro bono legal battle against the project, drawing criticism [105]\n\n\nBush administration judicial nominations\nIn January 2004, after President Bush renominated Charles Pickering to the federal appeals court along with 30 other nominees who had failed to win confirmation under the previous Democratic-controlled Senate, Schumer stated his intent to prevent Pickering's confirmation and said the US could do better [106]\n\n\nCannabis\nIn April 2018, Schumer said that he would back efforts to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level [109] On April 20, a day known as 4/20, he announced his sponsorship of legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act The bill would also provide funding for women and minority-owned businesses and for research into the public health effects of cannabis [110] On June 27, 2018, Schumer formally introduced the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act [111]\n\n\nClinton impeachment\nSchumer voted on the impeachment charges of President Bill Clinton in both houses of Congress Schumer was a member of the House of Representatives (and Judiciary Committee member) during a December 1998 lame-duck session of Congress, voting \"no\" on all counts in committee and on the floor of the House In January 1999, Schumer, as a newly elected member of the Senate, also voted \"not guilty\" on the two impeachment charges [115]\n\n\nConsumer issues\nSchumer has given legislative attention to consumer issues He passed legislation that required uniform disclosure information on the back of credit card applications, notifying prospective cardholders of annual fees and interest rates This standardized information is now known as the \"Schumer box\" Schumer has also aggressively pushed to end the practice whereby customers can be charged two ATM fees, one by their own bank and one by the bank that owns the ATM, if the ATM is outside their bank's network [116]\n\n\nDeath penalty\nIn 2013, Schumer said the death penalty would be \"appropriate\" in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing \"The federal law allows the death penalty. .. I wrote the law in 1994 when I was head of the crime subcommittee in the House This is just the kind of case that it should be applied to.\" [124] [125]\n\n\nDisaster relief\nIn 2014, Schumer was recognized for helping to achieve the award of $700,000 in compensation from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Gowanda, New York, as a result of the devastating flood there in 2009

federal disaster site [126] [127]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn a November 2016 interview conducted in the weeks after Trump's election to the presidency, Schumer said that he and Trump were not friends and had had \"civil conversations a couple of times\" when Trump had contacted him Trump had said earlier that year that he believed he would get along with Schumer and that he was \"close to Schumer in many ways\" [128] In December 2016, Schumer called on Trump cabinet nominees to release their tax returns and in doing so follow the precedent set by Steve Mnuchin and Tom Price [129]\n\n\nElection reform\nIn March 2002, as the Senate worked on a compromise to save an election reform bill that stalled due to Republicans' believing it was not combative enough against voter fraud, Schumer and Senator Ron Wyden led a successful effort in protecting an amendment allowing first-time voters to be verified with only a signature [137]\n\n\nEqual pay\nIn April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Paycheck Fairness Act (S 2199; 113th Congress), a bill aimed at addressing the gender pay gap in the United States [138] Republicans argued that the Democrats were attempting to use the votes on this bill and the issue of equal pay as political issues in the 2014 midterm elections [138] Schumer backed the measure and told reporters, \"pay equity, that's women, that's 53 percent of the vote\" [138]\n\n\nFinancial industry regulation\nIn 1987, then-Representative Schumer wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, titled \"Don't Let Banks Become Casinos\" [139] In 1999, Schumer supported Congress's repeal of Glass–Steagall, saying: \"There are many reasons for this bill, but first and foremost is to ensure that U.S financial firms remain competitive.\" [140] Since 2010, the securities and investment industry has been the largest donor to Schumer's senatorial campaigns [141]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2009, Schumer criticized

massive oil deal between the United Kingdom and Libya [148]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nIn March 2006, the House Appropriations Committee voted to block an amendment allowing Dubai Ports World to operate some terminals at U.S ports, an amendment that was inserted into the emergency supplemental funding bill for military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan The same day, Schumer introduced an amendment barring a company from operating in a U.S port if the company was owned by a country that recognized the Taliban's regime in Afghanistan, the amendment being touted as similar to the House measure Senate majority leader Bill Frist subsequently asked for a quorum call that effectively gnarled proceedings, Schumer afterward opining that the Democrats had \"bent over backwards to try and accommodate the Republican schedule\" and that Frist's move meant Republicans did not want a vote at all [156]\n\n\nChina\nIn 2006, NPR reported that Schumer and Senator Lindsey Graham were highly critical of the

with Iran [165] He planned to tell the White House, then his Senate colleagues, and then the public, but the White House leaked the news during the Republican debate in what CBS News described as an \"apparent attempt to limit coverage\" [166] Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis derided Schumer's decision, noting that Schumer was making factually incorrect claims about the amount of time in which the treaty would allow inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities [167] In what The Guardian described as a \"shot across Schumer's bow\", White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that fellow Democrats might remember Schumer's decision when deciding whom to elect as their next majority leader [168]\n\n\nIraq\nSchumer was a supporter of the Iraq War Resolution but was very critical of

the American Jewish Congress in a campaign to get the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Palestinian-American charity the Holy Land Foundation, which by the time it was shut down in 2001 was the country's largest Muslim charity [174]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nIn February 2017, Schumer said that North Korea had proved itself to be \"an irresponsible nation in every way\" and that China could be used to curtail North Korea as most of North Korea's imports and exports go through China He advocated that the United States tell China \"they have to put the wood to North Korea in a much more serious way than they have done so far.\" [191] In August, after Trump said North Korea would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of continued threats against the United States, Schumer released a statement advocating that the United States be \"firm and deliberate with North Korea, but reckless rhetoric is not a strategy to keep America safe.\" [192]\n\n\nRussia\nIn a June 3, 2008, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Schumer wrote that cooperative economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government In discussing the importance of Russia's cooperation, Schumer wrote, \"Mr Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before the fall of the Soviet Union.\" He added, \"The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground It mocks Mr Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe.\" [197] On June 10, the East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter about his article, writing, \"As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe', your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia is troubling, inexplicable and unacceptable.\" [198]\n\n\nGun laws\nIn 1994, then-Representative Schumer and Senator Dianne Feinstein authored the Assault Weapons Ban Supporters of gun control legislation give Schumer much of the credit for passage of both the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act [207] The Assault Weapons Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and

controversy\nOn June 26, 2008, Schumer took the extraordinary step of publicly releasing letters he had written to regulators about IndyMac Bank, the country's seventh-largest savings and loan association and ninth-largest originator of mortgage loans, which he considered a severely troubled institution Schumer wrote that he was \"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.\" Many IndyMac depositors either panicked or, from another perspective, justifiably acted and withdrew funds in the 11 days before IndyMac failed [241]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nSchumer voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 [253] He opposed the Federal Marriage Amendment, saying in 2004 that DOMA made it obsolete [254]\n\n\nStudent loan forgiveness\nSchumer supports the cancellation of $50,000 or more in federal student loan debt for every borrower by executive action [258]\n\n\nSubprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis\nIn September 2007, Schumer proposed that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) raise Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's conforming loan (\"affordable\") limits from $417,000 to $625,000, thereby allowing these government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to back mortgages on homes priced up to $780,000 with a 20% down payment [259]\n\n\nTaxes on high incomes\nSchumer had been a staunch defender of low taxes on hedge fund and private equity managers in the mid-2000s, arguing that this was necessary to protect the industry Then serving on both the Senate Banking and Finance Committees, Schumer was in a position to block attempts to tax their financial gains at the rate other taxpayers pay for income [263] But in 2010, he suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry [264]\n\n\nTechnology and the Internet\nIn June 2011, Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin sought a crackdown on Bitcoin, saying it facilitated illegal drug trade transactions \"The transactions leave no traditional  [bank transfer] money trail for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment,\" which used the anonymizing network Tor [266] One opinion website said the senators wanted \"to disrupt  [the] Silk Road drug website\" [267]\n\n\nFacebook\nSchumer has offered political support to Facebook, acting as an ally and seeking to advance the company's interests in Senate debates about regulating it or probing its involvement in various controversies, including Russian interference in the 2016 election [273] In July 2018, he confronted Senator Mark Warner, and urged him not to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues [273] As of 2018, one of Schumer's daughters

significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac.\" Many IndyMac depositors

Born in 1980 in Tehran, Iran, she and her parents left the country shortly after her birth and settled in London, where they applied for political refugee status.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nBoniadi was born in 1980 in Tehran, Iran, in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. Less than a month after her birth, she and her parents left Iran and applied to become political refugees in London. This decision was likely due to the tumultuous political climate in Iran at the time, which saw widespread human rights abuses and suppression of dissent.\n\nGrowing up in London, Boniadi developed a strong sense of identity as a refugee and a member of a diaspora community. She has spoken publicly about the challenges of navigating cultural and linguistic differences as a child, and the importance of finding her place in a new country.\n\nDespite these challenges, Boniadi showed a keen interest in science and technology from an early age. She pursued a career in science, studying physics and chemistry in school and later attending university to study biophysics.\n\n**Acting Career**\n\nBoniadi changed her career path from science and started pursuing acting in 2006. She began by taking classes and attending acting workshops, where she honed her skills and developed her craft.\n\nHer first major acting role was as Leyla Mir on the daytime drama General Hospital and its SOAPnet spin-off series General Hospital: Night Shift. This marked a significant milestone in Boniadi's career, as she became the first contract actor to play a Middle Eastern character in American daytime television history. She is also the first actress born in Iran to ever be on contract on an American soap opera.\n\nBoniadi's portrayal of Leyla Mir was widely praised for its nuance and authenticity, and she quickly became a fan favorite on the show. She went on to appear in numerous other TV shows and films, including a recurring role on the popular TV series Homeland.\n\n**Activism**\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Boniadi has been involved in human rights activism, with a focus on youth and women's rights. She has worked closely with Amnesty International USA (AIUSA), serving as a spokesperson from 2009 until 2015. During this time, she focused on the unjust conviction and treatment of Iranian youth, women, and prisoners of conscience.\n\nBoniadi has also written extensively on human rights issues, including the use of torture and arbitrary detention in Iran. She has spoken publicly about the importance of standing up for marginalized communities and advocating for justice and equality.\n\nIn 2020, Boniadi was appointed as an ambassador for Amnesty International UK, with a focus on women and Iran. In this role, she continues to amplify the voices of women and marginalized communities, and to advocate for human rights and social justice.\n\n**Recognition and Awards**\n\nBoniadi is fluent in English and Persian, and has a strong understanding of the complexities of the Middle East. Her nationality is British, and she has been recognized for her contributions to the arts and human rights.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBoniadi is fluent in English and Persian, and has a strong connection to her Iranian heritage. She has spoken publicly about the importance of preserving her cultural identity and honoring her family's traditions.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Boniadi was a dedicated Scientologist, and her mother had also been a member of the Church. However, she left the Church of Scientology soon after and has since spoken out about the negative experiences she had within the organization.\n\nIn October 2014, Boniadi called herself a \"non-practising Muslim,\" highlighting her spiritual journey and her exploration of different faith traditions. This decision was likely influenced by her experiences as a refugee and her connection to the Middle East.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nBoniadi has appeared in numerous films and TV shows throughout her career, including:\n\n* General Hospital (2007-2008)\n* General Hospital: Night Shift (2008)\n* Homeland (2012)\n* Red Dawn (2012)\n* 3 Days to Kill (2014)\n* 12 Rounds 3: Lockdown (2015)\n* No Tomorrow (2016-2017)\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references, as per the original request.\n\n**External Links**\n\nFor more information on Nazanin Boniadi, please visit her official website or follow her on social media.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nazanin_Boniadi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nNazanin Boniadi was born in 1980 in Tehran in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution Less than a month after her birth, she and her parents left Iran and applied to become political refugees in London [2] [3] [4]\n\n\nActing career\nBoniadi changed her career path from science and started pursuing acting in 2006 Her first major acting role was as Leyla Mir on the daytime drama General Hospital and its SOAPnet spin-off series General Hospital: Night Shift, making her the first contract actor to play a Middle Eastern character in American daytime television history [citation needed] She is also the first actress born in Iran to ever be on contract on an American soap opera [10]\n\n\nActivism\nBoniadi has been involved in human rights activism, with a focus on youth and women's rights She was a spokesperson for Amnesty International USA (AIUSA), with a focus on the unjust conviction and treatment of Iranian youth, women and prisoners of conscience, from 2009 until 2015 [27] [28] She has her own official blog page on the AIUSA website [29] and continues to partner with them In 2020, she was appointed as an ambassador for Amnesty International UK, with a focus on women and Iran [30]\n\n\nRecognition and awards\nBoniadi is fluent in English and Persian [65] Her nationality is British [61] [66]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBoniadi is fluent in English and Persian [65] Her nationality is British [61] [66]\n\n\nScientology\nIn the mid 2000s, she was a dedicated Scientologist Her mother had also been a Scientologist [67]\n\n\nAfterwards\nBoniadi left the Church of Scientology soon after [74] and in October 2014 called herself a \"non-practising Muslim\" [75]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

other archaeological evidence indicate continuous habitation for some 8,000 years [14] People living in these settlements used tools, fire, and clothing made of animal skins [14]\n\n\nPre-imperial era\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, there was frequent warfare between the Chechens, Tamerlane and Tokhtamysh, culminating in the Battle of the Terek River (see Tokhtamysh–Timur war) The Chechen tribes built fortresses, castles, and defensive walls, protecting the mountains from the invaders (see Vainakh tower architecture) Part of the lowland tribes were occupied by Mongols However, during the mid-14th century a strong Chechen Princedom called Simsim emerged under Khour II, a Chechen king that led the Chechen politics and wars He was in charge of an army of Chechens against the rogue warlord Mamai and defeated him in the Battle of Tatar-tup in 1362 The kingdom of Simsim was almost destroyed during the Timurid invasion of the Caucasus, when Khour II allied himself with the Golden Horde Khan Tokhtamysh in the Battle of the Terek River Timur sought to punish the highlanders for their allegiance to Tokhtamysh and as a consequence invaded Simsim in 1395 [16]\n\n\nImperial rule\nPeter the Great first sought to increase Russia's political influence in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea at the expense of Safavid Persia when he launched the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723 Russian forces succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Iran for several years [20]\n\n\nSoviet rule\nDuring Soviet rule, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined to form the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic In the 1930s, Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing a famine As a result, many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR permanently and survived the famine [29] Although over 50,000 Chechens and over 12,000 Ingush were fighting against Nazi Germany on the front line (including Heroes of the USSR: Abukhadzhi Idrisov, Khanpasha Nuradilov, Movlid Visaitov), and although Nazi German troops advanced as far as the Ossetian ASSR city of Ordzhonikidze and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR city of Malgobek after capturing half of the Caucasus in less than a month, Chechens and Ingush were falsely accused as Nazi supporters and entire nations were deported during Operation Lentil to the Kazakh SSR (later Kazakhstan) in 1944 near the end of World War II where over 60% of Chechen and Ingush populations perished [30] [31] American historian Norman Naimark writes:\n\n\nChechen Wars and brief independence\nThe First Chechen War, during which Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, took place from 1994 to 1996 Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in troops, weaponry, and air support, the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and insurgency raids The Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in 1995 shocked the Russian public.\n\n\nPost-war reconstruction and insurgency\nChechen separatists continued to fight Russian troops and conduct terror attacks [46] [page needed] In October 2002, 40–50 Chechen rebels seized a Moscow theater and took about 900 civilians hostage [30] The crisis ended with 117 hostages and up to 50 rebels dead, mostly due to an unknown aerosol pumped into the building by Russian special forces to incapacitate the people inside [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nGeography\nSituated in the eastern part of the North Caucasus in Eastern Europe, Chechnya is surrounded on nearly all sides by Russian Federal territory In the west, it borders North Ossetia and Ingushetia, in the north, Stavropol Krai, in the east, Dagestan, and to the south, Georgia Its capital is Grozny Chechnya is well known for being mountainous, but it is in fact split between the more flat areas north of the Terek, and the highlands south of the Terek.\n\n\nClimate\nDespite a relatively small territory, Chechnya is characterized by a variety of climate conditions The average temperature in Grozny is 11.2 °C (52.2 °F) [62]\n\n\nCities and towns with over 20,000 people\nThe Chechen Republic is divided

1,456,792 make up 96.4% of the republic's population Other groups include Russians (18,225, or 1.2%), Kumyks (12,184, or 0.8%) and a host of other small groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population The birth rate was 25.41 in 2004 (25.7 in Achkhoi Martan, 19.8 in Groznyy, 17.5 in Kurchaloi, 28.3 in Urus Martan and 11.1 in Vedeno).\n\n\nLife expectancy\nDespite its difficult past, Chechnya has a high life expectancy, one of the highest in Russia But the pattern of life expectancy is unusual, and in according to numerous statistics, Chechnya stands out from the overall picture In 2020, Chechnya had the deepest fall in life expectancy, but in 2021 it had the biggest rise Chechnya has the highest excess of life expectancy in rural areas over cities [65]

to 13th centuries (i.e before Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia), there was a mission of Georgian Orthodox missionaries to the Nakh peoples Their success was limited, though a couple of highland teips did convert (conversion was largely by teips) However, during the Mongol invasions, these Christianized teips gradually reverted to paganism, perhaps due to the loss of trans-Caucasian contacts as the Georgians fought the Mongols and briefly fell under their dominion.\n\n\nPolitics\nSince 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities Chechnya has enjoyed a period of relative stability under the Russian-appointed government, although there is still some separatist movement activity [77] Its regional constitution entered into effect on 2 April 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held on 23 March 2003 Some Chechens were controlled by regional teips, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.\n\n\nRegional government\nThe former separatist religious leader (mufti) Akhmad Kadyrov was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on 5 October 2003 Incidents of ballot stuffing and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors On 9 May 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a landmine explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and Sergey Abramov was appointed acting prime minister after the incident However, since 2005 Ramzan Kadyrov (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president Many [who?] allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia (the Kadyrovites) The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch.\n\n\nSeparatist government\nIchkeria was a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation between 1991 and 2010 [80] Former president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the Georgian Civil War, recognized the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993 [81] Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognised Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the Taliban government on 16 January 2000 This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001 [82] However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria—Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate [83] Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists, and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU [83] [84] [85]\n\n\nHuman rights\nТhe Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reports that after hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and separatist conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today [88]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nAlthough homosexuality is officially legal in Chechnya per Russian law, it is de facto illegal Chechen authorities have reportedly arrested, imprisoned and killed persons based on their perceived sexual orientation [102]\n\n\nEconomy\nDuring the First Chechen War, the Chechen economy fell apart [116] In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but the change did not occur due to the re-taking of Chechnya by Russian troops in the Second Chechen War [116]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Chechnya is based on the native traditions of Chechen people Chechen mythology along with art have helped shape the culture for over 1,000

the early days of the war, Russian troops captured several cities in southern Ukraine, including Melitopol and Kherson, [31] [user-generated source?] [32] pushing Ukrainian troops back to the city of Mykolaiv The Russian forces originally aimed towards capturing the major port city of Odesa from the southeast, but were forced back following their defeat at the battle of Voznesensk, and ultimately only succeeded in occupying a small part of Mykolaiv Oblast, notably including the town of Snihurivka [33] [34] In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Russian troops pushed north and successfully defeated Ukrainian servicemen at the Battle of Enerhodar, thus seizing the city and the adjacent Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in continental Europe [35] Russian forces also pushed east, reaching the Donetsk/Zaporizhzhia administrative borders, thereby creating a land bridge connecting Crimea with the Russian mainland [citation needed]\n\n\nRussian offensive\nDuring the 2022 southern Ukraine offensive, Russian troops invaded the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Mykolaiv Oblasts In the early days of the war, Russian troops captured several cities in southern Ukraine, including Melitopol and Kherson, [31] [user-generated source?] [32] pushing Ukrainian troops back to the city of Mykolaiv The Russian forces originally aimed towards capturing the major port city of Odesa from the

Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in continental Europe [35] Russian forces also pushed east, reaching the Donetsk/Zaporizhzhia administrative borders, thereby creating a land bridge connecting Crimea with the Russian mainland [citation needed]\n\n\nRussian occupation\nRussian forces began an occupation of Kherson Oblast on 2 March, [36] and the occupation authorities immediately began to consolidate their control over these territories The authorities reportedly erected a statue of Vladimir Lenin in the town square, introduced Russian curriculum to the local school system, [37] rerouted internet servers to Russia, [38] issued Russian passports, [39] and began circulating the Russian ruble [40] There were also widespread allegations of Russian authorities abducting hundreds of Ukrainian civilians across occupied territories [41] [42] By early July, Russia controlled 95% of Kherson Oblast, 70% of Zaporizhzhia Oblast and 10% of Mykolaiv Oblast [43]\n\n\nAnnexation\nIn late May, Russian government officials acknowledged plans to annex all three oblasts and were reportedly setting conditions on occupied territory within Zaporizhzhia [44] A referendum was reportedly planned by Russian occupation authorities in the region for late 2022 to annex Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, while the occupied parts of the Mykolaiv Oblast would be included in the Kherson MSA, [45] but officials soon moved the date forwards to autumn [46] [47] amid fears of being set back by the Ukrainian Army, according to U.K intelligence officials [48] [citation needed] These referendums were held from 23 to 27 September, [49] with Russia officially annexing Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts about a week later  on 5 October [50] Western governments denounced the referendums as illegitimate and refused to recognize its results, and their illegitimacy was later confirmed with the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4 [51]\n\n\nUkrainian counterattacks\nBy 11 March the Russian offensive had stalled on numerous fronts within Mykolaiv Oblast, prompting gradual retreat by the end of the month [52] By the end of March, eleven settlements in the northern portion of the Kherson Oblast had been recaptured by the Ukrainian military's 60th Brigade, including Novovorontsovka, Krasnivka  [uk], Kniazivka  [uk], and Kochubeivka  [uk] [53] In April, Ukrainian authorities said they had pushed the enemy southwards to the border with Kherson Oblast [54]\n\n\nPartisan warfare\nThere were numerous reports of partisan warfare within the occupied territories In the city of Melitopol, Ukrainian resistance leaders claimed to have killed 100 Russian soldiers by 5 June [60] In Kherson, Ukrainian sources claimed that resistance fighters bombed a café frequented by Russian troops, killing Russian collaborators and destroying Russian military infrastructure [61] [unreliable source?] Assassination attempts and bombings have also been carried out on collaborators [62] On 30 August, shootouts and explosions were recorded in the city, which Russian officials attributed to \"spies and saboteurs\" [63]\n\n\nPrelude\nUkrainian officials first hinted at a large-scale military offensive in mid-to-late June, saying that \"visible results\" should be expected from Ukrainian counteroffensives by August 2022 [64] A Ukrainian general stated on 15 June that if Ukraine were supplied sufficient weapons, it would be able to mount a massive counteroffensive by the summer [65]\n\n\nSpeculation of counteroffensive\nIn the morning of 9 July, Ukrainian government authorities began to urge residents of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts to evacuate from their homes due to an impending Ukrainian counteroffensive [71] Residents of occupied Kherson in particular were urged to create shelters to \"survive the Ukrainian counteroffensive\" [72] Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and Minister of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories, warned of intense fighting and shelling in the upcoming days, claiming that the \"ZSU is coming\" [73] [74]\n\n\nEarly engagements\nIn early July, the Ukrainian army engaged in minor skirmishes with Russian forces On 11 July, the Ukrainian army reported that it had recaptured the village of Ivanivka  [uk] in Kherson Oblast [81] Ukrainian troops struck Nova Kakhovka, a Russian command post in Kherson city, with HIMARS missiles, and claimed it killed 12 officers and a Russian major general [82] [83] By the afternoon, Ukrainian authorities claimed that Russian forces were transferring equipment to the left bank of the Dnieper, creating roadblocks within Kherson city in preparation for street battles [84] Ukrainian authorities urged civilians in Zaporizhzhia Oblast to evacuate, suggesting that a major counteroffensive was soon to come [85] On 13 July, the head of the Kherson regional military administration claimed that Ukraine launched counterattacks along the entire Mykolaiv–Kherson–Zaporizhzhia front line [86]\n\n\nPreparation phase and initial offensive announcements\nAccording to a 24 July statement by Kherson Region official Serhii Khlan, Ukrainian attacks damaging Antonivka Road Bridge [88] and another key bridge, and attacks on Russian ammunition stores and command posts, were preparatory actions for the offensive [79] A day earlier, Khlan stated that Ukrainian forces had retaken several villages in Kherson Oblast, but that the Ukrainian authorities requested civilians not to publish information on the progress of the campaign prior to official statements [89] On 26 July, Antonivka Road Bridge was hit again by a Ukrainian HIMARS missile strike The bridge remained structurally intact while the bridge's roadway surface was damaged [90]\n\n\nPreceding Russian offensive in the south\nOn 20 August, Russian forces launched a minor offensive in southern Ukraine, with Ukrainian sources admitting that Russian forces had advanced and made gains in the towns of Blahodatne and Vasylky  [uk] in Mykolaiv Oblast [96] [97] On August 22, Russian forces achieved some success east of the city of Mykolaiv and in northwestern Kherson Oblast, driving Ukrainian forces 36 km from the front line to the north and 28 km deep into the territory of Mykolaiv Oblast with two objectives, to force a westward direction towards the city Mykolaiv or in a northerly direction towards the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with the intention of capturing the city of Kryvyi Rih, which hosts a strong Ukrainian troop concentration, and from where a counter-offensive on Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Berdyansk and Crimea is planned On the same day, Russian forces took control of Blahodatne about 45 km east of the town of Mykolaiv and a 12 square kilometer zone of control [98]\n\n\nCounteroffensive\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy announced the start of a full-scale counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South [104] [105] [106] [1] [10]\n\n\nAugust\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy announced the start of a full-scale counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South [104] [105] [106] [1] [10]\n\n\nSeptember\nFrom 1 to 2 September, Russian milbloggers reported further Ukrainian advances, but also a series of successful Russian counter-attacks Many villages were reportedly contested [116] [117] On 2 September, a day of mourning was declared by Ukrainian authorities in Zakarpattia Oblast, after the heavy losses suffered by the native 128th Mountain Assault Brigade during the opening days of the offensive [118] [119] On 3 September, the British Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had made three main lines of attack in Kherson Oblast, and had a military advantage of tactical surprise as a result of Russian commanders' mistakes and Russian logistical problems Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian pontoon bridges There was gunfire near the centre of Kherson city [120] [121] On the same day, Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian troops had captured the village of Blahodativka  [uk] and withdrawn from a few positions near Sukhyi Stavok [122]\n\n\nOctober\nOn 2 October, just two days after Russia's annexation of Kherson along with the Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and a day after Ukrainian forces recaptured the strategic Lyman railway junction in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces started the counteroffensive along the line from Arkhanhelske to Osokorivka in the Kherson region south of the Kherson–Dnipropetrovsk border They moved south along the west bank of the Dnieper and retook Zolota Balka [141] as well as Mykhailivka [142] and advanced further south to the next target, Dudchany [143] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces liberated Myrolyubivka  [uk] (23 km northwest of Kherson City) and Arkhanhelske on the Inhulets River south of the Kherson–Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border [19] The installed Russian head of the Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, said that \"in that region there was a breakthrough\" and called the situation \"tense\" [144]\n\n\nNovember\nOn 9 November, Ukrainian forces were close to entering Snihurivka; [161] Russia announced the withdrawal of its troops from Kherson and the right bank of the Dnieper [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter the recapture of Kherson, Ukraine continued offensive military operations in the area On 12 November, a video allegedly showed Ukrainian special forces crossing the Dnieper–Bug estuary in speedboats and attacking Russian forces stationed on the Kinburn Peninsula [173] On the same day, the Russian occupation authorities announced that they were preparing to leave the town of Nova Kakhovka, located on the east bank of the Dnieper River [174] The following day, Russian media reported that 20 Ukrainian \"saboteurs\" from the country's armed forces and four vessels had been destroyed in an attempt to land in Pokrovske on the Kinburn Peninsula [175]\n\n\nAnalysis\nOn 10 September 2022, Taras Berezovets stated that the southern counteroffensive had been part of a \"disinformation campaign\" to distract Russia from the real counteroffensive being prepared in the Kharkiv oblast [186] The Institute for the Study of War analyzed that Russian forces began moving equipment from the eastern frontlines to those in the south in order to prepare for the impending counteroffensive [187] Thus, Russian frontlines in Kharkiv oblast were left relatively unprotected to Ukrainian advances [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n Media

Russian forces achieved some success east of the city of Mykolaiv and in northwestern Kherson Oblast, driving Ukrainian forces 36 km from the front line to the north and 28 km deep into the territory of Mykolaiv Oblast with two objectives, to force a westward direction towards the city Mykolaiv or in a northerly direction towards the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast with the intention of capturing the city of Kryvyi Rih, which hosts a strong Ukrainian troop concentration, and from where a counter-offensive on Kherson, Melitopol, Enerhodar, Berdyansk and Crimea is planned On the same day, Russian forces took control of Blahodatne about 45 km east of the town of Mykolaiv and a 12 square kilometer zone of control [98]\n\n\nCounteroffensive\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy announced the start of a full-scale

successful Russian counter-attacks Many villages were reportedly contested [116] [117] On 2 September, a day of mourning was declared by Ukrainian authorities in Zakarpattia Oblast, after the heavy losses suffered by the native 128th Mountain Assault Brigade during the opening days of the offensive [118] [119] On 3 September, the British Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had made three main lines of attack in Kherson Oblast, and had a military advantage of tactical surprise as a result of Russian commanders' mistakes and Russian logistical problems Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian pontoon bridges There was gunfire near the centre of Kherson city [120] [121] On the same day, Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian troops had captured the village of Blahodativka  [uk] and withdrawn from a few positions near Sukhyi Stavok [122]\n\n\nOctober\nOn 2 October, just two days after Russia's annexation of Kherson along with the Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and a day after Ukrainian forces recaptured the strategic Lyman railway junction in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces started the counteroffensive along the line from Arkhanhelske to Osokorivka in the Kherson region south of the Kherson–Dnipropetrovsk border They moved south along the west bank of the Dnieper and retook Zolota Balka [141] as well as Mykhailivka [142] and advanced further south to the next target, Dudchany [143] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukrainian forces liberated Myrolyubivka  [uk] (23 km northwest of Kherson City) and Arkhanhelske on the Inhulets River south of the Kherson–Dnipropetrovsk Oblast border [19] The installed Russian head of the Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, said that \"in that region there was a breakthrough\" and called the

preparing to leave the town of Nova Kakhovka, located on the east bank of the Dnieper River [174] The following day, Russian media reported that 20 Ukrainian \"saboteurs\" from the country's armed forces and four vessels had been destroyed in an attempt to land in Pokrovske on the Kinburn Peninsula [175]\n\n\nAnalysis\nOn 10 September 2022, Taras Berezovets stated that the southern counteroffensive had been part of a \"disinformation campaign\" to distract Russia from the real counteroffensive being prepared in the Kharkiv oblast [186] The Institute for the Study of War analyzed that Russian forces began moving equipment from the eastern frontlines to those in the south in order to prepare for the impending counteroffensive [187] Thus, Russian frontlines in Kharkiv oblast were left relatively unprotected to Ukrainian advances [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to 2022 Ukrainian Kherson counteroffensive at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to

Liverpool He was handed a place in Roy Evans' senior squad, with Steve Heighway stating that, \" [Owen] is ready for whatever you throw at him; nothing fazes Michael Owen He's ready If the manager wants a recommendation from me, Michael gets it.\" [24] Owen also declared his aim was \"a first-team place in the next year or so\" [20] Karl-Heinz Riedle, who prior to joining Liverpool in the summer of 1997 had never heard of Owen, declared, \"It's unbelievable when you see him play to realise that he's only 17,\" he said \"He's such a good player, so very quick and for his age he has excellent vision and awareness He's a great player already and in one or two years he will become a very great player.\" [20] Owen was rated as \"the best attacker of his age in the country\" in

helped Liverpool to a treble in 2000–01, as the team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup to end a six-year trophy drought [32] Owen was thus the recipient of the Ballon d'Or in recognition of his performances that season [33] He became the most recent English winner of the European Footballer of the Year award, and the first Englishman to win the award since Kevin Keegan in 1979 Owen scored

November and culminating in January saw the team bow out of the title race Chelsea pipped Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot on the final day of the season [42] [43] Owen was also controversially overlooked for the PFA Player of the Year award during the season [41] He had continued establishing personal records with Liverpool and had scored his 100th Premier League goal on 26 April against West Bromwich Albion [44] Success in the League Cup also meant that Liverpool had ended up with a trophy for a third consecutive season Owen had scored in the League Cup Final against Manchester United to clinch the trophy for Liverpool [20] However, Liverpool's failure to qualify for the Champions League led to speculation about Owen's long-term future [45] Transfer speculation had continued linking him to Real Madrid and Barcelona [46] [47] Owen was quoted as saying, \"I really have to be playing in the Champions League and that is something  [Liverpool] have to remedy.\" [48] Owen would later refute the quote, stating, \"Some of the words I never even said and the rest were taken completely out of context.\" [49] Houllier moved to re-shape the Liverpool squad in 2003 to reassure Owen [45] He stated, \"We want to win the title This is our vision at Liverpool – and we want to win it with Michael in our team Michael is a genuine world-class player He has had a great season and I think he will be even better next season.\" [45] Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce was quoted as saying, \"Stop Michael Owen scoring and you are 50 per cent towards getting a result

price As the 2006 World Cup was less than a year away, Owen wanted to get more playing time to secure his position as the first-choice striker in the England squad and joined Newcastle amid rumours that he had inserted an escape clause valued at £12 million [68] On 31 August 2005, Owen signed a four-year contract to play for Newcastle, despite initial press speculation that he would rather have

He's a great player already and in one or two years he will become a very great player.\"\n\n1996-2000: Breakthrough and Prolific Goal-Scoring\n\nOwen's breakthrough season in 1996-1997 saw him score 10 goals in 28 appearances for Liverpool. He became the first English player to score in the Champions League at the age of 17 and was also named the PFA Young Player of the Year. In 1997-1998, Owen continued his impressive form, scoring 18 goals in 29 appearances. He also played a key role in Liverpool's FA Cup victory over Arsenal, scoring the equalizing goal in the 1-1 draw and then scoring the winning goal in the 4-2 win in the replay.\n\n2000-2002: Ballon d'Or and Continental Treble\n\nOwen's performances in the 2000-2001 season earned him the Ballon d'Or, making him the most recent English winner of the European Footballer of the Year award. He was the first Englishman to win the award since Kevin Keegan in 1979. Owen scored 24 goals in 37 appearances for Liverpool in the 2000-2001 season, helping the club win the League Cup, FA Cup, and UEFA Cup, to end a six-year trophy drought. He also scored both of Liverpool's goals in their triumph over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final, as they came back from 1-0 down to win 2-1.\n\n2002-2004: Maintained Performances and Transfer Rumors\n\nOwen continued with strong performances in the 2002-2003 season, which saw Liverpool top the league table and remain unbeaten for several months. However, a run of disastrous results starting from November and culminating in January saw the team bow out of the title race. Chelsea pipped Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot on the final day of the season. Owen was also controversially overlooked for the PFA Player of the Year award during the season. He had continued establishing personal records with Liverpool and had scored his 100th Premier League goal on 26 April against West Bromwich Albion. Success in the League Cup also meant that Liverpool had ended up with a trophy for a third consecutive season. Owen had scored in the League Cup Final against Manchester United to clinch the trophy for Liverpool.\n\nReal Madrid\n\nOwen joined Real Madrid in 2004, during its Galácticos era, and played alongside the \"big four\" of preceding star signings, namely Luís Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, and David Beckham. He also became the second Liverpool player to join Real Madrid in five years after Steve McManaman, who played for the club from 1999 to 2003.\n\nNewcastle United\n\nOn 24 August 2005, Newcastle United announced that they had agreed to a club record fee of £16.8 million to obtain Owen, although they still had to negotiate with the player's advisers. Liverpool and local rivals Everton entered the fray, but were unwilling to match Madrid's asking price. Owen wanted to get more playing time to secure his position as the first-choice striker in the England squad and joined Newcastle amid rumors that he had inserted an escape clause valued at £12 million. On 31 August 2005, Owen signed a four-year contract to play for Newcastle, despite initial press speculation that he would rather have returned to Liverpool. Some 20,000 fans were present at Newcastle's home ground of St James' Park for Owen's official unveiling as a Newcastle player.\n\n2005-2007: Club Record Transfer and Injuries\n\nOwen's time at Newcastle was marked by injuries, which ruled him out for several months. He scored his first goal for the club on his second appearance, the second goal in a 3-0 away win at Blackburn Rovers on 18 September. Owen scored his first hat-trick for Newcastle in the 4-2 away win over West Ham United on 17 December.

He returned to the starting lineup in January 2008 and scored his first goal of the season in a 4-1 FA Cup win over Stoke City. Owen was awarded the captaincy by Kevin Keegan on 19 January 2008 and scored his first league goal of 2008 on 3 February. He scored a late goal coming off the substitutes bench to clinch victory for Newcastle over Everton on 2 April 2008.\n\nManchester United\n\nOn 3 July 2009, Owen signed a two-year deal with Manchester United, arch rivals of Liverpool.

He played once for the England under-21 team, scoring in a win over Greece at Carrow Road. Owen made his senior international debut for England in 1998 and went on to score 40 goals in 89 appearances for the national team. He was a key player for England at the 2002 World Cup and the 2006 World Cup, where he scored six goals in each tournament.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOwen met his wife, Louise Bonsall, at primary school in 1984.

unconstitutional and in violation of at least four articles of El Salvador's constitution [55] [56] Following Bukele's registration as a presidential pre-candidate, Eduardo Escobar, the executive director of the Citizen Action non-governmental organization, stated that \"everything is unconstitutional and they are only trying to give a face of legitimacy to everything with these gimmicks\" (\"todo es inconstitucional y solo están tratando de darle una cara de legitimidad a todo con estos artilugios\") [57] Manuel Flores, then a presidential pre-candidate of the FMLN, stated that \"the law is the law  [and] the law says that there is no re-election\" (\"la ley es la ley  [y] la ley dice que no hay reelección\"), adding that the constitution is \"clear\" (\"clara\") in prohibiting re-election [51] Citizen Resistance politician Rubén Zamora stated that the Legislative Assembly had to suspend Bukele's rights as a Salvadoran citizen in accordance with the constitution for registering as a pre-candidate for presidential re-election [58] Both Zamora and Claudia Ortiz, a deputy from Vamos, argued that immediate re-election is prohibited by articles 75, 88, 131, 152, 154, and 248 of the country's constitution [59]\n\n\nAllegations of fraud\nOn 18 January 2023, the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to increase the criminal penalty for electoral fraud to 15–20

Legislative Assembly passed a law making it illegal to impede the registration process for electoral candidates According to the updated penal code, impeding a candidate's registration process is legally considered electoral fraud and would result in 6–20 years imprisonment [78] Lawyers and electoral experts alleged that the updated law would be used against those who opposed Bukele's re-election campaign; Eduardo Escobar and Ruth Eleonora López, the chief of Cristosal's anti-corruption committee, claimed that it was intimidation and a threat [79]\n\n\nReduction of municipalities and legislative seats\nOn 30 December 2022, Bukele tweeted that he believed the country's 262 municipalities should be reduced to only 50, claiming that it was \"absurd that 21,000 km2 are divided into 262 municipalities\" (\"absurdo que 21,000 kms2 estén divididos en 262 alcaldías\") [f] [108] Various economists, lawyers, and politicians argued that the proposed reduction was an attempt to consolidate power through gerrymandering, [109] would grant Nuevas Ideas an electoral advantage, [110] and would lead to data manipulation to favor the government [111] Eugenio Chicas, a former magistrate of the TSE, denounced the idea, claiming that it was a part of Bukele's \"political vision\" (\"visión política\") to consolidate a military dictatorship [112]\n\n\nInitial proposals, support, and criticism\nOn 30 December 2022, Bukele tweeted that he believed the country's 262 municipalities should be reduced to only 50, claiming that it was \"absurd that 21,000 km2 are divided

Legislative Assembly\nDuring a speech celebrating his fourth year in office on 1 June 2023, Bukele formally proposed legislation to reduce the number of municipalities from 262 to 44 and the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly from 84 to 60 [125] Regarding the municipal reduction, he stated that the present municipalities would be transformed into districts, adding that municipal employees would keep their jobs and that communities would still be able to celebrate their local traditions and customs Bukele argued that the reduction would also reduce the budgetary burden on the municipalities, make a \"more equitable\" (\"más equitativa\") distribution of taxation possible, and make electing and auditing mayors easier [126] [127] Regarding the legislative reduction, he stated that the number of seats would return to the number that were present before the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992 He criticized opposition politicians, stating \"this Assembly once had 60 deputies, it did not occur to this Government, that those in the corner do not like this announcement because ARENA and the FMLN in that farce they signed added 24 more deputies and it was the only thing that they completed in those 'peace accords'\" (\"esta Asamblea tenía 60 diputados, no se nos ocurrió en este Gobierno, a esos de la esquina no les gusta este anuncio porque ARENA y el

events in Salvadoran political history, as many politicians and journalists described it as breaking the country's two-party system [10]\n\n\nPresidency of Nayib Bukele\nNayib Bukele, the former mayor

José Napoleón Duarte (1984–1989) to not be a member of one of the country's two largest political parties: the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) [8] [9] Bukele's election is considered to be one of the most impactful events in Salvadoran political history, as many politicians and journalists described it as breaking the country's two-party system [10]\n\n\nPresidential re-election controversy\nOn 3 September 2021, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the president of El Salvador is eligible to run for re-election consecutively, discarding a 2014 ruling that required presidents to wait ten years before running for re-election The 2021 court ruling made Bukele eligible to run for president in 2024 [36] Despite protests from ARENA and the FMLN, the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) accepted the Supreme Court's ruling [37] Chargé d'Affaires Jean Elizabeth Manes compared the path the Salvadoran government was taking to that of Venezuela under Hugo Chávez [38] On 1 March 2023, four of the five members of the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber confirmed that presidential re-election is allowed [39]\n\n\nCriticism and opposition to re-election\nBukele's announcement that he was running for re-election was criticized by constitutional lawyers, who said his re-election would be unconstitutional and in violation of at least four articles of El Salvador's constitution [55] [56] Following Bukele's registration as a presidential pre-candidate, Eduardo Escobar, the executive director of the Citizen Action non-governmental organization, stated that \"everything is unconstitutional and they are only trying to give a face of legitimacy to everything with these gimmicks\" (\"todo es inconstitucional y solo están tratando de darle una cara de legitimidad a todo con estos artilugios\") [57] Manuel Flores, then a presidential pre-candidate of the FMLN, stated that \"the law is the law  [and] the law says that there is no re-election\" (\"la ley es la ley  [y] la ley dice que no hay reelección\"), adding that the constitution is \"clear\" (\"clara\") in prohibiting re-election [51] Citizen Resistance politician Rubén Zamora stated that the Legislative Assembly had to suspend Bukele's rights as a Salvadoran citizen in accordance with the constitution for registering as a pre-candidate for presidential re-election [58] Both Zamora and Claudia Ortiz, a deputy from Vamos, argued that immediate re-election is prohibited by articles 75, 88, 131, 152, 154,

Legislative Assembly passed a law making it illegal to impede the registration process for electoral candidates According to the updated penal code, impeding a candidate's registration process is legally considered electoral fraud and would result in 6–20 years imprisonment [78] Lawyers and electoral experts alleged that the updated law would be used against those who opposed Bukele's re-election campaign; Eduardo Escobar and Ruth Eleonora López, the chief of Cristosal's anti-corruption committee, claimed that it was intimidation and a threat [79]\n\n\nReduction of municipalities

into 262 municipalities\" (\"absurdo que 21,000 kms2 estén divididos en 262 alcaldías\") [f] [108] Various economists, lawyers, and politicians argued that the proposed reduction was an attempt to consolidate power through gerrymandering, [109] would grant Nuevas Ideas an electoral advantage, [110] and would lead to data manipulation to favor the government [111] Eugenio Chicas, a former magistrate of the TSE, denounced the idea, claiming that it was a part of Bukele's \"political vision\" (\"visión política\") to consolidate a military dictatorship [112]\n\n\nInitial proposals, support, and criticism\nOn 30 December 2022, Bukele tweeted that he believed the country's 262 municipalities should be reduced to only 50, claiming that it was \"absurd that 21,000 km2 are divided

would keep their jobs and that communities would still be able to celebrate their local traditions and customs Bukele argued that the reduction would also reduce the budgetary burden on the municipalities, make a \"more equitable\" (\"más equitativa\") distribution of taxation possible, and make electing and auditing mayors easier [126] [127] Regarding the legislative reduction, he stated that the number of seats would return to the number that were present before the signing of the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992 He criticized opposition politicians, stating \"this Assembly once had 60 deputies, it did not occur to this Government, that those in the corner do not like this announcement because ARENA and the FMLN in that farce they signed added 24 more deputies and it was the only thing that they completed in those 'peace accords'\" (\"esta Asamblea tenía 60 diputados, no se nos ocurrió en este Gobierno, a esos de la esquina no les gusta este anuncio porque ARENA y el

vote total for San Salvador includes votes cast from the exterior The party with the most votes in a department is highlighted in its party color and the party with the second most votes and seats in a department is in gray.\n\n\nMunicipal results\nAll 44 municipalities have had their winners declared [383] Nuevas Ideas, GANA, the PDC, the PCN, Solidary Force, and ARENA all won at least one mayorship, while the FMLN, Vamos, Nuestro Tiempo, Democratic Change, and the Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity did not win any [384] Turnout for the municipal election was the lowest since the end of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992 [385] In total, the opposition won one mayorship, one trustee, 24 proprietary aldermen, and 23 substitute aldermen in 16 of the 44 municipal councils; this accounts for around 10 percent of all municipal council positions The remaining 90 percent of municipal council positions were won by Nuevas Ideas and its allies [386]\n\n\nPARLACEN results\nTurnout for the PARLACEN election was the lowest in 25 years and reached just 29.88% [387] La Prensa Gráfica attributed the low turnout and almost 10 percent of the vote being blank or invalid to PARLACEN's general unpopularity in El Salvador, with many invalid ballots containing messages questioning PARLACEN's functions or relevance [388]\n\n\nAftermath\nShortly after polling stations closed but before the TSE officially announced the results of the presidential and legislative elections, Bukele posted on X declaring that, \"according to our numbers\", he had won the presidential election with \"more than 85% of the votes\" and that Nuevas Ideas had won \"a minimum of\" 58 of the Legislative Assembly's 60 seats [389] He also claimed that his electoral victory was \"a record in the entire democratic history of the world\" [390] and that the 2024 election was \"the first time in history that El Salvador has democracy, and it's not me saying it, it's the people\" [391] A crowd of Bukele's supporters gathered at the Plaza Gerardo Barrios in San Salvador to celebrate his victory Bukele later addressed the crowd from the balcony of the National Palace and celebrated his victory in a speech, [392] [393] during which he criticized journalists who themselves had criticized the gang crackdown and his concentration of power [391] [394] Bukele also remarked that the election results was \"the first time in a country that just one party exists in a completely democratic system\", adding that \"the entire opposition together was pulverized\" [395]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nShortly after polling stations closed but before the TSE officially announced the results of the presidential and legislative elections, Bukele posted on X declaring that, \"according to our numbers\", he had

Cortizo, the president of Panama; [411] Miguel Díaz-Canel, the president of Cuba; Xi Jinping, the president of China; [413] Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia; [414] and Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, the secretary of foreign affairs of Mexico, congratulated Bukele on X after he declared himself as the election's winner [411] The Chilean and Chinese embassies in El Salvador also congratulated Bukele before the release of the official results, [95] [411] as did the United Nations [415] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina congratulated Bukele and reaffirmed commitment for both countries to work together [416]\n\n\nAllegations of irregularities\nShortly after polling stations closed at 5 p.m CST, Bukele accused the TSE and Indra Solutions of preventing expatriates from casting their vote by not allowing them to cast their vote after the said time He argued that people waiting in line before the polling stations closed still had to be allowed to vote and called upon Attorney General Rodolfo Delgado to launch an investigation Delgado responded by stating that the office of the attorney general \"will prosecute those who committed a crime\" (\"procesará a quien cometa delito\") [423] The TSE announced that it would re-open voting at three voting centers in the United States which had not allowed Salvadorans to vote after 5 p.m CST, however, the TSE later retraced its announcement following a petition made by ARENA [424] Bukele responded on X to the TSE's retraction by stating \"remember this, when the opposition asks you again for votes in the next elections\" (\"recuerden esto, cuando la oposición vuelva a pedirles el voto en las próximas elecciones\") [425]\n\n\nPresidential and legislative transition\nThe TSE

{"title": "Osama_bin_Laden", "content": "\nName\nOsama bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as \"Osama bin Laden\" The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S governmental agencies, have used either \"Usama bin Laden\" or the accepted transliteration \"Usama bin Ladin\".\n\n\nEarly life and education\nOsama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [9] [10] His father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, [11] [12] a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, [13] and his mother was Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem) [14] [15] Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents [16]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; [31] but they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, 2 days before the 9/11 attacks [32] His other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000) Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony [33] Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives [34] [35] Many of Bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and as of 2010 [update], Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements [36]\n\n\nPolitical views\nPolitical\n\n\nMilitant and political career\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan–Soviet War [84] He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" [85] From 1979 to 1992, the U.S (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) [86] British journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"He did not receive any direct funding or training from the U.S during the 1980s Nor did his followers The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.\" [87] Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI [88] According to Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, the person in charge of the ISI's Afghan operations at the time, it was a strict policy of Pakistan to prevent any American involvement in the distribution of funds or weapons or in the training of the mujahideen, and the CIA officials stayed in the embassy in Islamabad, never entering Afghanistan or meeting with the Afghan resistance leaders themselves [89] According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, Bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives Steve Coll states that although Bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" [90] Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed [91]\n\n\nAfghan–Soviet War\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan–Soviet War [84] He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" [85] From 1979 to 1992, the U.S (as part of CIA

and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives Steve Coll states that although Bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" [90] Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed [91]\n\n\nAllegation of involvement in 1988 Gilgit massacre\nIn May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre [95] Shia civilians were also subjected to rape [96] The massacre is alleged by B Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing, [97] to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq [98] He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced Osama bin Laden to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt [99]\n\n\nFormation and structuring of al-Qaeda\nBy 1988, [100] Bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, Bin Laden wanted a more military role One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force [101] Notes of a meeting of Bin Laden and others on 20 August 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one's superiors [102]\n\n\nMove to Sudan\nIn 1991, Bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States [105] [116] He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, [105] [116] in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed [117] Bin Laden's personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns [118] Meanwhile, in March–April 1992, Bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other mujahideen leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself [119]\n\n\nReturn to Afghanistan\nThe 9/11 Commission Report states:\n\n\n1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa\nIn August 1996, Bin Laden issued a fatwa titled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\", which was published by Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a London-based newspaper Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"The Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Mecca and Medina The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to U.S forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch [137] Despite the assurance of President George H W Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all U.S forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy) Bin Laden's view was that \"the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony\" [138]\n\n\nLate 1990s attacks\nIn Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters [145] Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of Bin Laden's terrorist network [146] The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service [147]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nA former U.S State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Bin Laden [162]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nOn 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden and three other people They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994 [67] [176] Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death [177] [178] He was first indicted by a grand jury of the U.S on 8 June 1998, on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the U.S and prosecutors further charged that Bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide [179]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nPresident George W Bush received an intelligence report on 6 August 2001, titled \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\" [189] On 11 September 2001 (the \"September 11 attacks\" or \"9/11\"), the U.S was attacked by al-Qaeda, who used four commercial airplanes as missiles against various targets Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon United Airlines Flight 93 did not reach its intended destination, as its passengers overtook the plane, which crashed in Pennsylvania The Twin Towers eventually collapsed At least 2,750 people died from the attacks [190] On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency intercepted communications that pointed to bin Laden's responsibility, [191] as did German intelligence agencies [192] At 11:30 p.m., Bush wrote in his diary: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today.. We think it's Osama bin Laden.\" [193] The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified [194] evidence linking al-Qaeda and Bin Laden to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable [195] The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case [196] Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the U.S military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.\n\nManhunt and activities after the September 11 attacks\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden [206] U.S officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death [207] [208] On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed [209] The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward [210]\n\n\nBush administration\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden [206] U.S officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death [207] [208] On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed [209] The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward [210]\n\n\nObama administration\nOn 7 October 2008, in the second debate of that year's U.S presidential election, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, \"We will kill Bin Laden We will crush al-Qaeda That has to be our biggest national security priority.\" [222] Upon being elected, Obama expressed his plans to renew U.S commitment to finding al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to his national security advisers in an effort to ratchet up the hunt for the terrorist [222] President Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on Bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, narrow focus on al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates [223] [224]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nOsama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, [244] [245] shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time on 1 May 2011) [b] [246] [247] by a U.S military special operations unit [248] [249] The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Barack Obama in April 2011 and carried out in a CIA operation by a team of U.S Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, [250] with support from CIA operatives on the ground [251] [252] [253]\n\n\nAllegations of Pakistan support and protection of Bin Laden\nBin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, [266] and had reportedly been his home for at least five years [267] [268] The compound was located less than 2 kilometres (1 mi) from Pakistan Military Academy and less than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Pakistan's capital [251] [269] While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew Bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S strike, [270] [271] Carlotta Gall, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad [272] In a 2015 London Review of Books article, investigative reporter Seymour M Hersh asserted—citing U.S sources—that Bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the U.S mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of Bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence of Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who was paid an estimated $25 million for the information [256] Both stories were denied by U.S and Pakistani officials.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBin Laden's supporters have referred to him by several nicknames, including the \"Emir\" (الأمير, al-Amīr, 'Prince'), the \"Sheik\" (الشيخ, aš-Šaykh), the \"Jihadist Sheik\" or \"Sheik al-Mujahid\" (شيخ المجاهد, Šaykh al-Mujāhid), \"Hajj\" (حج, Ḥajj), the \"Director\", [207] \"Lion\" and \"Lion Sheik\" [280] Despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used his portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns; owing to his widespread popularity that once pervaded the Arab World during the early 2000s [281] His popularity reached its apex through the course of the Iraq War; during which opinion polls conducted in various Muslim countries gave him 50% – 60% favourable ratings [282] [281] [283] [284] During a June 2020 Pakistani parliament session, Imran Khan denounced Bin Laden's killing, labelling it as \"an embarrassing moment\" in their country's history, and also praised Bin Laden as a Shaheed (martyr) He further criticized the co-operation policies of past Pakistani governments with the U.S during its \"War on Terror\", arguing that such policies brought humiliation to Pakistan [285] [286] [287] [288] Obama concluded the first volume of his presidential memoir with the killing of Bin Laden [289]\n\n\nLetter to the American People\nIn November 2023, amid the 2023 Hamas-Israel war, Bin Laden's \"Letter to the American People\", published in 2002, became the subject of public controversy after some TikTok users expressed sympathy with Bin Laden's statements in the letter regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, which later went viral after a compilation of these videos was posted on Twitter [293] [294] The letter was removed from The Guardian's website after more than 20 years of being present online in the news outlet's webpage and TikTok began taking down videos that shared the letter [295] [296] [297]\n\n\nSee also\nArchival Documents\n\n\nNotes\nArchival Documents\n\n\nReferences\nArchival Documents\n\n\nBibliography\nArchival Documents\n\n\nFurther reading\nArchival Documents\n\n\nExternal links\nArchival Documents\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Osama bin Laden**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOsama bin Laden was a Saudi Arabian terrorist and founder of the organization al-Qaeda. He is widely regarded as one of the most wanted terrorists in modern history, responsible for the September 11 attacks in 2001 and numerous other terrorist attacks around the world.\n\n**Name**\n\nOsama bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as \"Osama bin Laden.\" The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S governmental agencies, have used either \"Usama bin Laden\" or the accepted transliteration \"Usama bin Ladin.\"\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nOsama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. His father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family. His mother was Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem). Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nAt age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria. However, they were later separated, and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, two days before the 9/11 attacks. His other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s), Khairiah Sabar (married 1985), Siham Sabar (married 1987), and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000). Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives.\n\n**Political views**\n\nBin Laden's political views were shaped by his experiences in the Afghan-Soviet War and his opposition to Western influence in the Middle East. He believed that the United States was responsible for many of the problems in the region and that it was necessary to fight against its influence.\n\n**Militant and political career**\n\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan and joined Abdullah Azzam to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan-Soviet War. He later told a journalist, \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" From 1979 to 1992, the U.S (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency.\n\n**Afghan–Soviet War**\n\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan and joined Abdullah Azzam to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan-Soviet War.

Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns.\n\n**Return to Afghanistan**\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report states that Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan in 1996, where he established a new base of operations. He began to plan and prepare for a major terrorist attack against the United States.\n\n**1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa**\n\nIn August 1996, Bin Laden issued a fatwa titled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\", which was published by Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a London-based newspaper. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"The Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Mecca and Medina. The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to U.S forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch.\n\n**Late 1990s attacks**\n\nIn Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters. Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of Bin Laden's terrorist network.\n\n**Yugoslav Wars**\n\nA former U.S State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Bin Laden.\n\n**Criminal charges**\n\nOn 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994. Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death.\n\n**September 11 attacks**\n\nPresident George W Bush received an intelligence report on 6 August 2001, titled \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\" On 11 September 2001 (the \"September 11 attacks\" or \"9/11\"), the U.S was attacked by al-Qaeda, who used four commercial airplanes as missiles against various targets. Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon. United Airlines Flight 93 did not reach its intended destination, as its passengers overtook the plane, which crashed in Pennsylvania.\n\n**Manhunt and activities after the September 11 attacks**\n\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks. The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden. U.S officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death.\n\n**Death and aftermath**\n\nOsama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time on 1 May 2011) by a U.S military special operations unit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Barack Obama in April 2011 and carried out in a CIA operation by a team of U.S Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CIA operatives on the ground.\n\n**Allegations of Pakistan support and protection of Bin Laden**\n\nBin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, and had reportedly been his home for at least five years. The compound was located less than 2 kilometers (1 mile) from Pakistan Military Academy and less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Pakistan's capital. While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew Bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S strike, Carlotta Gall, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad.\n\n**Reception and legacy**\n\nBin Laden's supporters have referred to him by several nicknames, including the \"Emir\" (الأمير, al-Amīr, 'Prince'), the \"Sheik\" (الشيخ, aš-Šaykh), the \"Jihadist Sheik\" or \"Sheik al-Mujahid\" (شيخ المجاهد, Šaykh al-Mujāhid), \"Hajj\" (حج, Ḥajj), the \"Director\", the \"Lion\" and \"Lion Sheik\". Despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used his portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns; owing to his widespread popularity that once pervaded the Arab World during the early 2000s. His popularity reached its apex through the course of the Iraq War; during which opinion polls conducted in various Muslim countries gave him 50% – 60% favourable ratings.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Osama_bin_Laden\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nOsama bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as \"Osama bin Laden\" The FBI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as well as other U.S governmental agencies, have used either \"Usama bin Laden\" or the accepted transliteration \"Usama bin Ladin\".\n\n\nEarly life and education\nOsama bin Laden was born on 10 March 1957 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [9] [10] His father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, [11] [12] a billionaire construction magnate with close ties to the Saudi royal family, [13] and his mother was Mohammed bin Laden's tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then called Alia Ghanem) [14] [15] Despite it being generally accepted that Bin Laden was born in Riyadh, his birthplace was listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents [16]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt age 17 in 1974, Bin Laden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; [31] but they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on 9 September 2001, 2 days before the 9/11 attacks [32] His other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sabar (married 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amal al-Sadah (married 2000) Some sources also list a sixth wife, name unknown, whose marriage to Bin Laden was annulled soon after the ceremony [33] Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives [34] [35] Many of Bin Laden's children fled to Iran following the September 11 attacks and as of 2010 [update], Iranian authorities reportedly continue to control their movements [36]\n\n\nPolitical views\nPolitical\n\n\nMilitant and political career\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan–Soviet War [84] He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" [85] From 1979 to 1992, the U.S (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) [86] British journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"He did not receive any direct funding or training from the U.S during the 1980s Nor did his followers The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency, received large amounts of both Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant.\" [87] Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-star general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency Although the United States provided the money and weapons, the training of militant groups was entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI [88] According to Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, the person in charge of the ISI's Afghan operations at the time, it was a strict policy of Pakistan to prevent any American involvement in the distribution of funds or weapons or in the training of the mujahideen, and the CIA officials stayed in the embassy in Islamabad, never entering Afghanistan or meeting with the Afghan resistance leaders themselves [89] According to some CIA officers, beginning in early 1980, Bin Laden acted as a liaison between the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) and Afghan warlords; no evidence of contact between the CIA and Bin Laden exists in the CIA archives Steve Coll states that although Bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" [90] Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed [91]\n\n\nAfghan–Soviet War\nAfter leaving college in 1979, Bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money and machinery from his own construction company to help the Mujahideen resistance in the Afghan–Soviet War [84] He later told a journalist: \"I felt outraged that an injustice had been committed against the people of Afghanistan.\" [85] From 1979 to 1992, the U.S (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Arabia, and China provided between $6–12 billion worth of financial aid and weapons to tens of thousands of mujahideen through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) [86] British journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"He did not receive any direct funding or training from the U.S during the

salaried GIP agent, \"it seems clear that Bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence.\" [90] Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S Special Forces commando Ali Mohamed [91]\n\n\nAllegation of involvement in 1988 Gilgit massacre\nIn May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis by Shias, large numbers of Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan were killed in a massacre [95] Shia civilians were also subjected to rape [96] The massacre is alleged by B Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing, [97] to have been in response to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgit during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq [98] He alleged that the Pakistan Army induced Osama bin Laden to lead an armed group of Sunni tribals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and its surrounding areas to suppress the revolt [99]\n\n\nFormation and structuring of al-Qaeda\nBy 1988, [100] Bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat While Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, Bin Laden wanted a more military role One of the main points leading to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force [101] Notes of a meeting of Bin Laden and others on 20 August 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make his religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one's superiors [102]\n\n\nMove to Sudan\nIn 1991, Bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States [105] [116] He and his followers moved first to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, [105] [116] in a deal brokered by Ali Mohamed [117] Bin Laden's personal security detail consisted of bodyguards personally selected by him Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-47s, RPGs, and PK machine guns [118] Meanwhile, in March–April 1992, Bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war in Afghanistan, by urging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other mujahideen leaders negotiating a coalition government instead of trying to conquer Kabul for himself [119]\n\n\nReturn to Afghanistan\nThe 9/11 Commission Report states:\n\n\n1996 Declaration of war and 1998 fatwa\nIn August 1996, Bin Laden issued a fatwa titled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\", which was published by Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a London-based newspaper Saudi Arabia is sometimes called \"The Land of the Two Holy Mosques\" in reference to Mecca and Medina The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to U.S forces based in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch [137] Despite the assurance of President George H W Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all U.S forces based in Saudi Arabia would be withdrawn once the Iraqi threat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans were still there Bush cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosen not to destroy) Bin Laden's view was that \"the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American colony\" [138]\n\n\nLate 1990s attacks\nIn Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from the days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps for Mujahideen fighters [145] Bin Laden effectively took over Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to members of Bin Laden's terrorist network [146] The arms smuggler Viktor Bout helped to run the airline, maintaining planes and loading cargo Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was being used as a terrorist taxi service [147]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nA former U.S State Department official in October 2001 described Bosnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists, some with ties to Bin Laden [162]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nOn 16 March 1998, Libya issued the first official Interpol arrest warrant against Bin Laden and three other people They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of Germany's domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, and his wife Vera in Libya on 10 March 1994 [67] [176] Bin Laden was still wanted by the Libyan government at the time of his death [177] [178] He was first indicted by a grand jury of the U.S on 8 June 1998, on a charges of conspiracy to attack defense utilities of the U.S and prosecutors further charged that Bin Laden was the head of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer of Islamic fighters worldwide [179]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nPresident George W Bush received an intelligence report on 6 August 2001, titled \"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\" [189] On 11 September 2001 (the \"September 11 attacks\" or \"9/11\"), the U.S was attacked by al-Qaeda, who used four commercial airplanes as missiles against various targets Two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City American Airlines Flight 77 was crashed into the Pentagon United Airlines Flight 93 did not reach its intended destination, as its passengers overtook the plane, which crashed in Pennsylvania The Twin Towers eventually collapsed At least 2,750 people died from the attacks [190] On the day of the attacks, the National Security Agency intercepted communications that pointed to bin Laden's responsibility, [191] as did German intelligence agencies [192] At 11:30 p.m., Bush wrote in his diary: \"The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today.. We think it's Osama bin Laden.\" [193] The Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that classified [194] evidence linking al-Qaeda and Bin Laden to the September 11 attacks is clear and irrefutable [195] The UK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding al-Qaeda and Bin Laden's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that the evidence presented is not necessarily sufficient to prosecute the case [196] Identified motivations of the September 11 attacks include the support of Israel by the United States, presence of the U.S military in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the U.S enforcement of sanctions against Iraq.\n\nManhunt and activities after the September 11 attacks\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden [206] U.S officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death [207] [208] On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed [209] The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward [210]\n\n\nBush administration\nIn response to the attacks, the United States launched the war on terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation to preclude future attacks The CIA's Special Activities Division was given the lead in tracking down and killing or capturing Bin Laden [206] U.S officials named Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization as the prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or death [207] [208] On 13 July 2007, the Senate voted to double the reward to $50 million, although the amount was never changed [209] The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association offered an additional $2 million reward [210]\n\n\nObama administration\nOn 7 October 2008, in the second debate of that year's U.S presidential election, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, \"We will kill Bin Laden We will crush al-Qaeda That has to be our biggest national security priority.\" [222] Upon being elected, Obama expressed his plans to renew U.S commitment to finding al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to his national security advisers in an effort to ratchet up the hunt for the terrorist [222] President Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on Bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a covert, narrow focus on al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates [223] [224]\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nOsama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011, [244] [245] shortly after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM Eastern Time on 1 May 2011) [b] [246] [247] by a U.S military special operations unit [248] [249] The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Barack Obama in April 2011 and carried out in a CIA operation by a team of U.S Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or informally by its former name, SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command, [250] with support from CIA operatives on the ground [251] [252] [253]\n\n\nAllegations of Pakistan support and protection of Bin Laden\nBin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were probably built for him, [266] and had reportedly been his home for at least five years [267] [268] The compound was located less than 2 kilometres (1 mi) from Pakistan Military Academy and less than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Pakistan's capital [251] [269] While the United States and Pakistan governments both claimed, and later maintained, that no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew Bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the U.S strike, [270] [271] Carlotta Gall, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knew of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad [272] In a 2015 London Review of Books article, investigative reporter Seymour M Hersh asserted—citing U.S sources—that Bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that Pasha knew of the U.S mission in advance, and authorized the helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; and that the CIA learned of Bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani intelligence of Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who was paid an estimated $25 million for the information [256] Both stories were denied by U.S and Pakistani officials.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBin Laden's supporters have referred to him by several nicknames, including the \"Emir\" (الأمير, al-Amīr, 'Prince'), the \"Sheik\" (الشيخ, aš-Šaykh), the \"Jihadist Sheik\" or \"Sheik al-Mujahid\" (شيخ المجاهد, Šaykh al-Mujāhid), \"Hajj\" (حج, Ḥajj), the \"Director\", [207] \"Lion\" and \"Lion Sheik\" [280] Despite condemnations from U.S-allied governments in the Arab world, anti-American protestors from Pakistan to Palestinian territories used his portraits during their protests, speeches and public campaigns;

Born and raised in southern Georgia, Owens has spent most of her life in or near wilderness areas, developing a deep appreciation for the natural world.\n\n**Biography**\n\nOwens grew up in Thomasville, Georgia, a small town in the southern part of the state. She was raised in a family that valued the outdoors and encouraged her to explore and appreciate nature. Owens' parents were both nature lovers, and their home was surrounded by woods and wildlife, which sparked her interest in the natural world from a young age.\n\nOwens attended the University of Georgia, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in zoology. Her undergraduate studies laid the foundation for her future career in science, and she went on to earn a PhD in animal behavior from the University of California, Davis. During her graduate studies, Owens became increasingly interested in the behavior and ecology of predators and prey, which would later become a central theme in her writing.\n\nDespite her academic success, Owens initially considered a career in science rather than writing. However, she soon realized that her true passion lay in storytelling and sharing her knowledge of the natural world with a wider audience. Owens' writing career began with scientific articles and essays, but she soon turned to fiction, drawing on her experiences in the wilderness to create engaging and informative stories.\n\n**Zambian Murder Case**\n\nIn 1996, Owens and her husband, Mark, were living in Zambia, where they were conducting research on predators and prey in the African savannah. On March 30, 1996, a documentary titled \"Deadly Game: The Mark and Delia Owens Story\" aired on the ABC news-magazine show Turning Point. The documentary included footage of a filmed murder, which was presented as the killing of an alleged poacher by a Zambian game scout.\n\nHowever, the documentary's depiction of the event has been disputed. In 2010, journalist Jeffrey Goldberg interviewed Chris Everson, the ABC cameraman who filmed the killing, and reported that it was actually Mark Owens who fired the fatal shots. Goldberg also spoke to Biemba Musole, a Zambian police detective who investigated the incident, and Graphael Musamba, the former national police commissioner. Both men stated that the investigation was hindered by the absence of a body, as the \"bush is the perfect place to commit murder ... The animals eat the evidence.\"\n\nThe incident has been the subject of much controversy and debate, with some accusing Owens and her husband of involvement in the murder. However, there is currently no concrete evidence to support these claims, and Owens has consistently maintained her innocence.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nOwens has received numerous awards and honors for her work in conservation and education. She has been recognized for her contributions to the field of wildlife biology and has been awarded several grants and fellowships to support her research.\n\nIn addition to her scientific accomplishments, Owens has also achieved significant success as a writer.

Mukhtar Ansari's maternal grandfather, Mohammad Usman, was a brigadier in the Indian Army and remained a bachelor all his life.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nIn the early 1970s, the government commissioned several development projects in the Poorvanchal area, which resulted in the rise of organized gangs competing for contracts. Mukhtar Ansari was allegedly a member of the Makhanu Singh gang, which clashed with another gang led by Sahib Singh over a plot of land in Saidpur in the 1980s. The conflict resulted in a series of violent incidents. Brijesh Singh, an alleged member of Sahib Singh's gang, later formed his own gang and took over Ghazipur's contract work mafia in the 1990s. Mukhtar Ansari's gang competed with him for control of the ₹ 100 crore contract business, which spanned areas such as coal mining, railway construction, scrap disposal, public works, and the liquor business. The gangs were also allegedly involved in running protection and extortion rackets, besides other criminal activities such as kidnapping.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nMukhtar Ansari entered politics around 1995 through a student union at Government PG College, Ghazipur, and became an MLA in 1996. He started challenging Brijesh Singh's dominance in the region. In 2002, Singh allegedly ambushed Ansari's convoy, resulting in the deaths of three of Ansari's men. Brijesh Singh was critically injured and presumed dead. To counter Ansari's influence, Singh supported the election campaign of the BJP leader Krishnanand Rai, who defeated Mukhtar Ansari's brother and five-time MLA Afzal Ansari from Mohammadabad in the 2002 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Mukhtar Ansari later claimed that Rai used his office to award contracts to Brijesh Singh's gang and that they planned to eliminate him.\n\n**Bahujan Samaj Party**\n\nMukhtar Ansari and his brother Afzal joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in 2007. The party allowed them in after they claimed to have been framed in criminal cases for fighting against the \"feudal system\" and promised to refrain from participating in any crimes. BSP chief Mayawati portrayed Mukhtar Ansari as Robin Hood and called him \"a messiah of the poor.\" Mukhtar Ansari fought the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi on the BSP ticket while still lodged in jail. He lost to BJP's Murli Manohar Joshi by a margin of 17,211 votes.\n\n**Quami Ekta Dal**\n\nAfter being expelled from the BSP and being rejected by other parties, the three Ansari brothers (Mukhtar, Afzal, and Sibkatillah) formed their own party, Quami Ekta Dal (QED), in 2010. Earlier, Mukhtar had launched an outfit called the Hindu Muslim Ekta Party, which was merged with QED. In 2012, he was charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act for being a member of an organised crime syndicate.\n\n**Back in the BSP**\n\nOn January 26, 2016, Mukhtar Ansari rejoined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) before the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Legislative elections. There was widespread speculation about the Ansari brothers joining the Samajwadi party a couple of months before. BSP chief Mayawati defended his entry into the party, stating that the criminal charges against Ansari had not been proven, and that the party gives people a chance to reform themselves.\n\n**Positions Held**\n\nMukhtar Ansari was elected five times as MLA from the Mau constituency.\n\n**Criminal Cases**\n\nIn 2005, MLA Krishnanand Rai's cavalcade was ambushed while he was returning home. Rai and six of his aides were killed by AK-47 bullet fires. Mukhtar Ansari was acquitted of the murder in 2019.\n\n**Death**\n\nMukhtar Ansari died of a heart attack on March 28, at the age of 60. An autopsy carried out by a panel of doctors from AIIMS Delhi confirmed that Ansari died of a heart attack. His son, Umar Ansari, claimed that his father was given a slow poison that led to the heart attack. Ten days prior to his death, on March 19, 2024, Mukhtar Ansari reported to the Barabanki Court that he was experiencing continuous pain in his nerves and limbs, attributing this discomfort to some poisonous substance that he believed had been introduced into his food. The Uttar Pradesh government ordered a three-member magisterial investigation into the allegations.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nKrishnanand Rai's son, Piyush Rai, termed Mukhtar Ansari a \"tyrant\" and said, \"God has considered his fate in the month of Ramzan.\" Akhilesh Yadav, the leader of the Samajwadi Party, urged that a judge of the Supreme Court look into Mukhtar Ansari's death.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mukhtar_Ansari\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground and family\nAnsari's paternal grandfather was Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, a surgeon, and an early president of the Indian National Congress in 1927 and of Muslim League in 1918 and 1920 [7] [8] His father was Subhan Ullah Ansari, who was a leader of the Communist party [9] Mukhtar Ansari's maternal grandfather was Mohammad Usman, who was a brigadier in the Indian Army;

{"title": "Tibesti_Mountains", "content": "\nToponymy\nThe Tibesti Mountains are named for the Toubou people, also written Tibu or Tubu, that inhabit the area In the Kanuri language, tu means \"rocks\" or \"mountain\" and bu means \"a person\" or \"dweller,\" and thus Toubou roughly translates to \"people of the mountains\" [a] and Tibesti to the \"place where the mountain people live\" [2] [3]\n\n\nGeography\nThe mountains lie on the border between Chad and Libya, straddling the Chadian region of Tibesti and the Libyan districts of Murzuq and Kufra, around 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) north of N'djamena and 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) south-southeast of Tripoli [11] The range is adjacent to Niger and located approximately halfway between the Gulf of Sidra and Lake Chad, just south of the Tropic of Cancer [11] [12] [13] The East African Rift is 1,900 km (1,200 mi) to the east and the Cameroon line lies 1,800 km (1,100 mi) to the southwest [4]\n\n\nLocation\nThe mountains lie on the border between Chad and Libya, straddling the Chadian region of Tibesti and the Libyan districts of Murzuq and Kufra, around 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) north of N'djamena and 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) south-southeast of Tripoli [11] The range is adjacent to Niger and located approximately halfway between the Gulf of Sidra and Lake Chad, just south of the Tropic of Cancer [11] [12] [13] The East African Rift is 1,900 km (1,200 mi) to the east and the Cameroon line lies 1,800 km (1,100 mi) to the southwest [4]\n\n\nTopography\nThe highest peak in the Tibesti Mountains, as well as the highest point in Chad and the Sahara Desert, is the 3,415-meter (11,204 ft) Emi Koussi, located at the southern end of the range [18] Other prominent peaks include Pic Toussidé [c] at 3,296 m (10,814 ft) and the 3,012-meter (9,882 ft) Timi on its western side, the 2,972-meter (9,751 ft) Tarso Yega, the 2,925-meter (9,596 ft) Tarso Tieroko, the 2,849-meter (9,347 ft) Ehi Mousgou, the 2,845-meter (9,334 ft) Tarso Voon, the 2,820-meter (9,250 ft) Ehi Sunni, and the 2,774-meter (9,101 ft) Ehi Yéy near the center of the range [20] The 3,376-meter (11,076 ft) Mouskorbé is a peak notable for its height in the northeastern part of the mountain range [11] [21] The 2,266-meter (7,434 ft) Bikku Bitti, the highest point in Libya, is nearby, on the other side of the border [11] [22] The average elevation of the Tibesti Mountains is about 2,000 m (6,600 ft); sixty percent of its area exceeds 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in elevation [18]\n\n\nHydrology\nFive rivers in the northern half of the Tibesti Mountains flow to Libya, while the southern half belongs to the endorheic basin of Lake Chad However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may flow great distances through subterranean aquifers [33]\n\n\nGeology\nThe Tibesti Mountains are a large area of tectonic uplift that, according to contemporary theory, resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African Plate lithosphere, which is about 130 to 140 km (81 to 87 mi) thick [44] [45] This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone [46] [47] A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated [48]\n\n\nGeomorphology\nVolcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi Emi Koussi increased in height The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance [56]\n\n\nClimate\nThe Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year [35] [65] [66] In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry [39] In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems [9] [65] For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of 12 mm (0.47 in) of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw 60 mm (2.4 in) of rainfall [9] In general, the range receives less than 20 mm (0.79 in) of rainfall per year [34] However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example Trou au Natron 2,250 m (7,380 ft) receives 126 mm (5.0 in) annually When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow [9] [67] This occurs, on average, once every seven years [68]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nMuch like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert [66] [72] As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the 82,000-square-kilometer (31,700 sq mi) Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara 650 km (400 mi) to the east [11] [66] Most of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its flora and fauna, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and vegetation has suffered from overgrazing in the past [66]\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel and Afromontane vegetation [66] [73] Biodiversity and endemism levels are higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall [74] [75] Oases lie along the courses of the enneris, such as Enneri Yebige, which is virtually unexplored [update] [34] These oases, which are more numerous to the north and west of the range, are scattered with acacia, figs, palms and tamarisks [76] Most gueltas are lined with macrophytes—including smooth flatsedge (Cyperus laevigatus) and branched horsetail (Equisetum ramosissimum) [76]—and bryophytes—including Oxyrrhynchium speciosum and species of Bryum [77] Egyptian acacia (Vachellia nilotica syn Acacia nilotica) grows near these water basins [76] Saharan myrtle (Myrtus nivellei) and oleander (Nerium oleander) grow between elevations of 1,500 and 2,300 m (4,900 and 7,500 ft) in the western part of the range, while Nile tamarisk (Tamarix nilotica) grows at similar elevations in its northern part [75] Downstream, where the current of the enneris is slower and the riverbed is deeper, there are dense thickets of Athel tamarisk (Tamarix aphylla syn Tamarix articulata) and arak (Salvadora persica) [78]\n\n\nFauna\nMammals abound in the Tibesti [66] Bovids include the endangered addax (Addax nasomaculatus) along with the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros) and a significant population of Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) [66] [81] [82] Rodents are the most represented order of mammals, and include the spiny mouse (Acomys spp.), bushy-tailed jird (Sekeetamys calurus) and the North African gerbil (Dipodillus campestris syn Gerbillus campestris) [66] Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis lybica) and, more rarely, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), as well as several canine species, including the golden jackal (Canis aureus), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii) [66] [83] The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range [66] African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) formerly roamed the range, although these populations are now extirpated [84] Olive baboons (Papio anubis), found as recently as 1960, are now likely extirpated as well [85] Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the Egyptian mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma cystops), Egyptian slit-faced bat (Nycteris thebaica) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens) [86] The Cape hare (Lepus capensis) and the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) also populate the area [66]\n\n\nPopulation\nThe town of Bardaï, located on the northern flank of the mountains at an elevation of 1,020 m (3,350 ft), is the capital of the Tibesti region [9] [91] It is connected to the town of Zouar, to the southwest, by a track that crosses Tarso Toussidé [92] [93] The village of Omchi is accessible from Bardaï via Aderké, or from the town of Aouzou via Irbi These rough tracks extend southward towards Yebbi Souma and Yebbi Bou, and then follow the course of Enneri Misky The eastern half of the Tibesti is cut off from the western half, and the eastern village of Aozi is accessible from Libya via Ouri [92] Zouar has an airport, as does Bardaï at Zougra [94] Bardaï also has a hospital, although the medical supply is very much dependent upon the prevailing political situation [10]\n\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the Stone Age, when denser paleovegetation facilitated human habitation [60] The Toubou were settled in the region by the 5th century BC and eventually established trade relations with the Carthaginian civilization [110] [111] Around this time, Herodotus mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled \"Aethiopians\", and described them as having a language akin to the \"cry of bats\" [f] [110] [113]\n\n\nHuman settlement\nThere is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the Stone Age, when denser paleovegetation facilitated human habitation [60] The Toubou were settled in the region by the 5th century BC and eventually established trade relations with the Carthaginian civilization [110] [111] Around this time, Herodotus mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled \"Aethiopians\", and described them as having a language akin to the \"cry of bats\" [f] [110] [113]\n\n\nRegional relations and colonization\nIn the mid-19th century the Ottoman Empire began a campaign of territorial conquest across northern Africa from its regional headquarters in Libya, yet was unable to subdue the Tibesti [125] In 1890, to the chagrin of the Turks, France and Great Britain signed a declaration recognizing a French zone of influence in northern Africa from the Mediterranean Sea down to Lake Chad [126] In response, the Toubou allied with the Senussi Arabs of Libya and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the French Colonial Army [127] As the Sennussis' influence moved southward, so did their headquarters, which in 1899 was moved to the town of Gouro on the southeast flank of the range [92] [128] [129] The Senussi founded a Zawiya in Bardaï, which quickly promoted the total Islamization of the Tibesti [14] [130] At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derdé, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911 These garrisons fell apart a few months later when the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops [131]\n\n\nModern history\nChad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by François Tombalbaye imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti [121] [136] Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi [137] Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government [121] These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979 [121] [138]\n\n\nChadian Civil War\nChad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by François Tombalbaye imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti [121] [136] Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi [137] Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government [121] These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979 [121] [138]\n\n\nTibesti War\nIn 1978, war broke out between Chad and Libya ostensibly over the Aouzou Strip, a 114,000-square-kilometer (44,000 sq mi) borderland between Chad and Libya that extends into the Tibesti Mountains and is rumored to contain uranium deposits [113] [150] [151] [152] In 1980, Libya used the strip as a base from which stage an attack, led by Goukouni, on the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, located in southern Chad and controlled by Habré [153] N'Djamena was toppled in December; however, under considerable international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habré's Armed Forces of the North (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces [153] [154] [155] Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces [156]\n\n\nMDJT War\nFollowing a decade of relative peace, in late 1997 the Tibesti saw the formation of the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a rebel group opposed to Chadian president Idriss Déby [165] Numbering around 1,000 fighters at its peak between 2000 and 2001, and financed by Libyan Teda clans and the Libyan government, the MDJT was able to take control of several towns in the Tibesti [166] Battles with the Chadian National Army (ANT) were particularly violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Bardaï [167] Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population [168]\n\n\nGold rush\nGold was discovered in the Tibesti Mountains in 2012, attracting prospectors from across the Sahel [173] The arrival of migrants has led to violent conflicts with the Teda locals, a problem exacerbated by an influx of weaponry to the region due to the ongoing [update] wars in Darfur and Libya [174] Violence has also arisen as a result of disputes between the miners themselves; for example, around 100 people were killed in May 2022 over a \"banal dispute\" between miners [175] The increased migration has also increased drug traffic, with the Tibesti lying along the trans-Saharan smuggling route for South American cocaine destined for Europe [176] [177] Nevertheless, the gold discovery has benefited the impoverished region economically Many Tibesti residents have been able to purchase goods such as cars, televisions and satellite telephones that they could not otherwise afford \"If by the grace of God, gold had not appeared we would not even have anything to eat\", remarked one Tibesti prospector [178]\n\n\nScientific exploration and research\nDue to its isolation and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists [16] The German Gustav Nachtigal was the first European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869 [179] While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his expedition was fiercely opposed by the Toubou, and his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years [180] [181] Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and petrology of the range [16] The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Marguerite, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935 Le Cœur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research [h] [180] [182] French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957 [180] In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research was slowed due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974 [183] [184]\n\n\nClimbing history\nAlthough not an alpine climb, Gustav Nachtigal ascended to 2,400 m (7,873 ft) elevation as he traversed a pass abutting Pic Toussidé during his exploration of the Tibesti in 1869 [187] The Englishman Wilfred Thesiger summited the highest mountain in the range, the 3,415-meter (11,204 ft) Emi Koussi, in 1938 [1] [188] In 1948, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research mounted an expedition under Edouard Wyss-Dunant, which scaled both the peak and needle of Botoum, at 2,400 m (7,900 ft) and 2,000 m (6,600 ft), respectively [189]\n\n\nEconomy\nAlthough gold was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012 [196] [197] Diamonds have also been found The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of uranium, tin, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lead, zinc and copper [197] Amazonite is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes [198] [199] [200] Salt is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou [99]\n\n\nNatural resources\nAlthough gold was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012 [196] [197] Diamonds have also been found The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of uranium, tin, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lead, zinc and copper [197] Amazonite is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes [198] [199] [200] Salt is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou [99]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThere are accessible oases to the west and north of the range Where mosquitoes do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar where, by the 1950s, indigenous plant species had been largely replaced by some 56,000 date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) [202] [203] The dates are harvested between late July and early August [109] In winter, when reserves are depleted, it is not uncommon for the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed Some native palm species remain, such as the doum palm (Hyphaene thebaica), from which the hard yet vaguely-sweet fruit rinds are collected, ground and consumed, despite their low nutritional value [202] The banks of the enneris grow desert gourd (Citrullus colocynthis), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour [204] Women are customarily responsible for gathering wild grains on the tarsos in August [109]\n\n\nTourism\nAs the Sahara's highest mountain range, with geothermal features, a distinctive culture, and numerous rock and parietal artworks, the Tibesti has tourism potential [206] [207] [208] However, tourist accommodations are limited at best [209] In the early 2010s, the French adventure travel company Point-Afrique financed the repair of the airport at Faya-Largeau, some 200 kilometers (120 mi) southeast of the Tibesti, and established direct charter flights between Faya and Marseille Although the flights mainly brought tourists destined for the Ounianga Lakes UNESCO World Heritage Site, there was considerable hope that they would also open the gates for tourism in the Tibesti [207] [210] For example, the Chadian government invested in a tourist camp along with walled pavilions in Bardaï [207] [209] Yet, following the Libyan Crisis and France's intervention in Mali, the French government pressured tour operators to prevent French tourists from venturing into the Sahara, and the flights ended [207]\n\n\nConservation\nThe resources available for conservation in the Tibesti are limited [66] In 2006, various non-governmental working groups proposed a protected area to preserve the area's rhim gazelle and Barbary sheep populations [81] [82] The protected area would be modeled after the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve to the south However, due to economic and political barriers, the project has not moved beyond the proposal stage [213] Nevertheless, the establishment of two World Heritage Sites [k] in northern Chad in 2012 and 2016 has renewed hope that a similar feat might be achieved in the Tibesti [207]\n\n\nArt and literature\nThe Tibesti Mountains are renowned for their rock and parietal art [216] Around 200 engraving sites and 100 painting sites have been identified Many date as early as the 6th millennium BC, long before the arrival of the Toubou The art has suffered the effects of time, including weathering from sand blown by the wind [206] The earliest works often portray animals that have since died out in the region due to climate change, including elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and giraffes More recent art includes ostriches, antelopes, gazelles, baboons and sheep Later works, dated less than 2000 years old, portray domesticated animals, such as oxen and camels [206] [217]\n\n\nRock and parietal

spires of the Tibesti, along with a stylized sheep's head, were displayed on a 20 CFA franc postage stamp issued by Republic of Chad in 1962 [218] In 1989, French painter and sculptor Jean Vérame used the natural surroundings of the Tibesti to create multidimensional land art works by painting rocks [219] [220]\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

The range is approximately 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) long and 500 kilometers (310 miles) wide, with an average elevation of 2,000 meters (6,600 feet). The highest peak in the range, Emi Koussi, reaches an elevation of 3,415 meters (11,204 feet), making it the highest point in Chad and the Sahara Desert.\n\n## Toponymy\n\nThe Tibesti Mountains are named for the Toubou people, also written as Tibu or Tubu, who inhabit the area. The name \"Tibesti\" is derived from the Kanuri language, where \"tu\" means \"rocks\" or \"mountain\" and \"bu\" means \"a person\" or \"dweller\". Therefore, \"Tibesti\" roughly translates to \"the place where the mountain people live\".\n\n## Geography\n\nThe Tibesti Mountains lie on the border between Chad and Libya, with the Chadian region of Tibesti and the Libyan districts of Murzuq and Kufra. The range is adjacent to Niger and located approximately halfway between the Gulf of Sidra and Lake Chad, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. The East African Rift is approximately 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) to the east, and the Cameroon line lies approximately 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) to the southwest.\n\n## Location\n\nThe Tibesti Mountains are situated in the Sahara Desert, one of the driest and most inhospitable regions on Earth.

following this outline:\n\n\nToponymy\nThe Tibesti Mountains are named for the Toubou people, also written Tibu or Tubu, that inhabit the area In the Kanuri language, tu means \"rocks\" or \"mountain\" and bu means \"a person\" or \"dweller,\" and thus Toubou roughly translates to \"people of the mountains\" [a] and Tibesti to the \"place where the mountain people live\" [2] [3]\n\n\nGeography\nThe mountains lie on the border between Chad and Libya, straddling the Chadian region of Tibesti and the Libyan districts of Murzuq and Kufra, around 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) north of N'djamena and 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) south-southeast of Tripoli [11] The range is adjacent to Niger and located approximately halfway between the Gulf of Sidra and Lake Chad, just south of

African Rift is 1,900 km (1,200 mi) to the east and the Cameroon line lies 1,800 km (1,100 mi) to the southwest [4]\n\n\nTopography\nThe highest peak in the Tibesti Mountains, as well as the highest point in Chad and the Sahara Desert, is the 3,415-meter (11,204 ft) Emi Koussi, located at the southern end of the range [18] Other prominent peaks include Pic Toussidé [c] at 3,296 m (10,814 ft) and the 3,012-meter (9,882 ft) Timi on its western side, the 2,972-meter (9,751 ft) Tarso Yega, the 2,925-meter (9,596 ft) Tarso Tieroko, the 2,849-meter (9,347 ft) Ehi Mousgou, the 2,845-meter (9,334 ft) Tarso Voon, the 2,820-meter (9,250 ft) Ehi Sunni, and the 2,774-meter (9,101 ft) Ehi Yéy near the center of the range [20] The 3,376-meter (11,076 ft) Mouskorbé is a peak notable for its height in the northeastern part of the mountain range [11] [21] The 2,266-meter (7,434 ft) Bikku Bitti, the highest point in Libya, is nearby, on the other side of the border [11] [22] The average elevation of the Tibesti Mountains is about 2,000 m (6,600 ft); sixty percent of its area exceeds 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in elevation [18]\n\n\nHydrology\nFive rivers in the northern half of the Tibesti Mountains flow to Libya, while the southern half belongs to the endorheic basin of Lake Chad However, none of the rivers travel long distances, as the water evaporates in the desert heat or seeps into the ground, although the latter may flow great distances through subterranean aquifers [33]\n\n\nGeology\nThe Tibesti Mountains are a large area of tectonic uplift that, according to contemporary theory, resulted from a mantle plume in the craton of the African Plate lithosphere, which is about 130 to 140 km (81 to 87 mi) thick [44] [45] This tectonic uplift may have been accompanied by the opening, and subsequent closure via subduction, of a rift zone [46] [47] A system of regional faults, although partially obscured by the volcanic product, has two distinct orientations: a NNE-SSW alignment that could be an extension of Cameroon line, and a NW-SE alignment that could extend to the Great Rift Valley; however, the relationship between these fault systems has not been conclusively demonstrated [48]\n\n\nGeomorphology\nVolcanic activity in the Tibesti took place in several phases In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon and Ehi Yéy The product of this early volcanic activity has been completely obscured by later eruptions In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas This phase also saw the formation of the Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Mohi Emi Koussi increased in height The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane Calderas formed on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance [56]\n\n\nClimate\nThe Tibesti climate is substantially less dry than that of the surrounding Sahara Desert, but rainfall events are highly variable from year to year [35] [65] [66] In the south of the range, this variation is largely due to oscillations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which steadily moves northward toward northern Chad from November until August, accompanied by humid monsoonal air Normally, the ITCZ repels the Harmattan, a dry trade wind that blows west or southwest from the Sahara Desert, and brings rainfall to southern Tibesti However, sometimes the front retires early, before reaching the Tibesti, leaving its southern portion dry [39] In the arid northern Tibesti, where the monsoon has little influence, storms are caused by episodic Sahara-Sudanese weather systems [9] [65] For example, between 1957 and 1968, Bardaï, on the northern flank of the range, saw an average of 12 mm (0.47 in) of precipitation annually, yet some years were completely dry while others saw 60 mm (2.4 in) of rainfall [9] In general, the range receives less than 20 mm (0.79 in) of rainfall per year [34] However, precipitation increases with altitude; for example Trou au Natron 2,250 m (7,380 ft) receives 126 mm (5.0 in) annually When the rainfall coincides with low temperatures, it can fall as snow [9] [67] This occurs, on average, once every seven years [68]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nMuch like an island surrounded by ocean, the ecology of the Tibesti Mountains is distinguishable from that of the surrounding desert [66] [72] As such, the mountains lie within their own biome, the 82,000-square-kilometer (31,700 sq mi) Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, along with the Jebel Uweinat, a disjunct mountain range that also rises from the Sahara 650 km (400 mi) to the east [11] [66] Most of the ecoregion remains unexplored due to its remoteness and persistent political instability, yet it is known to contain a number of endemic and endangered species Indeed, the isolation of the region is a benefit to its flora and fauna, serving as a sort of refuge, allowing plants to grow untrammeled and animals to roam unmolested Nevertheless, hunting is unregulated in the region, and vegetation has suffered from overgrazing in the past [66]\n\n\nFlora\nThe flora in the Tibesti is Saharomontane, mixing Mediterranean, Sahara, Sahel and Afromontane vegetation [66] [73] Biodiversity and endemism levels are higher in the Tibesti than in the Aïr Mountains or the Ennedi Plateau, although the vegetation's coverage is highly dependent on rainfall [74] [75] Oases lie along the courses of the enneris, such as Enneri Yebige, which is virtually unexplored [update] [34] These oases, which are more numerous to the north and west of the range, are scattered with acacia, figs, palms and tamarisks [76] Most gueltas are lined with macrophytes—including smooth flatsedge (Cyperus laevigatus) and branched horsetail (Equisetum ramosissimum) [76]—and bryophytes—including Oxyrrhynchium speciosum and species of Bryum [77] Egyptian acacia (Vachellia nilotica syn Acacia nilotica) grows near these water basins [76] Saharan myrtle (Myrtus nivellei) and oleander (Nerium oleander) grow between elevations of 1,500 and 2,300 m (4,900 and 7,500 ft) in the western part of the range, while Nile tamarisk (Tamarix nilotica) grows at similar elevations in its northern part [75] Downstream, where the current of the enneris is slower and the riverbed is deeper, there are dense thickets of Athel tamarisk (Tamarix aphylla syn Tamarix articulata) and arak (Salvadora persica) [78]\n\n\nFauna\nMammals abound in the Tibesti [66] Bovids include the endangered addax (Addax nasomaculatus) along with the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros) and a significant population of Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) [66] [81] [82] Rodents are the most represented order of mammals, and include the spiny mouse (Acomys spp.), bushy-tailed jird (Sekeetamys calurus) and the North African gerbil (Dipodillus campestris syn Gerbillus campestris) [66] Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis lybica) and, more rarely, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), as well as several canine species, including the golden jackal (Canis aureus), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii) [66] [83] The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range [66] African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) formerly roamed the range, although these populations are now extirpated [84] Olive baboons (Papio anubis), found as recently as 1960, are now likely extirpated as well [85] Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the Egyptian mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma cystops), Egyptian slit-faced bat (Nycteris thebaica) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens) [86] The Cape hare (Lepus capensis) and the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) also populate the area [66]\n\n\nPopulation\nThe town of Bardaï, located on the northern flank of the mountains at an elevation of 1,020 m (3,350 ft), is the capital of the Tibesti region [9] [91] It is connected to the town of Zouar, to the southwest, by a track that crosses Tarso Toussidé [92] [93] The village of Omchi is accessible from Bardaï via Aderké, or from the town of Aouzou via Irbi These rough tracks extend southward towards Yebbi Souma and Yebbi Bou, and then follow the course of Enneri Misky The eastern half of the Tibesti is cut off from the western half, and the eastern village of Aozi is accessible from Libya via Ouri [92] Zouar has an airport, as does Bardaï at Zougra [94] Bardaï also has a hospital, although the medical supply is very much dependent upon the prevailing political situation [10]\n\n\nHistory\nThere is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the Stone Age, when denser paleovegetation facilitated human habitation [60] The Toubou were settled in the region by the 5th century BC and eventually established trade relations with the Carthaginian civilization [110] [111] Around this time, Herodotus mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled \"Aethiopians\", and described them as having a language akin to the \"cry of bats\" [f] [110] [113]\n\n\nHuman settlement\nThere is evidence of human occupation of the Tibesti dating back to the

civilization [110] [111] Around this time, Herodotus mentioned the Toubou, whom he labeled \"Aethiopians\", and described them as having a language akin to the \"cry of bats\" [f] [110] [113]\n\n\nRegional relations and colonization\nIn the mid-19th century the Ottoman Empire began a campaign of territorial conquest across northern Africa from its regional headquarters in Libya, yet was unable to subdue the Tibesti [125] In 1890, to the chagrin of the Turks, France and Great Britain signed a declaration recognizing a French zone of influence in northern Africa from the Mediterranean Sea down to Lake Chad [126] In response, the Toubou allied with the Senussi Arabs of Libya and agreed that the southern half of the Tibesti could serve as a fallback base for the Senussi in their struggle against the French Colonial Army [127] As the Sennussis' influence moved southward, so did their headquarters, which in 1899 was moved to the town of Gouro on the southeast flank of the range [92] [128] [129] The Senussi founded a Zawiya in Bardaï, which quickly promoted the total Islamization of the Tibesti [14] [130] At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, the Senussi allied with the Ottoman Empire and, at the request of the Derdé, the Turks established garrisons in Tibesti beginning in March 1911 These garrisons fell apart a few months later when the Toubou attacked the Turkish troops [131]\n\n\nModern history\nChad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by François Tombalbaye imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti [121] [136] Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi [137] Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government [121] These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979 [121] [138]\n\n\nChadian Civil War\nChad gained independence from France in 1960, and in 1965 the Chadian government led by François Tombalbaye imposed its administrative and judicial authority in the Tibesti [121] [136] Mere days after the withdrawal of French troops from the region, rebellion erupted in Bardaï, followed by numerous small battles over subsequent months and a more significant battle in Bardaï in September In response, the Tombalbaye government imposed travel and trade restrictions on the Toubou and voided the traditional power of the then Derdé, Oueddei Kichidemi [137] Kichidemi went into exile in Libya the following year and became a national symbol in Chad for opposition to the government [121] These events sparked the First Chadian Civil War, which lasted from 1965 to 1979 [121] [138]\n\n\nTibesti War\nIn 1978, war broke out between Chad and Libya ostensibly over the Aouzou Strip, a 114,000-square-kilometer (44,000 sq mi) borderland between Chad and Libya that extends into the Tibesti Mountains and is rumored to contain uranium deposits [113] [150] [151] [152] In 1980, Libya used the strip as a base from which stage an attack, led by Goukouni, on the Chadian capital, N'Djamena, located in southern Chad and controlled by Habré [153] N'Djamena was toppled in December; however, under considerable international pressure, Libya withdrew from southern Chad in late 1981, and Habré's Armed Forces of the North (FAN) took control of the entirety of Chad with the exception of the Tibesti, where Goukouni retreated with his Libyan-backed Government of National Unity (GUNT) forces [153] [154] [155] Goukouni then established a National Peace Government in Bardaï and proclaimed it the legitimate government of Chad Habré attacked the GUNT in the Tibesti in both December 1982 and January 1983 but was repelled on both occasions Although fighting intensified over the next several months, the mountains remained under the control of the GUNT and Libyan forces [156]\n\n\nMDJT War\nFollowing a decade of relative peace, in late 1997 the Tibesti saw the formation of the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT), a rebel group opposed to Chadian president Idriss Déby [165] Numbering around 1,000 fighters at its peak between 2000 and 2001, and financed by Libyan Teda clans and the Libyan government, the MDJT was able to take control of several towns in the Tibesti [166] Battles with the Chadian National Army (ANT) were particularly violent between 1998 and 2002, resulting in the deaths of between 500 and 850 MDJT rebels and a comparable number of ANT soldiers at locales across northern Chad, including Bardaï [167] Although civilian casualties were relatively limited, many civilians were killed and injured by landmines, and the war resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the local population [168]\n\n\nGold rush\nGold was discovered in the Tibesti Mountains in 2012, attracting prospectors from across the Sahel [173] The arrival of migrants has led to violent conflicts with the Teda locals, a problem exacerbated by an influx of weaponry to the region due to the ongoing [update] wars in Darfur and Libya [174] Violence has also arisen as a result of disputes between the miners themselves; for example, around 100 people were killed in May 2022 over a \"banal dispute\" between miners [175] The increased migration has also increased drug traffic, with the Tibesti lying along the trans-Saharan smuggling route for South American cocaine destined for Europe [176] [177] Nevertheless, the gold discovery has benefited the impoverished region economically Many Tibesti residents have been able to purchase goods such as cars, televisions and satellite telephones that they could not otherwise afford \"If by the grace of God, gold had not appeared we would not even have anything to eat\", remarked one Tibesti prospector [178]\n\n\nScientific exploration and research\nDue to its isolation and geopolitical situation, the Tibesti Mountains were long unexplored by scientists [16] The German Gustav Nachtigal was the first European to explore, albeit with great difficulty, the Tibesti in 1869 [179] While Nachtigal provided an accurate description of the population, his expedition was fiercely opposed by the Toubou, and his account discouraged any new adventure into the Tibesti for over 40 years [180] [181] Later expeditions carried out between 1920 and 1970 yielded valuable information on the geology and petrology of the range [16] The French anthropologist Charles le Cœur and his wife Marguerite, a geographer, lived among the Teda of Tibesti between 1933 and 1935 Le Cœur was the first to closely study the Tibesti populace, but the outbreak of World War II prevented him from publishing his research [h] [180] [182] French Colonel Jean Chapelle published a book on the Toubou and their lifestyle in 1957 [180] In 1965, the Free University of Berlin opened a geomorphological research station in Bardaï; however, research was slowed due to the Chadian Civil War, and the station was ultimately closed in 1974 [183] [184]\n\n\nClimbing history\nAlthough not an alpine climb, Gustav Nachtigal ascended to 2,400 m (7,873 ft) elevation as he traversed a pass abutting Pic Toussidé during his exploration of the Tibesti in 1869 [187] The Englishman Wilfred Thesiger summited the highest mountain in the range, the 3,415-meter (11,204 ft) Emi Koussi, in 1938 [1] [188] In 1948, the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research mounted an expedition under Edouard Wyss-Dunant, which scaled both the peak and needle of Botoum, at 2,400 m (7,900 ft) and 2,000 m (6,600 ft), respectively [189]\n\n\nEconomy\nAlthough gold was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012 [196] [197] Diamonds have also been found The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of uranium, tin, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lead, zinc and copper [197] Amazonite is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes [198] [199] [200] Salt is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou [99]\n\n\nNatural resources\nAlthough gold was long known to exist in small quantities, substantial deposits were discovered in 2012 [196] [197] Diamonds have also been found The mountains and their surroundings could contain significant quantities of uranium, tin, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, beryllium, lead, zinc and copper [197] Amazonite is present and was reportedly mined by the ancient Libyan civilization of Garamantes [198] [199] [200] Salt is mined today, and is an important source of income for the Toubou [99]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThere are accessible oases to the west and north of the range Where mosquitoes do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar where, by the 1950s, indigenous plant species had been largely replaced by some 56,000 date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) [202] [203] The dates are harvested between late July and early August [109] In winter, when reserves are depleted, it is not uncommon for the cores of the dates and the fiber of the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed Some native palm species remain, such as the doum palm (Hyphaene thebaica), from which the hard yet vaguely-sweet fruit rinds are collected, ground and consumed, despite their low nutritional value [202] The banks of the enneris grow desert gourd (Citrullus colocynthis), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour [204] Women are customarily responsible for gathering wild grains on the tarsos in August [109]\n\n\nTourism\nAs the Sahara's highest mountain range, with geothermal features, a distinctive culture, and numerous rock and parietal artworks, the Tibesti has tourism potential [206] [207] [208] However, tourist accommodations are limited at best [209] In the early 2010s, the French adventure travel company Point-Afrique financed the repair of the airport at Faya-Largeau, some 200 kilometers (120 mi) southeast of the Tibesti, and established direct charter flights between Faya and Marseille Although the flights mainly brought tourists destined for the Ounianga Lakes UNESCO World Heritage Site, there was considerable hope that they would also open the gates for tourism in the Tibesti [207] [210] For example, the Chadian government invested in a tourist camp along with walled pavilions in Bardaï [207] [209] Yet, following the Libyan Crisis and France's intervention in Mali, the French government pressured tour operators to prevent French tourists from venturing into the Sahara, and the flights ended [207]\n\n\nConservation\nThe resources available for conservation in the Tibesti are limited [66] In 2006, various non-governmental working groups proposed a protected area to preserve the area's rhim gazelle and Barbary sheep populations [81] [82] The protected area would be modeled after the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve to the south However, due to economic and political barriers, the project has not moved beyond the proposal stage [213] Nevertheless, the establishment of two World Heritage Sites [k] in northern Chad in 2012 and 2016 has renewed hope that a similar feat might be achieved in the Tibesti [207]\n\n\nArt and literature\nThe Tibesti Mountains are renowned for their rock and parietal art [216] Around 200 engraving sites and 100 painting sites have been identified Many date as early as the 6th millennium BC, long before the arrival of the Toubou The art has suffered the effects of time, including weathering from sand blown by the wind [206] The earliest works often portray animals that have since died out in the region due to climate change, including elephants, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and giraffes More recent art includes ostriches, antelopes, gazelles, baboons and sheep Later works, dated less than 2000 years old, portray domesticated animals, such as oxen and camels [206] [217]\n\n\nRock and parietal

spires of the Tibesti, along with a stylized sheep's head, were displayed on a 20 CFA franc postage stamp issued by Republic of Chad in 1962 [218] In 1989, French painter and sculptor Jean Vérame used the natural surroundings of the Tibesti to create multidimensional land art works by painting rocks [219] [220]\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal

With a career spanning over five decades, Peltz has built a reputation as a shrewd and successful investor who has navigated the complexities of the corporate world with ease. This article will provide an in-depth look at Peltz's early life, business career, and personal life, as well as his notable investments and philanthropic endeavors.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nNelson Peltz was born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. His parents, Claire (née Wechsler) and Maurice Herbert Peltz, were both of modest means, and Nelson was the youngest of their three children. Growing up in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn, a sub-section of the East New York neighborhood, Peltz developed a strong work ethic and a keen business sense from a young age. His grandfather, who had immigrated to the United States from Poland, founded A Peltz & Sons, a wholesale food distribution business that delivered fresh produce and Snow Crop brand frozen food to restaurants in New York.\n\n## Business Career\n\nPeltz dropped out of the Wharton School, where he had been studying business, with the intention of becoming a ski instructor in Oregon. However, he soon found himself driving a delivery truck for his family's business, where he gained valuable experience in the food distribution industry. In the 1960s, Peltz began to build a reputation as a shrewd and knowledgeable investor, and he quickly made a name for himself in the investment world.\n\nIn the 1970s, Peltz cofounded Triangle Transportation Corporation, a transportation company that specialized in food distribution. The company quickly grew and became a major player in the industry, and Peltz's reputation as a successful businessman continued to grow. In the 1980s, Peltz became a prominent investor in the private equity industry, and he made a series of successful investments that further solidified his reputation.\n\n## Trian Partners\n\nIn 2005, Peltz, along with his partners David May and Ed Garden, founded Trian Fund Management, L.P. As an activist investing firm, Trian has invested in a wide range of companies, including Heinz, Cadbury, Kraft Foods, Ingersoll Rand, Wendy's, DuPont, Mondelēz, PepsiCo, State Street Corporation, Procter & Gamble, and Family Dollar. Through Trian, Peltz has become known as a shrewd and effective activist investor who is able to navigate the complexities of the corporate world with ease.\n\nUnder Peltz's leadership, Trian has taken a number of notable positions, including the successful campaign to break up the conglomerate Procter & Gamble. In 2011, Peltz led a successful campaign to pressure the company to separate its North American business from its international business, and the company ultimately agreed to the separation in 2014.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nPeltz has been married three times. His first wife, Cynthia Abrams, was the daughter of Emerson Radio & Phonograph Corporation co-founder Benjamin Abrams. They divorced in 1981, and Peltz married his second wife, Clare Hazlitt, in 1983. The couple had two children together before divorcing in 2000. In 2004, Peltz married his third wife, Victoria Holdsworth.\n\n## Politics\n\nPeltz has been described as a \"notable Republican donor,\" although he has described his own sympathies as centrist. He has said that \"this country operates way better between center-right and center-left,\" and he has been critical of the extremes of both parties. Despite his Republican leanings, Peltz has also been a longtime friend and supporter of Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, whom he has credited with \"keeping our elected officials somewhere in the middle.\"\n\n## Wealth and Donations\n\nIn February 2014, Forbes listed Peltz as one of the 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2013, with total earnings of $430 million.

a trailer would take away the \"Schrödinger's cat-esque position\", as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to disappoint fans [125]\n\n\nRelease\nAvengers: Endgame had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019 [133] [134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70-foot (21-metre) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system The convention center also held the red carpet arrival and after-party for the premiere [134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24, [135] in the United Kingdom on April 25, [136] in the United States and India on April 26, [103] [135] and in Russia on April 29 [135] in IMAX and 3D [137] [138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3 [77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films [139] Avengers: Endgame is part of Phase Three of the MCU [140]\n\n\nTheatrical\nAvengers: Endgame had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019 [133] [134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70-foot (21-metre) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system The convention center also held the red carpet arrival and after-party for the premiere [134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24, [135] in the United Kingdom on April 25, [136] in the United States and India on April 26, [103] [135] and in Russia on April 29 [135] in IMAX and 3D [137] [138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3 [77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films [139] Avengers: Endgame is part of Phase Three of the MCU [140]\n\n\nHome media\nThe film was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13 [144] Streaming became exclusive to Disney+ on November 12, 2021 [145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel [144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home-media release has the cropped 2.39:1 aspect-ratio version used for non-IMAX screenings [146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ on November 12, 2021, [147] and it earned $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US [3]\n\n\nReception\nAvengers: Endgame grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.941 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion [4] It was the highest-grossing film of all time [148] until it was surpassed by Avatar (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China, [149] and was the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada [150] Gone with the Wind (1939) remains the highest-grossing film (adjusted for inflation), and Avengers: Endgame is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide [151]\n\n\nBox office\nAvengers: Endgame grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada and $1.941 billion in other territories for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion [4] It was the highest-grossing film of all time [148] until it was surpassed by Avatar (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China, [149] and was the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada [150] Gone with the Wind (1939) remains the highest-grossing film (adjusted for inflation), and Avengers: Endgame is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide [151]\n\n\nPre-sale records\nEndgame was one of 2019's most anticipated films of 2019 in late December 2018, ranked second by IMDb and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets [158] [159] Due to high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S on April 2, 2019, customers on Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays;

{"title": "War_in_Donbas", "content": "\nBackground\nDespite being recognized as an independent country since 1991, as a former USSR constituent republic, Ukraine was perceived by the leadership of Russia as part of its sphere of influence In a 2002 paper Taras Kuzio stated \"While accepting Ukrainian independence, Putin has sought to draw Ukraine into a closer relationship This approach has been acceptable to eastern Ukrainian oligarchs, who do not harbour anti-Russian feelings\" [54]\n\n\nProtests\nFollowing the revolution, counter-revolutionary and pro-Russian protests began in parts of the Donbas A national survey held in March–April 2014 found that 58% of respondents in the Donbas wanted autonomy within Ukraine, while 31% wanted the region to separate from Ukraine [64]\n\n\nProxy war\nWhile the initial protests were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government, Russia took advantage of them to launch a coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine [76] Russian citizens led the separatist movement in Donetsk from April until August 2014, and were supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia [77] [78] [79] As the conflict escalated in May 2014, Russia employed a \"hybrid approach\", deploying a combination of disinformation, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support to destabilize the Donbas [80] [81] [82]\n\n\nMilitants seize towns\nBetween 12 April and 14 April, Russian-allied militants took control of government buildings in several towns and cities in Donetsk oblast, including Sloviansk, Mariupol, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka [75] [85] [86]\n\n\nSloviansk\nOn 12 April, the strategic town of Sloviansk was captured by a fifty-strong unit of heavily-armed pro-Russian militants [68] They attacked and occupied the town's administration building, police station, and SBU building, and set up roadblocks with the help of local armed activists [68] [87] The unit were Russian Armed Forces 'volunteers' under the command of Russian GRU colonel Igor Girkin ('Strelkov') [68] [88] They had been sent from Russian-occupied Crimea and wore no insignia [68]\n\n\nKramatorsk\nThe same day as the capture of Sloviansk, Girkin's men attacked the police station in nearby Kramatorsk, resulting in a shootout [96] The fighters, claiming to be members of the Donbas People's Militia, later captured the police station They removed the police station's sign and raised the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic over the building [97] They then issued an ultimatum that stated that if the city's mayor and administration did not swear allegiance to the Republic by the following Monday, they would remove them from office [97] Concurrently, a crowd of demonstrators surrounded the city administration building, captured it, and raised the Donetsk People's Republic flag over it A representative of the Republic addressed locals outside the occupied police station, but was received negatively and booed [97]\n\n\nHorlivka\nPro-Russian militants attempted to seize the police headquarters in Horlivka on 12 April, but were halted Ukrainska Pravda reported that police said that the purpose of the attempted seizure was to gain access to a weapons cache [98] They said that they would use force if needed to defend the building from \"criminals and terrorists\" [99] By 14 April militants had captured the building after a tense standoff with the police [75] Some members of the local police unit had defected to the Donetsk People's Republic earlier in the day, whilst the remaining officers were forced to retreat, allowing the insurgents to take control of the building [100]\n\n\nOther settlements\nOther smaller towns, as well as government buildings, were seized by Russian-backed militants in the Donbas.\n\n\nGovernment counter-offensive: \"the Anti-Terrorist Operation\"\nArsen Avakov, the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on 9 April that the separatist problem would be resolved within 48 hours through either negotiations or the use of force According to the Ukrinform state news agency, he said: \"There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict – a political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach We are ready for both.\" Acting president Oleksandr Turchynov had already signed a decree which called for the Donetsk regional state administration building, occupied by separatists, to be taken \"under state protection\" [73] [72] He offered amnesty to any separatists who laid down their arms and surrendered [112] By 11 April Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that he had been against the use of \"law enforcement\" at the time, but that \"there was a limit\" to how much the Ukrainian government would tolerate [113] In response to the spread of separatist control throughout Donetsk Oblast and the separatists' refusal to lay down their arms, Turchynov vowed to launch a military counter-offensive operation, called the \"Anti-Terrorist Operation\", against insurgents in the region by 15 April [71]\n\n\nMay 2014: post-referendum fighting\nIt was reported on 12 May that, following the local autonomy referendum, the Donbas People's Militia leader Igor Girkin declared himself \"Supreme Commander\" of the Donetsk People's Republic In his decree, he demanded that all military stationed in the region swear an oath of allegiance to him within 48 hours, and said that all remaining Ukrainian military in the region would be \"destroyed on the spot\" He then petitioned the Russian Federation for military support to protect against \"the threat of intervention by NATO\" and \"genocide\" [156] Pavel Gubarev, president of Donetsk People's Republic, instituted martial law on 15 May, and vowed for \"total annihilation\" of Ukrainian forces if they did not pull out of the Donbas by 21:00 Similarly, the president of the Luhansk People's Republic, Valery Bolotov, declared martial law on 22 May [157]\n\n\nAirport battle and fighting in Luhansk\nOn the morning of 26 May 200 pro-Russian insurgents, including members of the Vostok Battalion, captured the main terminal of the Donetsk International Airport, erected roadblocks around it, and demanded that government forces withdraw [175] Soon after these demands were issued, the Ukrainian National Guard issued an ultimatum to the separatists, asking them to surrender This was subsequently rejected Government forces then launched an assault on separatist positions at the airport with paratroopers and airstrikes [176] Attack helicopters were used by government forces They targeted a separatist-operated anti-aircraft gun [177]\nAn estimated 40 insurgents died in the fighting, with some civilians caught in the crossfire [178]\nBetween 15 and 35 insurgents were killed in a single friendly-fire incident, when two lorries carrying wounded fighters away from the airport were ambushed by insurgents mistaking them for Ukrainian forces [179] [180]\n\n\nEscalation in May and June 2014\nMykhailo Koval, the Minister of Defence, said on 30 May that Ukrainian government forces had \"completely cleared\" the insurgents from the southern and western parts of Donetsk Oblast and the northern part of Luhansk Oblast [183] Meanwhile, an internal coup replaced the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic, and some bodies of Russian fighters killed in the airport battle were repatriated to Russia [184]\n\n\nLuhansk border post siege\nTwo separatists were killed in a skirmish with Ukrainian border guards on 31 May [185] Two days later, five separatists were killed when 500 separatists attacked a border post in Luhansk Oblast Eleven border guards and eight separatists were wounded during the fighting, [186] which also killed one civilian [187]\n\n\n2 June Luhansk airstrike\nOn 2 June, eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded by a series of explosions hitting the occupied RSA building in Luhansk city [188] Separatists blamed the incident on a government airstrike, while Ukrainian officials denied this, and claimed that the explosions were caused by a stray surface-to-air missile fired by insurgents [189] The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) published a report on the next day, stating that based on \"limited observation\", they believed that the explosion was caused by an airstrike, supporting separatist claims [190]\n\n\nContinued fighting\nGovernment forces destroyed a separatist stronghold in Semenivka, and regained control of Krasnyi Lyman on 3 June [193] Two soldiers were killed in the fighting, and forty-five were wounded A spokesman for the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that 300 insurgents were killed during the operation and that 500 were wounded Insurgents said they lost between 10 and 50 men [194] They said that at least 25 were killed while in hospital at Krasnyi Lyman [195] None of these reports were independently confirmed, and both sides denied the other's accounts of the battle [194]\n\n\nRussian tank incursion\nUkrainian officials said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo-Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov said \"we have observed columns passing with armoured personnel carriers, other armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, and tanks which, according to our information, came across the border and this morning were in Snizhne\" He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way Reuters correspondents confirmed the presence of three tanks in Donetsk city, and the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also said that Russia had indeed sent tanks, along with other heavy weapons, to the separatists in Ukraine [201]\n\n\nIlyushin Il-76 shoot-down\nA Ukrainian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD was shot down by forces aligned with the Luhansk People's Republic on 14 June [213] The aircraft was preparing to land at Luhansk International Airport, and was carrying troops and equipment from an undisclosed location All 49 people on board died [213]

armoured vehicles broke out in the town of Yampil, near government-held Krasnyi Lyman Up to 4,000 insurgents were present for the fighting, which started, according to the insurgents, after the Armed Forces attempted to capture insurgent-held Yampil, [215] with the goal of breaking through to Siversk [216] According to the Armed Forces, it started after insurgents attempted to break through a cordon of government troops around government-held Krasny Lyman The battle was described as exceeding \"in terms of force and scale anything there has been\" during the conflict in the Donbas [217]\n\n\nJuly 2014: post-ceasefire government offensive\nAfter a week-long ceasefire unilaterally declared by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko ended, the Armed Forces renewed their operations against the insurgents on 1 July Shelling occurred in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and government forces retook a border crossing in Dolzhansk, one of the three major border crossings occupied by the separatists Government forces also recaptured the villages of Brusivka and Stary Karavan [225] On the same day, insurgents in Luhansk said that they had taken control of Luhansk International Airport [226] On 1 July 2014 in Donetsk a street gunfight broke between rival factions of pro-Russian militants, which resulted in one person being fatally wounded and two others in critical conditions [227]\n\n\nFighting worsens in eastern Donetsk Oblast\nAfter a brief lull following the insurgent withdrawal from the northern part of Donetsk Oblast, fighting continued to escalate sharply in the eastern parts of Donetsk Oblast Shells landed on the border town of Donetsk in Rostov Oblast, a part of Russia, on 13 July [250] One civilian was killed in the shelling Russian officials blamed the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the shelling, whilst Ukraine denied responsibility and accused insurgents in the Donbas of having staged a false flag attack [251] Russia said it was considering launching airstrikes against government targets in Ukraine as retaliation for the shelling [252]\n\n\nDowning of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\nOn 17 July 2014, DPR forces shot down a civilian passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Hrabove (a village in the Donetsk Oblask), killing all 298 people on board This disaster followed two similar incidents earlier in the week, when two Ukrainian Air Force planes were shot down [258]\n\n\nGovernment push into Donetsk and Luhansk cities\nMeanwhile, fighting in Luhansk resulted in the loss of electrical power and water services across the city [267] Shelling damaged an electrical substation in the Kamennobrodskiy district, causing the power loss An oil refinery in Lysychansk was also set alight [267]\n\n\nOpen war between Russia and Ukraine\nOn

Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, and the LPR agreed to a ceasefire on 5 September [38] OSCE monitors said they would observe the ceasefire, and assist the Ukrainian government in implementing it [371] According to The New York Times, the agreement was an \"almost verbatim\" replication of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's failed June \"15-point peace plan\" [372] It was agreed that there would be an exchange of all prisoners taken by both sides, and that heavy weaponry should be removed from the combat zone [372] [373]\n\n\nNovember 2014

conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine, which began in 2014 and is still ongoing. The conflict has been described as a war, a civil war, and a frozen conflict, and has involved various parties, including the Ukrainian government, Russian-backed separatist groups, and Russian military forces.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Donbas region, which includes the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, has a complex history of ethnic and linguistic diversity. The region has been inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Russians, and other minority groups for centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the region became a major industrial center in the Russian Empire, with coal mining and steel production being the primary industries.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Donbas region became a major center of industry and culture in the Soviet Union. However, the region also became a major site of nationalistic and separatist sentiment, particularly among ethnic Russians, who felt that they were being marginalized and oppressed by the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union, and the Donbas region became part of an independent Ukraine. However, the region's history of nationalistic and separatist sentiment continued, and in 2014, the Ukrainian government faced a major crisis when pro-Russian protesters took to the streets in the Donbas region, demanding greater autonomy and even independence.\n\n**Protests**\n\nIn February 2014, a wave of protests swept across Ukraine, following the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who had been elected in 2010 with the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The protests, which were led by a coalition of nationalist and liberal groups, were sparked by Yanukovych's decision to reject an association agreement with the European Union, which was seen as a key step towards Ukraine's integration into the EU.\n\nIn the Donbas region, the protests took on a distinctly pro-Russian character, with many protesters demanding greater autonomy and even independence from Ukraine. The protests were led by a group of pro-Russian activists, who were supported by Russian-backed separatist groups.\n\n**Proxy war**\n\nWhile the initial protests were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government, Russia took advantage of them to launch a coordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine. Russian citizens led the separatist movement in Donetsk from April until August 2014, and were supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia.\n\nAs the conflict escalated in May 2014, Russia employed a \"hybrid approach\", deploying a combination of disinformation, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support to destabilize the Donbas. The separatists, who were supported by Russia, launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian government buildings and military units, leading to a major escalation of the conflict.\n\n**Militants seize towns**\n\nBetween 12 April and 14 April, Russian-allied militants took control of government buildings in several towns and cities in Donetsk Oblast, including Sloviansk, Mariupol, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka.\n\n**Government counter-offensive: \"the Anti-Terrorist Operation\"**\n\nIn response to the spread of separatist control throughout Donetsk Oblast and the separatists' refusal to lay down their arms, Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov vowed to launch a military counter-offensive operation, called the \"Anti-Terrorist Operation\", against insurgents in the region by 15 April.\n\n**May 2014: post-referendum fighting**\n\nFollowing the local autonomy referendum, the Donbas People's Militia leader Igor Girkin declared himself \"Supreme Commander\" of the Donetsk People's Republic, and demanded that all military stationed in the region swear an oath of allegiance to him within 48 hours.\n\n**Airport battle and fighting in Luhansk**\n\nOn 26 May, pro-Russian insurgents captured the main terminal of the Donetsk International Airport, and government forces launched an assault on separatist positions at the airport with paratroopers and airstrikes. The fighting resulted in the deaths of an estimated 40 insurgents, and the destruction of several buildings.\n\n**Escalation in May and June 2014**\n\nThe conflict escalated in May and June 2014, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Ukrainian government launched a major counter-offensive against the separatists, and the separatists responded with a series of attacks on Ukrainian military units.\n\n**Russian tank incursion**\n\nIn June 2014, Russian tanks entered the Donbas region, and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of sending tanks and other heavy equipment to support the separatists.\n\n**Ilyushin Il-76 shoot-down**\n\nOn 14 June 2014, a Ukrainian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD was shot down by forces aligned with the Luhansk People's Republic, killing all 49 people on board.\n\n**Battle of Yampil**\n\nLate on 19 June, a battle fought with tanks and armoured vehicles broke out in the town of Yampil, near government-held Krasnyi Lyman.\n\n**July 2014: post-ceasefire government offensive**\n\nAfter a week-long ceasefire unilaterally declared by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ended, the Armed Forces renewed their operations against the insurgents on 1 July.\n\n**Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17**\n\nOn 17 July 2014, DPR forces shot down a civilian passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, over Hrabove, killing all 298 people on board.\n\n**Open war between Russia and Ukraine**\n\nOn 14 August 2014, a convoy of Russian armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles crossed into Ukraine, and Ukrainian artillery engaged and destroyed a \"significant\" portion of the armoured column.\n\n**September 2014 ceasefire**\n\nAfter days of peace talks in Minsk under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, and the LPR agreed to a ceasefire on 5 September.\n\n**November 2014 separatist elections and aftermath**\n\nHeavy fighting continued across the Donbas through October, despite the ceasefire. In violation of the procedure agreed to as part of the Minsk Protocol, DPR and LPR authorities held parliamentary and executive elections on 2 November.\n\n**Escalation in January 2015**\n\nOSCE monitors reported a \"rise in tensions\" following New Year's Day, and numerous ceasefire violations were recorded. Infighting amongst insurgent groups broke out in Luhansk Oblast.\n\n**Minsk II ceasefire and denouement**\n\nThe scheduled summit at Minsk on 11 February 2015 resulted in the signing of a new package of peacemaking measures, called Minsk II, on 12 February.\n\n**January 2017 eruption of heavy fighting and failed ceasefires**\n\n2016 was the first full calendar year of the conflict in which Ukraine lost no territories to pro-Russian forces.

The DPR and LPR joined the offensive, and the separatists stated that an operation to capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast had begun.\n\n**Combatants**\n\nDiverse forces of both foreign and domestic origin participated in the war in the Donbas. Russian involvement in the Donbas war has taken a variety of forms since the beginning of the conflict in 2014.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe estimated number of fatalities in the Donbas war was 14,200-14,400 by the end of December 2021, including non-combat military deaths. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 6,500 were pro-Russian separatist forces, 4,400 were Ukrainian forces, and 3,404 were civilians.\n\n**Humanitarian concerns**\n\nThe United Nations observed in May 2014 an \"alarming deterioration\" in human rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily carried out by the forces of the Donetsk People's Republic.\n\n**Displaced population**\n\nBy early August 2014, at least 730,000 had fled fighting in the Donbas and left for Russia.

heavy weaponry should be removed from the combat zone [372] [373]\n\n\nNovember 2014 separatist elections and aftermath\nHeavy fighting continued across the Donbas through October, despite the ceasefire In violation of the procedure agreed to as part of the Minsk Protocol, DPR and LPR authorities held parliamentary and executive elections on 2 November [393] [394] In response to the elections, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko asked parliament to revoke the \"special status\" that was granted to DPR and LPR-controlled areas as part of the Minsk Protocol [395] DPR deputy prime minister Andrei Purgin said that Ukrainian forces had launched \"all-out war\" against the DPR and LPR on 6 November [396]\n\n\nEscalation in January 2015\nOSCE monitors reported a \"rise in tensions\" following New Year's Day [414] Numerous ceasefire violations were recorded, with most occurring near Donetsk International Airport Infighting amongst insurgent groups broke out in Luhansk Oblast [415] In one incident, LPR militants said that they had killed Alexander Bednov, the leader of the pro-Russian \"Batman Battalion\", on 2 January 2015 LPR officials said that Bednov had been running an \"illegal prison\", and that he had engaged in torturing prisoners [416] In another incident, the leader of an Antratsyt-based Don Cossack militant group, Nikolai Kozitsyn, said that the territory controlled by his group, claimed by the Luhansk People's Republic, had become part of the \"Russian empire\", and that Russian president Vladimir Putin was its \"emperor\" [415] An intercity bus stopped at a government checkpoint in Buhas was hit by a Grad rocket on 13 January, killing 12 civilians [417] [418] Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko declared a day of national mourning [419] Buhas is 35 kilometres (22 mi) south-west of Donetsk city.\n\n\nMinsk II ceasefire and denouement\nThe scheduled summit at Minsk on 11 February 2015 resulted in the signing of a new package of peacemaking measures, called Minsk II, on 12 February [444] The plan, similar in content to the failed Minsk Protocol, called for an unconditional ceasefire, to begin on 15 February, amongst many other measures [444] [445] Despite the signing of Minsk II, fighting continued around Debaltseve [446] DPR forces said that ceasefire did not apply to Debaltseve, and continued their offensive Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the Debaltseve area on 18 February, leaving separatist forces in control of it [447]\n\n\nJanuary 2017 eruption of heavy fighting and failed ceasefires\n2016 was the first full calendar year of the conflict in which Ukraine lost no territories to pro-Russian forces [467] In addition, both the Ukrainian Armed Forces (211 combat losses and 256 non-combat losses) and the local populace (13 in Ukrainian government-controlled areas) suffered significantly less casualties than in 2015 [467] The new year, however, brought a new eruption of heavy fighting, starting on 29 January 2017, centred on the Ukrainian-controlled city of Avdiivka [468]\n\n\nOctober 2019 Steinmeier formula agreement and July 2020 ceasefire\nFollowing extensive negotiations, Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, LPR, and the OSCE signed an agreement to try to end the conflict in the Donbas on 1 October 2019 Called the \"Steinmeier formula\", after its proposer, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the agreement envisages free elections in DPR and LPR territories, observed and verified by the OSCE, and the subsequent reintegration of those territories into Ukraine with special status Russia demanded the agreement's signing before any continuation of the \"Normandy format\" peace talks [50] A survey of public opinion in DPR and LPR-controlled Donbas conducted by the Centre for East European and International Studies in March 2019 found that 55% of those polled favoured reintegration with Ukraine 24% of those in favour of reintegration supported a return to the pre-war administrative system for Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, while 33% percent supported special status for the region [513]\n\n\n2021–2022 escalation\nAccording to Ukrainian authorities, in the first three months of 2021, 25 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the conflict zone, compared to a total of 50 that had died in all of 2020 [53] According to the Ombudsman of the DPR, 85 soldiers and 30 civilians were killed in January–October 2021 as a consequence of military action [524]\n\n\n2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine\nOn 24 February 2022, Russia launched a new, full-scale invasion of Ukraine [552] [553] The DPR and LPR joined the offensive; the separatists stated that an operation to capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast had begun [554] By 25 March 2022, Russian forces claimed control over 93 percent of Luhansk oblast and 54 percent of Donetsk oblast [555] Having encountered heavy resistance to its operations in other parts of Ukraine, Russia announced on the same day that it would shift its focus to the complete \"liberation\" of the Donbas, and launched a campaign that would last through much of mid-2022 [555]\n\n\nCombatants\nDiverse forces of both foreign and domestic origin participated in the war in the Donbas.\n\n\nList of combatants\nDiverse forces of both foreign and domestic origin participated in the war in the Donbas.\n\n\nRussian involvement\nRussian involvement in the Donbas war has taken a variety of forms since the beginning of the conflict in 2014.\n\n\nMilitary aid to Ukraine\nIn December 2017, the United States provided Ukraine with lethal aid for the first time, in the form of Javelin antitank missiles [591] Initially, these were to be kept away from the front, but after a second delivery of similar weapon systems they were cleared for use anywhere [592] [593] In September 2021, Kyiv commanded military forces drill in a common exercise with US and NATO partners [594] The use of Javelins on the front line was reported in November 2021 [595]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe estimated number of fatalities in the Donbas war was 14,200–14,400 by the end of December 2021, including non-combat military deaths According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 6,500 were pro-Russian separatist forces, 4,400 were Ukrainian forces, and 3,404 were civilians [17] The vast majority of deaths were in the first two years of the war (2014 and 2015) [596]\n\n\nCivilians\nAccording to the United Nations, 3,404 civilians were killed in the war and more than 7,000 were injured The vast majority of civilian deaths were in the first two years of the war, while 365 civilians were killed in the six years from 2016 to 2021 In the year before Russia's full-scale invasion, 25 civilians were killed, over half of them from mines and unexploded ordnance [17]\n\n\nUkrainian forces\nUkraine reported that 4,647 of its servicemen had been killed by late February 2022, including 262 foreign-born Ukrainian citizens or foreigners [13] [14] [15] [d] Another 70 Ukrainian soldiers were missing [16]\n\n\nSeparatist forces\nThe separatists reported that they had lost 1,400 men at most by February 2015 [603] The UN estimated 6,500 separatists were killed by the end of December 2021 [17]\n\n\nHumanitarian concerns\nThe United Nations observed in May 2014 an \"alarming deterioration\" in human rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic [616] The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily carried out by the forces of the Donetsk People's Republic [617] The UN also reported threats against, attacks on, and abductions of journalists and international observers, as well as beatings and attacks on supporters of Ukrainian unity [617] Russia criticised these reports, and said that they were \"politically motivated\" [618]\n\n\nDisplaced population\nBy early August 2014, at least 730,000 had fled fighting in the Donbas and left for Russia [634] This number, much larger than earlier estimates, was given by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) The number of internal refugees rose to 117,000 [634] By the start of September, after a sharp escalation over the course of August, the number of people displaced from Donbas within Ukraine more than doubled to 260,000 [635] The number of temporary asylum seekers and refugee applicants from Ukraine in Russia rose to 121,000 [636] Despite two months of a shaky ceasefire established by the Minsk Protocol, the number of refugees displaced from Donbas in Ukraine escalated sharply to 466,829 in mid November [637]\n\n\nReactions\nA national survey held in March-April 2014 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that 31% of respondents in the Donbas wanted the region to separate from Ukraine, while 58% wanted autonomy within Ukraine [64] A September 2014 International Republican Institute poll of the Ukrainian public (excluding those in Russian-annexed Crimea) had 89% of respondents opposing Russian intervention in Ukraine [643] As broken down by region, 78% of those polled from Eastern Ukraine (including Dnipropetrovsk Oblast) opposed the intervention, along

This group of individuals accumulated vast fortunes through a combination of business deals, government connections, and strategic investments.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe rise of the Russian oligarchs is closely tied to the country's transition from a Soviet economy to a market-based economy. During the 1990s, Russia's government, led by President Boris Yeltsin, implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at privatizing state-owned enterprises and encouraging private sector growth. This created a new class of wealthy entrepreneurs who were able to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the country's rapidly changing economic landscape.\n\n**Yeltsin Era, 1991–1999**\n\nDuring Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika (c. 1985–1991), many businessmen in Russia imported goods such as personal computers and jeans into the country and sold them for a hefty profit. Economists Sergei Guriev and Andrei Rachinsky contrast older oligarchs with nomenklatura ties and younger-generation entrepreneurs such as Kakha Bendukidze who built their wealth from scratch because Gorbachev's reforms affected a period \"when co-existence of regulated and quasi-market prices created huge opportunities for arbitrage.\"\n\n**Emergence**\n\nThe emergence of the Russian oligarchs was closely tied to the country's economic reforms. As the government began to privatize state-owned enterprises, a new class of entrepreneurs emerged to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the changing economic landscape. These individuals, many of whom had previously been involved in black market activities, were able to use their connections and business acumen to accumulate vast fortunes.\n\n**Political Support**\n\nThe Russian oligarchs received significant political support from the government, particularly from President Yeltsin and his advisors. Yegor Gaidar, a key figure in the Russian government during the 1990s, played a crucial role in shaping the country's economic policies and providing support to the oligarchs. Gaidar's policies, which included the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the creation of a market-based economy, created a favorable environment for the oligarchs to grow and accumulate wealth.\n\n**Putin Era, 1999–2022 (Prior to the Invasion of Ukraine)**\n\nWith the ascent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, the influence of the Yeltsin oligarchs began to dissipate. Many of the oligarchs were either imprisoned, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, or emigrated, sold off their assets, or died under suspicious circumstances. The government also began to crack down on the oligarchs, arresting several high-profile figures and sentencing them to lengthy prison terms.\n\n**Prominent Putin-Era Oligarchs**\n\nDespite the decline of the Yeltsin oligarchs, a new group of influential businesspeople emerged during the Putin era. These individuals, many of whom had close ties to the government, accumulated vast fortunes through a combination of business deals, government connections, and strategic investments. Some of the most prominent Putin-era oligarchs include Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Arkady Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, Andrey Guryev, and Vitaly Malkin.\n\n**2008 Global Recession and Credit Crisis**\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 had a significant impact on the Russian oligarchs. The Russian stock market plummeted, and many of the oligarchs saw their fortunes decline significantly. According to estimates, the Russian oligarchs collectively lost over $230 billion in the wake of the crisis.\n\n**Putin Era, 2022 Invasion of Ukraine and International Sanctions**\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine marked a significant turning point for the Russian oligarchs. In response to the invasion, the international community imposed a range of economic sanctions on Russia, including targeted sanctions on the oligarchs. The sanctions, which were imposed by countries including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Japan, aimed to directly impact the Russian ruling class and limit their ability to accumulate wealth.\n\n**Russian Oligarchs in London**\n\nThe Russian oligarchs have significant ties to the United Kingdom, with many of them owning properties and businesses in London. The British government has encouraged the flow of foreign capital into the UK, and the Russian oligarchs have taken advantage of this to invest in the country.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Russian oligarchs are a complex and influential group of businesspeople who have played a significant role in shaping the country's economic and political landscape. While some of the oligarchs have accumulated vast fortunes, others have been imprisoned or forced to flee the country. The ongoing sanctions imposed by the international community in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine are likely to have a significant impact on the oligarchs and the Russian economy as a whole.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_oligarchs\" following this outline:\n\n\nYeltsin era, 1991–1999\nDuring Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika

of man, the French settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more civil rights [70] Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by Vincent Ogé, resulting in his capture, torture and execution [55] Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern Haiti under the leadership of Toussaint Louverture inspired by the Vodou houngan (priest) Boukman, and backed by the Spanish in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony [55]\n\n\nIndependent Haiti\nThe independence of Saint-Domingue was proclaimed under the native name 'Haiti' by Jean-Jacques Dessalines on 1 January 1804 in Gonaïves [96] [97] and he was proclaimed \"Emperor for Life\" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops [98] Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others [99] However, once in power, he ordered the genocide of nearly all the remaining white men, women, children; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population [100] Only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared: Polish soldiers, the majority of whom had deserted from the French army and fought alongside the Haitian rebels; the small group of German colonists invited to the north-west region; and a group of medical doctors and professionals [101] Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men [102]\n\n\nFirst Empire (1804–1806)\nThe independence of Saint-Domingue was proclaimed under the native name 'Haiti' by Jean-Jacques Dessalines on 1 January 1804 in Gonaïves [96] [97] and he was proclaimed \"Emperor for Life\" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops [98] Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others [99] However, once in power, he ordered the genocide of nearly all the remaining white men, women, children; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population [100] Only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared: Polish soldiers, the majority of whom had deserted from the French army and fought alongside the Haitian rebels; the small group of German colonists invited to the north-west region; and a group of medical doctors and professionals [101] Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men [102]\n\n\nState of Haiti, Kingdom of Haiti and the Republic (1806–1820)\nAfter Dessalines' death Haiti became split into two, with the Kingdom of Haiti in the north directed by Henri Christophe, later declaring himself Henri I, and a republic in the south centered on Port-au-Prince, directed by Alexandre Pétion, an homme de couleur [109] [110] [111] [112] Pétion's republic was less absolutist, and he initiated a series of land reforms which benefited the peasant class [88] President Pétion also gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader Simón Bolívar, which were critical in enabling him to liberate the Viceroyalty of New Granada [113] Meanwhile, the French, who had managed to maintain a precarious control of eastern Hispaniola, were defeated by insurgents led by Juan Sánchez Ramírez, with the area returning to Spanish rule in 1809 following the Battle of Palo Hincado [114]\n\n\nUnification of Hispaniola (1821–1844)\nBeginning in 1821, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, also an homme de couleur and successor to Pétion, reunified the island following the suicide of Henry Christophe [55] [115] After Santo Domingo declared its independence from Spain on 30 November 1821, Boyer invaded, seeking to unite the entire island by force and ending slavery in Santo Domingo [116]\n\n\nLoss of the Spanish portion of the island\nAfter losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with Charles Rivière-Hérard replacing him as president [55] Nationalist Dominican forces in eastern Hispaniola led by Juan Pablo Duarte seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844 [55] The Haitian forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending Haitian rule of eastern Hispaniola In March Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the Dominicans inflicted heavy losses [124] Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general Philippe Guerrier, who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844 [citation needed]\n\n\nSecond Empire (1849–1859)\nOn 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General Faustin Soulouque [55] During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence [124] But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security [124] Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the French Government could ratify the treaty [124]\n\n\nLate 19th century–early 20th century\nThe period following Soulouque's overthrow down to the turn of the century was a turbulent one for Haiti, with repeated bouts of political instability President Geffrard was overthrown in a coup in 1867, [127] as was his successor, Sylvain Salnave, in 1869 [128] Under the Presidency of Michel Domingue (1874–76) relations with the Dominican Republic were dramatically improved by the signing of a treaty, in which both parties acknowledged the independence of the other Some modernisation of the economy and infrastructure also occurred in this period, especially under the Presidencies of Lysius Salomon (1879–1888) and Florvil Hyppolite (1889–1896) [129]\n\n\nUnited States occupation (1915–1934)\nGermany increased its influence in Haiti in this period, with a small community of German settlers wielding disproportionate influence in Haiti's economy [137] [138] The German influence prompted anxieties in the United States, who had also invested heavily in the country, and whose government defended their right to oppose foreign interference in the Americas under the Monroe Doctrine [55] [138] In December 1914, the Americans removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and to enable the debt to be repaid [139]\n\n\nPost-occupation era (1934–1957)\nAfter U.S forces left in 1934, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo used anti-Haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool In an event that became known as the Parsley Massacre, he ordered his army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border [151] [152] Few bullets were used; instead, 20,000–30,000 Haitians were bludgeoned and bayoneted, then herded into the sea, where sharks finished what Trujillo had begun [153] The indiscriminate massacre occurred over a period of five days.\n\n\nDuvalier dynasty (1957–1986)\nIn 1956–57 Haiti underwent severe political turmoil; Magloire was forced to resign and leave the country in 1956 and he was followed by four short-lived presidencies [55] In the September 1957 election François Duvalier was elected President of Haiti Known as 'Papa Doc' and initially popular, Duvalier remained President until his death in 1971 [162] He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite [55] [163] Not trusting the army, despite his frequent purges of officers deemed disloyal, Duvalier created a private militia known as Tontons Macoutes (\"Bogeymen\"), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents [162] [164] In 1964 Duvalier proclaimed himself 'President for Life'; an uprising against his rule that year in Jérémie was violently suppressed, with the ringleaders publicly executed and hundreds of mixed-raced citizens in the town killed [162] The bulk of the educated and professional class began leaving the country, and corruption became widespread [55] [162] Duvalier sought to create a personality cult, identifying himself with Baron Samedi, one of the loa (or lwa), or spirits, of Haitian Vodou Despite the well-publicized abuses under his rule, Duvalier's firm anti-Communism earned him the support of the Americans, who furnished the country with aid [162] [165]\n\n\nPost-Duvalier era (1986–2004)\nFollowing Duvalier's departure, army leader General Henri Namphy headed a new National Governing Council [55] Elections scheduled for November 1987 were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and Tontons Macoutes [172] [55] Fraudulent elections followed in 1988, in which only 4% of the citizenry voted [173] [55] The newly elected president, Leslie Manigat, was then overthrown some months later in the June 1988 Haitian coup d'état [55] [174]\n\n\nPost-Aristide era (2004–present)\nAmidst the continuing political chaos, a series of natural disasters hit Haiti In 2004 Tropical Storm Jeanne skimmed the north coast, leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and mudslides, mostly in the city of Gonaïves [196] In 2008 Haiti was again struck by tropical storms; Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike all produced heavy winds and rain, resulting in 331 deaths and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid [197] The state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008 [198] [199] [55]\n\n\nGeography\nHaiti forms the western three-eighths of Hispaniola, the second largest island in the Greater Antilles At 27,750 km2 (10,710 sq mi) Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind Cuba and the Dominican Republic, the latter sharing a 360-kilometer (224 mi) border with Haiti The country has a roughly horseshoe shape and because of this it has a disproportionately long coastline, second in length (1,771 km or 1,100 mi) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles [233] [234]\n\n\nClimate\nHaiti's climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude [235] Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of 23 °C (73.4 °F) to an average maximum of 31 °C (87.8 °F); in July, from 25–35 °C (77–95 °F) The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains Haiti's dry season occurs from November to January.\n\n\nGeology\nThere are blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system over which Haiti lies [240] After the earthquake of 2010, there was no evidence of surface rupture and geologists' findings were based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data [241]\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation have caused periodic and severe flooding, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004 Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic [247]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nHaiti is home to four ecoregions: Hispaniolan moist forests, Hispaniolan dry forests, Hispaniolan pine forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves [251]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe government of Haiti is a semi-presidential republic, a multiparty system wherein the president of Haiti is head of state and elected directly by popular elections held every five years [55] [255] The prime minister of Haiti acts as head of government and is appointed by the president, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly [55] Executive power is exercised by the president and prime minister who together constitute the government [256]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAdministratively, Haiti is divided into ten departments [235] The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.\n\n\nForeign relations\nHaiti is a member of a wide range of international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations, CARICOM, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, International Monetary Fund, Organisation of American States, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, OPANAL and the World Trade Organization [235]\n\n\nMilitary\nHaiti has a strong military history dating to the pre-independence struggle The Indigenous Army is essential in the construction of the state the management of land and public finances Up to the 20th century, every Haitian president was an officer in the army During the US intervention, the army was remodeled as Gendarmerie d'Haiti and later on as Force Armée d'Haiti (FAdH) In the early 1990s, the army was unconstitutionally decommissioned and replaced by the Haitian National Police (PNH) In 2018, Président Jovenel Moise reactivated the FAdH [citation needed]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\nThe legal system is based on a modified version of the Napoleonic Code [268] [55]\n\n\nHaitian penitentiary system\nPort-au-Prince penitentiary is home to half of Haiti's prisoners The prison has a capacity of 1,200 detainees but as of November 2017 [update] the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 363% occupancy level [286] The inability to receive sufficient funds has caused deadly cases of malnutrition, combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis [286]\n\n\nEconomy\nHaiti's per capita GDP is $1,800 and its GDP is $19.97 billion (2017 estimates) [235] The country uses the Haitian gourde as its currency Despite its tourism industry, Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the Americas, with corruption, political instability, poor infrastructure, lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main causes [235] Unemployment is high and many Haitians seek to emigrate Trade declined dramatically after the 2010 earthquake and subsequent outbreak of cholera, with the country's purchasing power parity GDP falling by 8% (from US$12.15 billion to US$11.18 billion) [4] Haiti ranked 145th of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Index, with 57.3% of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI's poverty measures [290]\n\n\nForeign aid\nHaiti received more than US$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003, including US$1.5 billion from the United States [296] The largest donor is the US, followed by Canada and the European Union [297] In January 2010, following the earthquake, US President Barack Obama promised US$1.15 billion in assistance [298] The European Union pledged more than €400 million (US$616 million) [299] Neighboring Dominican Republic has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to Haiti, including the funding and construction of a public university, [300] human capital, free healthcare services in the border region, and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake [301]\n\n\nTrade\nAccording to the 2015 CIA World Factbook, Haiti's main import partners are: Dominican Republic 35%, US 26.8%, Netherlands Antilles 8.7%, China 7% (est 2013) Haiti's main export partner is the US 83.5% (est 2013) [303] Haiti had a trade deficit of US$3 billion in 2011, or 41% of GDP [304]\n\n\nEnergy\nHaiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with Petrocaribe for much of its energy requirements In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources [305]\n\n\nPersonal income\nHaiti suffers from a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment, and underemployment Most Haitians in the labor force have informal jobs Three-quarters of the population lives on US$2 or less per day [311]\n\n\nReal estate\nIn rural areas, people often live in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs Outhouses are located in back of the huts In Port-au-Prince, colorful shantytowns surround the central city and go up the mountainsides [316]\n\n\nAgriculture\nHaiti is the world's leading producer of vetiver, a root plant used to make luxury perfumes, essential oils and fragrances, providing for half the world's supply [317] [318] [319] Roughly 40–50% of Haitians work in the agricultural sector [235] [320] However, according to soil surveys by the United States Department of Agriculture in the early 1980s, only 11.3 percent of the land was highly suitable for crops Haiti relies upon imports for half its food needs and 80% of its rice [320]\n\n\nCurrency\nThe Haitian gourde (HTG) is the national currency The \"Haitian dollar\" equates to 5 gourdes (goud) [citation needed] The vast majority of the business sector and individuals will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred Locals may refer to the USD as \"dollar américain\" (dola ameriken) or \"dollar US\" (pronounced oo-es) [323]\n\n\nTourism\nThe tourism market in Haiti is undeveloped and the government is heavily promoting this sector Haiti has many of the features that attract tourists to other Caribbean destinations, such as white sand beaches, mountainous scenery and a year-round warm climate However, the country's poor image overseas, at times exaggerated, has hampered the development of this sector [55] In 2014, the country received 1,250,000 tourists (mostly from cruise ships), and the industry generated US$200 million in 2014 [citation needed]\n\n\nCaracol Industrial Park\nOn 21 October 2012, Haitian President Michel Martelly, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, Ben Stiller and Sean Penn inaugurated the 240-hectare (600-acre) Caracol industrial park, the largest in the Caribbean [330] The project cost US$300 million and included a 10-megawatt power plant, a water-treatment plant and worker housing [330] The plan for the park pre-dated the 2010 earthquake but was fast-tracked as part of US foreign aid strategy to help Haiti recover [331] The park was part of a \"master plan\" for Haiti's North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the Cap-Haïtien International Airport to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international seaport in Fort-Liberté and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haïtien) on 12 January 2012 [332]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nHaiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other The northern highway, Route Nationale No 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien The southern highway, Route Nationale No 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather [55]\n\n\nTransportation\nHaiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other The northern highway, Route Nationale No 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien The southern highway, Route Nationale No 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather [55]\n\n\nAirports\nToussaint Louverture International Airport, located ten kilometers (six miles) north-northeast of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of Tabarre, is the primary hub for entry and exit into the country It has Haiti's main jetway, and along with Cap-Haïtien International Airport handles the vast majority of the country's international flights Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by regional airlines and private aircraft [citation needed]\n\n\nBus service\nTap tap buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as shared taxis The \"tap tap\" name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off [341] These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art [342]\n\n\nCommunications\nIn Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) –  an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013 [343]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nHaiti faces key challenges in the water supply and sanitation\nsector Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions Foreign and Haitian NGOs play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2018, Haiti's population was estimated to be about 10,788,000 [235] In 2006, half of the population was younger than age 20 [344] In 1950, the first formal census gave a total population of 3.1 million [345] Haiti averages approximately 350 people per square kilometer (910 people/sq mi), with its population concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys.\n\n\nRacial discrimination\nUnder colonial rule, Haitian mulattoes were generally privileged above the black majority, though they possessed fewer rights than the white population Following the country's independence, they became the nation's social elite Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes During this time, the enslaved persons and the affranchis were given limited opportunities toward education, income, and occupations, but even after gaining independence, the social structure remains a legacy today as the disparity between the upper and lower classes have not been reformed significantly since the colonial days [353] Making up 5% of the nation's population, mulattoes have retained their preeminence, evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in Haiti [354] As a result, the elite class today consists of a small group of influential people who are generally light in color [355]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Haiti according to the Pew Research Center (2010) [356]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe two official languages of Haiti are French and Haitian Creole French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians [364] [365] It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church Masses Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements, or collectivités, of France, such as French Guiana Haitian Creole is spoken by nearly all of the Haitian population French, the base language for Haitian Creole, is popular among the Haitian elite and upper classes French is also popular in the business sector, and to a far lesser degree, English due to American influence Spanish is spoken by some Haitians who live along the Haitian-Dominican border [366] English and Spanish may also be spoken by Haitian deportees from the United States and various Latin American countries Overall, about 90–95% of Haitians only speak Haitian Creole and French fluently, with over half only knowing Creole [367]\n\n\nEmigration\nThere is a large Haitian diaspora community, predominantly based in the US and Canada, France, and the wealthier Caribbean islands [citation needed]\n\n\nEducation\nThe educational system of Haiti is based on the French system Higher education, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, [378] is provided by universities and other public and private institutions [379]\n\n\nHealth\nAs of 2012 [update], 60% of children in Haiti under the age of 10 were vaccinated, [384] [385] compared to 93–95% in other countries [386] Recently there have been mass vaccination campaigns claiming to vaccinate as many as 91% of a target population against specific diseases (measles and rubella in this case) [387] Most people have no transportation or access to Haitian hospitals [388]\n\n\nLargest cities\nHaiti has a lasting and unique cultural identity, blending traditional French and African customs, mixed with sizable acquirements from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures [398]\n\n\nCulture\nHaiti has a lasting and unique cultural identity, blending traditional French and African customs, mixed with sizable acquirements from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures [398]\n\n\nArt\nHaitian art is distinctive, particularly through its paintings and sculptures [398] [399] [400] Brilliant colors, naïve perspectives, and sly humor characterize Haitian art Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, foods, landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism [citation needed]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nHaitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled here It reflects French, African and Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola, and minor native Taino influences Styles of music unique to Haitian culture include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions, Rara parading music, Twoubadou ballads, mini-jazz rock bands, Rasin movement, Hip hop kreyòl, méringue, [403] and compas Youth attend parties at nightclubs called discos, and attend Bal (ball, as in a formal dance).\n\n\nLiterature\nHaiti has always been a literary nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition The French colonial experience established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production However, since the 18th century there has been a sustained effort to write in Haitian Creole The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole [406] In 1975, Franketienne was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of Dezafi, the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole [407] Other well known Haitian authors include Jean Price-Mars, Jacques Roumain, Jacques Stephen Alexis, Marie Vieux-Chauvet, Pierre Clitandre, René Depestre, Edwidge Danticat, Lyonel Trouillot and Dany Laferrière.\n\n\nCinema\nHaiti has a small though growing cinema industry Well-known directors working primarily in documentary film-making include Raoul Peck and Arnold Antonin Directors producing fictional films include Patricia Benoît, Wilkenson Bruna and Richard Senecal.\n\n\nCuisine\nHaiti is famous for its creole cuisine (related to Cajun cuisine), and its soup joumou [408]\n\n\nArchitecture\nMonuments include the Sans-Souci Palace and the Citadelle Laferrière, inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1982 [409] Situated in the Northern Massif du Nord, in the National History Park, the structures date from the early 19th century [410] The buildings were among the first built after Haiti's independence from France.\nThe Citadelle Laferrière, the largest fortress in the Americas, is located in northern Haiti It was built between 1805 and 1820 and is today referred to by some Haitians as the eighth wonder of the world [108]\n\n\nMuseums\nThe anchor of Christopher Columbus's largest ship, the Santa María rests in the Musée du Panthéon National Haïtien (MUPANAH), in Port-au-Prince [412]\n\n\nFolklore and mythology\nHaiti is known for its folklore traditions [413] Much of this is rooted in Haitian Vodou tradition Belief in zombies is also common [414] Other folkloric creatures include the lougarou [414]\n\n\nNational holidays and festivals\nThe Haitian Carnival has been one of the most popular carnivals in the Caribbean In 2010, the government decided to stage the event in a different city outside Port-au-Prince every year [415] [416] The National Carnival follows the popular Jacmel Carnival, which takes place a week earlier in February or March [415]\n\n\nSports\nFootball (soccer) is the most popular sport in Haiti with hundreds of small clubs competing at the local level Basketball and baseball are growing in popularity [419] [420] Stade Sylvio Cator is the multi-purpose stadium in Port-au-Prince, currently used mostly for association football matches In 1974, the Haiti national football team were only the second Caribbean team to make the World Cup The national team won the 2007 Caribbean Nations Cup [421]\n\n\nSee also\nGovernment\n\n\nNotes\nGovernment\n\n\nReferences\nGovernment\n\n\nFurther

by area and the most populous French-speaking country in the world. The country has a rich and diverse culture, shaped by its history, geography, and the people who have inhabited it over the centuries. From the indigenous Taino people to the African slaves who were brought to the island, and from the French colonizers to the Haitian revolutionaries, Haiti has been a melting pot of cultures and influences.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Haiti\" comes from the indigenous Taino language and means \"land of high mountains\". This was the native name for the entire island of Hispaniola, which the Taino people inhabited before the arrival of Europeans. After Haiti declared its independence from France in 1804, the name was restored as the official name of the country, in tribute to its Amerindian predecessors.\n\n**History**\n\nThe island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths, has been inhabited since around 600 AD by the indigenous Taino people. The Taino were a peaceful and organized people who lived in small villages and were skilled farmers and fishermen. They were also skilled craftsmen, producing beautiful pottery and textiles.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Spanish arrived on the island, and the Taino were subjected to forced labor, enslavement, and violence. Many Taino died from diseases brought over by the Europeans, such as smallpox and influenza, to which they had no immunity.\n\nThe French arrived on the island in the 17th century and established a colony, which they named Saint-Domingue. The French brought enslaved Africans to the island to work on sugar plantations, and the slave trade became a major industry in Haiti.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Haitian Revolution began, led by Toussaint Louverture, a former slave who had become a military leader. The revolution was a long and brutal struggle, with many battles and massacres. In 1804, Haiti declared its independence from France, becoming the first independent nation in the Caribbean.\n\n**Pre-Columbian Era**\n\nThe pre-Columbian era in Haiti refers to the period before the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the European colonizers. The indigenous Taino people inhabited the island for thousands of years, developing a complex and sophisticated society.\n\nThe Taino were skilled farmers, growing crops such as cassava, yams, and sweet potatoes. They were also skilled fishermen, catching fish and other seafood in the waters surrounding the island.\n\nThe Taino were a peaceful and organized people, living in small villages and governed by a system of chiefs and councils. They were also skilled craftsmen, producing beautiful pottery, textiles, and other items.\n\n**Colonial Era**\n\nThe colonial era in Haiti began in the 15th century, when the Spanish arrived on the island. The Span", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Haiti\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nHaiti (also earlier Hayti) [d] comes from the indigenous Taíno language and means \"land of high mountains\"; [41] it was the native name [e] for the entire island of Hispaniola The name was restored by Haitian revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines as the official name of independent Saint-Domingue, as a tribute to the Amerindian predecessors [45]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe island of Hispaniola, of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths, [18] [19] has been inhabited since around 6,000 years ago by Native Americans who are thought to have arrived from Central or northern South America These Archaic Age people are thought to have been largely hunter gatherers During the 1st millennium BC, the Arawakan-speaking ancestors of the Taino people began to migrate into the Caribbean Unlike the Archaic peoples, they practiced the intensive production of pottery and agriculture The earliest evidence of the ancestors of the Taino people on Hispaniola is the Ostionoid culture, which dates to around 600 AD [50] \n\nPre-Columbian era\n\nThe island of

for the Crown of Castile Nineteen days later, his ship the Santa María ran aground near the present site of Cap-Haïtien Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of La Navidad on 25 December 1492 [55] Relations with the native peoples, initially good, broke down and the settlers were later killed by the Taíno [56]\n\n\nSpanish rule (1492–1625)\nNavigator Christopher Columbus landed in Haiti on 6 December 1492, in an area that he named Môle-Saint-Nicolas, [54] and claimed the island for the Crown of Castile Nineteen days later, his ship the Santa María ran aground near the present site of Cap-Haïtien Columbus left 39 men on the island, who founded the settlement of La Navidad on 25 December 1492 [55] Relations with the native peoples, initially good, broke down and the settlers were later killed by the Taíno [56]\n\n\nFrench rule (1625–1804)\nFrance received the western third and subsequently named it Saint-Domingue, the French equivalent of Santo Domingo, the Spanish colony on Hispaniola [66] The French set about creating sugar and coffee plantations, worked by vast numbers of those enslaved imported from Africa, and Saint-Domingue grew to become their richest colonial possession, [65] [55] generating 40% of France’s foreign trade and doubling the wealth generation of all of England’s colonies, combined [67]\n\n\nHaitian Revolution (1791–1804)\nInspired by the French Revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man, the French settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more civil rights [70] Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by Vincent Ogé, resulting in his capture, torture and execution [55] Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern Haiti under the leadership of Toussaint Louverture inspired by the Vodou houngan (priest) Boukman, and backed by the Spanish in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony [55]\n\n\nIndependent Haiti\nThe independence of Saint-Domingue was proclaimed under the native name 'Haiti' by Jean-Jacques Dessalines on 1 January 1804 in Gonaïves [96] [97] and he was proclaimed \"Emperor for Life\" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops [98] Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others [99] However, once in power, he ordered the genocide of nearly all the remaining white men, women, children; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population [100] Only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared: Polish soldiers, the majority of whom had deserted from the French army and fought alongside the Haitian rebels; the small group of German colonists invited to the north-west region; and a group of medical doctors and professionals [101] Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men [102]\n\n\nFirst Empire (1804–1806)\nThe independence of Saint-Domingue was proclaimed under the native name 'Haiti' by Jean-Jacques Dessalines on 1 January 1804 in Gonaïves [96] [97] and he was proclaimed \"Emperor for Life\" as Emperor Jacques I by his troops [98] Dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others [99] However, once in power, he ordered the genocide of nearly all the remaining white men, women, children; between January and April 1804, 3,000 to 5,000 whites were killed, including those who had been friendly and sympathetic to the black population [100] Only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared: Polish soldiers, the majority of whom had deserted from the French army and fought alongside the Haitian rebels; the small group of German colonists invited to the north-west region; and a group of medical doctors and professionals [101] Reportedly, people with connections to officers in the Haitian army were also spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men [102]\n\n\nState of Haiti, Kingdom of Haiti and the Republic (1806–1820)\nAfter Dessalines' death Haiti became split into two, with the Kingdom of Haiti in the north directed by Henri Christophe, later declaring himself Henri I, and a republic in the south centered on Port-au-Prince, directed by Alexandre Pétion, an homme de couleur [109] [110] [111] [112] Pétion's republic was less absolutist, and he initiated a series of land reforms which benefited the peasant class [88] President Pétion also gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader Simón Bolívar, which were critical in enabling him to liberate the Viceroyalty of New Granada [113] Meanwhile, the French, who had managed to maintain a precarious control of eastern Hispaniola, were defeated by insurgents led by Juan Sánchez Ramírez, with the area returning to Spanish rule in 1809 following the Battle of Palo Hincado [114]\n\n\nUnification of Hispaniola (1821–1844)\nBeginning in 1821, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, also an homme de couleur and successor to Pétion, reunified the island following the suicide of Henry Christophe [55] [115] After Santo Domingo declared its independence from Spain on 30 November 1821, Boyer invaded, seeking to unite the entire island by force and ending slavery in Santo Domingo [116]\n\n\nLoss of the Spanish portion of the island\nAfter losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with Charles Rivière-Hérard replacing him as president [55] Nationalist Dominican forces in eastern Hispaniola led by Juan Pablo Duarte seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844 [55] The Haitian forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending Haitian rule of eastern Hispaniola In March Rivière-Hérard attempted to reimpose his authority, but the Dominicans inflicted heavy losses [124] Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged general Philippe Guerrier, who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844 [citation needed]\n\n\nSecond Empire (1849–1859)\nOn 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General Faustin Soulouque [55] During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence [124] But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security [124] Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the French Government could ratify the treaty [124]\n\n\nLate 19th century–early 20th century\nThe period following Soulouque's overthrow down to the turn of the century was a turbulent one for Haiti, with repeated bouts of political instability President Geffrard was overthrown in a coup in 1867, [127] as was his successor, Sylvain Salnave, in 1869 [128] Under the Presidency of Michel Domingue (1874–76) relations with the Dominican Republic were dramatically improved by the signing of a treaty, in which both parties acknowledged the independence of the other Some modernisation of the economy and infrastructure also occurred in this period, especially under the Presidencies of Lysius Salomon (1879–1888) and Florvil Hyppolite (1889–1896) [129]\n\n\nUnited States occupation (1915–1934)\nGermany increased its influence in Haiti in this period, with a small community of German settlers wielding disproportionate influence in Haiti's economy [137] [138] The German influence prompted anxieties in the United States, who had also invested heavily in the country, and whose government defended their right to oppose foreign interference in the Americas under the Monroe Doctrine [55] [138] In December 1914, the Americans removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and to enable the debt to be repaid [139]\n\n\nPost-occupation era (1934–1957)\nAfter U.S forces left in 1934, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo used anti-Haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool In an event that became known as the Parsley Massacre, he ordered his army to kill Haitians living on the Dominican side of the border [151] [152] Few bullets were used; instead, 20,000–30,000 Haitians were bludgeoned and bayoneted, then herded into the sea, where sharks finished what Trujillo had begun [153] The indiscriminate massacre occurred over a period of five days.\n\n\nDuvalier dynasty (1957–1986)\nIn 1956–57 Haiti underwent severe political turmoil; Magloire was forced to resign and leave the country in 1956 and he was followed by four short-lived presidencies [55] In the September 1957 election François Duvalier was elected President of Haiti Known as 'Papa Doc' and initially popular, Duvalier remained President until his death in 1971 [162] He advanced black interests in the public sector, where over time, people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite [55] [163] Not trusting the army, despite his frequent purges of officers deemed disloyal, Duvalier created a private militia known as Tontons Macoutes (\"Bogeymen\"), which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponents [162] [164] In 1964 Duvalier proclaimed himself 'President for Life'; an uprising against his rule that year in Jérémie was violently suppressed, with the ringleaders publicly executed and hundreds of mixed-raced citizens in the town killed [162] The bulk of the educated and professional class began leaving the country, and corruption became widespread [55] [162] Duvalier sought to create a personality cult, identifying himself with Baron Samedi, one of the loa (or lwa), or spirits, of Haitian Vodou Despite the well-publicized abuses under his rule, Duvalier's firm anti-Communism earned him the support of the Americans, who furnished the country with aid [162] [165]\n\n\nPost-Duvalier era (1986–2004)\nFollowing Duvalier's departure, army leader General Henri Namphy headed a new National Governing Council [55] Elections scheduled for November 1987 were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and Tontons Macoutes [172] [55] Fraudulent elections followed in 1988, in which only 4% of the citizenry voted [173] [55] The newly elected president, Leslie Manigat, was then overthrown some months later in the June 1988 Haitian coup d'état [55] [174]\n\n\nPost-Aristide era (2004–present)\nAmidst the continuing political chaos, a series of natural disasters hit Haiti In 2004 Tropical Storm Jeanne skimmed the north coast, leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and mudslides, mostly in the city of Gonaïves [196] In 2008 Haiti was again struck by tropical storms; Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Ike all produced heavy winds and rain, resulting in 331 deaths and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid [197] The state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008 [198] [199] [55]\n\n\nGeography\nHaiti forms the western three-eighths of Hispaniola, the second largest island in the Greater Antilles At 27,750 km2 (10,710 sq mi) Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind Cuba and the Dominican Republic, the latter sharing a 360-kilometer (224 mi) border with Haiti The country has a roughly horseshoe shape and because of this it has a disproportionately long coastline, second in length (1,771 km or 1,100 mi) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles [233] [234]\n\n\nClimate\nHaiti's climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude [235] Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of 23 °C (73.4 °F) to an average maximum of 31 °C (87.8 °F); in July, from 25–35 °C (77–95 °F) The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains Haiti's dry season occurs from November to January.\n\n\nGeology\nThere are blind thrust faults associated with the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault system over which Haiti lies [240] After the earthquake of 2010, there was no evidence of surface rupture and geologists' findings were based on seismological, geological and ground deformation data [241]\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation have caused periodic and severe flooding, as experienced, for example, on 17 September 2004 Earlier in May that year, floods had killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic [247]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nHaiti is home to four ecoregions: Hispaniolan moist forests, Hispaniolan dry forests, Hispaniolan pine forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves [251]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe government of Haiti is a semi-presidential republic, a multiparty system wherein the president of Haiti is head of state and elected directly by popular elections held every five years [55] [255] The prime minister of Haiti acts as head of government and is appointed by the president, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly [55] Executive power is exercised by the president and prime minister who together constitute the government [256]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAdministratively, Haiti is divided into ten departments [235] The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.\n\n\nForeign relations\nHaiti is a member of a wide range of international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations, CARICOM, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, International Monetary Fund, Organisation of American States, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, OPANAL and the World Trade Organization [235]\n\n\nMilitary\nHaiti has a strong military history dating to the pre-independence struggle The Indigenous Army is essential in the construction of the state the management of land and public finances Up to the 20th century, every Haitian president was an officer in the army During the US intervention, the army was remodeled as Gendarmerie d'Haiti and later on as Force Armée d'Haiti (FAdH) In the early 1990s, the army was unconstitutionally decommissioned and replaced by the Haitian National Police (PNH) In 2018, Président Jovenel Moise reactivated the FAdH [citation needed]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\nThe legal system is based on a modified version of the Napoleonic Code [268] [55]\n\n\nHaitian penitentiary system\nPort-au-Prince penitentiary is home to half of Haiti's prisoners The prison has a capacity of 1,200 detainees but as of November 2017 [update] the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 363% occupancy level [286] The inability to receive sufficient funds has caused deadly cases of malnutrition, combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis [286]\n\n\nEconomy\nHaiti's per capita GDP is $1,800 and its GDP is $19.97 billion (2017 estimates) [235] The country uses the Haitian gourde as its currency Despite its tourism industry, Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the Americas, with corruption, political instability, poor infrastructure, lack of health care and lack of education cited as the main causes [235] Unemployment is high and many Haitians seek to emigrate Trade declined dramatically after the 2010 earthquake and subsequent outbreak of cholera, with the country's purchasing power parity GDP falling by 8% (from US$12.15 billion to US$11.18 billion) [4] Haiti ranked 145th of 182 countries in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Index, with 57.3% of the population being deprived in at least three of the HDI's poverty measures [290]\n\n\nForeign aid\nHaiti received more than US$4 billion in aid from 1990 to 2003, including US$1.5 billion from the United States [296] The largest donor is the US, followed by Canada and the European Union [297] In January 2010, following the earthquake, US President Barack Obama promised US$1.15 billion in assistance [298] The European Union pledged more than €400 million (US$616 million) [299] Neighboring Dominican Republic has also provided extensive humanitarian aid to Haiti, including the funding and construction of a public university, [300] human capital, free healthcare services in the border region, and logistical support after the 2010 earthquake [301]\n\n\nTrade\nAccording to the 2015 CIA World Factbook, Haiti's main import partners are: Dominican Republic 35%, US 26.8%, Netherlands Antilles 8.7%, China 7% (est 2013) Haiti's main export partner is the US 83.5% (est 2013) [303] Haiti had a trade deficit of US$3 billion in 2011, or 41% of GDP [304]\n\n\nEnergy\nHaiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with Petrocaribe for much of its energy requirements In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources [305]\n\n\nPersonal income\nHaiti suffers from a shortage of skilled labor, widespread unemployment, and underemployment Most Haitians in the labor force have informal jobs Three-quarters of the population lives on US$2 or less per day [311]\n\n\nReal estate\nIn rural areas, people often live in wooden huts with corrugated iron roofs Outhouses are located in back of the huts In Port-au-Prince, colorful shantytowns surround the central city and go up the mountainsides [316]\n\n\nAgriculture\nHaiti is the world's leading producer of vetiver, a root plant used to make luxury perfumes, essential oils and fragrances, providing for half the world's supply [317] [318] [319] Roughly 40–50% of Haitians work in the agricultural sector [235] [320] However, according to soil surveys by the United States Department of Agriculture in the early 1980s, only 11.3 percent of the land was highly suitable for crops Haiti relies upon imports for half its food needs and 80% of its rice [320]\n\n\nCurrency\nThe Haitian gourde (HTG) is the national currency The \"Haitian dollar\" equates to 5 gourdes (goud) [citation needed] The vast majority of the business sector and individuals will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred Locals may refer to the USD as \"dollar américain\" (dola ameriken) or \"dollar US\" (pronounced oo-es) [323]\n\n\nTourism\nThe tourism market in Haiti is undeveloped and the government is heavily promoting this sector Haiti has many of the features that attract tourists to other Caribbean destinations, such as white sand beaches, mountainous scenery and a year-round warm climate However, the country's poor image overseas, at times exaggerated, has hampered the development of this sector [55] In 2014, the country received 1,250,000 tourists (mostly from cruise ships), and the industry generated US$200 million in 2014 [citation needed]\n\n\nCaracol Industrial Park\nOn 21 October 2012, Haitian President Michel Martelly, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, Ben Stiller and Sean Penn inaugurated the 240-hectare (600-acre) Caracol industrial park, the largest in the Caribbean [330] The project cost US$300 million and included a 10-megawatt power plant, a water-treatment plant and worker housing [330] The plan for the park pre-dated the 2010 earthquake but was fast-tracked as part of US foreign aid strategy to help Haiti recover [331] The park was part of a \"master plan\" for Haiti's North and North-East departments, including the expansion of the Cap-Haïtien International Airport to accommodate large international flights, the construction of an international seaport in Fort-Liberté and the opening of the $50 million Roi Henri Christophe Campus of a new university in Limonade (near Cap-Haïtien) on 12 January 2012 [332]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nHaiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other The northern highway, Route Nationale No 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien The southern highway, Route Nationale No 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather [55]\n\n\nTransportation\nHaiti

towns of Montrouis and Gonaïves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port Cap-Haïtien The southern highway, Route Nationale No 2, links Port-au-Prince with Les Cayes via Léogâne and Petit-Goâve The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather [55]\n\n\nAirports\nToussaint Louverture International Airport, located ten kilometers (six miles) north-northeast of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of Tabarre, is the primary hub for entry and exit into the country It has Haiti's main jetway, and along with Cap-Haïtien International Airport handles the vast majority of the country's international flights Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by regional airlines and private aircraft [citation needed]\n\n\nBus service\nTap tap buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as shared taxis The \"tap tap\" name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off [341] These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art [342]\n\n\nCommunications\nIn Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) –  an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013 [343]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nHaiti faces key challenges in the water supply and sanitation\nsector Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions Foreign and Haitian NGOs play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2018, Haiti's population was estimated to be about 10,788,000 [235] In 2006, half of the population was younger than age 20 [344] In 1950, the first formal census gave a total population of 3.1 million [345] Haiti averages approximately 350 people per square kilometer (910 people/sq mi), with its population concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys.\n\n\nRacial discrimination\nUnder colonial rule, Haitian mulattoes were generally privileged above the black majority, though they possessed fewer rights than the white population Following the country's independence, they became the nation's social elite Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes During this time, the enslaved persons and the affranchis were given limited opportunities toward education, income, and occupations, but even after gaining independence, the social structure remains a legacy today as the disparity between the upper and lower classes have not been reformed significantly since the colonial days [353] Making up 5% of the nation's population, mulattoes have retained their preeminence, evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in Haiti [354] As a result, the elite class today consists of a small group of influential people who are generally light in color [355]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Haiti according to the Pew Research Center (2010) [356]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe two official languages of Haiti are French and Haitian Creole French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians [364] [365] It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church Masses Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an official language; the other French-speaking areas are all overseas départements, or collectivités, of France, such as French Guiana Haitian Creole is spoken by nearly all of the Haitian population French, the base language for Haitian Creole, is popular among the Haitian elite and upper classes French is also popular in the business sector, and to a far lesser degree, English due to American influence Spanish is spoken by some Haitians who live along the Haitian-Dominican border [366] English and Spanish may also be spoken by Haitian deportees from the United States and various Latin American countries Overall, about 90–95% of Haitians only speak Haitian Creole and French fluently, with over half only knowing Creole [367]\n\n\nEmigration\nThere is a large Haitian diaspora community, predominantly based in the US and Canada, France, and the wealthier Caribbean islands [citation needed]\n\n\nEducation\nThe educational system of Haiti is based on the French system Higher education, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, [378] is provided by universities and other public and private institutions [379]\n\n\nHealth\nAs of 2012 [update], 60% of children in Haiti under the age of 10 were vaccinated, [384] [385] compared to 93–95% in other countries [386] Recently there have been mass vaccination campaigns claiming to vaccinate as many as 91% of a target population against specific diseases (measles and rubella in this case) [387] Most people have no transportation or access to Haitian hospitals [388]\n\n\nLargest cities\nHaiti has a lasting and unique cultural identity, blending traditional French and African customs, mixed with sizable acquirements from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures [398]\n\n\nCulture\nHaiti has a lasting and unique cultural identity, blending traditional French and African customs, mixed with sizable acquirements from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures [398]\n\n\nArt\nHaitian art is distinctive, particularly through its paintings and sculptures [398] [399] [400] Brilliant colors, naïve perspectives, and sly humor characterize Haitian art Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, foods, landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism [citation needed]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nHaitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled here It reflects French, African and Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola, and minor native Taino influences Styles of music unique to Haitian culture include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions, Rara parading music, Twoubadou ballads, mini-jazz rock bands, Rasin movement, Hip hop kreyòl, méringue, [403] and compas Youth attend parties at nightclubs called discos, and attend Bal (ball, as in a formal dance).\n\n\nLiterature\nHaiti has always

children born in 1982 were entering kindergarten, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the impending new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000 [24] They wrote about the cohort in their books Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991) [25] and Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation (2000) [24]\n\n\nDate and age range definitions\nOxford Living Dictionaries describes a Millennial as a person \"born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.\" [44] Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Millennial as \"a person born in the 1980s or 1990s\" [45] More detailed definitions in use are as follows:\n\n\nPsychology\nPsychologist Jean Twenge, the author of the 2006 book Generation Me, considers millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls \"Generation Me\" [89] Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and tolerance, but also describes a sense of entitlement and narcissism, based on NPI surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials [quantify] compared to preceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties [90] [91] Psychologist Jeffrey Arnett of Clark University, Worcester has criticized Twenge's research on narcissism among millennials, stating \"I think she is vastly misinterpreting or over-interpreting the data, and I think it's destructive\" [92] He doubts that the Narcissistic Personality Inventory really measures narcissism at all Arnett says that not only are millennials less narcissistic, they're \"an exceptionally generous generation that holds great promise for improving the world\" [93] A study published in 2017 in the journal Psychological Science found a small decline in narcissism among young people since the 1990s [94] [95]\n\n\nCognitive abilities\nIntelligence researcher James R Flynn discovered that back in the 1950s, the gap between the vocabulary levels of adults and children was much smaller than it is in the early twenty-first century Between 1953 and 2006, adult gains on the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler IQ test were 17.4 points whereas the corresponding gains for children were only 4 He asserted that some of the reasons for this are the surge in interest in higher education and cultural changes The number of Americans pursuing tertiary qualifications and cognitively demanding jobs has risen significantly since the 1950s This boosted the level of vocabulary among adults Back in the 1950s, children generally imitated their parents and adopted their vocabulary This was no longer the case in the 2000s, when teenagers often developed their own subculture and as such were less likely to use adult-level vocabulary on their essays [101]\n\n\nCultural identity\nComputer games and computer culture has  [sic] led to a decrease in reading books The tendency for teachers to now \"teach to the test\" has also led to a decrease in the capacity to think in lateral ways.\n\n\nDemographics\nChinese millennials are commonly called the post-80s and post-90s generations At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by University of Southern California's US–China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials Findings included millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism [122] Due to the one-child policy introduced in the late 1970s, one-child households have become the norm in China, leading to rapid population aging, especially in the cities where the costs of living are much higher than in the countryside [123]\n\n\nAsia\nChinese millennials are commonly called the post-80s and post-90s

[123]\n\n\nEurope\nFrom about 1750 to 1950, most of Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates By the late 1960s and 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction\", such a rebound came only for a few countries Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, it returned to replacement level only in Sweden (reaching a TFR of 2.14 in 1990, up from 1.68 in 1980), [130] along with Ireland [131] and Iceland; [132] the bump in Sweden was largely due to improving economic output and the generous, far-reaching family benefits granted by the Nordic welfare system, [133] while in France it was mostly driven by older women realizing their dreams of motherhood For Sweden, the increase in the fertility rate came with a rise in the birth rate (going from 11.7 in 1980 to 14.5 in 1990), [134] which slowed down and then stopped for a brief period to the aging of the Swedish population [135] caused by the decline in birth rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s To this day, France and Sweden still have higher fertility rates than most of Europe, and both almost reached replacement level in 2010 (2.03 [136] and 1.98 [134] respectively).\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989 Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a quarter in the late 1980s The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies Under the new funding scheme, the Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students [169]\n\n\nNorth America\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002 For comparison, the number of young people attending university was 44% in 1986 [173] By the 2020s, 39% of millennials had at least a bachelor's degree, more than the Baby Boomers at 25%, the Economist reports [174]\n\n\nEconomic prospects and trends\nTrends suggest developments in artificial intelligence and robotics will not result in mass unemployment, but can actually create high-skilled jobs However, in order to take advantage of this situation, people need to hone skills that machines have not yet mastered, such as teamwork [160] [161]\n\n\nEducation\nFrom the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap between them and the developed world Hence Westerners lost their relative advantage in education, as the world saw more people with high-school diplomas than ever before The number of people with Bachelor's degree and advanced degrees grew significantly as well Westerners who only passed secondary school had their income cut in real terms during that same period while those with university degrees had incomes that barely increased on average The fact that many jobs are suitable for remote work due to modern technology further eroded the relative advantage of education in the Western world, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization [8]\n\n\nGlobal trends\nFrom the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap

world, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization [8]\n\n\nIn Europe\nIn Sweden, universities are tuition-free, as is the case in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland However, Swedish students typically graduate very indebted due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013 In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60% Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S In the 2008–09 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the Centrala Studiestödsnämnden (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60) In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education In the 2008–09 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995 In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter [166]\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989 Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a

America\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002 For comparison, the number of young people attending university was 44% in 1986 [173] By the 2020s, 39% of millennials had at least a bachelor's degree, more than the Baby Boomers at 25%, the Economist reports [174]\n\n\nHistorical knowledge\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S adults) surveyed did not know what Auschwitz was, [188] while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2 million Jews or fewer were killed during the Holocaust, and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust [189] Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the Baltic states, which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single Nazi concentration camp or ghetto in German-occupied Europe [190] [191] However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened [192]\n\n\nHealth and welfare\nAccording to a 2018 report from Cancer Research UK, millennials in the United Kingdom are on track to have the highest rates of overweight and obesity, with current data trends indicating millennials will overtake the Baby boomer generation in this regard, making millennials the heaviest generation since current records began Cancer Research UK reports that more than 70% of millennials will be overweight or obese by ages 35–45, in comparison to 50% of Baby boomers who were overweight or obese at the same ages [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nSports and fitness\nFewer American millennials follow sports than their Generation X predecessors, [206] with a McKinsey survey finding that 38 percent of millennials in contrast to 45 percent of Generation X are committed sports fans [207] However, the trend is not uniform across all sports; the gap disappears for National Basketball Association, Ultimate Fighting Championship, English Premier League and college sports [206] For example, a survey in 2013 found that engagement with mixed martial arts had increased in the 21st century and was more popular than boxing and wrestling for Americans aged 18 to 34 years old, in contrast to those aged 35 and over who preferred boxing [208] In the United States, while the popularity of American football and the National Football League has declined among millennials, the popularity of Association football and Major League Soccer has increased more among millennials than for any other generation, and as of 2018 was the second most popular sport among those aged 18 to 34 [209] [210]\n\n\nPolitical views and participation\nMillennials are reshaping political discourse, showing evolving attitudes towards governance, social issues, and economic policies Their increasing political participation and distinct generational identity signify a transformative phase in contemporary politics, with potential long-term implications for national and global political trends.\n\n\nPreferred modes of transport\nMillennials in the U.S were initially not keen on getting a driver's license or owning a vehicle thanks to new licensing laws and the state of the economy when they came of age, but the oldest among them have already begun buying cars in great numbers In 2016, millennials purchased more cars and trucks than any living generation except the Baby Boomers; in fact, millennials overtook Baby Boomers in car ownership in California that year [223] A working paper by economists Christopher Knittel and Elizabeth Murphy then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed data from the U.S Department of Transportation's National Household Transportation Survey, the U.S Census Bureau, and American Community Survey in order to compare the driving habits of the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and the oldest millennials (born between 1980 and 1984) That found that on the surface, the popular story is true: American millennials on average own 0.4 fewer cars than their elders But when various factors—including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location—were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services [224]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nMillennials often describe themselves as \"spiritual but not religious\" and will sometimes turn to astrology, meditation or mindfulness techniques possibly to seek meaning or a sense of control [21] According to 2015 analysis of the European Values Study in the Handbook of Children and Youth Studies \"the majority of young respondents in Europe claimed that they belonged to a Christian denomination\", and \"in most countries, the majority of young people believe in God\" [228] However, according to the same analysis a \"dramatic decline\" in religious affiliation among young respondents happened in Great Britain, Sweden, France, Italy and Denmark By contrast an increase in religious affiliation happened among young respondents in Russia, Ukraine, and Romania [228]\n\n\nSocial tendencies\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \"millennials in adulthood\" are \"detached from institutions and networked with friends\" The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment [238] [239]\n\n\nSocial circles\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \"millennials in adulthood\" are \"detached from institutions and networked with friends\" The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment [238] [239]\n\n\nCourtship behavior\n\nIn many countries, people have since the mid-twentieth century been increasingly looking for mates of the same socioeconomic status and educational attainment The phenomenon of preferring mates with characteristics similar to one's own is known as assortative mating Part of the reason growing economic and educational assortative mating was economic in nature Innovations which became commercially available in the late twentieth century such as the washing machine and frozen food reduced the amount of time people needed to spend on housework, which diminished the importance of domestic skills [240] Moreover, by the early 2000s, it was less feasible for a couple with one spouse having no more than a high-school diploma to earn about the national average; on the other hand, couples both of whom had at least a bachelor's degree could expect to make a significant amount above the national average People thus had a clear economic incentive to seek out a mate with at least as high a level of education in order to maximize their potential income [241] Another incentive for this kind of assortative mating lies in the future of the offspring People have since the mid-twentieth century increasingly wanted intelligent and well-educated children, and marrying bright people who make a lot of money goes a long way in achieving that goal [240] [242] Couples in the early twenty-first century tend to hold egalitarian rather than traditional views on gender roles Modern marriage is more about companionship rather than bread-winning for the man and homemaking for the woman [242] American and Chinese youths are increasingly choosing whether or not to marry according to their personal preferences rather than family, societal, or religious expectations [242] [13]\n\nFamily life and offspring\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, the number of American mothers who never married ballooned between 1968, when they were extremely rare, and 2008, when they became much more common, especially among the less educated In particular, in 2008, the number of mothers who never married with at least 16 years of education was 3.3%, compared to 20.1% of those who never graduated from high school Unintended pregnancies were also higher among the less educated [249]\n\n\nWorkplace attitudes\nIn 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials \"Trophy Kids\", [268] a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments [268] Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace [269] Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations [270] Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggesting there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being \"more practical\" and \"more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime\" which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 [271]\n\n\nUse of digital technology\nMarc Prensky coined the term \"digital native\" to describe \"K through college\" students in 2001, explaining they \"represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology\" [7] In their 2007 book Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know About Today's Students, authors Reynol Junco and Jeanna Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of college students They found that Net Generation college students, born 1982 onwards, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a computer, 94% owned a mobile phone, and 56% owned an MP3 player They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used instant messaging, 92% of those reported multitasking while instant messaging, 40% of them used television to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the Internet as their primary news source [279] [280]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Millennials**\n\nThe Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are a demographic cohort born between 1981 and 1996. They are the successors to the Baby Boomers and the predecessors to Generation Z. The term \"Millennial\" was coined by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, who first used it in their 1987 book \"Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069\".\n\n**Date and Age Range Definitions**\n\nThe exact birth years that define the Millennials are not universally agreed upon. Oxford Living Dictionaries describes a Millennial as a person \"born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines Millennial as \"a person born in the 1980s or 1990s.\" Some researchers and experts use more detailed definitions, such as those proposed by Jean Twenge, who considers Millennials to be people born from 1979 to 2000.\n\n**Psychology**\n\nPsychologist Jean Twenge considers Millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls \"Generation Me\".

Flynn attributed some of the reasons for this to the surge in interest in higher education and cultural changes.\n\n**Cultural Identity**\n\nThe rise of computer games and computer culture has led to a decrease in reading books. Additionally, the tendency for teachers to now \"teach to the test\" has also led to a decrease in the capacity to think in lateral ways. This shift in cultural identity has had a profound impact on the way Millennials think and interact with the world.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe demographics of the Millennials are diverse and complex. In China, Millennials are commonly referred to as the \"post-80s\" and \"post-90s\" generations. A 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by the University of Southern California's US–China Institute examined the Millennials in China and contrasted them with American Millennials. The findings included Millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child-raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism.\n\n**Asia**\n\nIn Asia, the Millennials are a significant demographic cohort.

From about 1750 to 1950, most of Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. However, by the late 1960s and 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children. Some European countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, experienced a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) in the late twentieth century, but this returned to replacement level only in Sweden, Ireland, and Iceland.\n\n**Oceania**\n\nIn Australia, the Millennials are a significant demographic cohort.

pursuing tertiary qualifications and cognitively demanding jobs has risen significantly since the 1950s This boosted the level of vocabulary among adults Back in the 1950s, children generally imitated their parents and adopted their vocabulary This was no longer the case in the 2000s, when teenagers often developed their own subculture and as such were less likely to use adult-level vocabulary on their essays [101]\n\n\nCultural identity\nComputer games and computer culture has  [sic] led to a decrease in reading books The tendency for teachers to now \"teach to the test\" has also led to a decrease in the capacity to think in lateral ways.\n\n\nDemographics\nChinese millennials are commonly called the post-80s and post-90s generations At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by University of Southern California's US–China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials Findings included millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism [122] Due to the one-child policy introduced in the late 1970s, one-child households have become the norm in China, leading to rapid population aging, especially in the cities where the costs of living are much higher than in the countryside [123]\n\n\nAsia\nChinese millennials are commonly called

1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction\", such a rebound came only for a few countries Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, it returned to replacement level only in Sweden (reaching a TFR of 2.14 in 1990, up from 1.68 in 1980), [130] along with Ireland [131] and Iceland; [132] the bump in Sweden was largely due to improving economic output and the generous, far-reaching family benefits granted by the Nordic welfare system, [133] while in France it was mostly driven by older women realizing their dreams of motherhood For Sweden, the increase in the fertility rate came with a rise in the birth rate (going from 11.7 in 1980 to 14.5 in 1990), [134] which slowed down and then stopped for a brief period to the aging of the Swedish population [135] caused by the decline in birth rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s To this day, France and Sweden still have higher fertility rates than most of Europe, and both almost reached replacement level in 2010 (2.03 [136] and 1.98 [134] respectively).\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989 Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a quarter in the late 1980s The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies Under the new funding scheme, the Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students [169]\n\n\nNorth America\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002 For comparison, the number of young people attending university was 44% in 1986 [173] By the 2020s, 39% of millennials had at least a bachelor's degree, more than the Baby Boomers at 25%, the Economist reports [174]\n\n\nEconomic prospects and trends\nTrends suggest developments in artificial intelligence and robotics will not result in mass unemployment, but can actually create high-skilled jobs However, in order to take advantage of this situation, people need to hone skills that machines have not yet mastered, such as teamwork [160] [161]\n\n\nEducation\nFrom the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap between them and the developed world Hence Westerners lost their relative advantage in education, as the world saw more people with high-school diplomas than ever before The number of people with Bachelor's degree and advanced degrees grew significantly as well Westerners who only passed secondary school had their income cut in real terms during that same period while those with university degrees had incomes that barely increased on average The fact that many jobs are suitable for remote work due to modern technology further eroded the relative advantage of education in the Western world, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization [8]\n\n\nGlobal trends\nFrom the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap between them and the developed world Hence Westerners lost their relative advantage in education, as the world saw more people with high-school diplomas than ever before The number of people with

degrees had incomes that barely increased on average The fact that many jobs are suitable for remote work due to modern technology further eroded the relative advantage of education in the Western world, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization [8]\n\n\nIn Europe\nIn Sweden, universities are tuition-free, as is the case in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland However, Swedish students typically graduate very indebted due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013 In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60% Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S In the 2008–09 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the Centrala Studiestödsnämnden (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60) In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education In the 2008–09 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995 In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter [166]\n\n\nOceania\nIn Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989 Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a

Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students [169]\n\n\nNorth America\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002 For comparison, the number of young people attending university was 44% in 1986 [173] By the 2020s, 39% of millennials had at least a bachelor's degree, more than the Baby Boomers at 25%, the Economist reports [174]\n\n\nHistorical knowledge\nA February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S adults) surveyed did not know what Auschwitz was, [188] while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2 million Jews or fewer were killed during the Holocaust, and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust [189] Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the Baltic states, which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single Nazi concentration camp or ghetto in German-occupied Europe [190] [191] However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened [192]\n\n\nHealth and welfare\nAccording to a 2018 report from Cancer Research UK, millennials in the United Kingdom are on track to have the highest rates of overweight and obesity, with current data trends indicating millennials will overtake the Baby boomer generation in this regard, making millennials the heaviest generation since current records began Cancer Research UK reports that more than 70% of millennials will be overweight or obese by ages 35–45, in comparison to 50% of Baby boomers who were overweight or obese at the same ages [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nSports and fitness\nFewer American millennials follow sports than their Generation X predecessors, [206] with a McKinsey survey finding that 38 percent of millennials in contrast to 45 percent of Generation X are committed sports fans [207] However, the trend is not uniform across all sports; the gap disappears for National Basketball Association, Ultimate Fighting Championship, English Premier League and college sports [206] For example, a survey in 2013 found that engagement with mixed martial arts had increased in the 21st century and was more popular than boxing and wrestling for Americans aged 18 to 34 years old, in contrast to those aged 35 and over who preferred boxing [208] In the United States, while the popularity of American football and the National Football League has declined among millennials, the popularity of Association football and Major League Soccer has increased more among millennials than for any other generation, and as of 2018 was the second most popular sport among those aged 18 to 34 [209] [210]\n\n\nPolitical views and participation\nMillennials are reshaping political discourse, showing evolving attitudes towards governance, social issues, and economic policies Their increasing political participation and distinct generational identity signify a transformative phase in contemporary politics, with potential long-term implications for national and global political trends.\n\n\nPreferred modes of transport\nMillennials in the U.S were initially not keen on getting a driver's license or owning a vehicle thanks to new licensing laws and the state of the economy when they came of age, but the oldest among them have already begun buying cars in great numbers In 2016, millennials purchased more cars and trucks than any living generation except the Baby Boomers; in fact, millennials overtook Baby Boomers in car ownership in California that year [223] A working paper by economists Christopher Knittel and Elizabeth Murphy then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed data from the U.S Department of Transportation's National Household Transportation Survey, the U.S Census Bureau, and American Community Survey in order to compare the driving habits of the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and the oldest millennials (born between 1980 and 1984) That found that on the surface, the popular story is true: American millennials on average own 0.4 fewer cars than their elders But when various factors—including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location—were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services [224]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nMillennials often describe themselves as \"spiritual but not religious\" and will sometimes turn to astrology, meditation or mindfulness techniques possibly to seek meaning or a sense of control [21] According to 2015 analysis of the European Values Study in the Handbook of Children and Youth Studies \"the majority of young respondents in Europe claimed that they belonged to a Christian denomination\", and \"in most countries, the majority of young people believe in God\" [228] However, according to the same analysis a \"dramatic decline\" in religious affiliation among young respondents happened in Great Britain, Sweden, France, Italy and Denmark By contrast an increase in religious affiliation happened among young respondents in Russia, Ukraine, and Romania [228]\n\n\nSocial tendencies\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \"millennials in adulthood\" are \"detached from institutions and networked with friends\" The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment [238] [239]\n\n\nSocial circles\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \"millennials in adulthood\" are \"detached from institutions and networked with friends\" The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the country's best years are ahead, though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment [238] [239]\n\n\nCourtship behavior\n\nIn many countries, people have since the mid-twentieth century been increasingly looking for mates of the same socioeconomic status and educational attainment The phenomenon of preferring mates with characteristics similar to one's own is known as assortative mating Part of the reason growing economic and educational assortative mating was economic in nature Innovations which became commercially available in the late twentieth century such as the washing machine and frozen food reduced the amount of time people needed to spend on housework, which diminished the importance of domestic skills [240] Moreover, by the early 2000s, it was less feasible for a couple with one spouse having no more than a high-school diploma to earn about the national average; on the other hand, couples both of whom had at least a bachelor's degree could expect to make a significant amount above the national average People thus had a clear economic incentive to seek out a mate with at least as high a level of education in order to maximize their potential income [241] Another incentive for this kind of assortative mating lies in the future of the offspring People have since the mid-twentieth century increasingly wanted intelligent and well-educated children, and marrying bright people who make a lot of money goes a long way in achieving that goal [240] [242] Couples in the early twenty-first century tend to hold egalitarian rather than traditional views on gender roles Modern marriage is more about companionship rather than bread-winning for the man and homemaking for the woman [242] American and Chinese youths are increasingly choosing whether or not to marry according to their personal preferences rather than family, societal, or religious expectations [242] [13]\n\nFamily life and offspring\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, the number of American mothers who never married ballooned between 1968, when they were extremely rare, and 2008, when they became much more common, especially among the less educated In particular, in 2008, the number of mothers who never married with at least 16 years of education was 3.3%, compared to 20.1% of those who never graduated from high school Unintended pregnancies were also higher among the less educated [249]\n\n\nWorkplace attitudes\nIn 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials \"Trophy Kids\", [268] a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments [268] Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace [269] Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations [270] Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggesting there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being \"more practical\" and \"more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime\" which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 [271]\n\n\nUse of digital technology\nMarc Prensky coined the term \"digital native\" to describe \"K through college\" students in 2001, explaining they \"represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology\" [7] In their 2007 book Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know About Today's Students, authors Reynol Junco and Jeanna Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of college students They found that Net Generation college students, born 1982 onwards, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a computer, 94% owned a mobile phone, and 56% owned an MP3 player They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used instant messaging, 92% of those reported multitasking while instant messaging, 40% of them used television to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the Internet as their primary news source [279] [280]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Established by George Washington in 1782, the Purple Heart has a rich history that spans over two centuries, with its significance and prestige growing with each passing year.\n\n# History\n\n## The Original Badge of Military Merit\n\nThe original Purple Heart, designated as the Badge of Military Merit, was established by George Washington, then the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, by order from his Newburgh, New York, headquarters on 7 August 1782. This award was created to recognize the bravery and sacrifices of soldiers during the Revolutionary War. Washington authorized his subordinate officers to issue Badges of Merit as appropriate, and although only three soldiers received the award during the Revolutionary War, it laid the foundation for the prestigious Purple Heart that we know today.\n\n## The Re-establishment of the Purple Heart\n\nAlthough the award of the Badge of Military Merit was not proposed again officially until after World War I, the Purple Heart continued to evolve and grow in significance. In 1932, Congress formally authorized the award, and it was redesignated as the Purple Heart, with a distinctive purple heart-shaped medal featuring a profile of General George Washington. The Purple Heart was initially awarded to soldiers who were wounded or killed in combat, and its prestige and significance grew as the award was presented to more and more service members.\n\n## The Expansion of Eligibility\n\nIn 1942, the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart were expanded to include non-military personnel serving or closely affiliated with the armed forces. This change allowed government employees, Red Cross workers, war correspondents, and various other professions to receive the Purple Heart, whether in peacetime or armed conflicts. This expansion of eligibility helped to increase the number of Purple Heart recipients and further solidified the award's reputation as a symbol of bravery and sacrifice.\n\n## Notable Recipients\n\nThe Purple Heart has been awarded to numerous notable individuals throughout its history, including Ernie Pyle, a famous war correspondent who was killed in action during World War II. Pyle's posthumous award was a testament to his bravery and sacrifice, and it helped to further cement the Purple Heart's reputation as a prestigious award.\n\n## Most Purple Heart Awards\n\nThe Purple Heart has been awarded to numerous service members throughout its history, with the most awards being presented during World War II. According to official records, over 1.8 million Purple Hearts were awarded during World War II, making it one of the most awarded medals in U.S. military history. The sheer number of awards presented during this conflict helped to establish the Purple Heart as a symbol of bravery and sacrifice, and it continues to be one of the most respected awards in the U.S. military.\n\n# Criteria\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S. Armed Services after 5 April 1917, has been wounded or killed. The criteria for awarding the Purple Heart are as follows:\n\n## Specific Examples of Services\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded to service members who have been wounded or killed while serving in various capacities, including combat, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. The award is also presented to service members who have been wounded or killed while participating in training exercises or other military activities.\n\n## Additional Awards\n\nService members who receive additional Purple Heart awards are denoted by oak leaf clusters, with each cluster representing an additional award. The oak leaf clusters are worn on the service member's uniform, and they serve as a visible symbol of the service member's bravery and sacrifice.\n\n# Appearance\n\nThe Purple Heart award is a 1 3/8 inches wide purple- and gold-colored heart-shaped brass-alloy medal featuring a profile of General George Washington. The medal also features a shield of the coat of arms of George Washington, with two red bars and three red stars in chief, between sprays of green leaves. The reverse of the medal features a raised bronze heart with the words \"FOR MILITARY MERIT\" below the coat of arms and leaves.\n\n# Devices\n\nThe Purple Heart award is also denoted by various devices, including oak leaf clusters and 5/16 inch stars. The oak leaf clusters represent additional awards, while the 5/16 inch stars represent additional awards of the Purple Heart Medal.\n\n# Presentation\n\nThe Purple Heart is presented to service members upon recommendation from their chain of command, stating the injury that was received and the action in which the service member was wounded. The award authority for the Purple Heart is normally at the level of an Army Brigade, Marine Corps Division, Air Force wing, Space Force delta, or Navy Task Force.\n\n# Notable Recipients\n\nThe Purple Heart has been awarded to numerous notable individuals throughout its history, including Ernie Pyle, a famous war correspondent who was killed in action during World War II. Pyle's posthumous award was a testament to his bravery and sacrifice, and it helped to further cement the Purple Heart's reputation as a prestigious award.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Medal of Honor\n* Distinguished Service Cross\n* Silver Star\n* Bronze Star\n* Purple Heart Medal\n\n# References\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# Bibliography\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n# External Links\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Purple_Heart\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe original Purple Heart, designated as the Badge of Military Merit, was established by George Washington – then the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army – by order from his Newburgh, New York, headquarters on 7 August 1782 The Badge of Military Merit was only awarded to three Revolutionary War soldiers by Washington himself Washington authorized his subordinate officers to issue Badges of Merit as appropriate Although never abolished, the award of the badge was not proposed again officially until after World War I [7] [8]\n\n\nCriteria\nThe Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the president of the United States to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S Armed Services after 5 April 1917, has been wounded or killed Specific examples of services which warrant the Purple Heart include:\n\n\nFormer eligibility\nFrom 1942 to 1997, non-military personnel serving or closely affiliated with the armed forces—as government employees, Red Cross workers, war correspondents, and various other professions—were eligible to receive the Purple Heart whether in peacetime or armed conflicts Among the earliest individuals to receive the award were nine Honolulu Fire Department (HFD) firefighters who were killed or wounded in peacetime while fighting fires at Hickam Field during the attack on Pearl Harbor [24] In total, about 100 men and women who served as non-military personnel received the award, the most famous being newspaperman Ernie Pyle, who was awarded a Purple Heart posthumously by the Army after being killed by Japanese machine gun fire in the Pacific Theater near the end of World War II Before his death, Pyle had seen and experienced combat in the European Theater while accompanying and writing about infantrymen for readers back home [25] Those serving in the Merchant Marine are not eligible for the award During World War II, members of this service who met the Purple Heart criteria received a Merchant Marine Mariner's Medal instead.\n\n\nAppearance\nThe Purple Heart award is a 1+3⁄8 inches (35 mm) wide purple- and gold-colored heart-shaped brass-alloy medal containing a profile of General George Washington Above the heart appears a shield of the coat of arms of George Washington (a white shield with two red bars and three red stars in chief) between sprays of green leaves The reverse consists of a raised bronze heart with the words FOR MILITARY MERIT below the coat of arms and leaves.\n\n\nDevices\nAdditional awards of the Purple Heart are denoted by oak leaf clusters in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force, and additional awards of the Purple Heart Medal are denoted by 5⁄16 inch stars in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard [6]\n\n\nPresentation\nCurrent active duty personnel are awarded the Purple Heart upon recommendation from their chain of command, stating the injury that was received and the action in which the service member was wounded The award authority for the Purple Heart is normally at the level of an Army Brigade, Marine Corps Division, Air Force wing, Space Force delta, or Navy Task Force While the award of the Purple Heart is considered automatic for all wounds received in combat, each award presentation must still be reviewed to ensure that the wounds received were as a result of enemy action Modern day Purple Heart presentations are recorded in both hardcopy and electronic service records The annotation of the Purple Heart is denoted both with the service member's parent command and at the headquarters of the military service department An original citation and award certificate are presented to the service member and filed in the field service record.\n\n\nNotable recipients\nTen Purple Hearts:\n\n\nMost Purple Heart awards\nTen Purple Hearts:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is one of the most notorious figures in the history of Mexican organized crime.\n\n# Early Life\n\nErnesto Fonseca Carrillo was born in Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Mexico. Sources disagree on his exact date of birth, with some claiming he was born in 1942, while others say he was born on August 1, 1930. His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he grew up in a poor family in a rural area of Sinaloa.\n\n# Drug Trafficking\n\nFonseca's involvement in organized crime began in the 1960s, when he started working as a smuggler of marijuana and other narcotics. He quickly rose through the ranks and became a key figure in the Guadalajara Cartel, one of the most powerful and influential cartels in Mexico at the time. Fonseca and other narcotics traffickers created and operated El Búfalo (The Buffalo), a ranch in Chihuahua that is one of the largest marijuana plantations in history by square footage.\n\nUnder Fonseca's leadership, the Guadalajara Cartel expanded its operations and became a major player in the global narcotics trade. Fonseca's network of contacts and associates spanned the globe, and he was known for his ruthless tactics and ability to evade law enforcement.\n\n# Charges and Arrest\n\nIn 1982, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) indicted Fonseca in a money laundering operation in San Diego. Fonseca was accused of using a complex network of shell companies and bank accounts to launder millions of dollars in narcotics profits. Prior to the DEA receiving permission to wiretap the phones where Fonseca was thought to be hiding, Fonseca fled back to Mexico.\n\nFonseca's escape was seen as a major blow to the DEA's efforts to dismantle the Guadalajara Cartel. However, the DEA continued to pursue Fonseca, and in 1985, he was finally located in Puerto Vallarta by the Mexican Army. Fonseca's villa was surrounded, and he surrendered to authorities on April 7, 1985.\n\n# House Arrest\n\nIn 2016, Fonseca was transferred from prison to house arrest due to his old age and declining health. At the time, he had about nine years remaining on his 40-year sentence. Fonseca's house arrest was seen as a lenient sentence by many, given the severity of his crimes and the harm caused by the Guadalajara Cartel.\n\n# In Media\n\nFonseca-Carrillo is portrayed in the Netflix series Narcos: Mexico by actor Joaquín Cosío. The series provides a dramatized account of Fonseca's life and career, including his rise to power, his involvement in the Guadalajara Cartel, and his eventual arrest and imprisonment.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Narcos: Mexico\n* Guadalajara Cartel\n* El Búfalo (The Buffalo)\n* Mexican organized crime\n* Drug trafficking in Mexico\n\nFonseca's legacy as a major figure in Mexican organized crime continues to be felt today.

{"title": "Zinedine_Zidane", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nZinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France [5] He is the youngest of five siblings [6] Zidane is of Algerian descent and has described himself as a \"non-practising Muslim\" [7] [8] His parents, Smaïl and Malika, immigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War The family, which had settled in the city's tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille [9] In an interview with Esquire magazine, he stated:\n\n\nClub career\n\"He'd go past one, two, three, five, six players – it was sublime His feet spoke with the ball\"\n\n\nCannes\n\"He'd go past one, two, three, five, six players – it was sublime His feet spoke with the ball\"\n\n\nBordeaux\nZidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruher SC [22] [23] and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup [23] [24] [25] during his four years with the club He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, \"Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?\" [26] Also toward the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £1.2 million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division [27] In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year [28]\n\n\nJuventus\n\"He is a special player He creates space where there is none No matter where he gets the ball or how it comes to him, he can get out of trouble His imagination and his technique are amazing\"\n\n\nReal Madrid\nOn 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of Rafael Benítez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new head coach of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal [127] His first match as the club's new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La Coruña 5–0 in a La Liga match In his first El Clásico as a coach, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2–1 win over Barcelona, ending Barça's 39-match unbeaten run [128] On 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the Champions League final by beating Manchester City 1–0 on aggregate [129] In La Liga, Madrid ended up finishing second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona [130] On 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won after a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over Atlético Madrid, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\" [131] [132] Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup both as a player and a coach and the second man (after Miguel Muñoz) to achieve the feat with Real Madrid He also became the first French coach, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy [133] [134]\n\n\nInternational career\nBoth France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough [53] Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France [54]\n\n\nEuro 1996\nDespite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic [57]\n\n\n1998 World Cup\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in; the tournament was held in his home country, France The French team won all three games in the group stage, with Zidane setting up Christophe Dugarry's goal in the opening match against South Africa from a corner, and

some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane's departure – culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4–1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week – his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui's equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane

characterized by its formation flexibility and attacking football, as well as his ability to unite the dressing room, have been positively compared to Carlo Ancelotti's coaching method [211] [212]

against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory Similarly, his use of Gareth Bale as a substitute in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final proved crucial; Bale scored two goals after being brought on, turning a 1-1 tie into a 3-1 Madrid victory It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks, [214] while he is credited for repopularising the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football [215]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nZidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior These sponsorship deals earned him €8.6 million on top of his €6.4 million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling €15 million ($20.4 million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer [224] [225] In 2004, Forbes magazine listed his earnings of $15.8 million for the previous 12 months [226] In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton,

league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4–1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week – his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui's equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022 [152] [153]\n\n\nReception and legacy\n\"Zidane is the master Over the past ten years, there's been no one like him, he has been the best player in the world.\"\n\n\nAs a player\n\n\n\nAs a coach\nDespite establishing himself as one of the most successful coaches of his era and in the history of Real Madrid, [A] Zidane's time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck [B] His tactical philosophy has been praised by many [207] [208] [209] [210] Zidane's tactical style, characterized by its formation flexibility and attacking football, as well as his ability to unite the dressing room, have been positively compared to Carlo Ancelotti's coaching method [211] [212] [213] His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory Similarly, his use of Gareth Bale as a substitute in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final proved crucial; Bale scored two goals after being brought on, turning a 1-1 tie into a 3-1 Madrid victory It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks, [214] while he is credited for repopularising the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football [215]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nZidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior These sponsorship deals earned him €8.6 million on top of his €6.4 million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling €15 million ($20.4 million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer [224] [225] In 2004, Forbes magazine listed his earnings of $15.8 million for the previous 12 months [226] In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with Pelé and Diego Maradona [227] Zidane features as the cover star of the Ultimate Edition of the FIFA video game FIFA 20 [228]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAt the age of 17, Zidane met his future wife, Véronique Fernández (born in Aveyron of Spanish descent), [240] while playing for Cannes in the 1988–89 season Married in 1994, they have four sons: Enzo Zidane (born 24 March 1995), [241] Luca Zidane (born 13 May 1998), [242] Théo Zidane (born 18 May 2002), [243] and Elyaz Zidane (born 26 December

multi-day period of high instability and supportive wind shear across the Southern and Central Plains, [10] and by May 1, a 15% risk was added across Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas [11] On May 3, as confidence in a significant tornado outbreak increased, a 30% risk zone was introduced in far northern Oklahoma, central Kansas, and far southern Nebraska, [12] and on May 5, a moderate risk was issued as forecasters noted the possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes and large hail [13]\n\n\nMay 6\nStarting April 30, the Storm Prediction Center noted that certain

far southern Nebraska, [12] and on May 5, a moderate risk was issued as forecasters noted the possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes and large hail [13]\n\n\nMay 7–8\nOn May 7, a tornado-driven enhanced risk was issued across the Ohio Valley by the Storm Prediction Center [21] [22] That afternoon, a strong, high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage in Portage, Michigan Later, another tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood, the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan along with Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 8 [23] [24] [25] Later on May 8, a wind and hail driven Moderate Risk was introduced, both at 45% hatched wind and hail risks, [26] more severe weather and tornadoes impacted much of the Middle Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys PDS tornado warnings were issued for tornadoes near Equality, Illinois and Aurora, Missouri [27] Multiple strong supercells hit Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts At 6:54 pm CDT a tornado emergency was issued for parts of Marshall County, Maury County, Rutherford County, and Williamson County including Spring Hill, Tennessee, Chapel Hill, Tennessee, and Allisona, Tennessee of the Southern Nashville Metro area, a second in 5 months, after a Tornado Emergency in the north of the metro that hit Hendersonville on December 9, 2023 [28] In the middle of the outbreak, the SPC issued a 15% hatched tornado driven Moderate risk for Southeastern Tennessee, Northwestern Georgia and North Alabama at 0100 UTC [29] Two flash flood emergencies were issued for parts of Northern Tennessee after round of torrential rainfall battered the area Later, another supercell in Alabama caused a PDS tornado warning for the city of Huntsville, Alabama [30] That same supercell went on to produce another damaging tornado that sparked a tornado emergency for Henagar, Alabama, Hammondville, Alabama, and Mentone, Alabama [31]\n\n\nMay 9–10\nIsolated tornadoes occurred during the day on May 9 Additionally, several supercells produced large hail across Texas Widespread damaging winds occurred overnight into the next day, from a congealing squall line, along with a few tornadoes including two EF2 tornadoes and an EF1 tornado in the Tallahassee Metropolitan area The outbreak ended as severe storms moved offshore during the afternoon hours of May 10 [15]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nThis large, violent EF4 tornado first touched down at 9:12 p.m CDT (02:12 UTC) southeast of Hominy on CR-1701 and moved northeastward snapping trees at EF1 strength As the tornado approached SH-20, it intensified to low-end EF2 strength, damaging the roof of a home and destroying two outbuildings Past this point, the tornado rapidly strengthened to low-end EF3 intensity as it knocked over seven steel power poles and snapped trees After the tornado had crossed SH-20, it weakened It traveled through primarily rural areas at EF2 strength, and then EF1 strength Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted, and outbuildings were damaged At 9:39 p.m CDT (02:39 UTC), the National Weather Service in Tulsa, Oklahoma issued a Tornado Emergency for Barnsdall, after receiving reports of a large tornado and a large debris ball appearing on radar As the tornado approached CR-2240, it regained EF2 strength and severe ground-scouring began It then crossed Birch Lake, and further intensified to EF3 strength, continuing to destroy trees As the tornado passed east of CR-2380, it became violent It reached its peak intensity of EF4, with wind speeds estimated at 180 mph (290 km/h) A well-constructed home was swept clean off of its crawl space, and its debris was blown to the northeast Nearby trees were completely stubbed and debarked, and vehicles were thrown and rolled Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened slightly as it inflicted high-end EF3 damage to the NuCera Solutions wax plant on the southeast side of Barnsdall [32]\n\n\nHominy–Barnsdall–Bartlesville, Oklahoma\nThis large, violent EF4 tornado first touched down at 9:12 p.m CDT (02:12 UTC)

the NuCera Solutions wax plant on the southeast side of Barnsdall [32]\n\n\nColumbia–Lunns Store, Tennessee\nThis deadly low-end EF3 tornado first touched down at 5:37 pm CDT (22:37 UTC) on Lofton Road just east of the Duck River in the eastern part of Columbia in Maury County, causing light tree damage with some limbs being broken Strengthening ensued as it moved northeast, damaging some homes and collapsing roofs on some residences before snapping tree trunks near Mt Oliver Road at EF1 intensity [15] The tornado then moved northwest of Beech Grove, damaging more houses and collapsing roofs and ripping roof panels off of homes at EF1 intensity More tree trunks were snapped as it moved through forested regions and across US 412/SR 99, before the tornado reached EF2 strength along Old Highway 99 EF2 damage was observed further northeast, including an outbuilding that was totally destroyed by the tornado, with walls collapsed inward Continuing onward, the tornado then intensified to its peak of low-end EF3 intensity as it moved into the Lasea community It bent and collapsed large transmission power trusses, mostly destroyed two homes, which were left with only their interior rooms standing, and obliterating a mobile home One person was killed in one of the destroyed homes [15] [40] EF2 damage was noted nearby further north where two houses had their roofs and walls destroyed By this time, a tornado emergency had been issued for the eastern portions of Columbia as a debris ball was evident on radar and storm spotters reported a large, significant tornado on the ground.\n\n\nPisgah–Henagar–Hammondville, Alabama\nThis intense tornado touched down along SR 71 south of Pisgah in Jackson County at 10:57 pm CDT (03:57 UTC) It moved east-southeastward at EF1 strength, snapping trees and inflicting minor roof damage to farm building Another EF1 tornado would pass through this area about seven hours later, causing additional damage This tornado then intensified and widened significantly as it reached County Road 422, overturning a camper, partially destroying a well-built home, destroying a horse trailer and a mobile home, and removing a third of the roof from a hay barn Debris was thrown into the field across the street and 2x4s were impaled 1–1.5 feet (0.30–0.46 m) into the ground Two people were injured in the camper Along SR 40, several large 100+-year-old oak trees with diameters of 4–5 feet (1.2–1.5 m) were knocked down, including some that fell on knocked down two exterior walls of a home, which also had its windows sucked out The tornado then reached its widest point and ripped a garage clean from the home it was attached to with the resulting debris shearing the home This home was anchored with nails instead of bolts and a high-end EF2 rating was applied to this structure Just beyond this point, the tornado reached its peak intensity of low-end EF3 along County Road 125 A well-built and well-anchored metal shop building was completely destroyed with the large bolts and plates that anchored the H-beams being snapped and bent A large 4–5-foot (1.2–1.5 m) section of the foundation was ripped from the ground with debris being scattered about 10 feet (3.0 m), although the column anchoring remained intact A nearby 20,000 lb (9,100 kg) 18-wheeler cab was tossed more than 150 yards (140 m) into a field across CR 125 Other nearby semi-trailers were shifted 50–100 feet (15–30 m) as well [42] [15] Around this time, a tornado emergency was issued for Henagar, Hammondville, and Mentone [43]\n\n\nTallahassee, Florida\nThis tornado first touched down at 6:38 am EDT in Gadsden County, Florida east of Wetumpka, and was the first of three to impact Leon County that morning After damaging an old farm building, the tornado tracked east-southeastward at EF1 intensity snapping or uprooting numerous trees as it passed just south of Midway through rural areas The tornado then crossed the Ochlockonee River into Leon County, continuing to cause EF1 tree damage as it passed through Ochlockonee as it tracked along US 90 A mobile home park had extensive tree damage, with several trees falling on mobile homes The tornado then entered the western city limits of Tallahassee near the intersection of US 90 and SR 263 and turned southeastward, causing roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center After crossing SR 263, the tornado intensified to low-end EF2 strength as it approached and crossed SR 20 A swath of pine trees was snapped at about 75 feet (23 m) above the ground and an automotive repair building was heavily damaged After inflicting significant EF1 tree damage on the Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College campuses, the tornado briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity again as it passed over a neighborhood, where another area of intense tree damage was noted with numerous homes damaged by fallen trees The tornado then began to move through densely populated areas, causing widespread EF1 tree damage through several neighborhoods Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, especially along SR 366 The tornado then moved through the southwestern part of the Florida State University campus, continuing to down numerous trees The tent housing the FSU Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged Turning back to an east-southeastward heading and moving into Downtown Tallahassee along Gaines Street, the tornado collapsed a construction crane and inflicted major damage to businesses Multiple warehouses in Railroad Square suffered severe damage and the railroad depot sustained roof damage The tornado then began to interact with another EF2 tornado that was ongoing to its south causing this tornado to turn back to the southeast It missed the Florida State Capitol to the south, continuing to snap trees in residential areas, parks, and a country club and blowing down street signs before rapidly weakening and dissipating at 7:03 am EDT as the other EF2 tornado to its south became the dominant circulation The storm that caused this tornado, as well as the one that overtook it, was responsible for an area of wind gusts potentially exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h) in southern Tallahassee [15] [45]\n\n\nFirst tornado\nThis tornado first touched down at 6:38 am EDT in Gadsden County, Florida east of Wetumpka, and was the first of three to impact Leon County that morning After damaging an old farm building, the tornado tracked east-southeastward at EF1 intensity snapping or

potentially exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h) in southern Tallahassee [15] [45]\n\n\nSecond tornado\nAs the first EF2 tornado was approaching Tallahassee, a second even larger and longer-tracked EF2 tornado developed in Lake Talquin State Park in Leon County at 6:50 am EDT It was the third of three simultaneous tornadoes in Leon County as an EF1 tornado was already ongoing to the south of this tornado Along the beginning of its path, the tornado snapped numerous trees and a power pole at EF1 intensity as it moved east-southeastward As it reached SR 20, the tornado made a sharp turn and began moving due east along the highway continuing to snap numerous trees as it moved through the Lake Talquin State Recreational Area The tornado then veered back to the east-southeast away from SR 20 and impacted many subdivisions in the Norfleet neighborhood, leaving behind a large area of snapped trees Turning back eastward and moving into the southern part of Tallahassee, the tornado crossed SR 263, continuing to snap dozens of trees along with wooden power poles The tornado then began to move generally eastward through neighborhoods in the southwest part of the city, snapping and uprooting countless trees, snapping power poles, damaging an elementary school, and inflicting roof damage to homes, outbuildings, and other structures Some homes were damaged by fallen trees as well Around this time, a swath of damaging 100 mph (160 km/h) straight-line winds developed just south of this tornado This area of destructive winds would continue to parallel this tornado until it dissipated The tornado then moved through the Florida A&M University campus producing widespread EF1 tree damage with two university buildings also being damaged Power poles and lines were taken down by fallen trees as well The tornado reached its peak width in this area and a much larger area of EF0 shingle damage to homes and businesses was noted as it crossed SR 363 The first Tallahassee tornado then merged with this tornado as it moved over the Capital City Country Club, and this tornado became the dominant tornadic circulation as it continued through Tallahassee After leaving the golf course, the tornado reached low-end EF2 intensity as it impacted the Indian Head Acres subdivisions, snapping trees at about 75 feet (23 m) above the ground Fallen trees also damaged homes, power poles, and power lines The tornado continued eastward, causing EF1 tree damage throughout several subdivisions as it crossed US 319 and exited Tallahassee After crossing CR 2195 east of Tallahassee, the tornado weakened to EF0 intensity uprooting a few trees along US 27 as it crossed into Jefferson County before dissipating at 7:14 am EDT [15] [45]\n\n\nNon-tornadic effects\nStrong straight-line winds blew a tree down on a car east of Lone Mountain, Tennessee, killing the driver [27] One person was killed and another person was injured after a tree fell on a vehicle in Gaston County, North Carolina on May 8 [49] One occurred in Jackson County, Illinois, as a mobile home was shifted off its foundation and a trailer was flipped there, [50] while two people were injured after a warehouse had its roof collapse in Knox County, Tennessee [51] Severe storms also forced a Major League Baseball game at Busch Stadium to be postponed until August 5 [52] The same system later produced extensive straight-line wind damage in Mississippi and Florida, Tallahassee was particularly hard hit, with tens of thousands of power outages still affecting residents days later [53]\n\n\nImpacts\nWaffle Houses in the Oklahoma City metro closed on May 6th due to the risk of tornadoes [citation needed] Amtrak's northbound Heartland Flyer was canceled on May 6 as a precautionary measure due to the high risk of severe weather issued by the Storm Prediction Center; retroactively, the southbound train for May 7 was also canceled [54] Wolverine trains from the evening of May 7 to the early morning hours of May 8 were also delayed between Ann Arbor and Battle Creek, Michigan due to tornadic activity in the area [55] On May 8, the Nashville International Airport briefly issued a ground stop due to severe storms [56] Further north, Mammoth Caves National Park shut down at 3:30 pm on May 8 due to the storm, re-opening on May 9 [57]\n\n\nLater developments\nManagement at the NuCera Solution wax plant, which was severely damaged by the tornado, had initially been planning to rebuild the structure However, the plant announced in late-July 2024 that it would permanently close within the next 6-12 months [58]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Tornado Outbreak of May 6–10, 2024**\n\nThe Tornado Outbreak of May 6–10, 2024 was a significant series of tornadoes that affected the United States, particularly in the Southern and Central Plains, Ohio Valley, and Southeast regions. The outbreak occurred from May 6 to 10, 2024, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological Synopsis**\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) began noting the potential for a multi-day period of high instability and supportive wind shear across the Southern and Central Plains as early as April 30, 2024. By May 1, a 15% risk was introduced across Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and northern Texas. On May 3, a 30% risk zone was introduced in far northern Oklahoma, central Kansas, and far southern Nebraska. On May 5, a moderate risk was issued as forecasters noted the possibility of strong and long-tracked tornadoes and large hail.\n\n**May 6**\n\nOn May 6, the SPC continued to monitor the situation, issuing a tornado-driven enhanced risk across the Ohio Valley. That afternoon, a strong, high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage in Portage, Michigan. Later, another tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood, the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan. Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 7.\n\n**May 7–8**\n\nOn May 7, the SPC issued a tornado-driven enhanced risk across the Ohio Valley. That afternoon, a strong, high-end EF2 tornado caused severe damage in Portage, Michigan. Later, another tornado prompted the issuance of a tornado emergency for Union City and Sherwood, the first tornado emergency ever issued in the state of Michigan. Other tornadoes were reported across Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania through the overnight hours into May 8.\n\n**May 9–10**\n\nIsolated tornadoes occurred during the day on May 9. Additionally, several supercells produced large hail across Texas. Widespread damaging winds occurred overnight into the next day, from a congealing squall line, along with a few tornadoes, including two EF2 tornadoes and an EF1 tornado in the Tallahassee Metropolitan area. The outbreak ended as severe storms moved offshore during the afternoon hours of May 10.\n\n**Confirmed Tornadoes**\n\n**Hominy–Barnsdall–Bartlesville, Oklahoma**\n\nA large, violent EF4 tornado first touched down at 9:12 PM CDT on May 6, 2024, southeast of Hominy on CR-1701. The tornado moved northeastward, snapping trees at EF1 strength. As the tornado approached SH-20, it intensified to low-end EF2 strength, damaging the roof of a home and destroying two outbuildings. Past this point, the tornado rapidly strengthened to low-end EF3 intensity, knocking over seven steel power poles and snapping trees. The tornado then weakened and traveled through primarily rural areas at EF2 strength and then EF1 strength. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted, and outbuildings were damaged. At 9:39 PM CDT, the National Weather Service in Tulsa, Oklahoma issued a Tornado Emergency for Barnsdall, after receiving reports of a large tornado and a large debris ball appearing on radar. As the tornado approached CR-2240, it regained EF2 strength and severe ground-scouring began. The tornado then crossed Birch Lake and further intensified to EF3 strength, continuing to destroy trees. As the tornado passed east of CR-2380, it became violent. It reached its peak intensity of EF4, with wind speeds estimated at 180 mph (290 km/h). A well-constructed home was swept clean off its crawl space, and its debris was blown to the northeast. Nearby trees were completely stubbed and debarked, and vehicles were thrown and rolled. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened slightly as it inflicted high-end EF3 damage to the NuCera Solutions wax plant on the southeast side of Barnsdall.\n\n**Columbia–Lunns Store, Tennessee**\n\nA deadly low-end EF3 tornado first touched down at 5:37 PM CDT on May 6, 2024, on Lofton Road just east of the Duck River in the eastern part of Columbia in Maury County.

A nearby 20,000 lb (9,100 kg) 18-wheeler cab was tossed more than 150 yards (140 m) into a field across CR 125. Other nearby semi-trailers were shifted 50–100 feet (15–30 m) as well.\n\n**Tallahassee, Florida**\n\nA tornado first touched down at 6:38 AM EDT on May 9, 2024, in Gadsden County, Florida east of Wetumpka, and was the first of three to impact Leon County that morning. After damaging an old farm building, the tornado tracked east-southeastward at EF1 intensity, snapping or uprooting numerous trees as it passed just south of Midway through rural areas. The tornado then crossed the Ochlockonee River into Leon County, continuing to cause EF1 tree damage as it passed through Ochlockonee as it tracked along US 90. A mobile home park had extensive tree damage, with several trees falling on mobile homes. The tornado then entered the western city limits of Tallahassee near the intersection of US 90 and SR 263 and turned southeastward, causing roof and siding damage to a hotel and shopping center. After crossing SR 263, the tornado intensified to low-end EF2 strength as it approached and crossed SR 20. A swath of pine trees was snapped at about 75 feet (23 m) above the ground and an automotive repair building was heavily damaged. After inflicting significant EF1 tree damage on the Lively Technical College and Tallahassee Community College campuses, the tornado briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity again as it passed over a neighborhood, where another area of intense tree damage was noted with numerous homes damaged by fallen trees. The tornado then began to move through densely populated areas, causing widespread EF1 tree damage through several neighborhoods. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged by fallen trees, especially along SR 366. The tornado then moved through the southwestern part of the Florida State University campus, continuing to down numerous trees. The tent housing the FSU Flying High Circus was destroyed and the outfield fence at Dick Howser Stadium was severely damaged. Turning back to an east-southeastward heading and moving into Downtown Tallahassee along Gaines Street, the tornado collapsed a construction crane and inflicted major damage to businesses. Multiple warehouses in Railroad Square suffered severe damage and the railroad depot sustained roof damage. The tornado then began to interact with another EF2 tornado that was ongoing to its south causing this tornado to turn back to the southeast. It missed the Florida State Capitol to the south, continuing to snap trees in residential areas, parks, and a country club and blowing down street signs before rapidly weakening and dissipating at 7:03 AM EDT as the other EF2 tornado to its south became the dominant circulation.\n\n**Second Tornado**\n\nA second even larger and longer-tracked EF2 tornado developed in Lake Talquin State Park in Leon County at 6:50 AM EDT on May 9, 2024. It was the third of three simultaneous tornadoes in Leon County as an EF1 tornado was already ongoing to the south of this tornado. Along the beginning of its path, the tornado snapped numerous trees and a power pole at EF1 intensity as it moved east-southeastward. As it reached SR 20, the tornado made a sharp turn and began moving due east along the highway continuing to snap numerous trees as it moved through the Lake Talquin State Recreational Area. The tornado then veered back to the east-southeast away from SR 20 and impacted many subdivisions in the Norfleet neighborhood, leaving behind a large area of snapped trees. Turning back eastward and moving into the southern part of Tallahassee, the tornado crossed SR 263, continuing to snap dozens of trees along with wooden power poles. The tornado then began to move generally eastward through neighborhoods in the southwest part of the city, snapping and uprooting countless trees, snapping power poles, damaging an elementary school, and inflicting roof damage to homes, outbuildings, and other structures. Some homes were damaged by fallen trees as well. Around this time, a swath of damaging 100 mph (160 km/h) straight-line winds developed just south of this tornado. This area of destructive winds would continue to parallel this tornado until it dissipated. The tornado then moved through the Florida A&M University campus producing widespread EF1 tree damage with two university buildings also being damaged. Power poles and lines were taken down by fallen trees as well. The tornado reached its peak width in this area and a much larger area of EF0 shingle damage to homes and businesses was noted as it crossed SR 363. The first Tallahassee tornado then merged with this tornado as it moved over the Capital City Country Club, and this tornado became the dominant tornadic circulation as it continued through Tallahassee. After leaving the golf course, the tornado reached low-end EF2 intensity as it impacted the Indian Head Acres subdivisions, snapping trees at about 75 feet (23 m) above the ground. Fallen trees also damaged homes, power poles, and power lines. The tornado continued eastward, causing EF1 tree damage throughout several subdivisions as it crossed US 319 and exited Tallahassee. After crossing CR 2195 east of Tallahassee, the tornado weakened to EF0 intensity uprooting a few trees along US 27 as it crossed into Jefferson County before dissipating at 7:14 AM EDT.\n\n**Non-Tornadic Effects**\n\nStrong straight-line winds blew a tree down on a car east of Lone Mountain, Tennessee, killing the driver. One person was killed and another person was injured after a tree fell on a vehicle in Gaston County, North Carolina on May 8. One occurred in Jackson County, Illinois, as a mobile home was shifted off its foundation and a trailer was flipped there. Two people were injured after a warehouse had its roof collapse in Knox County, Tennessee. Severe storms also forced a Major League Baseball game at Busch Stadium to be postponed until August 5. The same system later produced extensive straight-line wind damage in Mississippi and Florida, Tallahassee was particularly hard hit, with tens of thousands of power outages still affecting residents days later.\n\n**Impacts**\n\nWaffle Houses in the Oklahoma City metro closed on May 6th due to the risk of tornadoes. Amtrak's northbound Heartland Flyer was canceled on May 6 as a precautionary measure due to the high risk of severe weather issued by the Storm Prediction Center; retroactively, the southbound train for May 7 was also canceled. Wolverine trains from the evening of May 7 to the early morning hours of May 8 were also delayed between Ann Arbor and Battle Creek, Michigan due to tornadic activity in the area. On May 8, the Nashville International Airport briefly issued a ground stop due to severe storms. Further north, Mammoth Caves National Park shut down at 3:30 PM on May 8 due to the storm, re-opening on May 9.\n\n**Later Developments**\n\nManagement at the NuCera Solution wax plant, which was severely damaged by the tornado, had initially been planning to rebuild the structure. However, the plant announced in late-July 2024 that it would permanently close within the next 6-12 months.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

{"title": "Chariots_of_Fire", "content": "\nPlot\nDuring a 1978 funeral service in London in honour of the life of Harold Abrahams, headed by his former colleague Lord Andrew Lindsay, there is a flashback to when he was young and in a group of athletes running along a beach.\n\n\nCast\nOther actors in smaller roles include John Young as Eric and Jennie's father Reverend J.D Liddell, Yvonne Gilan as their mother Mary, Benny Young as their older brother Rob, Yves Beneyton as French runner Géo André, Philip O'Brien as American coach George Collins, Patrick Doyle as Jimmie, [6] and Ruby Wax as Bunty [7] Kenneth Branagh, who worked as a set gofer, appears as an extra in the Cambridge Society Day sequence [8] Stephen Fry has a likewise uncredited role as a Gilbert-and-Sullivan Club singer [8]\n\n\nProduction\nProducer David Puttnam was looking for a story in the mould of A Man for All Seasons (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt that sport provided clear situations in this sense [9] He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon An Approved History of the Olympic Games, a reference book on the Olympics, while housebound from the flu, in a rented house in Malibu [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nScreenplay\nProducer David Puttnam was looking for a story in the mould of A Man for All Seasons (1966), regarding someone who

Games, a reference book on the Olympics, while housebound from the flu, in a rented house in Malibu [10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nCasting\nDirector Hugh Hudson was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm as their supporting cast Hudson and producer David Puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell They then saw Scottish stage actor Ian Charleson performing the role of Pierre in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Piaf, and knew immediately they had found their man Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would \"fit like a kid glove\" [20]\n\n\nFilming\nThe beach scenes showing the athletes running towards the Carlton Hotel at Broadstairs, Kent, [24] were shot in Scotland on West Sands, St Andrews next to the 18th hole of the Old Course at St Andrews Links A plaque now commemorates the filming [25] [26] The impact of these scenes (as the athletes run in slow motion to Vangelis's music) prompted Broadstairs town council to commemorate them with a seafront plaque [27]\n\n\nEditing\nThe film was slightly altered for the U.S audience A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics cricket game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two First World War veterans who use an obscenity – in order to be given a PG rating [32] An off-camera retort of, \"Win it for Israel\" among exhortations of fellow students

Fire**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nChariots of Fire is a 1981 British historical drama film directed by Hugh Hudson, produced by David Puttnam, and written by Colin Welland. The film tells the story of two British athletes, Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, who come from different backgrounds and compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. The film explores themes of faith, determination, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a flashback to a 1978 funeral service in London in honor of the life of Harold Abrahams, headed by his former colleague Lord Andrew Lindsay. The film then flashes back to the early 1920s, when Abrahams is a young man from a middle-class Jewish family in Cambridge. He is a talented athlete who dreams of competing in the Olympics, but his family's expectations and his own sense of duty make it difficult for him to pursue his passion.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Liddell, a Scottish Christian, is a talented athlete who has just graduated from the University of Edinburgh. He is a devout believer who sees his athletic pursuits as a way to glorify God. Despite his natural talent, Liddell struggles with the idea of competing on a Sunday, which is a day of rest for Christians.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Abrahams and Liddell become friends and rivals as they compete in the 1924 Olympics. The film follows their journey as they face challenges, setbacks, and personal struggles, both on and off the track. Through their experiences, the film explores themes of faith, determination, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast of young actors, including Ben Cross as Harold Abrahams, Ian Charleson as Eric Liddell, and Nicholas Farrell as Lord Andrew Lindsay. The cast also includes John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm in supporting roles.\n\n**Production**\n\nProducer David Puttnam was looking for a story in the mold of A Man for All Seasons (1966), regarding someone who follows his conscience, and felt that sport provided clear situations in this sense. He discovered Eric Liddell's story by accident in 1977, when he happened upon An Approved History of the Olympic Games, a reference book on the Olympics, while housebound from the flu, in a rented house in Malibu.\n\nDirector Hugh Hudson was determined to cast young, unknown actors in all the major roles of the film, and to back them up by using veterans like John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm as their supporting cast. Hudson and producer David Puttnam did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell, before finally discovering Ian Charleson, who was performing the role of Pierre in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Piaf.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe beach scenes showing the athletes running towards the Carlton Hotel at Broadstairs, Kent, were shot in Scotland on West Sands, St Andrews, next to the 18th hole of the Old Course at St Andrews Links. A plaque now commemorates the filming. The impact of these scenes (as the athletes run in slow motion to Vangelis's music) prompted Broadstairs town council to commemorate them with a seafront plaque.\n\n**Editing**\n\nThe film was slightly altered for the U.S audience. A brief scene depicting a pre-Olympics cricket game between Abrahams, Liddell, Montague, and the rest of the British track team appears shortly after the beginning of the original film. For the American audience, this brief scene was deleted. In the U.S., to avoid the initial G rating, which had been strongly associated with children's films and might have hindered box office sales, a different scene was used – one depicting Abrahams and Montague arriving at a Cambridge railway station and encountering two First World War veterans who use an obscenity – in order to be given a PG rating.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nAlthough the film is a period piece set in the 1920s, the Academy Award-winning original soundtrack composed by Vangelis (credited as Vangelis Papathanassiou) uses a contemporary 1980s electronic sound, with a strong use of synthesizer and piano among other instruments. This was a departure from earlier period films, which employed sweeping orchestral instrumentals. The title theme of the film has been used in subsequent films and television shows during slow-motion segments.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was distributed by 20th Century-Fox and selected for the 1981 Royal Film Performance with its premiere on 30 March 1981 at the Odeon Haymarket before opening to the public the following day.

by The New York Times suggested the agency would prioritize the private spaceflight sector [14] [15] In November 2018, NASA announced the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, selecting nine companies to deploy payloads for the agency [16] In May 2019, NASA announced that Astrobotic Technology, Intuitive Machines, and Orbit Beyond would develop lunar landers, awarding Intuitive Machines US$77 million [17] Intuitive Machines was paid US$118 million to develop the Odysseus lunar lander used in the IM-1 mission.\n\n\nMission hardware\nOdysseus was equipped with six instruments developed by NASA, including a laser retroreflector array, a lidar navigation device, a stereo camera, a low-frequency radio receiver, the Lunar Node-1 beacon, and an instrument to monitor propellant levels Additionally, a camera built by students at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, a planned Moon telescope, and a Jeff Koons art project were also on board [21] In total the payloads comprise six NASA scientific instruments and six commercial instruments (five of the latter being scientific and one cultural) [22]\n\n\nMission events\nIn December 2023, Odysseus arrived at Kennedy Space Center for processing [42] On January 31, 2024, the Odysseus spacecraft was encapsulated in the payload fairing of its Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle [43] On February 13, IM announced that two

rehearsals loading Odysseus with propellants had been successful and they were ready for launch [44] [45]\n\n\nLaunch\nA Falcon 9 booster launched Odysseus from LC-39A in Florida at 06:05 UTC on February 15, 2024 The booster returned to LZ-1 and the expended Falcon 9 upper stage delivered the spacecraft to its translunar trajectory.\n\n\nEarly operations\nAfter separation from the launch vehicle, the Nova Control operations center established communication with the lander and conducted initial checkouts Images captured by the spacecraft after separation from the launch vehicle were released on February 17 [47]\n\n\nCommissioning burn\nThe lander was scheduled to perform a main engine \"commissioning burn\" on February 15 Trent Martin, Intuitive Machines vice president of Space Systems, described this as a \"critical step\" for the mission [48] After reporting issues with the IM-1 star tracker and adjustment of the liquid oxygen line cooling time IM reported a successful commissioning burn on February 16 [49] [50] The maneuver resulted in a 21 m/s (47 mph) change in the lander's velocity [51]\n\n\nTrajectory correction\nIntuitive Machines planned for up to three trajectory adjustment maneuvers during the trans-lunar phase of the mission [49] The first was completed on February 18, [51] and after the second maneuver on February 20, there was no need for a third [52]\n\n\nLunar orbit\nOdysseus performed its lunar orbit insertion (LOI) on February 21, altering its velocity by 800 m/s (1,800 mph) Intuitive Machines reported the 408-second main engine LOI burn placed the lander in a 92 km (57 mi) lunar orbit [54] [55] On February 22 IM indicated a \"lunar correction maneuver\" had raised the orbit [56]\n\n\nLunar landing\nA favored landing site in 2020 was between the Sea of Serenity (Mare Serenitatis) and the Sea of Crises (Mare Crisium) [60] [61] Lunar maria are large plains formed when lava flowed into ancient impact basins Later, a lunar highlands location near the south pole of the Moon was chosen for the landing, since that region is believed to have a source of water for a future lunar base [62]\n\n\nSurface operations\nOn February 23, Intuitive Machines reported that the IM-1 Odysseus lander was still \"alive and well\", and that IM was continuing to receive data on the vehicle's status [71] and whether the scientific payloads could still be deployed [72] [68] Intuitive Machines executives said they were working to reconfigure antennas to increase downlink rates but did not estimate what sort of data rates they expected [73]\n\n\nEagleCam\nThe EagleCam was a deployable CubeSat camera system designed especially to photograph the lunar landing of the Nova-C Odysseus lander on the Moon Photographs taken during the lunar landing of the Odysseus lander may also have enabled a better understanding of the dynamics of lunar landings on the lunar regolith and rock surfaces in the vicinity of the Moon's south pole Such a better understanding of the local lunar surface features would have assisted with preparations for upcoming scheduled additional landings at the lunar south pole [40] [77] Designed and manufactured by staff and students working in the Space Technologies Laboratory at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, [40] [77] it was intended to deploy from Odysseus and take the first photographs of a spacecraft landing on the moon from a third-person perspective It also planned to test an electrodynamic dust shield system in space for the first time and utilize a Wi-Fi connection to transmit data for the first time on the lunar surface.\n\n\nDesign and objectives\nEagleCam's primary payload was its camera system, consisting of three fisheye-lens [78]: 2  cameras which would take a total of nine images per second over six seconds as it was ejected from Odysseus shortly before landing A fourth [79] camera was included to test another one of EagleCam's payloads, an electrodynamic dust shield (EDS), created by the Swamp Works facility at Kennedy Space Center [80] The CubeSat was powered from a solar-powered battery with a lifetime of 30 minutes [81]\n\n\nMission summary\nJust before landing, at approximately 30 m (98 ft) above the lunar surface, Odysseus was to eject this CubeSat Once ejected, EagleCam was supposed to semi-hard land on the lunar surface somewhere near the lander at 10 m/s (33 ft/s) As it descended to the surface EagleCam was planned to capture the first third-person images of a lunar landing [90] However, due to complications arising from a software patch which reconfigured the lander's sensors used during the final descent phase to the moon's surface, EagleCam was powered off and remained attached to Odysseus through landing [91] [79] It was later ejected on February 28 but was a partial failure as it returned all types of data, except post IM-1 landing images that were the main aim of its mission [92] [93] [94] [95]  [96] [84] “We reset the visual processing unit and powered up the EagleCam, and were able to eject it, and (we) ejected it about 4 meters away from the vehicle safely However, either in camera or in the Wi-Fi signal back to the lander, something might not be working correctly So, the Embry‑Riddle team is working on that and wrestling with that to see if there’s anything they can do,” Steve Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines commented on EagleCam in a NASA-IM mission update [97] The EagleCam utilized a Wi-Fi connection with the Odysseus lander to relay its images back to Earth [82]\n\n\nSee

The commissioning burn was eventually completed on February 16, resulting in a 21 m/s (47 mph) change in the lander's velocity.\n\n**Trajectory Correction**\n\nIntuitive Machines planned for up to three trajectory adjustment maneuvers during the trans-lunar phase of the mission. The first maneuver was completed on February 18, and after the second maneuver on February 20, there was no need for a third.\n\n**Lunar Orbit**\n\nThe Odysseus lander performed its lunar orbit insertion (LOI) on February 21, altering its velocity by 800 m/s (1,800 mph). Intuitive Machines reported that the 408-second main engine LOI burn placed the lander in a 92 km (57 mi) lunar orbit.\n\n**Lunar Landing**\n\nA favored landing site in 2020 was between the Sea of Serenity (Mare Serenitatis) and the Sea of Crises (Mare Crisium). However, a lunar highlands location near the south pole of the Moon was chosen for the landing, as this region is believed to have a source of water for a future lunar base.\n\n**Surface Operations**\n\nOn February 23, Intuitive Machines reported that the IM-1 Odysseus lander was still \"alive and well,\" and that IM was continuing to receive data on the vehicle's status and whether the scientific payloads could still be deployed.\n\n**EagleCam**\n\nThe EagleCam was a deployable CubeSat camera system designed especially to photograph the lunar landing of the Nova-C Odysseus lander on the Moon. Photographs taken during the lunar landing of the Odysseus lander may also have enabled a better understanding of the dynamics of lunar landings on the lunar regolith and rock surfaces in the vicinity of the Moon's south pole.\n\nThe EagleCam was designed and manufactured by staff and students working in the Space Technologies Laboratory at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach. It was intended to deploy from Odysseus and take the first photographs of a spacecraft landing on the moon from a third-person perspective.\n\n**Design and Objectives**\n\nEagleCam's primary payload was its camera system, consisting of three fisheye-lens cameras which would take a total of nine images per second over six seconds as it was ejected from Odysseus shortly before landing. A fourth camera was included to test another one of EagleCam's payloads, an electrodynamic dust shield (EDS), created by the Swamp Works facility at Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe CubeSat was powered from a solar-powered battery with a lifetime of 30 minutes. Once ejected, EagleCam was supposed to semi-hard land on the lunar surface somewhere near the lander at 10 m/s (33 ft/s). As it descended to the surface EagleCam was planned to capture the first third-person images of a lunar landing.\n\n**Mission Summary**\n\nJust before landing, at approximately 30 m (98 ft) above the lunar surface, Odysseus was to eject this CubeSat. However, due to complications arising from a software patch which reconfigured the lander's sensors used during the final descent phase to the moon's surface, EagleCam was powered off and remained attached to Odysseus through landing.\n\nIt was later ejected on February 28 but was a partial failure as it returned all types of data, except post IM-1 landing images that were the main aim of its mission.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"IM-1\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground and selection\nIn December 2017, Space Policy Directive 1 signaled an intention to return astronauts to the Moon [13] Excerpts from NASA documents obtained by The New York Times suggested the agency would prioritize the private spaceflight sector [14] [15] In November 2018, NASA announced the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, selecting nine companies to deploy payloads for the agency [16] In May 2019, NASA announced that Astrobotic Technology, Intuitive Machines, and Orbit Beyond would develop lunar landers, awarding Intuitive Machines US$77 million [17] Intuitive Machines was paid US$118 million to develop the Odysseus lunar lander used in the IM-1 mission.\n\n\nMission hardware\nOdysseus was equipped with six instruments developed by NASA, including a laser retroreflector array, a lidar navigation device, a stereo camera, a low-frequency radio receiver, the Lunar Node-1 beacon, and an instrument to monitor propellant levels Additionally, a camera built by students at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, a planned Moon telescope, and a Jeff Koons art project were also on board [21] In total the payloads comprise six NASA scientific instruments and six commercial instruments (five of the latter being scientific and one cultural) [22]\n\n\nMission events\nIn December 2023, Odysseus arrived at Kennedy Space Center for processing [42] On January 31, 2024, the Odysseus spacecraft was encapsulated in the payload fairing of its Falcon 9 Block 5 launch vehicle [43] On February 13, IM announced that two wet dress rehearsals loading Odysseus with propellants had been successful and they were ready for launch [44]

post IM-1 landing images that were the main aim of its mission [92] [93] [94] [95]  [96] [84] “We reset the visual processing unit and powered up the EagleCam, and were able to eject it, and (we) ejected it about 4 meters away from the vehicle safely However, either in camera or in the Wi-Fi signal back to the lander, something might not be working correctly So, the Embry‑Riddle team is working on that and wrestling with that to see if there’s anything they can do,” Steve Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines commented on EagleCam in a NASA-IM mission update [97] The EagleCam utilized a Wi-Fi connection with the Odysseus lander to relay its images back to Earth [82]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Vince_McMahon", "content": "\nEarly life\nMcMahon was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, on August 24, 1945, [13] to Victoria (née Hanner; 1920–2022) [14] and Vincent James McMahon (1914–1984), who left the family when McMahon was still a baby and took McMahon's older brother Roderick James McMahon III (1943–2021) [15] [16] with him McMahon did not meet his father until the age of 12 [17] McMahon's paternal grandfather was the boxing promoter Roderick James \"Jess\" McMahon, [18] whose parents were Irish immigrants from County Galway [19] [20]\n\n\nBusiness career\nMid 20th Century\n\n\nEarly business dealings\nMcMahon first met the promoter for Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC), his father, Vincent J McMahon, when 12 At that point, McMahon became interested in following in his father's professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to Madison Square Garden McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not allow him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers [24]\n\n\nProfessional wrestling\nWhen he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions Various promoters understood that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades [29] The National Wrestling Alliance became the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become In 1983, the WWF split from the NWA again (it had left the NWA in 1963 but rejoined in 1971) \n\n\nPurchase of the WWF and 1980s wrestling boom\nWhen he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions Various promoters understood that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades [29] The National Wrestling Alliance became the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become In 1983, the WWF split from the NWA again (it had left the NWA in 1963 but rejoined in 1971) \n\n\nBusiness decline and the Attitude Era\nIn 1993, the company entered the New Generation Era, one of McMahon's toughest times since taking over the company as business went up and down with various projects in the company [32]\n\n\nMonday Night War and acquisition of WCW and ECW\nOn June 24, 1999, McMahon appeared on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show and said he viewed Ted Turner as his rival, stating \"All I'll say about Ted is he's a son-of-a-bitch, other than that, he's probably not a bad guy, but I don't like him at all\" [36]\n\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund lawsuit: WWF becomes WWE\nOn May 5, 2002, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc announced that it would be changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after the company had lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark [42] The name change officially occurred the following day on May 6 Although mainly caused by the ruling in favor of the World Wildlife Fund regarding the \"WWF\" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment [43]\n\n\nRuthless Aggression Era and transition to PG rating\nShortly after its name change, WWE transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression Era; McMahon officially referred to the new era as \"Ruthless Aggression\" on June 24, 2002 [44] This period still featured many similar elements of its predecessor the Attitude Era, including the levels of violence, sex, and profanity, but there was less politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased [45]\n\n\nCompetition with AEW\nIn 2019, Tony Khan's All Elite Wrestling (better known as AEW) emerged as the second largest professional wrestling promotion in the market after WWE, and during a conference call on July 25, 2019, McMahon announced a new direction for WWE where he stated that it would \"be a bit edgier, but still remain in the PG environment\" [50] In another conference call on July 29, 2021, McMahon stated that he doesn't consider AEW competition and that he was \"not so sure what their investments are as far as their talent is concerned\" [51] WWE NXT and AEW Dynamite competed in the Wednesday Night Wars, from October 2, 2019, to April 7, 2021, which ended with AEW Dynamite emerging victorious and NXT moving to Tuesday nights [52] This eventually led WWE to revamp NXT with major changes to \"NXT 2.0\" starting from the September 14, 2021, episode [53]\n\n\nResignation and retirement\nMcMahon voluntarily stepped down as chairman and CEO of WWE on June 17, 2022, pending an internal investigation, with his daughter Stephanie McMahon being named the interim CEO and interim chairwoman of the WWE [6] [54] [55] McMahon continued to oversee WWE creative and content development [56] On July 22, Vince McMahon officially announced his retirement from WWE and named his daughter Stephanie McMahon, the company's new permanent chairwoman and co-CEO (alongside Nick Khan) [8] [57] [58] [59] Triple H then replaced Vince McMahon as Head of WWE creative [60]\n\n\nTKO executive chairman and second resignation\nIt was announced on January 6, 2023 by The Wall Street Journal that McMahon was planning a return to WWE as executive chairman, ahead of upcoming media rights negotiations in 2024 and also to explore a potential sale of the company On January 6, WWE published a filing with the SEC, appointing Vince McMahon by himself, George Barrios and Michelle Wilson back to the WWE Board of Directors [61] [62] [63] On January 10, McMahon assumed the role of executive Chairman of the WWE [9] On April 3, Endeavor Group Holdings announced a deal under which WWE would merge with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to form a new publicly traded company trading under the symbol \"TKO\" Endeavor will hold a 51% stake in TKO, with WWE's shareholders having a 49% stake, valuing WWE at $9.3 billion [64] McMahon will serve as the executive chairman of TKO and oversee the new company's WWE and UFC divisions [64] Upon completion of the deal, McMahon was expected to personally own 34% of TKO Group [65]\n\n\nOther business dealings\nIn 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the Cape Cod Coliseum and the Cape Cod Buccaneers of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts (including Van Halen and Rush) in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a great benefit to WWE's success [71]\n\n\nCharity work\nVince and Linda McMahon donated over $8 million in 2008, giving grants to the Fishburne Military School, Sacred Heart University, and East Carolina University Nonprofit Quarterly noted the majority of the McMahons' donations were toward capital expenditures [76] In 2006, they paid $2.5 million for construction of a tennis facility in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania [76] The McMahons have supported the Special Olympics since 1986, first developing an interest through their friendship with NBC producer Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James, who encouraged them to participate [77]\n\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nBefore the evolution of the Mr McMahon character, McMahon appeared as a commentator on television  His executive role was not publicized to maintain the illusion of wrestling's staged story lines, or kayfabe While McMahon did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on television his ownership of the WWF was considered an open secret through the mid-1990s Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of McMahon.\n\n\nWWE and predecessors (1969–2024)\nBefore the evolution of the Mr McMahon character, McMahon appeared as a commentator on television  His executive role was not publicized to maintain the illusion of wrestling's staged story lines, or kayfabe While McMahon did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on television his ownership of the WWF was considered an open secret through the mid-1990s Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of McMahon.\n\n\nCommentator (1969–1997)\nBefore the evolution of the Mr McMahon character, McMahon appeared as a commentator on television  His executive role was not publicized to maintain the illusion of wrestling's staged story lines, or kayfabe While McMahon did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on television his ownership of the WWF was considered an open secret through the mid-1990s Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of McMahon.\n\n\nCreation of the Mr. McMahon character (1996–1997)\nThroughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company's lead play-by-play commentator On the September 23, 1996 Monday Night Raw, Jim Ross delivered a worked shoot promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as chairman and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines This was followed up on the October 23 Raw with Stone Cold Steve Austin referring to then-WWF President Gorilla Monsoon as \"just a puppet\" and that it was McMahon \"pulling all the strings\" The March 17, 1997 WWF Raw Is War is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr McMahon character, as after Bret Hart lost to Sycho Sid in a steel cage match for the WWF Championship, Hart engaged in an expletive-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler [24]\n\n\nFeud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997–1999)\nIn December 1997 on Raw Is War, the night after D-Generation X: In Your House, McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of Stone Cold Steve Austin, such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself Mr McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental Championship against The Rock in a rematch As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the Nation of Domination gang Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead, Austin gave The Rock a Stone Cold Stunner and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.\n\n\nMcMahon-Helmsley Faction (2000–2001)\nMcMahon returned to WWF television on the March 13, 2000 Raw Is War helping The Rock win his WWF title shot back from the Big Show He also attacked Shane McMahon and Triple H [89] Two weeks later, McMahon and The Rock defeated Shane McMahon and The Big Show in a tag team match with help from special guest referee Mankind [89] At WrestleMania 2000, Triple H defended the WWF Championship in a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match in which each competitor had a McMahon in his corner Triple H had his wife Stephanie McMahon who was also the WWF Women's Champion in his corner, The Rock had Vince McMahon in his corner, Mick Foley had Linda McMahon in his corner, and Big Show had Shane in his corner After Big Show and Foley were eliminated, Triple H and The Rock were left Although Vince was in The Rock's corner, he turned on The Rock after hitting him with a chair, turning heel for the first time since his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, which helped Triple H win the match and retain his title [90] This began the McMahon-Helmsley Era.\n\n\nWCW/ECW Invasion and the brand extension (2001–2005)\nMcMahon purchased long-time rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001 from AOL Time Warner and signed many wrestlers from the organization This marked the beginning of the Invasion storyline, in which the former WCW wrestlers regularly fought matches against the WWF wrestlers On the July 9, 2001, episode of Raw Is War, some extremists as well as several former ECW wrestlers on the WWF roster, joined with the WCW wrestlers to form The Alliance Stone Cold Steve Austin joined the Alliance, along with Shane and Stephanie McMahon Vince McMahon led Team WWF thus turning face At Survivor Series, Team WWF defeated Team Alliance in a Survivor Series elimination match to pick up the victory and end the Invasion storyline [94]\n\n\nVarious feuds (2005–2013)\nHe began a feud with Eric Bischoff in late 2005, when he decided that Bischoff was not doing a good job as general manager of Raw turning face again He started \"The Trial of Eric Bischoff\" where McMahon served as the judge Bischoff ended up losing the trial; McMahon \"fired\" him, and put him in a garbage truck before it drove away Bischoff stayed gone for months Almost a year later on Raw in late 2006, Bischoff was brought out by McMahon's executive assistant Jonathan Coachman so that he could announce the completion of his book Controversy Creates Cash Bischoff began blasting remarks at McMahon, saying that he was fired \"unceremoniously\" as the Raw General Manager, that there would be no McMahon if not for Bischoff's over-the-top rebellious ideas, and that D-Generation X was nothing but a rip off of the New World Order [citation needed]\n\n\nThe Authority (2013–2017)\nFrom June 2013, members of the McMahon family began to dispute various elements of the control of WWE, such as the fates of Daniel Bryan, and of Raw and SmackDown general managers Brad Maddox and Vickie Guerrero [139] After Triple H and Stephanie created The Authority, McMahon celebrated Randy Orton's victory at TLC with them, but stepped aside from his on-screen authority role in early 2014 to evaluate Triple H and Stephanie's control of the company.\n\n\nSporadic appearances and retirement (2018–2022)\nOn January 22, 2018, McMahon returned on Raw 25 Years to address the WWE Universe, only to later turn on them by calling them \"cheap\" turning heel once again He was later confronted, and stunnered, by Stone Cold Steve Austin On March 12, McMahon made an appearance in a backstage segment with Roman Reigns, announcing that Reigns would be suspended for his recent actions On SmackDown 1000 McMahon returned as face once again after dancing on TruthTV McMahon returned once again to WWE television on the December 17, 2018, episode of Monday Night Raw, accompanied by his son Shane, daughter Stephanie McMahon, and his son-in-law Triple H, promising to shake things up as they admitted they weren't performing as well as they should have McMahon announced that the four of them would now run both Monday Night Raw and SmackDown Live collectively In early 2019, McMahon entered in the feud between Daniel Bryan and Kofi Kingston, not letting that latter receive a WWE championship match at WrestleMania [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited States Wrestling Association (1993)\nWhile the Mr McMahon character marked the first time that McMahon had been portrayed as a villain in WWF, in 1993, McMahon was engaged in a feud with Jerry Lawler as part of a cross-promotion between the WWF and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) As part of the angle, McMahon sent various WWF wrestlers to Memphis to dethrone Lawler as the \"king of professional wrestling\" This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF [157]\n\n\nProfessional wrestling style and persona\nMcMahon's on-screen persona is known for his throaty exclamation of \"You're fired!\", and his \"power walk\", an exaggerated strut toward the ring, swinging his arms and bobbing his head from side to side in a cocky manner According to Jim Cornette, the power walk was inspired by one of McMahon's favorite wrestlers as a child, Dr Jerry Graham The Fabulous Moolah claims in her autobiography that \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers was the inspiration for the walk [161] According to composer Jim Johnston, the idea behind his theme song, \"No Chance in Hell\", was \"He's got the power, the money, and ..., he was pretty much the only game in town ..

He is the majority owner, chairman, and CEO of WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.). McMahon is best known for his role as the owner and promoter of the WWE, which he has been since the 1980s.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMcMahon was born on August 24, 1945, in Pinehurst, North Carolina, to Victoria (née Hanner) and Vincent James McMahon. His paternal grandfather, Roderick James \"Jess\" McMahon, was a boxing promoter. McMahon's family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, when he was a child. He attended the University of Connecticut, where he studied business and graduated in 1968.\n\n**Business Career**\n\nIn the mid-20th century, McMahon began his career in the entertainment industry by working for his father's company, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC). He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age and often accompanied his father on trips to Madison Square Garden. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not allow him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.\n\n**Professional Wrestling**\n\nWhen he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions. Various promoters understood that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades. The National Wrestling Alliance became the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan. McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the NWA again (it had left the NWA in 1963 but rejoined in 1971).\n\n**Purchase of the WWF and 1980s Wrestling Boom**\n\nWhen he purchased the WWF in 1982, professional wrestling was a business run by regional promotions.

On January 6, WWE published a filing with the SEC, appointing Vince McMahon by himself, George Barrios and Michelle Wilson back to the WWE Board of Directors.\n\n**Other Business Dealings**\n\nIn 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the Cape Cod Coliseum and the Cape Cod Buccaneers of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts (including Van Halen and Rush) in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences.\n\n**Charity Work**\n\nVince and Linda McMahon donated over $8 million in 2008, giving grants to the Fishburne Military School, Sacred Heart University, and East Carolina University.

The novel is a prequel to the original trilogy, exploring the events leading up to the creation of the Hunger Games and the rise of the Capitol's tyrannical regime. The book follows the story of 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow, a charismatic and cunning student at the Capitol Academy, as he navigates the treacherous world of the 10th Hunger Games.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe novel takes place 64 years before the events of the original trilogy, when the 10th Hunger Games are about to take place. In an effort to revive the declining viewership of the Games, the Capitol introduces new features, such as tribute interviews and sponsors who gift supplies to the tributes. Eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow sees an opportunity to win the Plinth Prize, a prestigious award that will cover his university tuition and restore his family's reputation.\n\nCoriolanus is assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird, a talented and charismatic tribute from District 12. As the Games progress, Coriolanus becomes increasingly obsessed with winning the Plinth Prize and restoring his family's honor. He uses his charm and cunning to manipulate Lucy Gray and the other tributes, often walking a fine line between loyalty and betrayal.\n\nThroughout the novel, Collins explores the complexities of the Hunger Games universe, delving into themes of oppression, rebellion, and the exploitation of the poor by the wealthy. The novel also highlights the moral ambiguities of the Capitol's regime, as Coriolanus and Lucy Gray navigate the treacherous landscape of the Games and the Capitol's manipulation of the tributes.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe novel features a cast of complex and multidimensional characters, each with their own motivations and backstories. Coriolanus Snow is the central character, and his transformation from a charismatic and ambitious student to a ruthless and cunning mentor is a key aspect of the novel.\n\nLucy Gray Baird is a talented and charismatic tribute from District 12, who becomes Coriolanus's mentee. Her backstory and motivations are slowly revealed throughout the novel, adding depth and complexity to her character.\n\nThe novel also features a range of supporting characters, including Coriolanus's friends and rivals at the Capitol Academy, as well as the other mentors and tributes who participate in the 10th Hunger Games.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Collins's world-building and character development. The novel was praised for its thought-provoking exploration of the Hunger Games universe, as well as its nuanced portrayal of the complexities of the Capitol's regime.\n\nSome critics noted that the novel was a departure from the original trilogy, with a more introspective and character-driven approach. Others praised Collins's ability to balance action and suspense with character development and emotional depth.\n\nThe novel was also praised for its diverse cast of characters, including Lucy Gray's complex and multifaceted personality. Overall, the reception of the novel was overwhelmingly positive, with many praising Collins's ability to expand and deepen the Hunger Games universe.\n\n**Film Adaptation**\n\nIn August 2017, Lionsgate's CEO, Jon Feltheimer, expressed an interest in spin-offs of The Hunger Games, with intentions to create a writers' room to explore the concept. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes has been confirmed as a potential film adaptation, with Francis Lawrence set to direct and Suzanne Collins set to write the screenplay.\n\nWhile there have been no official announcements regarding the production or release of the film, the confirmation of the project suggests that Lionsgate is serious about exploring the Hunger Games universe in new and innovative ways.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a thought-provoking and character-driven novel that expands and deepens the Hunger Games universe. With its nuanced portrayal of the Capitol's regime and its exploration of themes such as oppression and rebellion, the novel is a must-read for fans of the series.\n\nThe novel's complex characters and moral ambiguities make it a compelling and engaging read, and its thought-provoking themes and ideas will leave readers thinking long after they finish the book. With its positive reception and potential film adaptation, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is an exciting and promising addition to the Hunger Games franchise.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Ballad_of_Songbirds_and_Snakes\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nTo help revive the televised Hunger Games' declining viewership, 24 Capitol Academy students are chosen to mentor tributes for the upcoming 10th Hunger Games and new features are added to the Games, such as tribute interviews and sponsors that gift supplies to the tributes Eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow hopes to win the offered Plinth Prize to pay his way to the university and return the Snow family's prestige \n\n\nCharacters\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes has received positive reviews [4] Even though book critics had an overall mixed reception to the novel on its release day, [5] according to Book Marks, the book received a \"positive\" consensus, based on nineteen critic reviews: six \"rave\", nine \"positive\", two \"mixed\", and two \"pan\" [6] In Books in the Media, a site that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a  (3.75 out of 5) from the site which was based on seven critic reviews [7] [8]\n\n\nReception\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes has received positive reviews [4] Even though book critics had an overall mixed reception to the novel on its release day, [5] according to Book Marks, the book received a \"positive\" consensus, based on nineteen critic reviews: six \"rave\", nine \"positive\", two \"mixed\", and two \"pan\" [6] In Books in the Media, a site that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a  (3.75 out of 5) from the site which was based on seven critic reviews [7] [8]\n\n\nFilm adaptation\nIn August 2017, Lionsgate's CEO, Jon Feltheimer, expressed an interest in spin-offs of The Hunger Games, with intentions to create a writers' room to explore the concept [14]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

2010 [9] [10] and is part of the 2 km2 (490-acre) Downtown Dubai development at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district \n\n\nConception\nBurj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development to include 30,000 homes, [15] nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential skyscrapers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake The decision to build Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based According to officials, projects like Burj Khalifa needed to be built to garner more international recognition and hence investment \"He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,\" said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties [16]\n\n\nRecords\nThe Burj Khalifa set several world records, including:\n\n\nArchitecture and design\nThe tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM), which also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan [31] [32] Due to its tubular system, proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction, compared to the Empire State Building [31] [33] Khan's contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work [34] The design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's Lake Point Tower When Adrian Smith was conceiving the project at SOM, he looked out his office window toward Lake Point Tower's curved three-wing layout and thought, \"There's the prototype\" [35] According to Strabala, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73rd floor Tower Palace Three, an all-residential building in Seoul In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential [36]\n\n\nPlumbing systems\nThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000 L (250,000 U.S. gal) of water per day through 100 km (62 mi) of pipes [21] [55] An additional 213 km (132 mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34 km (21 mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system [55]\n\n\nAir conditioning\nThe air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground [56] At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is 46 MW (62,000 hp), equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000 lb; 12,000,000 kg) of melting ice in one day [55] Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park [21]\n\n\nWindow cleaning\nTo wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000 m2 (1,290,000 sq ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks, each holding a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) bucket machine Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used The top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access [57] [58] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior [41] [59]\n\n\nFeatures\nOutside the Burj Khalifa, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh 800 million (US$217 million) Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270 m (900 ft) long and shoots water 150 m (500 ft) into the air while accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music It is the world's largest choreographed fountain [61] On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain

opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor At 452 m (1,483 ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened [63] After this was initially surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488 m (1,601 ft), [64] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555 m (1,821 ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014 Subsequently, on February 18, 2019, the Burj Khalifa also opened The Lounge observatory at 584 m (1,916 ft) – the highest lounge in the world, [65] [66] However, in June 2016 the Shanghai Tower opened with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres, thus taking the title of the world's highest observation deck \n\n\nPark\nBurj Khalifa is surrounded by an eleven-hectare (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group [77] Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant [78] At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower [79]\n\n\nFloor plan\nOn the higher floors, the sun is seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level Those living above the 80th floor should wait two extra minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor should wait three minutes [83]\n\n\nRamadan observance\nOn the higher floors, the sun is seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level Those living above the 80th floor should wait two extra minutes

the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101 [84] Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with BESIX from Belgium and Arabtec from the UAE [85] [86] Turner was the project manager on the main construction contract [87] Hong Kong-based Far East Aluminium combined to provide the exterior cladding for Burj Khalifa [88] [89]\n\n\nMilestones\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2) [113] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5 billion [6]\n\n\nReal estate values\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the

Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere [120] Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene [121] In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected [122]\n\n\nControversies\nOn 10 May 2011, an Asian migrant worker in his mid-30s jumped to his death from the 147th floor onto the 108th floor's deck Dubai police said he killed himself because his company refused to let him leave the country [125]\n\n\nDeadly incidents\nOn 10 May 2011, an Asian migrant worker in his mid-30s jumped to his death from the 147th floor onto the 108th floor's deck Dubai police said he killed himself because his company refused to let him leave the country [125]\n\n\nLabour\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia [129] [130] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment [131] [132] On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site [108] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84 [129] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay [133] [134] [135] During construction, one construction-related death was reported [136] Workplace injuries and deaths in the UAE are poorly documented, according to Human Rights Watch [133]\n\n\nNew Year's Eve\nEmaar New Year's Eve is an annual event held every 31 December at Burj Khalifa, organised by Emaar Properties [137] [138] The event consists of fireworks launched from Burj Khalifa, a light and laser show on the facade of Burj Khalifa, and an accompanying soundtrack and a special fountain show on The Dubai Fountain choreographed to the soundtrack [139] [140] The Emaar New Year's Eve fireworks celebration originated in 2010 with the inauguration of the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa The celebration was broadcast live to more than 2 million people and lasted for 3 minutes [141]\n\n\nBASE jumping\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\n\n\nClimbing\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \"Spiderman\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa The climb to the top of the spire took 6 hours To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness [157]\n\n\nAwards\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\" award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat [158] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for the best project of the year at the

the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101 [84] Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with BESIX from Belgium and Arabtec from the UAE [85] [86] Turner was the project manager on the main construction contract [87] Hong Kong-based Far East Aluminium combined to provide the exterior cladding for Burj Khalifa [88] [89]\n\n\nMilestones\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2) [113] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5 billion [6]\n\n\nReal estate values\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the

Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere [120] Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene [121] In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected

company refused to let him leave the country [125]\n\n\nDeadly incidents\nOn 10 May 2011, an Asian migrant worker in his mid-30s jumped to his death from the 147th floor onto the 108th floor's deck Dubai police said he killed himself because his company refused to let him leave the country [125]\n\n\nLabour\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia [129] [130] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment [131] [132] On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site [108] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84 [129] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay [133] [134] [135] During construction, one construction-related death was reported [136] Workplace injuries and deaths in the UAE are poorly documented, according to Human Rights Watch [133]\n\n\nNew Year's Eve\nEmaar New Year's Eve is an annual event held every 31 December at Burj Khalifa, organised by Emaar Properties [137] [138] The event consists of fireworks launched from Burj Khalifa, a light and laser show on the facade of Burj Khalifa, and an accompanying soundtrack and a special fountain show on The Dubai Fountain choreographed to the soundtrack [139] [140] The Emaar New Year's Eve fireworks celebration originated in 2010 with the inauguration of the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa The celebration was broadcast live to more than 2 million people and lasted for 3 minutes [141]\n\n\nBASE jumping\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\n\n\nClimbing\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \"Spiderman\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa The climb to the top of the spire took 6 hours To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness [157]\n\n\nAwards\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\" award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat [158] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for the best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010 [159] Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, said:\n\n\nSee also\n25°11′50″N 55°16′27″E﻿ / ﻿25.19722°N 55.27417°E﻿ / 25.19722;
