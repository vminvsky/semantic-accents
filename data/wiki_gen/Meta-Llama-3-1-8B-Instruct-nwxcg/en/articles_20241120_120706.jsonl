Grant**\n\nRichard E. Grant is a British actor, director, and screenwriter, best known for his roles in the films \"Withnail & I\" and \"Bridget Jones's Diary\", as well as his more recent roles in the television series \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Downton Abbey\".\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRichard Grant was born as Richard Grant Esterhuysen on 5 May 1957 in Mbabane, a city in the Protectorate of Swaziland (now the Kingdom of Eswatini). He is the elder child of Henrik Esterhuysen and Leonne Esterhuysen. Henrik was the head of education for the British government administration in the British protectorate of Swaziland. Grant has English, Dutch/Afrikaner, and German ancestry. He has a younger brother, Stuart, an accountant in Johannesburg, from whom he is estranged. Grant has stated that they \"never had any relationship\".\n\nGrant spent his childhood in Swaziland, where he was exposed to a unique cultural and linguistic environment. He has spoken about how this experience influenced his accent and way of speaking, which has been noted by others as being from a bygone era. Grant's family moved to England when he was a teenager, and he later attended the University of Bristol, where he studied English literature.\n\n**Career**\n\nGrant's early career in the arts began with his involvement in the Space Theatre Company in Cape Town, South Africa. He later moved to London in 1982 to pursue a career in acting. Grant has spoken about how he struggled to make a name for himself in the early days of his career, and how he often felt like an outsider in the British theatre world.\n\nGrant's breakthrough role came in 1987, when he played the role of \"Charlie\" in the film \"Withnail & I\". The film was a critical and commercial success, and it established Grant as a rising star in the British film industry. He went on to appear in a number of other successful films, including \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\".\n\nIn addition to his film work, Grant has also had a successful career in television. He has appeared in a number of television series, including \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Downton Abbey\". He has also written and directed several television shows, including the BBC series \"Bergerac\".\n\n**Writing and Directing**\n\nGrant has written and directed several films, including the 2005 film \"Wah-Wah\". The film is loosely based on his own childhood experiences growing up in Swaziland. Grant wrote the screenplay for the film, and he also directed it. The film took him over seven years to complete, and it starred Nicholas Hoult in the lead role.\n\nGrant has spoken about how the experience of making \"Wah-Wah\" was a challenging but rewarding one. He has said that he was drawn to the project because of its personal connections to his own life, and because of its unique cultural and historical context. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Grant's direction and his ability to convey the complexities of his characters.\n\nGrant has also written a book about his experience making \"Wah-Wah\", which is titled \"The Wah-Wah Diaries\". The book received positive reviews from critics, who praised Grant's honesty and vulnerability in sharing his story.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGrant married voice coach Joan Washington in 1986, and they had one daughter together, Olivia. They also had a stepson, Tom, from Joan's previous marriage. Joan was a talented voice coach who worked with a number of actors, including Grant himself. She was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, and she died on 2 September 2021.\n\nGrant has spoken about how his wife's death was a devastating blow to him, and how it has affected his life and his work. He has said that he is grateful for the time they had together, and that he is proud of the life they built as a family.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ \"Withnail & I\" (1987)\n\t+ \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001)\n\t+ \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992)\n\t+ \"Wah-Wah\" (2005)\n* **Television**\n\t+ \"Game of Thrones\" (2011-2019)\n\t+ \"Downton Abbey\" (2010-2015)\n\t+ \"Bergerac\" (1981-1991)\n* **Video Games**\n\t+ \"Assassin's Creed: Valhalla\" (2020)\n* **Other**\n\t+ \"The Wah-Wah Diaries\" (book, 2006)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* **BAFTA Awards**\n\t+ Nominated for Best Actor for \"Withnail & I\" (1988)\n\t+ Nominated for Best Actor for \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2002)\n* **Emmy Awards**\n\t+ Nominated for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for \"Game of Thrones\" (2015)\n* **Golden Globe Awards**\n\t+ Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2002)\n* **Other Awards**\n\t+ Won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actor for \"Wah-Wah\" (2006)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Grant, Richard E.

(1990), \"Vecna disappeared throughout the rest of the '90s, until Domains of Dread (1997)\" which confirmed his new location in the realm of Ravenloft [16] However, it wasn't until 1998 that there

the deities of Greyhawk In both, he is listed as the god of evil secrets Additionally, both his hand and eye are listed as artifacts In the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (2015), Vecna is mentioned as a possible God for the Arcana Cleric Domain, as well as a Warlock patron of the Undying [31]\n\n\nRelated artifacts\nThe left hand and eye of Vecna's original \"mortal\" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical artifacts [28] To use the powers of the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna one is required to cut off one's own corresponding body part and affix Vecna's in its place \"The new bearer of the Eye or Hand (or both) will gain access to powerful spell-like abilities, but the items will slowly corrupt them, turning them evil over time\" [44] These artifacts were introduced in the third supplement to the original D&D rules, Eldritch Wizardry They went on to appear in all subsequent D&D editions They

clairaudience and create sonic blasts, and enables them to understand any spoken language A lich known as Osterneth possesses the \"Heart of Vecna\" according to the Open Grave sourcebook.\n\n\nHead of Vecna\nThe Head of Vecna was a hoax that one adventuring party played on another in a campaign run by game master Mark Steuer  One of the groups tricked the other into going on a quest for the Head of Vecna, a hoax artifact that was supposedly similar to his Hand and Eye, but was simply an ordinary severed head  The hoax takes advantage of the fact that the Eye and Hand require a person to remove their own eye or hand and replace it with the artifact to function  The characters involved in the story reasoned that they needed to decapitate themselves to gain the powers of the Head of Vecna, and several members of the group actually fought over which character would get to have his head cut off and replaced  After the third character died, the joke was revealed [56]\n\n\nFictional history\nVecna is usually depicted as a powerful magician resembling a desiccated corpse missing his left hand and eye A constant theme in the adventures in which the character appears is Vecna's

In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the Serpent In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna The famed cambion lich, Acererak, once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown Among Vecna's staunchest foes are Kas, Iuz, Saint Cuthbert, the Lady of Pain, Pholtus, and the Circle of Eight He is also opposed by the Old Faith and the Silent Ones.\n\n\nWorshippers\nVecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various

Vecna Lives (1991) and Die Vecna, Die (2000) [61] [19] On the second module, Lucard wrote, \"I love Vecna and I love Greyhawk  [...] Players will encounter some of the most iconic and evil characters

He is a lich, a undead sorcerer who has achieved mastery over the dark arts. Vecna's history and mythology have evolved over the years, from his first appearance in the 1976 supplement \"Eldritch Wizardry\" to his current status as a major deity in the D&D pantheon.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nVecna's first appearance in D&D was in the 1976 supplement \"Eldritch Wizardry,\" where he was introduced as a legendary lich who had been destroyed long ago. The supplement described Vecna's Hand and Eye, two powerful magical artifacts that were said to be the only remnants of his existence. The name \"Vecna\" was an anagram of the surname \"Vance,\" a nod to the fantasy author Jack Vance, whose works inspired the magic system used in D&D.\n\n**Original Dungeons & Dragons**\n\nIn the original D&D rules, Vecna was regarded only as a legend or myth, a long-destroyed legendary lich of great power. However, the Hand and Eye of Vecna were mentioned in the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (1979) as powerful magical artifacts that could be used by players. Vecna's history was expanded in the \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (AD&D) years, where he was reimagined as a demigod and the chief antagonist of the adventure \"Vecna Lives!\" (1990).\n\n**2nd Edition**\n\nTen years after his introduction, Vecna's history was expanded in the AD&D 2nd edition's \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (1989). Vecna's Hand was described in detail, and his history was fleshed out in the adventure \"Vecna Lives!\" (1990). This adventure introduced Vecna as a demigod and the chief antagonist of the story. Vecna's history was further developed in the supplemental sourcebook \"Book of Artifacts\" (1993).\n\n**3rd and 3.5 Edition**\n\nWizards of the Coast continued Vecna's theme of ascending godhood in D&D Third Edition (2000-2002). Vecna was listed as a Lesser deity in the \"Player's Handbook\" (2000), and his role in the 3rd edition Greyhawk setting was defined in the \"Living Greyhawk Gazetteer\" (2000). Vecna's alignment was changed from Lawful Evil to Neutral Evil in Third Edition, and his history was detailed in \"Deities and Demigods\" (2002).\n\n**4th Edition**\n\nVecna appears as one of the deities described in the 2008 \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" for D&D 4th edition. He is primarily the god of secrets, and his Hand has made its return for this edition of the game. Vecna was given a set of statistics in \"Open Grave\" (2008), and his name was used for Wizards of the Coast's server that hosted and handled the new online character builder tool.\n\n**5th Edition**\n\nIn the 5th Edition D&D \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (2014), Vecna appears as a member of the \"Dawn War Pantheon,\" which is mostly derived from the 4th Edition pantheon. He is also included in the \"Player's Handbook\" (2014) as one of the deities of Greyhawk. Vecna is listed as the god of evil secrets, and both his Hand and Eye are listed as artifacts. Vecna is mentioned as a possible God for the Arcana Cleric Domain in the \"Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide\" (2015).\n\n**Related Artifacts**\n\nThe left hand and eye of Vecna's original \"mortal\" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical artifacts.

since Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by Mok'slyk the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself.\n\n\nWritings\nAt some point in his history, Vecna penned a tome known as Ordinary Necromancy [60] He is also rumored to have made significant additions to the Book of Vile Darkness.\n\n\nFictional relationships\nVecna has few allies, and countless enemies In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the Serpent In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna The famed cambion lich, Acererak, once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown Among Vecna's staunchest foes are Kas, Iuz, Saint Cuthbert, the Lady of Pain, Pholtus, and the Circle of Eight He is also opposed by the Old Faith and the Silent Ones.\n\n\nWorshippers\nVecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various points in history, in Diamond Lake, Greyhawk, and Verbobonc Temples to Vecna have also been reported in the Pomarj town of Highport and Erelhei-Cinlu, the debased city at the heart of the Vault of the Drow.\n\n\nScriptures\nBeing a secretive cult, there are no real collections of Vecnan teachings However, copies of the Book of Vile Darkness are highly prized by the cult for Vecna's role in that work's development The Open Grave book offers the \"Scroll of Mauthereign\", which offers a twisted version of Vecna's history and tells his followers that committing evil acts is holy and righteous.\n\n\nHierarchy\nEach position in Vecna's cult is named for a certain body part At the top is Vecna himself, followed by the Voice of Vecna, which can only be filled by Vecna's manifestation.\n\n\nOther Vecnan organizations\nOther Vecnan organizations are known to exist outside of the mainstream cult, and some may have similar or identical names Relations between these groups and the mainstream cult may vary Known examples are the Eyes of Vecna (a cult of undeath consisting mainly of rogues), the Fingers of Vecna (Vecna's personal guard), and the Ebon Triad (a heretical cult seeking to merge Vecna, Hextor, and Erythnul into a single entity).\n\n\nReception\nIn 2013, Alex Lucard, for Diehard GameFAN, highlighted the use of Vecna in two 2nd edition modules: Vecna Lives (1991) and Die Vecna, Die (2000) [61] [19] On the second module, Lucard wrote, \"I love Vecna and I love Greyhawk  [...] Players will encounter some of the most iconic and evil characters in all of Dungeons & Dragons, and have to witness firsthand the end of the Second Edition Universe, and the beginning of Third Edition\" [19]\n\n\nIn other media\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Puerto_Rico", "content": "\nEtymology\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\" [21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borikén, its Indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\" [40] [41] [42] The terms boricua, borinqueño, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage, [43] [44] and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively [45] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\" [46]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos The Taíno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare [61]\n\n\nU.S. era\nIn 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S [citation needed]\n\n\n21st century\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence [64] In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections [65] [66] The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S Constitution 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association [67] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence [68] [failed verification]\n\n\nGeography\n18°12′N 66°30′W﻿ / ﻿18.2°N 66.5°W﻿ / 18.2; -66.5﻿ (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico)\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves [103] Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States [114] [115] All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S Constitution [116]\n\n\nPolitical parties and elections\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) The three parties stand for different political status The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S state Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S authority In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds about 5%.\n\n\nPolitical status\nThe nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S Congress, and the United Nations [122] Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S., become a U.S state, or become an independent country [123]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nUnlike the vast majority of U.S states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration; for U.S Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents Municipalities are subdivided into barrios, and those into sectors Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991.\n\n\nForeign and intergovernmental relations\nPuerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá [139] [140]\n\n\nMilitary\nAs it is an unincorporated U.S territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S as its commander-in-chief Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\n\nLaw\nThe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\n\n\nCrime\nThe homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S state in 2014 [152] [153] Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related [154]\n\n\nEconomy\nPuerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund [38] It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740 [162] Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP [163] [o] [p] In recent years, it has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention center district overlooking the Port of San Juan [164]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months The damage was estimated at $100 billion An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal [175] By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce and Arecibo, were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico [176]\n\n\nFiscal debt\nIn early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion [178] The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession [179]\n\n\nPublic finances\nPuerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget) [185] The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000 Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973 [x] [187]\n\n\nCost of living\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade [z] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200]\n\n\nTransportation\nCities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano ('Urban Train') Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as carros públicos (private mini buses).\n\n\nUtilities\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE)—is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico [210] PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018 The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director.\n\n\nElectricity\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE)—is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico [210] PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018 The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director.\n\n\nWater and sewage\nSimilarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish: Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA)—is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico [213] It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly Its existence is designated by Law No 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments [214]\n\n\nTelecommunications\nTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [215] As of 2007 [update], there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island [216] Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letter before the number The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island) [217] Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them [218] They have been a key element in disaster relief [219]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as unincorporated territory of the United States Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics; racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st century United States [221]\n\n\nPopulation distribution\nThe most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census [224] Other major cities include Bayamón, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayagüez) of the island.\n\n\nPopulation makeup\nAs of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9 percent of the population, of which 95.5 percent were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins; only 1.1 percent of the population was non-Hispanic [226] Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1 percent) identified as \"White\", a decline of almost 80 percent; by contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8 percent) reported being multiracial—compared to just 3 percent in 2010—while roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5 percent) [227]\n\n\nImmigration and emigration\nThe vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population [193] Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic, [233] [234] and Cuba [citation needed], use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S mainland Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica [235] [236] Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans In fact, non-hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S mainland Smaller numbers of U.S citizens come from the U.S Virgin Islands There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration' [237] Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S and not recent immigrants Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official languages [242] of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico [243] are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law [244] However, all official business of the U.S District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population [245]\n\n\nReligion\nReligious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014) [249] [250]\n\n\nEducation and literacy\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School) It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology [283]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico [286] As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010 [287]\n\n\nCulture\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\n\n\nArts\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\n\n\nLiterature\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition and in 1647 wrote Descripción de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\") This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island [297]\n\n\nMedia\nThe mass media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish There are also three stations of the U.S Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Día, El Vocero and Índice, Metro, and Primera Hora El Vocero is distributed free of charge, as are Índice and Metro.\n\n\nMusic\nThe music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and the popular  salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton.\n\n\nPhilately\nPuerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S postal stamps Insular Territories were commemorated in 1937, the third stamp honored Puerto Rico featuring 'La Fortaleza', the Spanish Governor's Palace [300] The first free election for governor of the U.S territory of Puerto Rico was honored on 27 April 1949, at San Juan, Puerto Rico 'Inauguration' on the 3-cent stamp refers to the election of Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico [301] San Juan, Puerto Rico was commemorated with an 8-cent stamp on its 450th anniversary issued 12 September 1971, featuring a sentry box from Castillo San Felipe del Morro [302] In the \"Flags of our nation series\" 2008–2012, of the fifty-five, five territorial flags were featured Forever stamps included the Puerto Rico Flag illustrated by a bird issued 2011 [303]\n\n\nCuisine\nPuerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Taínos Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits Main dishes include mofongo, arroz con gandules, pasteles, and pig roast (or lechón) Beverages include maví and piña colada Desserts include flan, arroz con dulce (sweet rice pudding), piraguas, brazo gitanos, tembleque, polvorones, and dulce de leche.\n\n\nSports\nBaseball was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico The Puerto Rico Baseball League serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league No Major League Baseball franchise or affiliate plays in Puerto Rico; however, San Juan hosted the Montreal Expos for several series in 2003 and 2004 before they moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals.\n\n\nSee also\n18°12′N 66°30′W﻿ /

northeastern Caribbean Sea. It is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and several smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, and Mona. The island has a rich history, diverse culture, and stunning natural beauty, making it a popular destination for tourists and a unique place to live.\n\nEtymology\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port.\" The island has also been known as Borinquen, a derivation of Borikén, its Indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord.\" The terms boricua, borinqueño, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage, and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively.

The Spanish rule lasted for nearly four centuries, until Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S.\n\nU.S. era\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S. In 1917, Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship, but this did not necessarily mean they had full rights as citizens. It wasn't until the mid-20th century that Puerto Ricans began to push for greater autonomy and eventually, statehood. In the 1950s and 1960s, Puerto Rico became a hub for manufacturing and tourism, with the construction of the first highway and the development of the island's airport.\n\n21st century\n\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.

The island is located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east of Miami, Florida. The island is approximately 100 miles (160 km) long and 35 miles (56 km) wide, with a total area of about 3,515 square miles (9,104 square kilometers). The island is mountainous, with the Cordillera Central mountain range running north-south through the center of the island. The highest point on the island is Cerro de Punta, which is 3,525 feet (1,074 meters) above sea level.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Puerto Rico is mostly tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year-round, averaging near 85°F (29°C) in lower elevations and 70°F (21°C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year-round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March. The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances.\n\nBiodiversity\n\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves. The island has a rich biodiversity, with many endemic species that can be found nowhere else on the planet. The Puerto Rican parrot is one of the most endangered birds in the world, with only a few dozen individuals remaining in the wild. The island is also home to many species of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, including the Puerto Rican boa, the green sea turtle, and the humpback whale.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States. All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S Constitution.\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish), and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP).

The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S state. Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S authority. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each, while the PIP holds about 5%.\n\nPolitical status\n\nThe nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the U.S Congress, and the United Nations. Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain an unincorporated territory of the U.S, become a U.S state, or become an independent country.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\nUnlike the vast majority of U.S states, Puerto Rico has no first-order administrative divisions akin to counties, but has 78 municipalities or municipios as the secondary unit of administration. For U.S Census purposes, the municipalities are considered county equivalents. Municipalities are subdivided into barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for four-year terms, per the Autonomous Municipalities Act of 1991.\n\nForeign and intergovernmental relations\n\nPuerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the U.S Constitution and is thus restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Latin American countries such as Colombia and Panamá.\n\nMilitary\n\nAs it is an unincorporated U.S territory, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the U.S as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the U.S as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nLaw\n\nThe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\n\nCrime\n\nThe homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S state in 2014. Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers, with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug-related.\n\nEconomy\n\nPuerto Rico is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It is considered the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum and ranks highly on the Human Development Index. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita in Puerto Rico in 2020 was $21,740. Puerto Rico's economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals, and electronics) followed by services (primarily finance, insurance, real estate, and tourism); agriculture represents less than 1% of GNP.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism in Puerto Rico is also an important part of the economy. In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure, disrupting tourism for many months. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal. By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan, Ponce, and Arecibo, were in operation on the island, and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up to 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico.\n\nFiscal debt\n\nIn early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government, which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70 billion. The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.\n\nPublic finances\n\nPuerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8 billion with expenses at about $10.4 billion, creating a structural deficit of $775 million (about 7.9% of the budget). The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 24 consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.\n\nCost of living\n\nThe cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade. According to the Council for Community and Economic Research, the cost of living in San Juan is 146.2% of the national average in the United States. The cost of living index for San Juan is higher than that of other major cities in the United States, such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami.\n\nTransportation\n\nCities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, freeways, expressways, and highways maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the Puerto Rico Police Department. The island's San Juan metropolitan area is served by a public bus transit system and a metro system called Tren Urbano ('Urban Train'). Other forms of Puerto Rican public transport include seaborne ferries that serve Puerto Rico's archipelago as well as carros públicos (private mini buses).\n\nUtilities\n\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA, Spanish: Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, AEE) is an electric power company and the government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico responsible for electricity generation, power transmission, and power distribution in Puerto Rico. PREPA was, by law, the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly until 2018. The Authority is ruled by a governing board appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is run by an executive director.\n\nWater and sewage\n\nSimilarly, the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA, Spanish: Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, AAA) is a water company and the government-owned corporation responsible for water quality, management, and supply in Puerto Rico. It is the only entity authorized to conduct such business in Puerto Rico, effectively making it a government monopoly. Its existence is designated by Law No 40 of 1 May 1945, including the corresponding amendments.\n\nTelecommunications\n\nTelecommunications in Puerto Rico includes radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Broadcasting in Puerto Rico is regulated by the U.S Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As of 2007, there were 30 TV stations, 125 radio stations, and roughly 1 million TV sets on the island. Cable TV subscription services are available, and the U.S Armed Forces Radio and Television Service also broadcast on the island. Puerto Rico also has its own amateur radio prefixes, which differ from those of the contiguous United States in that there are two letters before the number. The most well-known prefix is KP4, but others separated for use on the archipelago (including Desecheo and Mona) are: KP3/KP4/NP3/NP4/WP3/WP4 (Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Culebra) and KP5/NP5/WP5 (Desecheo Island). Amateur radio operators (also known as ham radio operators) are a well-known group in the island and can obtain special vehicle license plates with their callsign on them. They have been a key element in disaster relief.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe population of Puerto Rico reflects influences from initial Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and the archipelago's status as an unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans are characterized by a high degree of ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as a long history of intermarriage and acculturation among different demographics. Racial and ethnic identity is subsequently complex and often nebulous, shaped by the broader attitudes and policies of the Spanish colonial period, 20th-century American racial politics, and modern trends in cultural and identity in the 21st-century United States.\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nThe most populous municipality is the capital, San Juan, with 342,259 people based on the 2020 Census. Other major cities include Bayamón, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayagüez) of the island.\n\nPopulation makeup\n\nAs of 2020, Hispanic or Latinos made up 98.9% of the population, of which 95.5% were Puerto Rican and 3.4% were Hispanic of non-Puerto Rican origins. Only 1.1% of the population was non-Hispanic. Fewer than one-fifth of people (17.1%) identified as \"White,\" a decline of almost 80% from previous decades. By contrast, nearly half of Puerto Ricans (49.8%) reported being multiracial—compared to just 3% in 2010—while roughly one-quarter chose \"some other race alone\" (25.5%).\n\nImmigration and emigration\n\nThe vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from Latin America, over half come from the Dominican Republic. Dominicans represent 53% of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics, about 1.8% of Puerto Rico's population. Some illegal immigrants, particularly from Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Cuba, use Puerto Rico as a temporary stop-over point to get to the U.S mainland. Other major sources of recent immigrants include Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Panama, Ecuador, Spain, and Jamaica. Additionally, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S citizens settling in Puerto Rico from the U.S mainland, majority of which are White Americans and a smaller number are Black Americans. In fact, non-Hispanic people represent 1.1% and majority of them are from the U.S mainland. Smaller numbers of U.S citizens come from the U.S Virgin Islands. There are also large numbers of Nuyoricans and other stateside Puerto Ricans coming back, as many Puerto Ricans engage in 'circular migration'. Small numbers of non-Puerto Rican Hispanics in Puerto Rico are actually American-born migrants from the mainland U.S and not recent immigrants. Most recent immigrants settle in and around the San Juan metropolitan area.\n\nLanguages\n\nThe official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law. However, all official business of the U.S District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education, and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.\n\nReligion\n\nReligious affiliation in Puerto Rico (2014) reflects a mix of Catholicism, Protestantism, and other faiths. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2014, 69% of the population identified as Catholic, 18% as Protestant, and 3% as other Christian denominations. Minority faiths, such as Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, make up a small percentage of the population.\n\nEducation and literacy\n\nThe first school in Puerto Rico was the Escuela de Gramática (Grammar School), established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge, and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy, and theology.\n\nHealth\n\nIn 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico. As of 2021, average life expectancy is approximately 82.1 years according to the CIA World Factbook, an improvement from 78.7 years in 2010.\n\nCulture\n\nModern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and many South Americans. Many Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles, and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\n\nArts\n\nPuerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called santos evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. Santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. Santos vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\n\nLiterature\n\nPuerto Rican literature evolved from", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Puerto_Rico\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nPuerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\" [21] Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation of Borikén, its Indigenous Taíno name, which is popularly said to mean \"Land of the Valiant Lord\" [40] [41] [42] The terms boricua, borinqueño, and borincano are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage, [43] [44] and derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively [45] The island is also popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto, meaning \"the island of enchantment\" [46]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC At the time of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in 1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the Taínos The Taíno people's numbers went dangerously low during the later half of the 16th century because of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare [61]\n\n\nU.S. era\nIn 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded and subsequently became a possession of the U.S The first years of the 20th century were marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic rights from the U.S [citation needed]\n\n\n21st century\nIn 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the U.S government to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence [64] In November 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections [65] [66] The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S Constitution 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association [67] 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and 5.49% for independence [68] [failed verification]\n\n\nGeography\n18°12′N 66°30′W﻿ / ﻿18.2°N 66.5°W﻿ / 18.2; -66.5﻿ (Commonwealth of Puerto Rico)\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of Puerto Rico in the Köppen climate classification is mostly tropical rainforest Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85 °F (29 °C) in lower elevations and 70 °F (21 °C) in the mountains Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round Puerto Rico has a rainy season, which stretches from April into November, and a dry season stretching from December to March The mountains of the Cordillera Central create a rain shadow and are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects, adding to the climatic variation Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPuerto Rico is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Puerto Rican moist forests, Puerto Rican dry forests, and Greater Antilles mangroves [103] Puerto Rico has two biosphere reserves recognized by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme: Luquillo Biosphere Reserve represented by El Yunque National Forest and the Guánica Biosphere Reserve.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nPuerto Rico has a republican form of government based on the American model, with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States [114] [115] All governmental powers are delegated by the United States Congress, with the head of state being the president of the United States As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks full protection under the U.S Constitution [116]\n\n\nPolitical parties and elections\nSince 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) The three parties stand for different political status The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S as a commonwealth, while the PNP seeks to make Puerto Rico a U.S state Meanwhile, the PIP seeks to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation free from U.S authority In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP

{"title": "Azerbaijan", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe term Azerbaijan derives from Atropates, [29] [30] a Persian [31] [32] satrap under the Achaemenid Empire who was reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander the Great [33] [34] The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant Zoroastrianism In the Avesta's Frawardin Yasht (\"Hymn to the Guardian Angels\"), there is a mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide, which translates from Avestan as \"we worship the fravashi of the holy Atropatene\" [35] The name \"Atropates\" is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning \"Protected by the (Holy) Fire\" or \"The Land of the (Holy) Fire\" [36] The Greek name was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo Over the span of millennia, the name evolved to Āturpātākān (Middle Persian), then to Ādharbādhagān, Ādhorbāygān, Āzarbāydjān (New Persian) and present-day Azerbaijan [37]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave [46] Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC [36] Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river [34] The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC [47] The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism [48]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave [46] Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC [36] Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river [34] The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC [47] The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism [48]\n\n\nFrom the Sasanid period to the Safavid period\nThe Sasanian Empire turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century [49] Despite Sassanid rule, Caucasian Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian marzban (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority [50]\n\n\nModern history\nAfter the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian Afsharid dynasty After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability Numerous khanates with various forms of autonomy [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] emerged The rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of Iran and were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah [75] The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West [76]\n\n\nIndependence\nFollowing the politics of glasnost initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, [103] an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to an already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in the Black January events in Baku [104] Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words \"Soviet Socialist\" from the title, adopted the \"Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic\" and restored the flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag [105] As a consequence of the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Moscow, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence on 18 October 1991 which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December, while the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December [105] The country celebrates its Day of Restoration of Independence on 18 October [106]\n\n\nAliyev family rule, 1993–present\nIn 1993, democratically elected President Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev In 1994, Huseynov, by that time the prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but he was arrested and charged with treason [115] In 1995 another coup was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the Russian OMON special police unit, Rovshan Javadov The coup was averted, resulting in the death of Javadov and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units [116] [117] At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy [118] In October 1998, Aliyev was re-elected for a second term.\n\n\nGeography\nAzerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling West Asia and Eastern Europe It lies between latitudes 38° and 42° N, and longitudes 44° and 51° E The perimeter of Azerbaijan's land borders is 2,648 km (1,645 mi), of which 1,007 km (626 mi) are with Armenia, 756 km (470 mi) with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 km (242 mi) with Russia and 15 km (9 mi) with Turkey [129] The coastline stretches for 800 km (497 mi), and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km (283 mi) [129] The country has a landlocked exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic [130]\n\n\nLandscape\nAzerbaijan is home to a wide variety of landscapes Over half of the land consists of mountain ridges, crests, highlands, and plateaus which rise up to levels of 400–1,000 meters (including the middle and lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120 meters, and others from 0–50 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron) The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands Elevations within the Caucasus region vary from about −28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazardüzü peak) [134]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks, and stones survived up to the present times The first information on flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century [131]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAzerbaijan's government functions as an authoritarian regime in practice; [146] [147] [148] [149] although it regularly holds elections, these are marred by electoral fraud and other unfair election practices [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] The government has been ruled by the Aliyev political family and the New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası, YAP) established by Heydar Aliyev continuously since 1993 [157] It is categorised as \"not free\" by Freedom House, [158] [159] who ranked it 7/100 on Global Freedom Score in 2024, calling its regime authoritarian [160]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland [166] The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996 [167] Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran [166] and Israel [168] Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its \"special relationship\" with Turkey [169] [170]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe National Army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918 [181] [182] When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the law on the armed forces of 9 October 1991 [183] The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day (26 June) [184] As of 2021, Azerbaijan had 126,000 active personnel in its armed forces There are also 17,000 paramilitary troops and 330,00 reserve personnel [185] The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Navy Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard as well [26] The Azerbaijani National Guard is a paramilitary force that operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the president [186]\n\n\nHuman rights and freedom\nThe constitution claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014, the media environment deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (May–November 2014) Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm [195] All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country [196] According to the 2013 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is \"not free\", and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries [197] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are banned in Azerbaijan [198] Discrimination against LGBT people in Azerbaijan is widespread [199] [200]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThere are 14 economic regions; 66 rayons (rayonlar, singular rayon) and 11 cities (şəhərlər, singular şəhər) under the direct authority of the republic [210] Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the Autonomous Republic (muxtar respublika) of Nakhchivan [26] The President of Azerbaijan appoints the governors of these units, while the government of Nakhchivan is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank [211] The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks, and non-banking credit organizations The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks Two major commercial banks are UniBank and the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, run by Abbas Ibrahimov [212]\n\n\nEnergy and natural resources\nTwo-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas [219] The oil industry dates back to the ancient period Arabian historian and traveler Ahmad Al-Baladhuri discusses the economy of the Absheron Peninsula in antiquity, mentioning its oil in particular [220] There are many pipelines in Azerbaijan The goal of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects the giant Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe, [221] is to reduce European Union's dependency on Russian gas [222]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAzerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region About 54.9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural land [129] At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of used agricultural area [228] In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m3 [228] Agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants [229] In some areas it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton [230] and tobacco Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products The Caspian fishing industry concentrates on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.\n\n\nTourism\n40°18′N 47°42′E﻿ / ﻿40.3°N 47.7°E﻿ / 40.3; 47.7\n\n\nTransportation\nThe convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of the transportation sector for the country's economy [242] The transport sector includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport It is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 km (1,102 mi) through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets [243] The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year [244] Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project [245]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped improve the situation in the science and technology sectors The government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable to those from oil production [247] Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector In 2012, rapid growth was forecast for at least five more years [248] Azerbaijan was ranked 95th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [249]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of March 2022, 52.9% of the population of 10,164,464 is urban, with the remaining 47.1% being rural [261] In January 2019, the 50.1% of the total population was female The sex ratio in the same year was 0.99 males per female [262] The 2011 population growth-rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide [26] A significant factor restricting population growth is a high level of migration In 2011 Azerbaijan saw a migration of −1.14/1,000 people [26]\n\n\nEthnicity\nDemographics of Azerbaijan\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language is Azerbaijani, a Turkic language Approximately 92% of the national population speak it as their mother tongue [267] Russian and Armenian (only in Nagorno-Karabakh) are still spoken in Azerbaijan Each is the mother tongue of around 1.5% of the national population [267] In 1989, Armenian was the majority language in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, spoken by about 76% of the regional population [268] After the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, native speakers of Armenian composed around 95% of the regional population [269]\n\n\nReligion\nAzerbaijan is considered the most secular Muslim-majority country [274] Around 97% of the population are Muslims [275] Around 55–65% of Muslims are estimated to be Shia, while 35–45% of Muslims are Sunnis [276] [277] [278] [279] Other faiths are practised by the country's various ethnic groups Under article 48 of its constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom In a 2006–2008 Gallup poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives [280]\n\n\nEducation\nA relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects [291] In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from Perso-Arabic script to Latin in the 1920s and from Roman to Cyrillic in the 1930s According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970 [291] According to the United Nations Development Program Report 2009, the literacy rate is 99.5 percent [292]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences; that is why Azerbaijanis are, in many ways, bi-cultural National traditions are preserved despite Western

[295]\n\n\nArchitecture\nAzerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of East and West, [296] with heavy influences from Persian architecture Many ancient architectural treasures are preserved, such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Walled City of Baku Entries on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list include the Ateshgah of Baku, Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Hirkan National Park, Binagadi asphalt lake, Lökbatan Mud Volcano, Shusha State Historical and Architectural Reserve, Baku Stage Mountain, Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions, Ordubad National Reserve and the Palace of Shaki Khans [297] [298]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nMusic of Azerbaijan builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly a thousand years, [302] evolving around the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies [303] The music has a branchy mode system, where chromatization of major and minor scales is of great importance [303] Among national musical instruments there are 14 string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments [304] According to The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \"in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion the Azerbaijani are musically much closer to Iran than Turkey.\" [305]\n\n\nArt\nAzerbaijani art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweling, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone, or bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, and knitting and embroidery Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers, and diplomats who had visited these places at different times [316]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe earliest known figure in written Azerbaijani literature was Izzeddin Hasanoghlu, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Azerbaijani ghazals [326] [327] In Persian ghazals he used a pen-name, while his Azerbaijani ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu [326] Among the medieval authors was Persian poet and philosopher Nizami, called Ganjavi after his place of birth, Ganja, who was the author of the Khamsa (\"The Quintuplet\"), composed of five romantic poems, including \"The Treasure of Mysteries\", \"Khosrow and Shīrīn\", and \"Leyli and Mejnūn\" [328]\n\n\nMedia\nThe first newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi was published in 1875 [342] There are three state-owned television channels: AzTV, Idman TV and Medeniyyet TV There is one public channel and 6 private channels: İctimai Television, Space TV, Lider TV, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Xazar TV,  Real TV  [az] and ARB [343]\n\n\nCinema\nThe film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898 Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography, [344] with the apparatus first showing up in Baku [345] In 1919 a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on the first anniversary of Azerbaijan's independence from Russia, 27 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku [346] After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation [346]\n\n\nCuisine\nAzerbaijani cuisine uses an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are popular and often accompany main dishes on the table Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the Caspian Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and seasonal vegetables and greens.\n\n\nSport\nFreestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's national sport, in which Azerbaijan has won fourteen medals, including four golds, since joining the International Olympic Committee The most popular sports are football and

of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The country has a rich history, diverse culture, and a strategic location that has made it an important player in regional and global affairs.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term Azerbaijan derives from Atropates, a Persian satrap under the Achaemenid Empire who was reinstated as the satrap of Media under Alexander the Great. The original etymology of this name is thought to have its roots in the once-dominant Zoroastrianism. In the Avesta's Frawardin Yasht, there is a mention of âterepâtahe ashaonô fravashîm ýazamaide, which translates from Avestan as \"we worship the fravashi of the holy Atropatene.\" The name \"Atropates\" is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning \"Protected by the (Holy) Fire\" or \"The Land of the (Holy) Fire.\" The Greek name was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo. Over the span of millennia, the name evolved to Āturpātākān (Middle Persian), then to Ādharbādhagān, Ādhorbāygān, Āzarbāydjān (New Persian) and present-day Azerbaijan.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave. Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave. Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC. Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river. The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC. The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism.\n\n**From the Sasanid period to the Safavid period**\n\nThe Sasanian Empire turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century. Despite Sassanid rule, Caucasian Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian marzban (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.\n\n**Modern history**\n\nAfter the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian Afsharid dynasty. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability. Numerous khanates with various forms of autonomy emerged. The rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of Iran and were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah. The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West.\n\n**Independence**\n\nFollowing the politics of glasnost initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to an already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in the Black January events in Baku. Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words \"Soviet Socialist\" from the title, adopted the \"Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic\" and restored the flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag. As a consequence of the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Moscow, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence on 18 October 1991, which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December, while the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December.\n\n**Aliyev family rule, 1993–present**\n\nIn 1993, democratically elected President Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev. In 1994, Huseynov, by that time the prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but he was arrested and charged with treason. In 1995, another coup was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the Russian OMON special police unit, Rovshan Javadov. The coup was averted, resulting in the death of Javadov and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units. At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy. In October 1998, Aliyev was re-elected for a second term.\n\n**Geography**\n\nAzerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling West Asia and Eastern Europe. It lies between latitudes 38° and 42° N, and longitudes 44° and 51° E. The perimeter of Azerbaijan's land borders is 2,648 km (1,645 mi), of which 1,007 km (626 mi) are with Armenia, 756 km (470 mi) with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 km (242 mi) with Russia and 15 km (9 mi) with Turkey. The coastline stretches for 800 km (497 mi), and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km (283 mi).\n\n**Landscape**\n\nAzerbaijan is home to a wide variety of landscapes. Over half of the land consists of mountain ridges, crests, highlands, and plateaus which rise up to levels of 400–1,000 meters (including the middle and lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120 meters, and others from 0–50 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands. Elevations within the Caucasus region vary from about −28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazardüzü peak).\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nThe first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks, and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nAzerbaijan's government functions as an authoritarian regime in practice, although it regularly holds elections, which are marred by electoral fraud and other unfair election practices. The government has been ruled by the Aliyev political family and the New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası, YAP) established by Heydar Aliyev continuously since 1993. It is categorised as \"not free\" by Freedom House, who ranked it 7/100 on Global Freedom Score in 2024, calling its regime authoritarian.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThe short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland. The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year. The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996. Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran and Israel. Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its \"special relationship\" with Turkey.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe National Army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918. When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the law on the armed forces of 9 October 1991. The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day (26 June). As of 2021, Azerbaijan had 126,000 active personnel in its armed forces. There are also 17,000 paramilitary troops and 330,000 reserve personnel. The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Navy. Additionally, the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed. These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard as well. The Azerbaijani National Guard is a paramilitary force that operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the president.\n\n**Human rights and freedom**\n\nThe constitution claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014, the media environment deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (May-November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm. All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country. According to the 2013 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is \"not free\", and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are banned in Azerbaijan. Discrimination against LGBT people in Azerbaijan is widespread.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nThere are 14 economic regions; 66 rayons (rayonlar, singular rayon) and 11 cities (şəhərlər, singular şəhər) under the direct authority of the republic. Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the Autonomous Republic (muxtar respublika) of Nakhchivan. The President of Azerbaijan appoints the governors of these units, while the government of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks, and non-banking credit organizations. The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are UniBank and the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, run by Abbas Ibrahimov.\n\n**Energy and natural resources**\n\nTwo-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas. The oil industry dates back to the ancient period. Arabian historian and traveler Ahmad Al-Baladhuri discusses the economy of the Absheron Peninsula in antiquity, mentioning its oil in particular. There are many pipelines in Azerbaijan. The goal of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects the giant Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe, is to reduce European Union's dependency on Russian gas.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nAzerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54.9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural land. At the beginning of 2007, there were 4,755,100 hectares of used agricultural area. In the same year, the total wood resources counted 136 million m3. Agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants. In some areas, it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton and tobacco. The Caspian fishing industry concentrates on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga. In 2002, the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroads of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of the transportation sector for the country's economy. The transport sector includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport. It is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 km (1,102 mi) through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets. The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nIn the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped improve the situation in the science and technology sectors. The government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable to those from oil production. Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector. In 2012, rapid growth was forecast for at least five more years. Azerbaijan was ranked 95th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of March 2022, 52.9% of the population of 10,164,464 is urban, with the remaining 47.1% being rural. In January 2019, the 50.1% of the total population was female. The sex ratio in the same year was 0.99 males per female. The 2011 population growth-rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide. A significant factor restricting population growth is a high level of migration. In 2011, Azerbaijan saw a migration of −1.14/1,000 people.\n\n**Ethnicity**\n\nEthnic groups in Azerbaijan include Azerbaijanis (about 92.5%), Russians (about 1.3%), Talysh (about 1.3%), Lezgins (about 1.1%), Armenians (about 0.5%), Avars (about 0.4%), Georgians (about 0.3%), Tatars (about 0.2%), and others.\n\n**Languages**\n\nThe official language is Azerbaijani, a Turkic language. Approximately 92% of the national population speak it as their mother tongue. Russian and Armenian (only in Nagorno-Karabakh) are still spoken in Azerbaijan. Each is the mother tongue of around 1.5% of the national population. In 1989, Armenian was the majority language in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, spoken by about 76% of the regional population. After the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, native speakers of Armenian composed around 95% of the regional population.\n\n**Religion**\n\nAzerbaijan is considered the most secular Muslim-majority country. Around 97% of the population are Muslims. Around 55–65% of Muslims are estimated to be Shia, while 35–45% of Muslims are Sunnis. Other faiths are practised by the country's various ethnic groups. Under article 48 of its constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom. In a 2006–2008 Gallup poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives.\n\n**Education**\n\nA relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.

Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers, and diplomats who had visited these places at different

Fire\" [36] The Greek name was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo Over the span of millennia, the name evolved to Āturpātākān (Middle Persian), then to Ādharbādhagān, Ādhorbāygān, Āzarbāydjān (New Persian) and present-day Azerbaijan [37]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave [46] Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC [36] Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river [34] The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC [47] The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism [48]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates back to the late Stone Age and is related to the Guruchay culture of Azykh Cave [46] Early settlements included the Scythians during the 9th century BC [36] Following the Scythians, Iranian Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras river [34] The Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which was integrated into the Achaemenid Empire around 550 BC [47] The area was conquered by the Achaemenids leading to the spread of Zoroastrianism [48]\n\n\nFrom the Sasanid period to the Safavid period\nThe Sasanian Empire turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state in 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century [49] Despite Sassanid rule, Caucasian Albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian marzban (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority [50]\n\n\nModern history\nAfter the Safavids, the area was ruled by the Iranian Afsharid dynasty After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability Numerous khanates with various forms of autonomy [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] emerged The rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of Iran and were vassals and subjects of the Iranian shah [75] The khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between Central Asia and the West [76]\n\n\nIndependence\nFollowing the politics of glasnost initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, [103] an autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to Moscow's indifference to an already heated conflict, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which culminated in the Black January events in Baku [104] Later in 1990, the Supreme Council of the Azerbaijan SSR dropped the words \"Soviet Socialist\" from the title, adopted the \"Declaration of Sovereignty of the Azerbaijan Republic\" and restored the flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as the state flag [105] As a consequence of the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Moscow, the Supreme Council of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independence on 18 October 1991 which was affirmed by a nationwide referendum in December, while the Soviet Union officially ceased to exist on 26 December [105] The country celebrates its Day of Restoration of Independence on 18 October [106]\n\n\nAliyev family rule, 1993–present\nIn 1993, democratically elected President Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev In 1994, Huseynov, by that time the prime minister, attempted another military coup against Heydar Aliyev, but he was arrested and charged with treason [115] In 1995 another coup was attempted against Aliyev, this time by the commander of the Russian OMON special police unit, Rovshan Javadov The coup was averted, resulting in the death of Javadov and disbanding of Azerbaijan's OMON units [116] [117] At the same time, the country was tainted by rampant corruption in the governing bureaucracy [118] In October 1998, Aliyev was re-elected for a second term.\n\n\nGeography\nAzerbaijan is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, straddling West Asia and Eastern Europe It lies between latitudes 38° and 42° N, and longitudes 44° and 51° E The perimeter of Azerbaijan's land borders is 2,648 km (1,645 mi), of which 1,007 km (626 mi) are with Armenia, 756 km (470 mi) with Iran, 480 kilometers with Georgia, 390 km (242 mi) with Russia and 15 km (9 mi) with Turkey [129] The coastline stretches for 800 km (497 mi), and the length of the widest area of the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian Sea is 456 km (283 mi) [129] The country has a landlocked exclave, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic [130]\n\n\nLandscape\nAzerbaijan is home to a wide variety of landscapes Over half of the land consists of mountain ridges, crests, highlands, and plateaus which rise up to levels of 400–1,000 meters (including the middle and lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100–120 meters, and others from 0–50 meters and up (Qobustan, Absheron) The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consists of plains and lowlands Elevations within the Caucasus region vary from about −28 meters at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466 meters (Bazardüzü peak) [134]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nThe first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks, and stones survived up to the present times The first information on flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century [131]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAzerbaijan's government functions as an authoritarian regime in practice; [146] [147] [148] [149] although it regularly holds elections, these are marred by electoral fraud and other unfair election practices [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] The government has been ruled by the Aliyev political family and the New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası, YAP) established by Heydar Aliyev continuously since 1993 [157] It is categorised as \"not free\" by Freedom House, [158] [159] who ranked it 7/100 on Global Freedom Score in 2024, calling its regime authoritarian [160]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland [166] The process of international recognition of Azerbaijan's independence from the collapsing Soviet Union lasted roughly one year The most recent country to recognize Azerbaijan was Bahrain, on 6 November 1996 [167] Full diplomatic relations, including mutual exchanges of missions, were first established with Turkey, Pakistan, the United States, Iran [166] and Israel [168] Azerbaijan has placed a particular emphasis on its \"special relationship\" with Turkey [169] [170]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe National Army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918 [181] [182] When Azerbaijan gained independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan were created according to the law on the armed forces of 9 October 1991 [183] The original date of the establishment of the short-lived National Army is celebrated as Army Day (26 June) [184] As of 2021, Azerbaijan had 126,000 active personnel in its armed forces There are also 17,000 paramilitary troops and 330,00 reserve personnel [185] The armed forces have three branches: the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Navy Additionally the armed forces embrace several military sub-groups that can be involved in state defense when needed These are the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Border Service, which includes the Coast Guard as well [26] The Azerbaijani National Guard is a paramilitary force that operates as a semi-independent entity of the Special State Protection Service, an agency subordinate to the president [186]\n\n\nHuman rights and freedom\nThe constitution claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014, the media environment deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (May–November 2014) Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm [195] All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country [196] According to the 2013 Freedom House Freedom of the Press report, Azerbaijan's press freedom status is \"not free\", and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries [197] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are banned in Azerbaijan [198] Discrimination against LGBT people in Azerbaijan is widespread [199] [200]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThere are 14 economic regions; 66 rayons (rayonlar, singular rayon) and 11 cities (şəhərlər, singular şəhər) under the direct authority of the republic [210] Moreover, Azerbaijan includes the Autonomous Republic (muxtar respublika) of Nakhchivan [26] The President of Azerbaijan appoints the governors of these units, while the government of Nakhchivan is elected and approved by the parliament of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfter gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank [211] The banking system consists of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, commercial banks, and non-banking credit organizations The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat, and to supervise all commercial banks Two major commercial banks are UniBank and the state-owned International Bank of Azerbaijan, run by Abbas Ibrahimov [212]\n\n\nEnergy and natural resources\nTwo-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas [219] The oil industry dates back to the ancient period Arabian historian and traveler Ahmad Al-Baladhuri discusses the economy of the Absheron Peninsula in antiquity, mentioning its oil in particular [220] There are many pipelines in Azerbaijan The goal of the Southern Gas Corridor, which connects the giant Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan to Europe, [221] is to reduce European Union's dependency on Russian gas [222]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAzerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region About 54.9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural land [129] At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100 hectares of used agricultural area [228] In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m3 [228] Agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical crops, green vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and medicinal plants [229] In some areas it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, sugar beets, cotton [230] and tobacco Livestock, dairy products, and wine and spirits are also important farm products The Caspian fishing industry concentrates on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga In 2002 the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.\n\n\nTourism\n40°18′N 47°42′E﻿ / ﻿40.3°N 47.7°E﻿ / 40.3; 47.7\n\n\nTransportation\nThe convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the south–north corridor, highlights the strategic importance of the transportation sector for the country's economy [242] The transport sector includes roads, railways, aviation, and maritime transport It is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than 1,774 km (1,102 mi) through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey The BTC is designed to transport up to 50 million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets [243] The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the Shah Deniz gas field Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year [244] Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project [245]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped improve the situation in the science and technology sectors The government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and innovation The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable to those from oil production [247] Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing Internet sector In 2012, rapid growth was forecast for at least five more years [248] Azerbaijan was ranked 95th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [249]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of March 2022, 52.9% of the population of 10,164,464 is urban, with the remaining 47.1% being rural [261] In January 2019, the 50.1% of the total population was female The sex ratio in the same year was 0.99 males per female [262] The 2011 population growth-rate was 0.85%, compared to 1.09% worldwide [26] A significant factor restricting population growth is a high level of migration In 2011 Azerbaijan saw a migration of −1.14/1,000 people [26]\n\n\nEthnicity\nDemographics of Azerbaijan\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language is Azerbaijani, a Turkic language Approximately 92% of the national population speak it as their mother tongue [267] Russian and Armenian (only in Nagorno-Karabakh) are still spoken in Azerbaijan Each is the mother tongue of around 1.5% of the national population [267] In 1989, Armenian was the majority language in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, spoken by about 76% of the regional population [268] After the first Nagorno-Karabakh war, native speakers of Armenian composed around 95% of the regional population [269]\n\n\nReligion\nAzerbaijan is considered the most secular Muslim-majority country [274] Around 97% of the population are Muslims [275] Around 55–65% of Muslims are estimated to be Shia, while 35–45% of Muslims are Sunnis [276] [277] [278] [279] Other faiths are practised by the country's various ethnic groups Under article 48 of its constitution, Azerbaijan is a secular state and ensures religious freedom In a 2006–2008 Gallup poll, only 21% of respondents from Azerbaijan stated that religion is an important part of their daily lives [280]\n\n\nEducation\nA relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects [291] In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from Perso-Arabic script to Latin in the 1920s and from Roman to Cyrillic in the 1930s According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970 [291] According to the United Nations Development Program Report 2009, the literacy rate is 99.5 percent [292]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Azerbaijan has developed as a result of many influences; that is why Azerbaijanis are, in many ways, bi-cultural National traditions are preserved despite Western influences, including globalized consumer culture For example, Novruz Bayram is a family holiday derived from the traditional celebration of the New Year in Zoroastrianism [295]\n\n\nArchitecture\nAzerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of East and West, [296] with heavy influences from Persian architecture Many ancient architectural treasures are preserved, such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the Walled City of Baku Entries on the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list include the Ateshgah of Baku, Momine Khatun Mausoleum, Hirkan National Park, Binagadi asphalt lake, Lökbatan Mud Volcano, Shusha State Historical and Architectural Reserve, Baku Stage Mountain, Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions, Ordubad National Reserve and the Palace of Shaki Khans [297] [298]\n\n\nMusic and dance\nMusic of Azerbaijan builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly a thousand years, [302] evolving around the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies [303] The music has a branchy mode system, where chromatization of major and minor scales is of great importance [303] Among national musical instruments there are 14 string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments [304] According to The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \"in terms of ethnicity, culture and religion the Azerbaijani are musically much closer to Iran than Turkey.\" [305]\n\n\nArt\nAzerbaijani art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweling, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone, or bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, and knitting and embroidery Each of these types of decorative art, evidence of the endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers, and diplomats who had visited these places at different times [316]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe earliest known figure in written Azerbaijani literature was Izzeddin Hasanoghlu, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Azerbaijani ghazals [326] [327] In Persian ghazals he used a pen-name, while his Azerbaijani ghazals were composed under his own name of Hasanoghlu [326] Among the medieval authors was Persian poet and philosopher Nizami, called Ganjavi after his place of birth, Ganja, who was the author of the Khamsa (\"The Quintuplet\"), composed of five romantic poems, including \"The Treasure of Mysteries\", \"Khosrow and Shīrīn\", and \"Leyli and Mejnūn\" [328]\n\n\nMedia\nThe first newspaper in Azerbaijani, Akinchi was published in 1875 [342] There are three state-owned television channels: AzTV, Idman TV and Medeniyyet TV There is one public channel and 6 private channels: İctimai Television, Space TV, Lider TV, Azad Azerbaijan TV, Xazar TV,  Real TV  [az] and ARB [343]\n\n\nCinema\nThe film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898 Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography, [344] with the apparatus first showing up in Baku [345] In 1919 a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on the first anniversary of Azerbaijan's independence from Russia, 27 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku [346] After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation [346]\n\n\nCuisine\nAzerbaijani cuisine uses an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are popular and often accompany main dishes on the table Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the Caspian Sea, local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and seasonal vegetables and greens.\n\n\nSport\nFreestyle wrestling has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's national sport, in which Azerbaijan has won fourteen medals, including four golds, since joining the International Olympic Committee The most popular sports are football and wrestling [350]\n\n\nSee also\n40°18′N 47°42′E﻿ / ﻿40.3°N 47.7°E﻿ / 40.3; 47.7\n\n\nNotes\n40°18′N 47°42′E﻿ / ﻿40.3°N 47.7°E﻿ / 40.3; 47.7\n\n\nReferences\n40°18′N 47°42′E﻿ / ﻿40.3°N 47.7°E﻿ / 40.3;

Born in West Pakistan (now Sindh, Pakistan), Balwani is a member of an upper-middle-class Sindhi Hindu farming family. He attended Aitchison College, a prestigious boarding school in Lahore, until 1984. Balwani speaks Sindhi, Urdu, Hindi, and English.\n\n# Early Life and Education\nBalwani was born into a family of farmers in West Pakistan, which is now part of Sindh, Pakistan. His family was considered upper-middle-class, and his parents were well-educated. Balwani's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education, and he attended Aitchison College, a prestigious boarding school in Lahore, until 1984. At Aitchison College, Balwani was exposed to a rigorous academic environment and developed a strong foundation in mathematics and science.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Aitchison College, Balwani went on to pursue higher education. However, the exact details of his educational background are not well-documented. Despite his limited formal education, Balwani has claimed to have written thousands of lines of code during his time at Microsoft, where he worked in sales.\n\n## Career\nIn the 1990s, Balwani worked for Lotus Software and Microsoft. During his tenure at Microsoft, he worked in sales and was responsible for promoting the company's products to potential customers. Balwani has claimed to have written thousands of lines of code during his time at Microsoft, although independent investigations could not verify this claim. Despite his alleged coding skills, numerous Microsoft managers who were asked about Balwani could not remember him.\n\nBalwani's time at Microsoft was marked by his meeting with a Japanese artist, Keiko Fujimoto, who would later become his wife. Fujimoto and Balwani lived in San Francisco before their divorce in December 2002.\n\n## Theranos\nIn 2009, Balwani joined Theranos, a health technology company founded by Elizabeth Holmes. At Theranos, Balwani served as the company's president and was responsible for running the company's day-to-day operations. Despite his lack of training in biological sciences or medical devices, Balwani was given a significant amount of autonomy at Theranos.\n\nBalwani's tenure at Theranos was marked by controversy. He was described by former Theranos employees as overbearing, uncompromising, and paranoid about industrial espionage. This behavior led to a number of issues, including the absence of medical experts on the company's board of directors.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\nIn March 2018, Balwani and Holmes were charged by the SEC with securities fraud. The charges alleged that the pair had raised more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology, business, and financial performance. Holmes settled the case out of court without admitting or denying wrongdoing, but Balwani was still in litigation as of 2022.\n\nBalwani has maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings, stating that he was unaware of any wrongdoing at Theranos. However, prosecutors have alleged that Balwani was involved in a number of schemes to defraud investors and patients.\n\n## United States v. Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani\nOn June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S Attorney's Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted president Balwani and CEO Holmes on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors alleged that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud patients.\n\nIn March 2020, a U.S District Court Judge ordered that Balwani will stand trial separately from Holmes. The trial is ongoing, and the outcome is still uncertain.\n\n## Personal Life\nBalwani was married to Japanese artist Keiko Fujimoto, whom he met during his time at Microsoft. The couple lived in San Francisco before their divorce in December 2002. Little is known about Balwani's personal life outside of his marriage to Fujimoto.\n\nBalwani's net worth is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars, thanks to his involvement in Theranos and his other business ventures.

below the team's salary cap, with Khalil Shakir becoming Allen's only returning wideout from the previous season To offset the departures of Diggs and Davis, the Bills replaced them with veteran free-agent receivers such as Curtis Samuel, Mack Hollins, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling while drafting Keon Coleman, with Joe Brady insisting on an \"everybody eats\" mentality among the offense rather than focusing on a singular player [177] The Bills started 3–0 with a comeback win against the Arizona Cardinals on opening day, in which Allen hurdled over Cardinals safety Budda Baker while tweaking

National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Bills with the seventh overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Allen has become known for his unique combination of size, arm strength, speed, running ability, and overall athleticism, drawing comparisons to John Elway, Randall Cunningham, Brett Favre, and Cam Newton.\n\nEarly Life\nAllen grew up on a 3,000-acre cotton farm near Firebaugh, California, a small town about 40 miles west of Fresno, California. His family has lived in the area since his great-grandfather, who emigrated from Sweden in 1907, settled there during the Great Depression. The farm where he was raised was established in 1975 by his paternal grandfather, who was also a longtime member of the local school board and namesake of the gymnasium of Firebaugh High School, from which Allen graduated in 2014.\n\nCollege Career\nAllen attended Reedley College, a junior college, where one of the football assistant coaches at the time was married to Allen's cousin. He then transferred to the University of Wyoming, where he played in two games and made one start in his first year. In his first career start, he attempted only four passes before suffering a broken collarbone, which ended his season. Because the injury occurred early in the season, he qualified for a medical redshirt. Allen returned from the injury in 2016 and was Wyoming's starter.\n\nCollege Statistics\nIn the 2017 season, Allen led the Cowboys to an 8-5 record and a bowl game appearance. He threw for 3,113 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. His performance caught the attention of NFL scouts, who saw him as a potential first-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nProfessional Career\nThe Buffalo Bills drafted Allen as the seventh overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year, fully guaranteed $21 million contract with the Bills on July 25, 2018. Allen entered 2019 as the Bills' opening day starter, being named a team captain.\n\n2019 Season\nAllen started strong in the 2019 season, throwing for 269 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 17-14 win over the New York Jets in Week 1. He continued to play well throughout the season, throwing for 3,141 yards and 20 touchdowns. The Bills finished the season with a 10-6 record and a Wild Card spot in the playoffs.\n\n2019-20 Postseason\nIn the AFC Wild Card Round against the Houston Texans, Allen started strong, breaking Jim Kelly's franchise post-season record for rushing yards by a quarterback (37) with a single 42-yard run on the first drive. He also caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver John Brown on a trick play. Despite the Bills' 19-22 loss in overtime, Allen finished the game with 92 rushing yards, 264 passing yards, 16 receiving yards, and one total touchdown.\n\n2020 Season\nIn the 2020 season, Allen was reportedly among a group of 77 NFL players that tested positive for COVID-19.

other veteran players due to cuts needed to stay below the team's salary cap, with Khalil Shakir becoming Allen's only returning wideout from the previous season To offset the departures of Diggs and

the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning in 1963 [12] However already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the foreseeable future Therefore, the West German government issued the order to research future upgrade options for the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche in 1967 [13]\n\n\nDevelopment\nEven as the Leopard 1 was just entering service, the West German military was interested in producing an improved tank in the next decade This resulted in the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning in 1963 [12] However already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the foreseeable future Therefore, the West German government issued the order to research future upgrade options for the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche in 1967 [13]\n\n\nPrototype development\nFollowing the end of the Gilded Leopard study in 1967, the West German government decided to focus on the Experimentalentwicklung (experimental development) in a feasibility study and to develop new components for upgrading the Leopard 1 and for use on a future main battle tank programme [14] At first 25 million DM were invested, but after the industry came to the conclusion that with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested The experimental development was contracted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but with the obligation to cooperate with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for the development of the turret [16]\n\n\nAmerican evaluation of Leopard 2AV and XM1 Abrams\nIn July 1973 German Federal Minister of Defence Georg Leber and his US counterpart James R Schlesinger agreed upon a higher degree of standardisation in main battle tanks being favourable to NATO By integrating components already fully developed by German companies for the Leopard 2, the costs of the XM1 Abrams, U.S prototype tank developed after the MBT-70, could be reduced A German commission was sent to the US to evaluate the harmonisation of components between the XM1 and Leopard 2 [23] However, under American law it was not possible for a public bidder to interfere in a procurement tender after a contract with intention of profits and deadline was awarded to private sector companies [23]\n\n\nSeries production\nThe decision to put the Leopard 2 tank in production for the German army was made after a study was undertaken [when?], which showed that adopting the Leopard 2 model would result in a greater combat potential of the German army than producing more Leopard 1A4 tanks or developing an improved version of the Leopard 1A4 with 105/120 mm smoothbore gun, improved armour protection, a new fire control system and a 890 kilowatts (1,190 hp) or 1,100 kilowatts (1,500 hp) engine [34] Various changes were applied to the Leopard 2 design before the series production started in 1979 [35] [36] The engine, transmission, and suspension were slightly modified and improved The ballistic protection of the turret and hull was improved and weak spots were eliminated [37]\n\n\nFurther improvements\nWhile previous models only varied in detail, the Leopard 2A4 introduced a digital ballistic computer and an improved fire extinguishing system Starting with the sixth batch, tanks were fitted with an improved armour array and new side skirts In 1984, the German military procurement agency stated a number of requirements for a future Leopard 2 upgrade In 1989, the Kampfwertsteigerung (combat potential improvement) programme was initiated in Germany with the delivery of first prototypes The official military requirements were published in March 1990 [42]\n\n\nReplacement\nThe Leopard 2 first entered service in 1979, and its service life is anticipated to end around 2030 In May 2015, the German Ministry of Defence announced plans to develop a tank jointly with France as a successor to both the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks Technologies and concepts will be investigated to determine what capabilities are needed in a future tank [50] Deployment of the new tank, titled Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), will be preceded by incremental upgrades to the Leopard 2, including a new digital turret core system and situational awareness system and an active protection system (APS) [51]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design [52] The armour consists of a combination of steel plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials [53] [54] [55] Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets [56] The Leopard 2's armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970 [57]\n\n\nProtection\nThe Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design [52] The armour consists of a combination of steel plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials [53] [54] [55] Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets [56] The Leopard 2's armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970 [57]\n\n\nSecondary protection\nThe Leopard 2's design follows the concept of compartmentation Possible sources of fire or explosions have been moved away from the crew [55] In the turret, the ammunition and the hydraulics are located in compartments separated from the crew In case of a detonation, the blow-off panels on the compartment roofs will direct the explosion and fire away from the crew The crew is also protected against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) threats, as the Leopard 2 is equipped with a Dräger NBC overpressurization system, which provides up to 4 hPA over-pressure inside the vehicle [60]\n\n\nArmour upgrades\nFollowing Leopard 2's introduction into service in 1979, the armour has been gradually improved over the years A modified version of spaced multilayer armour was introduced beginning with the 97th vehicle of the 6th production batch [62] The same batch also introduced an improved type of heavy ballistic skirts.\n\n\nArmour protection estimates\nEstimated levels of protection for the Leopard 2 range from 590 to 690 mm (23 to 27 in) RHAe on the turret, 600 mm (24 in) RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A4, to 920–940 mm (36–37 in) RHAe on the turret, 620 mm (24 in) RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A6 against kinetic projectiles [60] [unreliable source?]\n\n\nArmament\nThe primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun—the same gun later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models) [60]\n\n\nPrimary\nThe primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun—the same gun later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models) [60]\n\n\nSecondary\nThe Leopard 2 is equipped with two machine guns, one mounted co-axially, the other an anti-aircraft mount German models use the MG 3 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine gun; Dutch and Singaporean models use FN MAG 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine guns; Swiss models use Swiss MG 87 7.5 mm (0.295 in) machine guns [60] 4,750 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried on board the Leopard 2, of which 2,000 rounds are carried for the coaxial machine gun [79] More recent variants such as the Leopard 2A7+ are capable of mounting a Remotely-Controlled Weapons Station fitted with a Browning M2HB Heavy Machine Gun, near the commander's hatch.\n\n\nFire control\nThe standard fire control system found on the Leopard 2 is the German EMES 15 fire control system with a dual magnification stabilised primary sight The primary sight has an integrated neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet Nd:YAG laser rangefinder and a 120 element mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe (also known as CMT) Zeiss thermographic camera, both of which are linked to the tank's fire control computer [80] A backup 8x auxiliary telescope FERO-Z18 is mounted coaxially for the gunner [60]\n\n\nPropulsion\nThe Leopard 2 is propelled by the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine It provides 1,500 PS (1.1 MW) at 2,600 RPM and 4,700 N⋅m (3,500 lb⋅ft) of torque at 1,600–1,700 RPM The MTU MB 873 Ka-501 is a four-stroke, 47.7 litre, 90° V-block 12-cylinder, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, liquid-cooled diesel engine (with multi-fuel capability) It has an estimated fuel consumption rate of around 300 litres per 100 km on roads and 500 litres per 100 km across the country, and is coupled to the Renk HSWL 354 gear and brake system [60] [80]\n\n\nExports\nGermany has fielded about 2,125 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in various versions, but many were sold following German reunification The Leopard 2 became very popular in the 1990s, when the shrinking German army offered many of its redundant Leopard 2s at a reduced price It became successful enough in Europe that the manufacturer started calling it the Euro Leopard, despite France, Britain, and Italy all operating their own MBTs With further non-European orders, the name \"Global-Leopard\" is now used instead [84] Leopard 2 tanks have also been resold by original export customers, although reexport has always been conditional on consent from the German government who control the platform's export licence Other countries have bought newly manufactured vehicles or have produced them locally under licence.\n\n\nEurope\nThe Netherlands ordered 445 Leopard 2 tanks on 2 March 1979, after examining the results of the Leopard 2AV in the United States [85] It became the first export customer of the Leopard 2 and the vehicles were delivered between July 1981 and July 1986 Dutch Leopard 2 tanks have been subsequently exported to Austria, Canada, Norway, and Portugal In 2011 the last Dutch tank division was disbanded and their last Leopard 2 tanks were sold Then in 2015, because of rising tensions with Russia because of MH-17 and the Invasion of Crimea, the Dutch army released that they would start leasing 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks from Germany These tanks are operated in joint German-Dutch division [86] In September 2024 the Dutch army announced that they would order 46 Leopard 2A8 with 6 options [87] These will not be replacing the leased Leopard 2A6's from Germany It is currently unknown if they will be operated in a join German-Dutch division.\n\n\nBeyond Europe\nIn 2005, Turkey ordered 298 Leopard 2 tanks from German army stocks [109] The Leopard 2 was chosen in 2001 after successfully competing one year earlier in the Turkish army trials against the T-84 Yatagan, Leclerc and a version of the M1A2 Abrams fitted with a German MTU diesel engine Turkey wanted to buy 1,000 Leopard 2 tanks in 1999, but the German government rejected the deal.\n\n\nTransfer to Ukraine\nOn 2 July 2023, Ukraine had reportedly received 54 Leopard 2A4 from NATO-member countries [115]\n\n\nPolitical discussions\nSince April 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian government has requested that their allies donate Western-made main battle tanks Poland, Finland and others have all announced a willingness to contribute Leopard 2 tanks from their stocks, with around 100 tanks from various states ready to be transferred to Ukraine [116] However, when Germany exported the tanks to these countries, it had made reexport conditional on a German government permit, as based on the Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz and Außenwirtschaftsgesetz Until 22 January 2023, it was unclear whether such a consent would be provided with Germany determined to avoid any perception of escalating the conflict, and wary of being labelled an aggressor [117] Germany has also been keen to extract an American commitment to provide its own M1 Abrams tanks, before sending German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [118]\n\n\nGermany\nOn 25 January 2023, the German government confirmed that it would make 14 Leopard 2A6 (a company-strength number) available for Ukraine and would give authorisation to European partners to reexport their vehicles [127] The goal is for European Leopard 2 operators to provide two battalions worth, or 88 tanks, to Ukraine [130]\n\n\nPoland\nPoland welcomed the German decision to allow the transfer of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, with the Polish government announcing on 25 January it would transfer 14 Leopards to Ukraine from a total Polish stock of 247, in addition to a further 50–60 Soviet-era tanks [136] On 24 February 2023, the first 4 Leopard 2A4 tanks from Polish stocks were delivered to Ukraine These are the first Leopard 2 tanks to be operated by Ukraine [137]\n\n\nCanada\nOn 26 January 2023, the Canadian Defence Minister, Anita Anand, announced that Canada would be sending four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, with the potential for more to follow These vehicles were reportedly 'combat ready.' Canada will also provide appropriate training to Ukrainian forces who will go on to operate these tanks [138] The first Canadian Leopard 2 tanks had arrived in Poland on 5 February, to allow Ukrainian troops to begin training [139] On 24 February, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, announced that Canada would be sending a further four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine along with one armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) and 5,000 rounds of ammunition [140]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nOn 20 January 2023, the Czech Defense Ministry issued a statement that the media reports indicating the Czech Republic and Slovakia were willing to give up their Leopard 2 tanks for Ukraine were false, and that rumors that the Czech Republic would receive American Abrams tanks in exchange for Leopards were also false [141] As of December 2022, both countries had only received one Leopard 2A4 each from Rheinmetall as part of Germany's Ringtausch program in exchange for them delivering older Soviet equipment to Ukraine, while the remaining Leopard 2A4s are still being refurbished (expected to be delivered throughout 2023) [142]\n\n\nDenmark\nWhile it was reported in the international press that Denmark had signalled that it could contribute a number of tanks, [143] there was no official indication from the Danish Government that any Danish Leopard 2s would be sent to Ukraine Of the Danish inventory of 44 tanks, 14 were deployed to Estonia as part of NATO EFP, with a further number receiving upgrades at the German manufacturers [144] Some Danish opposition politicians voiced support for a transfer of Danish tanks [145] Unlike those considered by other countries, the Danish Leopards are of the new 2A7 standard, which would represent some logistic and mechanical challenges compared to the other variants [146] Denmark instead announced on 7 February that it was jointly purchasing 100-178 Leopard 1A5 tanks with Germany and the Netherlands [147] Denmark also announced on 20 April 2023 that they would jointly finance with the Netherlands the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks [148]\n\n\nFinland\nFinland had suggested before the German decision on reexport, that it could supply Ukraine with a limited number of Leopard 2 tanks The Finnish President, Sauli Niinistö, warned that \"the number of tanks  [to be sent to Ukraine] cannot be large, since Finland borders on Russia and is not part of NATO  [yet].\" [149] On 23 February Finland announced it will give three of its six Leopard 2R breaching tanks to Ukraine [150] The donation of the remaining three was announced a month later [151]\n\n\nGreece\nOn 25 January 2023 it was reported that Greece was one of the countries that had indicated it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [152] On 29 January 2023 it was erroneously reported that approximately 14 Leopard 2 tanks would be provided, though it was unclear if it would be the 2A4 or 2A6 HEL variant [153] However, on 31 January, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis clarified that Greece would not supply any Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing \"they are absolutely necessary for our defense posture.\" [154] Leaked Pentagon documents revealed that Greece was preparing to donate five of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, though Greek defense minister Nikolaos Panayiotopoulos reiterated later in April his government's opposition to tank deliveries to Ukraine, making confirmation of the delivery uncertain [155]\n\n\nNetherlands\nThe Netherlands was considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte suggesting that the Dutch government could purchase tanks from other countries and donate them [156] There were also some discussions about Netherlands purchasing the 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks they lease from Germany No refusal was made from Germany to sell them as no formal request to buy them was made; both countries agreed that they were critical to the operations of the joint German-Dutch military unit However, the Netherlands agreed to supply ammunition for Leopard tanks and announced it had not abandoned its intention to contribute to the tank initiative, while also noting it was helping to purchase Leopard 1A5 tanks with Denmark and Germany [157] The Netherlands later announced it was jointly financing with Denmark the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks, with delivery expected in early 2024 [158]\n\n\nNorway\nOn 25 January 2023, Norway pledged to donate spare Leopards to Ukraine with reports speculating that between four and eight of its 36 Leopard 2A4 tanks would be sent [143] [159] [160] Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said in an interview with Norwegian public television NRK: \"Norway and the government support the donation of battle tanks to Ukraine Norway will take part,\" but did not specify how many would be sent [161] On 14 February 2023, Gram announced that 8 Norwegian Leopard 2 tanks and 4 Leopard 1 derived \"special purpose vehicles\" would be handed over to Ukraine The special purpose vehicles turned out to be a mix of 3 NM189 AEVs and 1 NM217 ARV [162] [163] In February 2023, Norway ordered 54 Leopard 2A7 tanks (later changed to 2A8 variant) to be delivered from 2026, with a further option for 18 vehicles if necessary.\n\n\nPortugal\nWhen the German government changed its position on the reexport of Leopard 2 tanks, it was reported that the Portuguese government was preparing to send four of their Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine [164] On 4 February, Prime Minister António Costa confirmed that Portugal would send Leopards to Ukraine, but did not confirm the number of vehicles set to be delivered It is understood that Portugal is working with Germany to obtain the necessary parts to repair inoperable tanks in its inventory of 37 Leopard 2 tanks, but it has been widely reported by local media that most are inoperable Costa expressed hopes that Portuguese tanks would be delivered by March 2023 [165] On 14 February, it was reported that Portugal had earmarked three Leopard 2A6 tanks for donation to Ukraine [129] All three were confirmed donated on 27 March together with the 18 German Leopard 2A6 [166]\n\n\nSlovakia\nOn 25 January 2023, Slovakia announced it was not considering the transfer of any of its Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, but were willing to provide T-72 tanks if other allies replaced them with other tanks The reason cited for this was that Slovakia had only received 1 of the 15 Leopard tanks it was promised as part of Germany's Ringtaush program, which it was getting in exchange for supplying Ukraine with 30 Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicles [167]\n\n\nSpain\nOn 4 June 2022 it was reported that Spain was considering providing 40 of its 53 retired Leopard 2A4 tanks stored in Zaragoza [168] On 8 June German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied receiving any formal request from Spain for an export permit for Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [169] However it was later confirmed on 10 June by the Spanish defense minister they were considering the transfer [170] On 12 June, anonymous government sources told Der Spiegel that the Scholz government blocked any transfer of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing this \"would constitute a departure\" from an informal NATO decision not to provide Western tanks at that time [171] By 2 August, Spain officially backtracked on its decision, arguing the tanks at Zaragoza were in \"deplorable condition\" and that it could not send any [172]\n\n\nSweden\nSweden began considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks in January 2023 and did not rule out contributing its Strv 122 at a later stage [178] On 24 February, the Swedish minister of defence Pål Jonson announced that Sweden would be providing 10 Strv 122 tanks to Ukraine [179]\n\n\nCombat history\nStarting on 12 June 1999, 28 Leopard 2A5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the German Army as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) The vehicles of Panzerbataillon 33 and 214 were sent from North Macedonia to Prizren They were used for patrols, protecting checkpoints and bases as well as part of the show of force On 13 June 1999, two members of the Serbian paramilitary started firing from inside a Fiat 125p car at one of the checkpoints in Prizren and both were killed by return fire A Leopard 2A5 was located at the checkpoint, but it could not participate in the fighting as it was only partially crewed [180]\n\n\nKFOR\nStarting on 12 June 1999, 28 Leopard 2A5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the German Army as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) The vehicles of Panzerbataillon 33 and 214 were sent from North Macedonia to Prizren They were used for patrols, protecting checkpoints and bases as well

fire A Leopard 2A5 was located at the checkpoint, but it could not participate in the fighting as it was only partially crewed [180]\n\n\nIFOR/SFOR\nThe Dutch contingent in Bosnia-Herzegovina operated Leopard 2 tanks [182] Dutch Leopard 2A4s and Leopard 2A5s were stationed at the NLD bases at Bugojno, Novi Travnik, Sisava, Knezevo, Maslovare and Suica [citation needed]\n\n\nISAF/OEF\nIn October 2003, Canada was planning to replace its Leopard C2s with wheeled Stryker Mobile Gun Systems However, operational experience in Afghanistan and in particular during Operation Medusa, convinced the Canadian military of the usefulness of maintaining a tank fleet [183] Leopard C2s were deployed to Kandahar in December 2006, [184] but they were by then almost 30 years old, and were nearing the end of their operational life The Canadian government decided to borrow 20 Leopard 2A6s and three armoured recovery vehicles from Germany for rapid deployment to Afghanistan In late August 2007, the first Leopard 2s were airlifted into Afghanistan to equip Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) [185]\n\n\nTurkish intervention in Syria\nTurkey operates 354 Leopard 2A4 tanks Initially using other tank types including upgraded M60s, in December 2016 Turkey deployed a number of Leopard 2A4s to the Syrian Civil War against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) as part of Operation Euphrates Shield [citation needed] Initially, three of the Turkish Leopard 2A4s operating in Syria were destroyed or damaged by ISIS using anti-tank missile systems (possibly Fagot or Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles obtained from Syrian or Iraqi Army captured stocks) [citation needed] In mid-December 2016, two 2A4 tanks were captured by ISIS near al-Bab city in Syria during Euphrates Shield operations Amaq News Agency posted video of vehicles claimed to be captured Leopard 2A4s [195]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn April 2023, during training of a Ukrainian crew a Leopard 2A4 was damaged with its turret being completely dislodged from the hull The crew was reported as fine [209] In July 2023, a Leopard 2A4 was modified to carry Kontakt-1 ERA on the sides of the hull and the turret It was also shown with rubber screens attached to the turret and gun mantel [115] [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nVariants\nThe baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the \"A0\" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first series manufactured version The vehicles were manufactured from October 1979 until March 1982, altogether 380 vehicles 209 were built by Krauss Maffei and 171 by MaK The basic equipment consisted of electrical-hydraulic stabiliser WNA-H22, a fire control computer, a laser rangefinder, a wind sensor, a general-purpose telescope EMES 15, a panorama periscope PERI R17, the gunner's primary sight FERO Z18, on the turret roof as well as a computer-controlled tank testing set RPP 1–8 200 of the vehicles had a low-light enhancer (PZB 200) instead of thermal imaging Two chassis served as driver training vehicles [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2\nThe baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the \"A0\" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first

training vehicles [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A1\nMinor modifications and the installation of the gunner's thermal sight [1] were worked into the second batch of 450 vehicles Leopard 2, designated the A1 Krauss-Maffei built 248 (Chassis Nr 10211 to 10458) and MaK built 202 (Chassis Nr 20173 to 20347) Deliveries of the 2A1 models started in March 1982 and ended in November 1983 The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition racks to be identical to those in the M1A1 Abrams, and redesigned fuel filters that reduce refuelling time [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A2\nThis designation was given to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of the second and third batches This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available The upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling There was an addition of a deflector plate for the periscope and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system The tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987 The third, fourth and fifth batches, which were produced during this period, had the same features The modernised first batch can be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the crosswind sensor for the fire control system was removed [223]\n\n\nLeopard 2A3\nThe fourth batch of 300 vehicles, 165 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr 10624 to 10788) and 135 by MaK (Chassis Nr 20510 to 20644), was delivered between December 1984 and December 1985 The main change was the addition of the SEM80/90 digital radio sets (also being fitted to the Leopard 1 at the same time), and the ammunition reloading hatches being welded shut Even with these minor changes the new batch was known as the 2A3 [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A4\nThe most widespread version of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A4 models included more substantial changes, including an automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system able to handle new ammunition types, and an improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armour The Leopard 2s were manufactured in eight batches between 1985 and 1992 All the older models were upgraded to 2A4 standard Until 1994, Germany operated a total of 2,125 2A4s (695 newly built and the rest modified older versions), [citation needed] while the Netherlands had an additional 445 tanks The 2A4 was licensed and manufactured in Switzerland as the Panzer 87 \"Leopard\" or Pz 87 This version included Swiss-built 7.5 mm (0.295 in) MG 87 machine guns and communications equipment and featured an improved NBC protection system Switzerland operated 380 Pz 87 tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A4V\nOn 1 September 2023, video on social media showed Ukrainian crews with 30 Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt ERA and T-80U style rubber screens, called \"Leopard 2A4V\" by observers [245] This followed previous sightings in Ukraine of a Canadian supplied Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt-1 ERA [115] [212]\n\n\nLeopard 2 Marksman\nFinland has modernised its Marksman SPAAG vehicles by replacing the original T-55AM chassis with a newer Leopard 2A4 chassis [246] The upgraded Marksman vehicles were scheduled to enter service with the Finnish Army in 2016 [247] The new Leopard 2 chassis greatly improves mobility compared to the older T-55AM chassis, both on- and off-road The Leopard 2 chassis is larger, providing a more stable firing platform for the Marksman turret to operate from [248]\n\n\nLeopard 2 Imp\n\"Leopard 2 Improved\" was a series of three prototypes used to test possible further enhancements beyond the Leopard 2A4 model, developed beginning in 1988 [249] After a concept phase, a component test bed (KVT, Komponentenversuchsträger) was built in 1989, followed by two troop trial vehicles (TVM, Truppenversuchsmuster) The Leopard 2 Improved was mostly focused on improving armour protection, introducing the wedge-shaped, spaced add-on armour at the turret front, as well as hull and roof add-on armour, greatly improving protection against hollow charge and kinetic energy threats It does not form a shot-trap, since it does not deflect the penetrators outwards to hit the hull or turret ring The gun mantlet was redesigned to accept the new armour [61] Aside of improved armour protection, these tanks also included improved optics, navigation systems and electronics.\n\n\nLeopard 2A5\nThe Leopard 2 Improved was developed into the Leopard 2A5 Most of its improvements were focused on armour protection; it was enhanced by adding external add-on modules to the turret and replacing the turret's internal armour modules with ones of newer, improved composition [251] The interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated [251] The commander's sight was moved to a new position behind the hatch and it received an independent thermal channel The gunner's sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models A heavier sliding driver's hatch was fitted [252]\n\n\nStridsvagn 122\nStridsvagn 122 (also known as Leopard 2A5S [254] and Leopard 2 \"Improved\" A5 SE [255]\n) is a Swedish Army tank based on the Leopard 2 Improved 120 units were built, 91 of which were licence-produced in Sweden The tank features increased armour on the turret top and front hull, and improved command-, control- and fire-control systems Externally, it can be distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and the much thicker crew hatches [61] The Strv 122B+ Evolution, a variant equipped with modular AMAP composite armour from IBD Deisenroth, has increased 360° protection against threats like EFPs, RPGs and IEDs [256] The width of 4 metres (13 ft) has been kept, while the weight increases by only 350 kilograms (770 lb) [256]\n\n\nLeopard 2-140\nIn the early 1990s, [citation needed] Rheinmetall began development of a 140 mm (5.5 in) smoothbore cannon for use in future tank designs The new gun was intended to counter new Soviet tank developments, especially since the next generation of Soviet main battle tanks were rumoured to be armed with a 135 mm (5.3 in) or 152 mm (6.0 in) cannon The new 140 mm (5.5 in) cannon was part of a modernisation programme for the Leopard 2 known as the KWS III [257] [unreliable source?] Test firing of the new 140 mm (5.5 in) cannon was conducted Results showed that the gun had high penetration values, and had a muzzle velocity of around 2,000 metres a second, with potential to be increased further However, the 140 mm (5.5 in) rounds were too heavy for the tank crew to handle effectively [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A6\nThe Leopard 2A6 includes the addition of the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) L/55 smoothbore gun and other changes All German tank battalions of the \"crisis intervention forces\" are equipped with the A6 Canada purchased twenty Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands These were delivered in 2007 [259] Portugal purchased 37 Leopard 2A6s from the Dutch in 2007, with delivery in 2008 In January 2014, Finland purchased 100 L2A6s, as well as munitions, simulators, and a ten-year supply of reserve parts from the Netherlands The tanks were delivered in batches between 2015 and 2019 [260]\n\n\nLeopardo 2E\nThe Leopard 2E is a derivative of the 2A6, with greater armour protection, [273] developed under a programme of co-production between the defence industries of Spain and Germany The programme was developed within the frame of collaboration decided in 1995 between the Defence Ministries of both countries, which also included the cession of use by period of five years of 108 Leopard 2A4 from the German Army to the Spanish Army The session was extended up to 2016, and after that those tanks will be the sole property of the Spanish Army, as has been made public in January 2006, then having been paid a total of €15,124,014 in ten yearly installments, giving the Spanish co-ownership from 2006.\n\n\nLeopard 2PL\nThe Leopard 2PL is a Polish modernized version of the Leopard 2A4, carried out in cooperation with Rheinmetall and the Polish Armaments Group (Polish: Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, PGZ) The Leopard 2PL MBT is primarily tasked with assault, maintaining territory, and supporting mechanized and motorized subdivisions with its onboard weapon systems in all weather conditions during the day and night The main upgrades when compared to the Leopard 2A4 include modernization of the commander's and gunner's sight, additional ballistic modules on the turret, replacement of the hydraulic stabilization system with a new electric system, and new fire extinguishing and fire suppression systems [274] [275]\n\n\nLeopard 2 PSO\nThe new Leopard 2 PSO (Peace Support Operations) variant is designed especially for urban warfare, which had been encountered in peacekeeping operations with increasing frequency The Leopard 2 PSO is equipped with more effective all-around protection, a secondary weapons station, improved reconnaissance ability, an obstacle clearance blade (OCB), a shorter gun barrel for manoeuvring on urban streets at the expense of fire range, non-lethal armament, close-range surveillance ability through camera systems, a searchlight and further changes to improve its perseverance and mobility in built-up non-wide open areas These features are similar to the Tank Urban Survival Kit for the American M1A2 Abrams [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A7\nThe Leopard 2A7 vehicle is not intended to be optimized for combat in urban terrain, thus it is fundamentally different from the KMW variant, the: 2A7+ (see below) A total of 20 vehicles were provided for converting It involves former Dutch A6NL models returned by Canada to Germany The original upgrade to A6M has been extended in coordination with Canada and includes a crew-compartment cooling-system from the Leopard 2 A6M-HEL series, a new 20 kW (27 hp) auxiliary power unit based on the Steyr Motors M12 TCA UI engine, [279] the Saab Barracuda Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) with Heat-Transfer Reduction (HTR CoolCam) system, [280] a field trial proven combat management and information system (IFIS: Integriertes Führungs- und Informationssystem), onboard network optimization with ultracapacitors in the chassis and turret, a SOTAS IP digital intercom system, a renewal of the fire suppression system in the crew compartment, and the retrofitting of Attica thermal imaging module in the commander optics [46]\n\n\nLeopard 2A7+\nThe Leopard 2A7+ was first shown to the public during the Eurosatory 2010, featuring the label \"Developed by KMW – tested and qualified by the German Ministry of Defence\" The Leopard 2A7+ has been tested by the Bundeswehr under the name UrbOp (urban operations) [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A8\nThe Leopard 2A8 will be based on the current Leopard 2A7HU production model but feature additional improvements; among them the integration of the Trophy APS and an all-round situational awareness system with sensor-fusion capability [288]\n\n\nOrders\nTo replace the eighteen Leopard 2A6 tanks handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the German Ministry of Defence begun planning a purchase a batch of eighteen Leopard 2A8 tanks (with the option for a further 105) in May 2023 [288] In July 2024, Germany's budget committee approved a purchase of the remaining 105 tanks, in a contract worth 2.93 bln € Deliveries are planned between 2027 and 2030 and some ordered tanks will be used by the 45th Panzer Brigade, which, at the time of purchase, was deployed in Lithuania [289]\n\n\nLeopard 2A8 NOR\nThe Norwegian armed forces' order of fifty-four Leopard 2A7NOs was changed into a new 2A8 NOR variant by the middle of June 2023 A variety of Norwegian changes and alterations necessitated the renaming of the original 2A7NO into a unique new 2A8 NOR variant This subvariant mainly differs from the German 2A8 by integrating a Norwegian-designed C4IS-solution that includes Kongsberg's ICS/CORTEX-solution and Teleplan Globe's FACNAV/norBMS battlefield management system [300]\n\n\nLeopard 2 A-RC 3.0\nVariant presented in June 2024 at the Eurosatory exhibition It is equipped with an unmanned turret armed with a 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun fed by a modular linear autoloader, the 120 mm (4.7 in) gun can be exchanged for a 130 mm (5.1 in) or 140 mm (5.5 in) gun, the auto loader is capable of loading 3 rounds in 10 seconds Its secondary armament consists of a RWCS [clarification needed] armed with a 30x113mm cannon capable of countering drone threats and an anti-tank missile The weapon suite can be configured for 3D line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) engagement For its protection, it has a proven active protection system and smoke grenade launcher It weighs less than 60 t (59 long tons; 66 short tons), measures 7.95 m (26.1 ft), extending to 11.17 m (36.6 ft) with the barrel, 3.77 m (12.4 ft) wide and 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in) high to the roof of the turret Its engine generates 1,500 hp (1,100 kW),

2**\n\nThe Leopard 2 is a main battle tank (MBT) designed and produced by the German company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and, for a short period, by the German company MaK. The tank is currently used by several European countries and is considered one of the most advanced tanks in the world.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Leopard 2 is a direct successor to the Leopard 1 tank, which was produced from 1965 to 1990. The Leopard 2 was first unveiled in 1979 and has since undergone several upgrades and modernizations. The tank is known for its advanced armor, powerful engine, and reliable fire control system. Over 3,500 Leopard 2 tanks have been produced, making it one of the most produced tanks in history.\n\n**History**\n\nEven as the Leopard 1 was just entering service, the West German military was interested in producing an improved tank in the next decade. This resulted in the start of the MBT-70 development in cooperation with the United States beginning in 1963. However, already in 1967 it became questionable whether the MBT-70 would enter service at any time in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the West German government issued the order to research future upgrade options for the Leopard 1 to the German company Porsche in 1967.\n\n**Development**\n\nFollowing the end of the Gilded Leopard study in 1967, the West German government decided to focus on the Experimentalentwicklung (experimental development) in a feasibility study and to develop new components for upgrading the Leopard 1 and for use on a future main battle tank programme. At first 25 million DM were invested, but after the industry came to the conclusion that with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested.\n\n**Prototype development**\n\nThe experimental development was contracted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but with the obligation to cooperate with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for the development of the turret.\n\n**Series production**\n\nThe decision to put the Leopard 2 tank in production for the German army was made after a study was undertaken, which showed that adopting the Leopard 2 model would result in a greater combat potential of the German army than producing more Leopard 1A4 tanks or developing an improved version of the Leopard 1A4 with 105/120 mm smoothbore gun, improved armor protection, a new fire control system and a 890 kilowatts (1,190 hp) or 1,100 kilowatts (1,500 hp) engine.\n\n**Further improvements**\n\nWhile previous models only varied in detail, the Leopard 2A4 introduced a digital ballistic computer and an improved fire extinguishing system. Starting with the sixth batch, tanks were fitted with an improved armor array and new side skirts. In 1984, the German military procurement agency stated a number of requirements for a future Leopard 2 upgrade. In 1989, the Kampfwertsteigerung (combat potential improvement) programme was initiated in Germany with the delivery of first prototypes. The official military requirements were published in March 1990.\n\n**Combat history**\n\nThe Leopard 2 has seen action in several conflicts, including the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the Syrian Civil War. The tank has a reputation for its reliability and mobility, and has been praised for its performance in combat.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe Leopard 2 is currently operated by several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, and Turkey. The tank has also been exported to several other countries, including Australia, Finland, and Poland.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe Leopard 2 has undergone several variants, including the Leopard 2A4, Leopard 2A5, and Leopard 2A6. The Leopard 2A4 is the most produced variant, with over 2,000 tanks built. The Leopard 2A5 is an upgraded version of the Leopard 2A4, with improved armor and fire control systems. The Leopard 2A6 is a further upgraded version of the Leopard 2A5, with improved armor and a more powerful engine.\n\n**Current production**\n\nThe Leopard 2 is still in production, with the latest variant, the Leopard 2A7+, being produced in Germany. The Leopard 2A7+ features improved armor, a more powerful engine, and advanced fire control systems.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Leopard 2 has a number of specifications, including a weight of over 60 tons, a length of over 8 meters, and a top speed of over 65 km/h. The tank is powered by a 1,500 horsepower (1,100 kW) engine, and is equipped with a number of advanced systems, including a digital fire control system and a night vision system.\n\n**Export market**\n\nThe Leopard 2 has been exported to several countries, including Australia, Finland, and Poland. The tank has also been sold to several non-NATO countries, including Egypt and Turkey.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Leopard 2 is a highly advanced main battle tank that has been in service for over 40 years. The tank has undergone several upgrades and modernizations, and is currently operated by several countries. The Leopard 2 has a reputation for its reliability and mobility, and has been praised for its performance in combat.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Leopard 2\". Wikipedia.

main battle tank programme [14] At first 25 million DM were invested, but after the industry came to the conclusion that with such a low budget the development of the two projected testbeds was not possible, a total of 30 to 32 million DM was invested The experimental development was contracted to the company Krauss-Maffei, but with the obligation to cooperate with Porsche for the development of the chassis and with Wegmann for the development of the turret [16]\n\n\nAmerican evaluation of Leopard 2AV and XM1 Abrams\nIn July 1973 German Federal Minister of Defence Georg Leber and his US counterpart James R Schlesinger agreed upon a higher degree of standardisation in main battle tanks being favourable to NATO By integrating components already fully developed by German companies for the Leopard 2, the costs of the XM1 Abrams, U.S prototype tank developed after the MBT-70, could be reduced A German commission was sent to the US to evaluate the harmonisation of components between the XM1 and Leopard 2 [23] However, under American law it was not possible for a public bidder to interfere in a procurement tender after a contract with intention of profits and deadline was awarded to private sector companies [23]\n\n\nSeries production\nThe decision to put the Leopard 2 tank in production for the German army was made after a study was undertaken [when?], which showed that adopting the Leopard 2 model would result in a greater combat potential of the German army than producing more Leopard 1A4 tanks or developing an improved version of the Leopard 1A4 with 105/120 mm smoothbore gun, improved armour protection, a new fire control system and a 890 kilowatts (1,190 hp) or 1,100 kilowatts (1,500 hp) engine [34] Various changes were applied to the Leopard 2 design before the series production started in 1979 [35] [36] The engine, transmission, and suspension were slightly modified and improved The ballistic protection of the turret and hull was improved and weak spots were eliminated [37]\n\n\nFurther improvements\nWhile previous models only varied in detail, the Leopard 2A4 introduced a digital ballistic computer and an improved fire extinguishing system Starting with the sixth batch, tanks were fitted with an improved armour array and new side skirts In 1984, the German military procurement agency stated a number of requirements for a future Leopard 2 upgrade In 1989, the Kampfwertsteigerung (combat potential improvement) programme was initiated in Germany with the delivery of first prototypes The official military requirements were published in March 1990 [42]\n\n\nReplacement\nThe Leopard 2 first entered service in 1979, and its service life is anticipated to end around 2030 In May 2015, the German Ministry of Defence announced plans to develop a tank jointly with France as a successor to both the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks Technologies and concepts will be investigated to determine what capabilities are needed in a future tank [50] Deployment of the new tank, titled Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), will be preceded by incremental upgrades to the Leopard 2, including a new digital turret core system and situational awareness system and an active protection system (APS) [51]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design [52] The armour consists of a combination of steel plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials [53] [54] [55] Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets [56] The Leopard 2's armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970 [57]\n\n\nProtection\nThe Leopard 2 uses spaced multilayer armour throughout the design [52] The armour consists of a combination of steel plates of different hardness, elastic materials, and other non-metallic materials [53] [54] [55] Steel plates with high hardness and high ductility are used The armour is a result of extensive research about the formation and penetration mechanism of shaped charge jets [56] The Leopard 2's armour might be based on the British Burlington armour, which had already been demonstrated to West Germany in 1970 [57]\n\n\nSecondary protection\nThe Leopard 2's design follows the concept of compartmentation Possible sources of fire or explosions have been moved away from the crew [55] In the turret, the ammunition and the hydraulics are located in compartments separated from the crew In case of a detonation, the blow-off panels on the compartment roofs will direct the explosion and fire away from the crew The crew is also protected against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) threats, as the Leopard 2 is equipped with a Dräger NBC overpressurization system, which provides up to 4 hPA over-pressure inside the vehicle [60]\n\n\nArmour upgrades\nFollowing Leopard 2's introduction into service in 1979, the armour has been gradually improved over the years A modified version of spaced multilayer armour was introduced beginning with the 97th vehicle of the 6th production batch [62] The same batch also introduced an improved type of heavy ballistic skirts.\n\n\nArmour protection estimates\nEstimated levels of protection for the Leopard 2 range from 590 to 690 mm (23 to 27 in) RHAe on the turret, 600 mm (24 in) RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A4, to 920–940 mm (36–37 in) RHAe on the turret, 620 mm (24 in) RHAe on the glacis and lower front hull on the Leopard 2A6 against kinetic projectiles [60] [unreliable source?]\n\n\nArmament\nThe primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun—the same gun later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models) [60]\n\n\nPrimary\nThe primary armament for production versions of the Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun—the same gun later adapted for use on the M1 Abrams—in either the L/44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L/55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models) [60]\n\n\nSecondary\nThe Leopard 2 is equipped with two machine guns, one mounted co-axially, the other an anti-aircraft mount German models use the MG 3 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine gun; Dutch and Singaporean models use FN MAG 7.62 mm (0.3 in) machine guns; Swiss models use Swiss MG 87 7.5 mm (0.295 in) machine guns [60] 4,750 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried on board the Leopard 2, of which 2,000 rounds are carried for the coaxial machine gun [79] More recent variants such as the Leopard 2A7+ are capable of mounting a Remotely-Controlled Weapons Station fitted with a Browning M2HB Heavy Machine Gun, near the commander's hatch.\n\n\nFire control\nThe standard fire control system found on the Leopard 2 is the German EMES 15 fire control system with a dual magnification stabilised primary sight The primary sight has an integrated neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet Nd:YAG laser rangefinder and a 120 element mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe (also known as CMT) Zeiss thermographic camera, both of which are linked to the tank's fire control computer [80] A backup 8x auxiliary telescope FERO-Z18 is mounted coaxially for the gunner [60]\n\n\nPropulsion\nThe Leopard 2 is propelled by the MTU MB 873 Ka-501 engine It provides 1,500 PS (1.1 MW) at 2,600 RPM and 4,700 N⋅m (3,500 lb⋅ft) of torque at 1,600–1,700 RPM The MTU MB 873 Ka-501 is a four-stroke, 47.7 litre, 90° V-block 12-cylinder, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, liquid-cooled diesel engine (with multi-fuel capability) It has an estimated fuel consumption rate of around 300 litres per 100 km on roads and 500 litres per 100 km across the country, and is coupled to the Renk HSWL 354 gear and brake system [60] [80]\n\n\nExports\nGermany has fielded about 2,125 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in various versions, but many were sold following German reunification The Leopard 2 became very popular in the 1990s, when the shrinking German army offered many of its redundant Leopard 2s at a reduced price It became successful enough in Europe that the manufacturer started calling it the Euro Leopard, despite France, Britain, and Italy all operating their own MBTs With further non-European orders, the name \"Global-Leopard\" is now used instead [84] Leopard 2 tanks have also been resold by original export customers, although reexport has always been conditional on consent from the German government who control the platform's export licence Other countries have bought newly manufactured vehicles or have produced them locally under licence.\n\n\nEurope\nThe Netherlands ordered 445 Leopard 2 tanks on 2 March 1979, after examining the results of the Leopard 2AV in the United States [85] It became the first export customer of the Leopard 2 and the vehicles were delivered between July 1981 and July 1986 Dutch Leopard 2 tanks have been subsequently exported to Austria, Canada, Norway, and Portugal In 2011 the last Dutch tank division was disbanded and their last Leopard 2 tanks were sold Then in 2015, because of rising tensions with Russia because of MH-17 and the Invasion of Crimea, the Dutch army released that they would start leasing 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks from Germany These tanks are operated in joint German-Dutch division [86] In September 2024 the Dutch army announced that they would order 46 Leopard 2A8 with 6 options [87] These will not be replacing the leased Leopard 2A6's from Germany It is currently unknown if they will be operated in a join German-Dutch division.\n\n\nBeyond Europe\nIn 2005, Turkey ordered 298 Leopard 2 tanks from German army stocks [109] The Leopard 2 was chosen in 2001 after successfully competing one year earlier in the Turkish army trials against the T-84 Yatagan, Leclerc and a version of the M1A2 Abrams fitted with a German MTU diesel engine Turkey wanted to buy 1,000 Leopard 2 tanks in 1999, but the German government rejected the deal.\n\n\nTransfer to Ukraine\nOn 2 July 2023, Ukraine had reportedly received 54 Leopard 2A4 from NATO-member countries [115]\n\n\nPolitical discussions\nSince April 2022, in the wake of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian government has requested that their allies donate Western-made main battle tanks Poland, Finland and others have all announced a willingness to contribute Leopard 2 tanks from their stocks, with around 100 tanks from various states ready to be transferred to Ukraine [116] However, when Germany exported the tanks to these countries, it had made reexport conditional on a German government permit, as based on the Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz and Außenwirtschaftsgesetz Until 22 January 2023, it was unclear whether such a consent would be provided with Germany determined to avoid any perception of escalating the conflict, and wary of being labelled an aggressor [117] Germany has also been keen to extract an American commitment to provide its own M1 Abrams tanks, before sending German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [118]\n\n\nGermany\nOn 25 January 2023, the German government confirmed that it would make 14 Leopard 2A6 (a company-strength number) available for Ukraine and would give authorisation to European partners to reexport their vehicles [127] The goal is for European Leopard 2 operators to provide two battalions worth, or 88 tanks, to Ukraine [130]\n\n\nPoland\nPoland welcomed the German decision to allow the transfer of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, with the Polish government announcing on 25 January it would transfer 14 Leopards to Ukraine from a total Polish stock of 247, in addition to a further 50–60 Soviet-era tanks [136] On 24 February 2023, the first 4 Leopard 2A4 tanks from Polish stocks were delivered to Ukraine These are the first Leopard 2 tanks to be operated by Ukraine [137]\n\n\nCanada\nOn 26 January 2023, the Canadian Defence Minister, Anita Anand, announced that Canada would be sending four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, with the potential for more to follow These vehicles were reportedly 'combat ready.' Canada will also provide appropriate training to Ukrainian forces who will go on to operate these tanks [138] The first Canadian Leopard 2 tanks had arrived in Poland on 5 February, to allow Ukrainian troops to begin training [139] On 24 February, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, announced that Canada would be sending a further four Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine along with one armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) and 5,000 rounds of ammunition [140]\n\n\nCzech Republic\nOn 20 January 2023, the Czech Defense Ministry issued a statement that the media reports indicating the Czech Republic and Slovakia were willing to give up their Leopard 2 tanks for Ukraine were false, and that rumors that the Czech Republic would receive American Abrams tanks in exchange for Leopards were also false [141] As of December 2022, both countries had only received one Leopard 2A4 each from Rheinmetall as part of Germany's Ringtausch program in exchange for them delivering older Soviet equipment to Ukraine, while the remaining Leopard 2A4s are still being refurbished (expected to be delivered throughout 2023) [142]\n\n\nDenmark\nWhile it was reported in the international press that Denmark had signalled that it could contribute a number of tanks, [143] there was no official indication from the Danish Government that any Danish Leopard 2s would be sent to Ukraine Of the Danish inventory of 44 tanks, 14 were deployed to Estonia as part of NATO EFP, with a further number receiving upgrades at the German manufacturers [144] Some Danish opposition politicians voiced support for a transfer of Danish tanks [145] Unlike those considered by other countries, the Danish Leopards are of the new 2A7 standard, which would represent some logistic and mechanical challenges compared to the other variants [146] Denmark instead announced on 7 February that it was jointly purchasing 100-178 Leopard 1A5 tanks with Germany and the Netherlands [147] Denmark also announced on 20 April 2023 that they would jointly finance with the Netherlands the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks [148]\n\n\nFinland\nFinland had suggested before the German decision on reexport, that it could supply Ukraine with a limited number of Leopard 2 tanks The Finnish President, Sauli Niinistö, warned that \"the number of tanks  [to be sent to Ukraine] cannot be large, since Finland borders on Russia and is not part of NATO  [yet].\" [149] On 23 February Finland announced it will give three of its six Leopard 2R breaching tanks to Ukraine [150] The donation of the remaining three was announced a month later [151]\n\n\nGreece\nOn 25 January 2023 it was reported that Greece was one of the countries that had indicated it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [152] On 29 January 2023 it was erroneously reported that approximately 14 Leopard 2 tanks would be provided, though it was unclear if it would be the 2A4 or 2A6 HEL variant [153] However, on 31 January, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis clarified that Greece would not supply any Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing \"they are absolutely necessary for our defense posture.\" [154] Leaked Pentagon documents revealed that Greece was preparing to donate five of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, though Greek defense minister Nikolaos Panayiotopoulos reiterated later in April his government's opposition to tank deliveries to Ukraine, making confirmation of the delivery uncertain [155]\n\n\nNetherlands\nThe Netherlands was considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte suggesting that the Dutch government could purchase tanks from other countries and donate them [156] There were also some discussions about Netherlands purchasing the 18 Leopard 2A6 tanks they lease from Germany No refusal was made from Germany to sell them as no formal request to buy them was made; both countries agreed that they were critical to the operations of the joint German-Dutch military unit However, the Netherlands agreed to supply ammunition for Leopard tanks and announced it had not abandoned its intention to contribute to the tank initiative, while also noting it was helping to purchase Leopard 1A5 tanks with Denmark and Germany [157] The Netherlands later announced it was jointly financing with Denmark the purchase and refurbishing of 14 Leopard 2A4 for Ukraine from private industry stocks, with delivery expected in early 2024 [158]\n\n\nNorway\nOn 25 January 2023, Norway pledged to donate spare Leopards to Ukraine with reports speculating that between four and eight of its 36 Leopard 2A4 tanks would be sent [143] [159] [160] Norwegian defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said in an interview with Norwegian public television NRK: \"Norway and the government support the donation of battle tanks to Ukraine Norway will take part,\" but did not specify how many would be sent [161] On 14 February 2023, Gram announced that 8 Norwegian Leopard 2 tanks and 4 Leopard 1 derived \"special purpose vehicles\" would be handed over to Ukraine The special purpose vehicles turned out to be a mix of 3 NM189 AEVs and 1 NM217 ARV [162] [163] In February 2023, Norway ordered 54 Leopard 2A7 tanks (later changed to 2A8 variant) to be delivered from 2026, with a further option for 18 vehicles if necessary.\n\n\nPortugal\nWhen the German government changed its position on the reexport of Leopard 2 tanks, it was reported that the Portuguese government was preparing to send four of their Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine [164] On 4 February, Prime Minister António Costa confirmed that Portugal would send Leopards to Ukraine, but did not confirm the number of vehicles set to be delivered It is understood that Portugal is working with Germany to obtain the necessary parts to repair inoperable tanks in its inventory of 37 Leopard 2 tanks, but it has been widely reported by local media that most are inoperable Costa expressed hopes that Portuguese tanks would be delivered by March 2023 [165] On 14 February, it was reported that Portugal had earmarked three Leopard 2A6 tanks for donation to Ukraine [129] All three were confirmed donated on 27 March together with the 18 German Leopard 2A6 [166]\n\n\nSlovakia\nOn 25 January 2023, Slovakia announced it was not considering the transfer of any of its Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine, but were willing to provide T-72 tanks if other allies replaced them with other tanks The reason cited for this was that Slovakia had only received 1 of the 15 Leopard tanks it was promised as part of Germany's Ringtaush program, which it was getting in exchange for supplying Ukraine with 30 Soviet-era infantry fighting vehicles [167]\n\n\nSpain\nOn 4 June 2022 it was reported that Spain was considering providing 40 of its 53 retired Leopard 2A4 tanks stored in Zaragoza [168] On 8 June German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denied receiving any formal request from Spain for an export permit for Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine [169] However it was later confirmed on 10 June by the Spanish defense minister they were considering the transfer [170] On 12 June, anonymous government sources told Der Spiegel that the Scholz government blocked any transfer of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, arguing this \"would constitute a departure\" from an informal NATO decision not to provide Western tanks at that time [171] By 2 August, Spain officially backtracked on its decision, arguing the tanks at Zaragoza were in \"deplorable condition\" and that it could not send any [172]\n\n\nSweden\nSweden began considering Ukrainian requests for Leopard 2 tanks in January 2023 and did not rule out contributing its Strv 122 at a later stage [178] On 24 February, the Swedish minister of defence Pål Jonson announced that Sweden would be providing 10 Strv 122 tanks to Ukraine [179]\n\n\nCombat history\nStarting on 12 June 1999, 28 Leopard 2A5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the German Army as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) The vehicles of Panzerbataillon 33 and 214 were sent from North Macedonia to Prizren They were used for patrols, protecting checkpoints and bases as well as part of the show of force On 13 June 1999, two members of the Serbian paramilitary started firing from inside a Fiat 125p car at one of the checkpoints in Prizren and both were killed by return fire A Leopard 2A5 was located at the checkpoint, but it could not participate in the fighting as it was only partially crewed [180]\n\n\nKFOR\nStarting on 12 June 1999, 28 Leopard 2A5 tanks were deployed to Kosovo by the

Leopard 2 tanks [182] Dutch Leopard 2A4s and Leopard 2A5s were stationed at the NLD bases at Bugojno, Novi Travnik, Sisava, Knezevo, Maslovare and Suica [citation needed]\n\n\nISAF/OEF\nIn October 2003, Canada was planning to replace its Leopard C2s with wheeled Stryker Mobile Gun Systems However, operational experience in Afghanistan and in particular during Operation Medusa, convinced the Canadian military of the usefulness of maintaining a tank fleet [183] Leopard C2s were deployed to Kandahar in December 2006, [184] but they were by then almost 30 years old, and were nearing the end of their operational life The Canadian government decided to borrow 20 Leopard 2A6s and three armoured recovery vehicles from Germany for rapid deployment to Afghanistan In late August 2007, the first Leopard 2s were airlifted into Afghanistan to equip Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) [185]\n\n\nTurkish intervention in Syria\nTurkey operates 354 Leopard 2A4 tanks Initially using other tank types including upgraded M60s, in December 2016 Turkey deployed a number of Leopard 2A4s to the Syrian Civil War against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) as part of Operation Euphrates Shield [citation needed] Initially, three of the Turkish Leopard 2A4s operating in Syria were destroyed or damaged by ISIS using anti-tank missile systems (possibly Fagot or Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles obtained from Syrian or Iraqi Army captured stocks) [citation needed] In mid-December 2016, two 2A4 tanks were captured by ISIS near al-Bab city in Syria during Euphrates Shield operations Amaq News Agency posted video of vehicles claimed to be captured Leopard 2A4s [195]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nIn April 2023, during training of a Ukrainian crew a Leopard 2A4 was damaged with its turret being completely dislodged from the hull The crew was reported as fine [209] In July 2023, a Leopard 2A4 was modified to carry Kontakt-1 ERA on the sides of the hull and the turret It was also shown with rubber screens attached to the turret and gun mantel [115] [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nVariants\nThe baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the \"A0\" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first series manufactured version The vehicles were manufactured from October 1979 until March 1982, altogether 380 vehicles 209 were built by Krauss Maffei and 171 by MaK The basic equipment consisted of electrical-hydraulic stabiliser WNA-H22, a fire control computer, a laser rangefinder, a wind sensor, a general-purpose telescope EMES 15, a panorama periscope PERI R17, the gunner's primary sight FERO Z18, on the turret roof as well as a computer-controlled tank testing set RPP 1–8 200 of the vehicles had a low-light enhancer (PZB 200) instead of thermal imaging Two chassis served as driver training vehicles [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2\nThe baseline Leopard 2, sometimes informally called the \"A0\" to differentiate it from later versions, was the first

training vehicles [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A1\nMinor modifications and the installation of the gunner's thermal sight [1] were worked into the second batch of 450 vehicles Leopard 2, designated the A1 Krauss-Maffei built 248 (Chassis Nr 10211 to 10458) and MaK built 202 (Chassis Nr 20173 to 20347) Deliveries of the 2A1 models started in March 1982 and ended in November 1983 The two most notable changes were the modification of the ammunition racks to be identical to those in the M1A1 Abrams, and redesigned fuel filters that reduce refuelling time [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A2\nThis designation was given to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of the second and third batches This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available The upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling There was an addition of a deflector plate for the periscope and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system The tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987 The third, fourth and fifth batches, which were produced during this period, had the same features The modernised first batch can be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the crosswind sensor for the fire control system was removed [223]\n\n\nLeopard 2A3\nThe fourth batch of 300 vehicles, 165 by Krauss-Maffei (Chassis Nr 10624 to 10788) and 135 by MaK (Chassis Nr 20510 to 20644), was delivered between December 1984 and December 1985 The main change was the addition of the SEM80/90 digital radio sets (also being fitted to the Leopard 1 at the same time), and the ammunition reloading hatches being welded shut Even with these minor changes the new batch was known as the 2A3 [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A4\nThe most widespread version of the Leopard 2 family, the 2A4 models included more substantial changes, including an automated fire and explosion suppression system, an all-digital fire control system able to handle new ammunition types, and an improved turret with flat titanium/tungsten armour The Leopard 2s were manufactured in eight batches between 1985 and 1992 All the older models were upgraded to 2A4 standard Until 1994, Germany operated a total of 2,125 2A4s (695 newly built and the rest modified older versions), [citation needed] while the Netherlands had an additional 445 tanks The 2A4 was licensed and manufactured in Switzerland as the Panzer 87 \"Leopard\" or Pz 87 This version included Swiss-built 7.5 mm (0.295 in) MG 87 machine guns and communications equipment and featured an improved NBC protection system Switzerland operated 380 Pz 87 tanks [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A4V\nOn 1 September 2023, video on social media showed Ukrainian crews with 30 Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt ERA and T-80U style rubber screens, called \"Leopard 2A4V\" by observers [245] This followed previous sightings in Ukraine of a Canadian supplied Leopard 2A4 upgraded with Kontakt-1 ERA [115] [212]\n\n\nLeopard 2 Marksman\nFinland has modernised its Marksman SPAAG vehicles by replacing the original T-55AM chassis with a newer Leopard 2A4 chassis [246] The upgraded Marksman vehicles were scheduled to enter service with the Finnish Army in 2016 [247] The new Leopard 2 chassis greatly improves mobility compared to the older T-55AM chassis, both on- and off-road The Leopard 2 chassis is larger, providing a more stable firing platform for the Marksman turret to operate from [248]\n\n\nLeopard 2 Imp\n\"Leopard 2 Improved\" was a series of three prototypes used to test possible further enhancements beyond the Leopard 2A4 model, developed beginning in 1988 [249] After a concept phase, a component test bed (KVT, Komponentenversuchsträger) was built in 1989, followed by two troop trial vehicles (TVM, Truppenversuchsmuster) The Leopard 2 Improved was mostly focused on improving armour protection, introducing the wedge-shaped, spaced add-on armour at the turret front, as well as hull and roof add-on armour, greatly improving protection against hollow charge and kinetic energy threats It does not form a shot-trap, since it does not deflect the penetrators outwards to hit the hull or turret ring The gun mantlet was redesigned to accept the new armour [61] Aside of improved armour protection, these tanks also included improved optics, navigation systems and electronics.\n\n\nLeopard 2A5\nThe Leopard 2 Improved was developed into the Leopard 2A5 Most of its improvements were focused on armour protection; it was enhanced by adding external add-on modules to the turret and replacing the turret's internal armour modules with ones of newer, improved composition [251] The interior received spall liners to reduce fragments if the armour is penetrated [251] The commander's sight was moved to a new position behind the hatch and it received an independent thermal channel The gunner's sight was moved to the turret roof as opposed to the cavity in the front armour in previous models A heavier sliding driver's hatch was fitted [252]\n\n\nStridsvagn 122\nStridsvagn 122 (also known as Leopard 2A5S [254] and Leopard 2 \"Improved\" A5 SE [255]\n) is a Swedish Army tank based on the Leopard 2 Improved 120 units were built, 91 of which were licence-produced in Sweden The tank features increased armour on the turret top and front hull, and improved command-, control- and fire-control systems Externally, it can be distinguished from the Leopard 2A5 by the French GALIX smoke dispensers, different storage bins, and the much thicker crew hatches [61] The Strv 122B+ Evolution, a variant equipped with modular AMAP composite armour from IBD Deisenroth, has increased 360° protection against threats like EFPs, RPGs and IEDs [256] The width of 4 metres (13 ft) has been kept, while the weight increases by only 350 kilograms (770 lb) [256]\n\n\nLeopard 2-140\nIn the early 1990s, [citation needed] Rheinmetall began development of a 140 mm (5.5 in) smoothbore cannon for use in future tank designs The new gun was intended to counter new Soviet tank developments, especially since the next generation of Soviet main battle tanks were rumoured to be armed with a 135 mm (5.3 in) or 152 mm (6.0 in) cannon The new 140 mm (5.5 in) cannon was part of a modernisation programme for the Leopard 2 known as the KWS III [257] [unreliable source?] Test firing of the new 140 mm (5.5 in) cannon was conducted Results showed that the gun had high penetration values, and had a muzzle velocity of around 2,000 metres a second, with potential to be increased further However, the 140 mm (5.5 in) rounds were too heavy for the tank crew to handle effectively [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A6\nThe Leopard 2A6 includes the addition of the Rheinmetall 120 mm (4.7 in) L/55 smoothbore gun and other changes All German tank battalions of the \"crisis intervention forces\" are equipped with the A6 Canada purchased twenty Leopard 2A6s from the Netherlands These were delivered in 2007 [259] Portugal purchased 37 Leopard 2A6s from the Dutch in 2007, with delivery in 2008 In January 2014, Finland purchased 100 L2A6s, as well as munitions, simulators, and a ten-year supply of reserve parts from the Netherlands The tanks were delivered in batches between 2015 and 2019 [260]\n\n\nLeopardo 2E\nThe Leopard 2E is a derivative of the 2A6, with greater armour protection, [273] developed under a programme of co-production between the defence industries of Spain and Germany The programme was developed within the frame of collaboration decided in 1995 between the Defence Ministries of both countries, which also included the cession of use by period of five years of 108 Leopard 2A4 from the German Army to the Spanish Army The session was extended up to 2016, and after that those tanks will be the sole property of the Spanish Army, as has been made public in January 2006, then having been paid a total of €15,124,014 in ten yearly installments, giving the Spanish co-ownership from 2006.\n\n\nLeopard 2PL\nThe Leopard 2PL is a Polish modernized version of the Leopard 2A4, carried out in cooperation with Rheinmetall and the Polish Armaments Group (Polish: Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, PGZ) The Leopard 2PL MBT is primarily tasked with assault, maintaining territory, and supporting mechanized and motorized subdivisions with its onboard weapon systems in all weather conditions during the day and night The main upgrades when compared to the Leopard 2A4 include modernization of the commander's and gunner's sight, additional ballistic modules on the turret, replacement of the hydraulic stabilization system with a new electric system, and new fire extinguishing and fire suppression systems [274] [275]\n\n\nLeopard 2 PSO\nThe new Leopard 2 PSO (Peace Support Operations) variant is designed especially for urban warfare, which had been encountered in peacekeeping operations with increasing frequency The Leopard 2 PSO is equipped with more effective all-around protection, a secondary weapons station, improved reconnaissance ability, an obstacle clearance blade (OCB), a shorter gun barrel for manoeuvring on urban streets at the expense of fire range, non-lethal armament, close-range surveillance ability through camera systems, a searchlight and further changes to improve its perseverance and mobility in built-up non-wide open areas These features are similar to the Tank Urban Survival Kit for the American M1A2 Abrams [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A7\nThe Leopard 2A7 vehicle is not intended to be optimized for combat in urban terrain, thus it is fundamentally different from the KMW variant, the: 2A7+ (see below) A total of 20 vehicles were provided for converting It involves former Dutch A6NL models returned by Canada to Germany The original upgrade to A6M has been extended in coordination with Canada and includes a crew-compartment cooling-system from the Leopard 2 A6M-HEL series, a new 20 kW (27 hp) auxiliary power unit based on the Steyr Motors M12 TCA UI engine, [279] the Saab Barracuda Mobile Camouflage System (MCS) with Heat-Transfer Reduction (HTR CoolCam) system, [280] a field trial proven combat management and information system (IFIS: Integriertes Führungs- und Informationssystem), onboard network optimization with ultracapacitors in the chassis and turret, a SOTAS IP digital intercom system, a renewal of the fire suppression system in the crew compartment, and the retrofitting of Attica thermal imaging module in the commander optics [46]\n\n\nLeopard 2A7+\nThe Leopard 2A7+ was first shown to the public during the Eurosatory 2010, featuring the label \"Developed by KMW – tested and qualified by the German Ministry of Defence\" The Leopard 2A7+ has been tested by the Bundeswehr under the name UrbOp (urban operations) [citation needed]\n\n\nLeopard 2A8\nThe Leopard 2A8 will be based on the current Leopard 2A7HU production model but feature additional improvements; among them the integration of the Trophy APS and an all-round situational awareness system with sensor-fusion capability [288]\n\n\nOrders\nTo replace the eighteen Leopard 2A6 tanks handed over to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the German Ministry of Defence begun planning a purchase a batch of eighteen Leopard 2A8 tanks (with the option for a further 105) in May 2023 [288] In July 2024, Germany's budget committee approved a purchase of the remaining 105 tanks, in a contract worth 2.93 bln € Deliveries are planned between 2027 and 2030 and some ordered tanks will be used by the 45th Panzer Brigade, which, at the time of purchase, was deployed in Lithuania [289]\n\n\nLeopard 2A8 NOR\nThe Norwegian armed forces' order of fifty-four Leopard 2A7NOs was changed into a new 2A8 NOR variant by the middle of June 2023 A variety of Norwegian changes and alterations necessitated the renaming of the original 2A7NO into a unique new 2A8 NOR variant This subvariant mainly differs from the German 2A8 by integrating a Norwegian-designed C4IS-solution that includes Kongsberg's ICS/CORTEX-solution and Teleplan Globe's FACNAV/norBMS battlefield management system [300]\n\n\nLeopard 2 A-RC 3.0\nVariant presented in June 2024 at the Eurosatory exhibition It is equipped with an unmanned turret armed with a 120 mm (4.7 in) smoothbore gun fed by a modular linear autoloader, the 120 mm (4.7 in) gun can be exchanged for a 130 mm (5.1 in) or 140 mm (5.5 in) gun, the auto loader is capable of loading 3 rounds in 10 seconds Its secondary armament consists of a RWCS [clarification needed] armed with a 30x113mm cannon capable of countering drone threats and an anti-tank missile The weapon suite can be configured for 3D line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) engagement For its protection, it has a proven active protection system and smoke grenade launcher It weighs less than 60 t (59 long tons; 66 short tons), measures 7.95 m (26.1 ft), extending to 11.17 m (36.6 ft) with the barrel, 3.77 m (12.4 ft) wide and 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in) high to the roof of the turret Its engine generates 1,500 hp (1,100 kW), allowing the tank to move at a speed of 65 km/h (40 mph) and its autonomy is 460 km (290 mi) It has a crew of 3 men, commander, driver and gunner, all located inside the chassis [301]

He is best known as the drummer and vocalist of the 1960s pop-rock band The Monkees.\n\nIntroduction\nThe Monkees were a manufactured band created for a television show of the same name. The show was a huge success, and the band quickly gained a following. Dolenz's charismatic personality and musical talents made him a key member of the band.\n\nLife and Entertainment Career\nDolenz was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 8, 1945. He is the son of actors George Dolenz and Janelle Johnson. He has three sisters, Gemma Marie (\"Coco\"), Deborah, and Kathleen (\"Gina\").\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDolenz began his show-business career in 1956 when he starred in a children's TV show called Circus Boy under the name Mickey Braddock. He played Corky, an orphaned water boy for the elephants in a one-ring circus at the start of the 20th century. The program ran for two seasons, after which Dolenz made sporadic appearances on network television shows and pursued his education. Dolenz went to Ulysses S Grant High School in Valley Glen and graduated in 1962. In 1964, he was cast as Ed in the episode \"Born of Kings and Angels\" of the NBC education drama series Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus as an idealistic Los Angeles teacher.\n\n**The Monkees**\n\nIn 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, writers of many of the Monkees' songs, observed quickly that when brought into the studio together, the four actors would try to make each other laugh. Because of this, the writers often brought in each singer individually. The antics escalated until Dolenz poured a cup of ice on Don Kirshner's head. At the time, Dolenz did not know Kirshner on sight.\n\n**Solo MGM Recordings**\n\nThe Moog synthesizer that Dolenz had bought proved vital when he composed a song entitled \"Easy on You\" in 1971. He began recording it in his home studio, playing acoustic guitar and drums, and using the Moog like a keyboard. With that song completed, he next invited former Monkee Peter Tork over to help with more recordings. Then, a fortuitous street encounter led to former Monkee stand-in David Price joining, as well as contributing a rock song he had written called \"Oh Someone.\" With Dolenz on drums and vocals, Tork on bass, and Price on rhythm guitar, the song was completed in only two hours. Subsequently, guitarist B.J. Jones came in two days later and added lead guitar. With these two songs recorded, Dolenz contacted his former high school friend Mike Curb, then the head of MGM Records; after playing the songs for Curb, Dolenz was immediately signed to MGM.\n\n**Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart**\n\nIn part because of reruns of The Monkees on Saturday mornings and in syndication, The Monkees' Greatest Hits charted in 1976. The LP, issued by Arista (a subsidiary of Columbia Pictures), was actually a repackaging of a 1972 compilation LP called Re-Focus that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, Bell Records, also owned by Columbia Pictures.\n\n**Notable Stage Work**\n\nIn 1977, he performed with former bandmate Davy Jones in a stage production of the Harry Nilsson musical The Point! at London's Mermaid Theatre, playing and singing the part of the \"Count's Kid\" and the Leafman to Jones' starring role as Oblio. An original cast recording was made and released. The comedic chemistry of Dolenz and Jones proved so strong that the show was revived in 1978 with Nilsson inserting additional comedy for the two, plus two more songs, with one of them (\"Gotta Get Up\") being sung by Dolenz and Jones together. The show was considered so good that it was planned to be revived again in 1979, but it proved cost-prohibitive. After the show's run, Dolenz remained in England and began directing for stage and television, as well as producing several of the shows he directed.\n\n**After Monkees Television and Film Career**\n\nAfter The Monkees television show ended, Dolenz continued performing, providing voice-overs for a number of Saturday-morning cartoon series, including The Funky Phantom, Partridge Family 2200 A.D., The Scooby-Doo Show, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, These Are the Days, Devlin, and Wonder Wheels (from The Skatebirds). Dolenz provided the voice of Arthur in the first season of the animated series The Tick. In 1972, Dolenz played Vance in the murder mystery film Night of the Strangler. He was featured in an episode of Adam-12, entitled \"Dirt Duel\" (season 5, episode 1), and an episode of Cannon, entitled \"Bitter Legion\" (season 2, episode 3). Dolenz provided the voice of Two-Face's twin henchmen Min and Max in the two-part episode \"Two-Face\" on Batman: The Animated Series.\n\n**Directorial Work**\n\nIn 1980, Dolenz produced and directed the British television sitcom Metal Mickey, featuring a large metallic robot with the catch-phrase \"boogie boogie.\" In 1981, he directed a short film based on the sketch \"Balham, Gateway to the South,\" with Robbie Coltrane playing multiple roles. In the early 1980s, Dolenz directed a stage adaptation of Bugsy Malone. He was producer of the TV show Luna in 1983-84.\n\n**MTV Reignites Monkee Mania**\n\nIn 1986, a screening of the entire Monkees television series by MTV led to renewed interest in the band, followed by a single, \"That Was Then, This Is Now,\" which reached No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and No. 41 in Canada, a 20th-anniversary tour, a greatest hits album, and a brand new LP, Pool It! in 1987. The band's original albums were reissued, and all hit the record charts at the same time.\n\n**WCBS-FM**\n\nOn January 10, 2005, Dolenz replaced Dan Taylor as the morning disc jockey at oldies radio station WCBS-FM in New York. On June 3, 2005, Dolenz celebrated his 100th show with a special morning show at B.B. King's. That was also his last regular show at the station; at 5:00 pm, WCBS-FM announced that the station would replace its oldies format with a \"Jack\" format, eliminating the need for on-air disc jockeys.\n\n**Solo Work and Further Monkees Reunions**\n\nIn 2009, Dolenz signed a deal to record an album of the classic songs of Carole King, titled King for a Day. The album (released on Gigitone Records) was produced by Jeffrey Foskett, who has worked extensively with Brian Wilson and played on Wilson's 2004 Grammy-winning Brian Wilson Presents Smile. King's songs \"Pleasant Valley Sunday,\" \"Sometime in the Morning,\" and \"Porpoise Song\" (Theme from Head) have emerged as signature songs from the Monkees. As of February 2010, he was appearing on stage in London in Hairspray with Michael Ball. The show also went on tour and had a successful run in Dublin, Ireland, during November 2010. In 2011, he rejoined Tork and Jones for An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour.\n\n**Other Tours**\n\nIn late 2019, Dolenz toured with Todd Rundgren, Jason Scheff, Christopher Cross, and Joey Molland of Badfinger, in celebration of the Beatles' White Album on the \"It Was Fifty Years Ago Today – A Tribute to the Beatles' White Album\" tour. Dolenz performed the Monkees' songs \"I'm a Believer\" and \"Pleasant Valley Sunday.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDolenz has been married three times and is the father of four daughters. In 1967, while in the UK on tour with the Monkees, Dolenz met future wife Samantha Juste, a co-presenter on BBC TV's pop music show Top of the Pops. They married in 1968, and their daughter Ami Bluebell Dolenz was born on January 8, 1969. She became an actress who was particularly active in the 1980s and 1990s.

Education [4] His grandfather, aunts, and uncles were also teachers He was raised in Ballintemple, Cork, alongside his younger brother Páidi and younger sisters Sile and Orla [5] [6] He started writing and performing songs at the age of 10 [7]\n\n\nCareer\nMurphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs [8] Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: \"There was something about him – he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, \"My God\" It had nothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time.\" [12] Murphy observed, \"I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose\" [13] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, [8] Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university [4] and his band [9] Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off [14]\n\n\n1996–2002: Theatre work and early roles\nMurphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca

music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off [14]\n\n\n2002–2004: 28 Days Later and breakthrough\nMurphy was cast in the lead role in Danny Boyle's horror film 28 Days Later (2002) He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is \"perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world\" after waking from a coma in a London hospital [21] Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film [22] [23] She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a \"dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film\" Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July, 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in North America, and success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time [24] [25] His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards, and Breakthrough Male Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards [26] [27] Murphy professed that he considered the film to be much deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film's success, and that American audiences responded well to its content and violence [28] Murphy said, \"The film did so well And you watch zombie stuff  [now], we were the first people to make zombies run, and  [that] changed everything It has a very special place in my heart, that movie.\" [29]\n\n\n2005–2006: Villainous roles and critical success\nMurphy appeared as Dr Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan [19] Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow [14] Nolan told Spin magazine, \"He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups\" [36] He starred as Jackson Rippner, who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye (2005) The New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made \"a picture-perfect villain\" and that his \"baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors\" [37] The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide [38] [39]\n\n\n2006–2010: Further theatre and film roles\nMurphy returned to the stage starring opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play Love Song Theatre Record described his character of Beane as a \"winsomely cranky\" mentally unstable \"sentimentalised lonely hero\", noting how he magnetically, with \"all blue eyes and twitching hands\", moves \"comically from painfully shy \"wallpaper\" to garrulous, amorous male [55] Variety magazine considered his performance to be \"as magnetic onstage as onscreen\", remarking that his \"unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink\" [56]\n\n\n2011–present: Peaky Blinders and Oppenheimer\nIn 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama Misterman, written and directed by Enda Walsh, with whom he had previously worked on Disco Pigs The production was initially staged in Galway and was taken to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York Murphy said of the role, \"The live nature of it makes it so dangerous You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show.\" [12] His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award [70] [71] Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a \"complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code\", praising his ability to mimic wickedly Lyall noted Murphy's \"unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show Misterman\", and documented that on one evening the \"theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence\", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance [12] He played the lead in the British horror film Retreat (2011), which had a limited release He also appeared in the science fiction film In Time (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed [72]\n\n\nPublic image\nReserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience \"a challenge\" that he does not \"want to overcome\" [114] He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids, stating, \"I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk\" [5] He prefers not to speak about his life outside of acting and did not appear on any television talk shows until 2010, when he was a guest on Ireland's Late Late Show to promote Perrier's Bounty, though he still remained reserved [115] [116] Murphy's introverted nature and lack of interest in social media has prompted several fans to create memes on his detached demeanour in press interviews and junkets [117] [118] In 2017, upon being asked his opinion on the \"Disappointed Cillian Murphy\" meme, he answered, \"What's a meme?\" [119] [120]\n\n\nActivism\nMurphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the general election, [123] and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organisation Focus Ireland [124] In 2011, he became a patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chair in Children, Youth and Civic Engagement In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former Vita Cortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for \"highlighting  [what] is hugely important to us all as a nation\" [125] [126] Murphy was a supporter of the 2018 Irish referendum to repeal the eighth amendment of the constitution that restricted access to abortions, appearing on The Blindboy Podcast to urge men to support women and vote in favour of the referendum [127] [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend Yvonne McGuinness, whom he met at one of his rock band's shows in 1996 [131] They lived in Dublin until 2001, when they moved to London so his wife could attend the Royal College of Art After 14 years, they moved back to Dublin in 2015 They have two sons, born in 2005 and 2007 [132] [133]\n\n\nActing credits and awards\nMurphy's most commercially successful films have been his many collaborations with Nolan, including Oppenheimer, Inception, Batman Begins, and Dunkirk [141] Following the success of Oppenheimer and the Barbenheimer

film 28 Days Later (2002) He portrayed pandemic survivor Jim, who is \"perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world\" after waking from a coma in a London hospital [21] Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy for the role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs Stevens stated that it was only after seeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of the film [22] [23] She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera, but enthused that he had a \"dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film\" Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July, 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in North America, and success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time [24] [25] His performance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire

zombies run, and  [that] changed everything It has a very special place in my heart, that movie.\" [29]\n\n\n2005–2006: Villainous roles and critical success\nMurphy appeared as Dr Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) Originally asked to audition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan [19] Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow [14] Nolan told Spin magazine, \"He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept trying to invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups\" [36] He starred as Jackson Rippner, who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye (2005) The New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made \"a picture-perfect villain\" and that his \"baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors\" [37] The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide [38] [39]\n\n\n2006–2010: Further theatre and film roles\nMurphy returned to the stage starring opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play Love Song Theatre Record described his character of Beane as a \"winsomely cranky\" mentally unstable \"sentimentalised lonely hero\", noting how he magnetically, with \"all blue eyes and twitching hands\", moves \"comically from painfully shy \"wallpaper\" to garrulous, amorous male [55] Variety magazine considered his performance to be \"as magnetic onstage as onscreen\", remarking that his \"unhurried puzzlement pulls the slight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink\" [56]\n\n\n2011–present: Peaky Blinders and Oppenheimer\nIn 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama Misterman, written and directed by Enda Walsh, with whom he had previously worked on Disco Pigs The production was initially staged in Galway and was taken to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York Murphy said of the role, \"The live nature of it makes it so dangerous You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's compounded by its being a one-man show.\" [12] His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award [70] [71] Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a \"complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code\", praising his ability to mimic wickedly Lyall noted Murphy's \"unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show Misterman\", and documented that on one evening the \"theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence\", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance [12] He played

overcome\" [114] He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids, stating, \"I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk\" [5] He prefers not to speak about his life outside of acting and did not appear on any television talk shows until 2010, when he was a guest on Ireland's Late Late Show to promote Perrier's Bounty, though he still remained reserved [115] [116] Murphy's introverted nature and lack of interest in social media has prompted several fans to create memes on his detached demeanour in press interviews and junkets [117] [118] In 2017, upon being asked his opinion on the \"Disappointed Cillian Murphy\" meme, he answered, \"What's a meme?\" [119] [120]\n\n\nActivism\nMurphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote

{"title": "Tokyo", "content": "\nEtymology\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (e, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (to, \"entrance, gate, door\") [25] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 tō \"east\", and 京 kyō \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital, [26] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)) [25] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\"; [27] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete [28]\n\n\nHistory\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kantō region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and moved there from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province He greatly expanded the castle, which was said to have been abandoned and in tatters when he moved there, and ruled the region from there When he became shōgun, the de facto ruler of the country, in 1603, the whole country came to be ruled from Edo While the Tokugawa shogunate ruled the country in practice, the Imperial House of Japan was still the de jure ruler, and the title of shōgun was granted by the Emperor as a formality The Imperial House was based in Kyoto from 794 to 1868, so Edo was still not the capital of Japan [29]\nDuring the Edo period, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city [30] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century [31]\n\n\nPre-1869 (Edo period)\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the

largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century [31]\n\n\n1869–1941\nAfter the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate, for the first time in a few centuries, the Emperor ceased to be a mere figurehead and became both the de facto and de jure ruler of the country Hisoka Maejima advocated for the relocation of the capital functions to Tokyo, recognizing the advantages of the existing infrastructure and the vastness of the Kanto Plain compared to the relatively small Kyoto basin [36] After being handed over to the Meiji government, Edo was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital) on 3 September 1868 Emperor Meiji visited the city once at the end of that year and eventually moved there in 1869 Tokyo had already been the nation's political center for nearly three centuries, [37] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace.\nGovernment ministries such as the Ministry of Finance were also relocated to Tokyo by 1871, [38] and the first railway line in the country was opened on 14 October 1872, connecting Shimbashi (Shiodome) and Yokohama (Sakuragicho), which is now part of the Tokaido line [39] The 1870s saw the establishment of other institutions and facilities that now symbolize Tokyo, such as Ueno Park (1873), the University of Tokyo (1877) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (1878) The rapid modernization of the country was driven from Tokyo, with its business districts such as Marunouchi filled with modern brick buildings and the railway network serving as a means to help the large influx of labour force needed to keep the development of the economy [40] The City of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889 The Imperial Diet, the national legislature of the country, was established in Tokyo in 1889, and it has ever since been operating in the city.\n\n\n1942–1945\nIn 1943, Tokyo City merged with Tokyo Prefecture to form the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to) This reorganization aimed to create a more centralized and efficient administrative structure to better manage resources, urban planning, and civil defence during wartime [46] The Tokyo Metropolitan Government thus became responsible for both prefectural and city functions while administering cities, towns, and villages in the suburban and rural areas.\nAlthough Japan enjoyed significant success in the initial stages of the war and rapidly expanded its sphere of influence, the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, marked the first direct foreign attack on Tokyo Although the physical damage was minimal, the raid demonstrated the vulnerability of the Japanese mainland to air attacks and boosted American morale [47] Large-scale Allied air bombing of cities in the Japanese home islands, including Tokyo, began in late 1944 when the US seized control of the Mariana Islands From these islands, newly developed long-range B-29 bombers could conduct return journeys The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed [48]\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9–10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid [49] Nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the east end of the city (shitamachi, 下町), an area with a high concentration of factories and working-class houses Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were destroyed, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured [50] [51] Numerous Edo and Meiji-era buildings of historical significance were destroyed, including the main building of the Imperial Palace, Sensō-ji, Zōjō-ji, Sengaku-ji and Kabuki-za Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Tokyo dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, as soldiers were sent to the front and children were evacuated [52]\n\n\n1945–1972\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the Allied Occupation Forces, under Douglas MacArthur, an American general, administered Japan for six years The original rebuilding plan of Tokyo was based on a plan modelled after the Metropolitan Green Belt of London, devised in the 1930s but canceled due to the war [53] However, due to the monetary contraction policy known as the Dodge Line, named after Joseph Dodge, the neoliberal economic advisor to MacArthur, the plan had to be reduced to a minimal one focusing on transport and other infrastructure In 1947, the 35 pre-war special wards were reorganized into the current 23 wards Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until around 1950, when heavy industry output returned to pre-war levels [54] [53]\nSince around the time the Allied occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo's focus shifted from rebuilding to developing beyond its pre-war stature From the 1950s onwards, Tokyo's Metro and railway network saw significant expansion, culminating in the launch of the world's first dedicated high-speed railway line, the Shinkansen, between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964 The same year saw the development of other transport infrastructure such as the Shuto Expressway to meet the increased demand brought about by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the first Olympic Games held in Asia Around this time, the 31-metre height restriction, imposed on all buildings since 1920, was relaxed due to the increased demand for office buildings and advancements in earthquake-proof construction [55] Starting with the Kasumigaseki Building (147 metres) in 1968, skyscrapers began to dominate Tokyo's skyline During this period of rapid rebuilding, Tokyo celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1956 [56] and the Ogasawara Islands, which had been under control of the US since the war ended, were returned in 1968 [57] Ryokichi Minobe, a Marxian economist who served as the governor for 12 years starting in 1967, is remembered for his welfare state policy, including free healthcare for the elderly and financial support for households with children, and his ‘war against pollution’ policy, as well as the large government deficit they caused [58]\n\n\n1973–present\nAlthough the 1973 oil crisis put an end to the rapid post-war recovery and development of Japan's economy, its position as the world's second-largest economy at the time had seemed secure by that point, remaining so until 2010 when it was surpassed by China [59] Tokyo's development was sustained by its status as the economic, political, and cultural hub of such a country In 1978, after years of the intense Sanrizuka Struggle, Narita International Airport opened as the new gateway to the city, while the relatively small Haneda Airport switched to primarily domestic flights [60] West Shinjuku, which had been occupied by the vast Yodobashi Water Purification Centre until 1965, became the site of an entirely new business district characterized by skyscrapers surpassing 200 metres during this period [61]\n\n\nAdministration\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis [70] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures The 23 special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nLocal government\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis [70] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous

the status of a city.\n\n\nMunicipalities\nSince the completion of the Great Mergers of Heisei in 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages All municipalities in Japan have a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles The 23 Special Wards cover the area that had been Tokyo City until 1943, 30 other municipalities are located in the Tama area, and the remaining 9 are on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level [80] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards [81] [82] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, [83] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\" [81]\n\n\nNational government\nTokyo is the seat of all three branches of government: the legislature (National Diet), the executive (Cabinet led by the Prime Minister), and the judiciary (Supreme Court of Japan), as well as the Emperor of Japan, the head of state Most government ministries are concentrated in the Kasumigaseki district in Chiyoda, and the name Kasumigaseki is often used as a metonym for the Japanese national civil service [86] Tokyo has 25 constituencies for the House of Representatives, 18 of which were won by the ruling Liberal Democrats and 7 by the main opposition Constitutional Democrats in the 2021 general election [87] Apart from these seats, through the Tokyo proportional representation block, Tokyo sends 17 more politicians to the House of Representatives, 6 of whom were members of the ruling LDP in the 2021 election The Tokyo at-large district, which covers the entire metropolis, sends 12 members to the House of Councillors.\n\n\nGeography\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft) [88] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91) [89]\n\n\nClimate\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), [91] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F) The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F) The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876 The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004.\nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F) [92]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki [109]\n\n\nEarthquakes\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local

either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki [109]\n\n\nVolcanic eruptions\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo There is a low risk of eruption The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days) [115] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo [116] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm [116] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis [117] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area [117] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages [117] The affected areas would need to be evacuated [117]\n\n\nFloods\n\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season [118] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa [119] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people [118] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood [118] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction [118] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed [118] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods [118]\n\nArchitecture\nTokyo's buildings are too diverse to be characterized by any specific archtectural style, but it can be generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past a hundred years; [121] twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II [121]\n\n\nEarly modern (1407–1868)\nThe oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi-Murayama The current building was constructed in 1407, during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) [122] Although greatly reduced in number by later fires, earthquakes, and air raids, a considerable number of Edo-era buildings survive to this day The Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period (1603–1868), has many gates and towers dating from that era, although the main palace buildings and the tenshu tower have been lost [123]\n\n\nModern (1869–1945)\nThe Meiji era saw a rapid modernization in architectural styles as well; until the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 exposed their weakness to seimic shocks, grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city Tokyo Station (1914), the Ministry of Justice building (1895), the International Library of Children's Literature (1906) and Mistubishi building one (1894, rebuilt in 2010) are some of the few brick survivors from this period It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the Japanese aristocracy to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles, and some of these buildings still exist, although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions Aristocratic residences today open to the public include the Marquess Maeda residence in Komaba, the Baron Iwasaki residence in Ikenohata and the Baron Furukawa residence in Nishigahara.\n\n\nContemporary (1946–)\nSince the 30-metre height restriction was lifted in the 1960s, Tokyo's most dense areas have been dominated by skyscrapers As of May 2024, there are at least 184 buildings exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in Tokyo Apart from these, Tokyo Tower (333m) and Tokyo Sky Tree (634m) feature high-elevation observation decks; the latter is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai [13] With a scheduled completion date in 2027, Torch Tower (385m) will overtake Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower (325.2m) as the tallest building in Tokyo.\n\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards [131] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day [132]\n\nAge structure and average age\nIn 2021, Tokyo's average and median ages were both 45.5 years old This is below the national median age of 49.0, placing Tokyo among the youngest regions in Japan 16.8% of the population was below 15, while 34.6% was above 65 [134] In the same year, the youngest municipalities in Tokyo were Mikura-jima (average age 40.72), Chuo (41.92), and Chiyoda (42.07), while the oldest included Okutama (59.11) and Miyake (53.82) [135]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu [136] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137) [137]\n\n\nDialects\nJapanese is the primary language spoken throughout the metropolis, though regional and socio-economic differences can be heard Traditionally, dialects in Tokyo are classified into two groups: the Yamanote dialect and the Shitamachi dialect The former has traditionally been spoken in the upper- and upper-middle-class residential area of Yamanote, which includes Bancho, Kojimachi, Koishikawa, Kudan, Yotsuya, Azabu, and Akasaka During the Edo period, these neighborhoods were occupied by Daimyo and other powerful samurai families, and the dialect evolved largely based on their way of speech Standard Japanese pronunciation is largely based on this accent and spread across the country with the introduction of radio The Shitamachi dialect, in contrast, has been associated with the Chōnin district of Shitamachi and retains many characteristics of the accents spoken there in the Edo era [140] However, socio-economic changes in the post-war period and the large influx of people moving from other areas have largely blurred these distinctions in recent years It has been reported that young generations are not as aware of the differences in dialects as their parents' and grandparents' generations were [141]\n\n\nEconomy\nTokyo's gross regional product was 113.7 trillion yen or US$1.04 trillion in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of the country's total economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita [15] By sector, Wholesale and Retail was the largest contributor, accounting for 21.5% of the total output This was followed by Real Estate (13.5%), Professional, Scientific and Technical (12.2%), Information and Communications (11.7%), Finance and Insurance (7.6%), Manufacturing (7.0%), and Healthcare (6.7%) Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery, and Mining combined accounted for less than 0.1% of the economic output [146] As these numbers suggest, Tokyo's economy is heavily dependent on the tertiary sector As the Greater Tokyo Area, it has the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world, after Greater New York, with a gross metropolitan product estimated at US$2 trillion The area's economy is slightly smaller than Canada's economy while being slightly larger than Mexico's, according to IMF estimates from the same year [147]\n\n\nFinance\nTokyo is a major international finance center; [155] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government \n\n\nMedia and communications\nTokyo's position as the country's cultural, political and economic hub has made its media industry the largest in Japan A majority of national media companies are headquartered in Tokyo, as well as the Asian or Japanese branches of international media companies The NHK, the oldest and only nation-wide public broadcaster in the country, is headquartered in Shibuya Other national broadcasters, [160] such as TBS, Nippon Television, Fuji Television, and TV Asahi, are also based in Tokyo Of the five major national newspapers, [160] The Nikkei, The Mainichi, and The Yomiuri are headquartered in Tokyo, while the other two, The Asahi and The Sankei, maintain head offices both in Tokyo and Osaka Major publishers based in Tokyo include Shueisha, Kodansha, Kadokawa, Shogakukan, Bungeishunju, Shinchosha, and Iwanami Shoten, with a high concentration in Chiyoda and Shinjuku.\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2019, tourism accounted for slightly more than one percent of Tokyo's total economic output, with 15.18 million foreign visitors spending 1.26 trillion yen, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government [161]\n\n\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018 [164] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries [165]\nTokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003, [166] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture.\n\n\nTransportation\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\" [168] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo [169] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time [170] [171] [172]\n\n\nRail\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, [173] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles central Tokyo It operates rail lines throughout the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and the rest of northeastern Honshu JR East is also responsible for the Shinkansen high-speed rail lines that link Tokyo and Northeastern cities of Japan (Joetsu Shinkansen, Tohoku/Hokkaido Shinkansen, Yamagata Shinkansen, Akita Shinkansen, Hokuriku Shinkansen) [174] The Tokaido Shinkansen, which links Tokyo and Osaka via Nagoya and Kyoto, as well as western cities beyond, is operated by JR Central The Chuo Shinkansen, the first-ever long-distance high-speed floating maglev line currently under construction, will also be operated by JR Central Both JR companies were created from the privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 JR Freight does not own any part of the railway network but operates freight trains on the JR network.\nTwo different entities operate Tokyo's underground railway network: the privatized Tokyo Metro, which operates Tokyo Metro lines, and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, which operates Toei lines Tokyo Metro is entirely owned by the Japanese Government and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government since it was privatized in 2004 (it was previously a public entity called the Imperial Capital Rapid Transit Authority from 1941 to 2004), but it is scheduled to go public in 2024 [175] Other major railway operators in Tokyo include Odakyu, Tokyu, Keio, Seibu, Tobu, and Keisei Although each operator directly owns its railway lines, through services that travel across different lines owned by different operators are common.\n\n\nRoads\nTokyo has the lowest car ownership rate among all prefectures in Japan, with 0.416 cars per household compared to the national average of 1.025 per household This is despite Tokyo being one of the most affluent areas in the country, with a nominal GDP per capita of around US$75,000 [177] A 2021 survey found that 81% of respondents without a car were satisfied with public transport and saw no need to own one [178]\n\n\nAviation\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo is served by two international airports: Haneda Airport in Ōta and Narita International Airport in neighboring Chiba Prefecture Haneda has served as the primary airport for Tokyo since 1931 However, the Jet Age saw an exponential increase in flights, prompting the government to build a second airport Narita was chosen as the site for this second airport in 1966, but local farmers and left-wing activists who sympathized with them protested vehemently for more than a decade (the Sanrizuka Struggle), delaying the new airport's opening until 1978 Almost all international flights were transferred to Narita Airport upon its completion, and Haneda became primarily a domestic airport [181]\n\n\nWater transport\nWater transport is the primary means of importing and exporting goods as well as connecting the Tokyo Islands to the mainland According to Lloyd's List, the Port of Tokyo handled 4,430,000 TEU of containers in 2022, making it the 46th largest port in the world [185] The Greater Tokyo Area is served by other major ports such as the Port of Yokohama and the Port of Chiba as well \nTakeshiba Pier (竹芝埠頭) in Minato is used by Tōkai Kisen, which serves islands such as Izu Ōshima, Miyakejima, Hachijojima, Kozushima, [186] and Ogasawara Kaiun, which serves the Ogasawara Islands [187] Many of these islands are accessible only by ocean routes and helicopters, as they are too small or undulating for a landing ground, making these ships the primary means of inter-island transport There are ferry routes that connect landmarks within the mainland portion of Tokyo as well; the Tokyo Cruise Ship and the Tokyo Mizube Line operate several routes between tourist attractions such as Asakusa, Hamarikyu, Odaiba, and Shinagawa Aquarium [188] The Symphony Cruise operates two large restaurant ships that can also be hired as party venues [189]\n\n\nEducation\nTokyo is the educational, academic, and cultural hub of Japan From primary to tertiary levels, numerous educational institutions operate in the city to cater to a diverse range of pupils and students.\n\n\nTertiary education\nTokyo is the heartland of tertiary education in the country, home to 143 authorized universities in 2020 [190] This number includes the nation's most prestigious and selective universities, such as, the University of Tokyo (QS National:1st), Tokyo Institute of Technology (4th), Hitotsubashi University (15th), Waseda University (9th), and Keio University (10th) [191] Additionally, Tokyo University of the Arts is widely regarded as the most prestigious painting, sculpture, crafts, and music school in the country [192] The United Nations University, which is the academic arm of the United Nations, is headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo  In 2024, QS Best Student Cities ranked Tokyo as the second-best city for university students, after London [193] The ranking noted that Tokyo is ideal for 'those who favour total immersion in local culture rather than living in a “student bubble”', stating that despite having high-ranking universities and large global companies offering internships as well as rich culture, Tokyo still has a very low international student population ratio [194]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nAt the secondary level, 429 senior high schools are located in Tokyo, six of which are national, 186 are public, and 237 are private [195] Some senior high schools, often prestigious national or private ones, run jointly with their affiliated junior high schools, providing six-year educational programs (Chūkō Ikkan Kyōiku) The Kaisei Academy, [196] Komaba Junior & Senior High School, University of Tsukuba, [197] Azabu High School, and Oin Junior and Senior High School, [198] the largest sources of successful applicants to the nation's top university, the University of Tokyo, [199] are some examples of such At the primary level, there are 1332 elementary schools in Tokyo Six of them are national, 1261 are public, and 53 are private [195]\n\n\nLearned societies\nAlmost all major Japanese learned societies are based in Tokyo The Japan Academy, the country's academy of sciences, was established in 1879 to bring together leading scholars in various disciplines [201] The Japan Art Academy was established in 1919 with a similar purpose [202] These two national academies are headquartered in Ueno Park The newest national academy, the Science Council of Japan, was established in 1949 with the purpose of promoting scientific research and the application of research findings to civilian life It is located in Roppongi, Minato.\n\n\nCulture\nTokyo is home to a wide array of museums, art galleries, and libraries, catering to various interests Ueno Park has the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum

"article": "Tokyo is the capital and largest city of Japan, located on the eastern coast of Honshu, the country's largest island. It is the most populous city in Japan and the world's largest metropolitan economy. Tokyo is known for its vibrant culture, cutting-edge technology, and rich history, making it a popular destination for tourists and a hub for international business and diplomacy.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nTokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (e, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (to, \"entrance, gate, door\"). The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 tō \"east\", and 京 kyō \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital, in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city.\n\n**History**\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan. After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kantō region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and moved there from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province. He greatly expanded the castle, which was said to have been abandoned and in tatters when he moved there, and ruled the region from there.\n\n**Pre-1869 (Edo period)**\n\nThe Edo period saw a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city. The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city. Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century.\n\n**1869–1945**\n\nThe Meiji era saw a rapid modernization in architectural styles as well; until the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 exposed their weakness to seismic shocks, grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city. Tokyo Station (1914), the Ministry of Justice building (1895), the International Library of Children's Literature (1906) and Mitsubishi building one (1894, rebuilt in 2010) are some of the few brick survivors from this period. It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the Japanese aristocracy to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles, and some of these buildings still exist, although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions.\n\n**1946–present**\n\nSince the 30-metre height restriction was lifted in the 1960s, Tokyo's most dense areas have been dominated by skyscrapers. As of May 2024, there are at least 184 buildings exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in Tokyo. Apart from these, Tokyo Tower (333m) and Tokyo Sky Tree (634m) feature high-elevation observation decks; the latter is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards. During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.\n\n**Economy**\n\nTokyo's gross regional product was 113.7 trillion yen or US$1.04 trillion in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of the country's total economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita. By sector, Wholesale and Retail was the largest contributor, accounting for 21.5% of the total output. This was followed by Real Estate (13.5%), Professional, Scientific and Technical (12.2%), Information and Communications (11.7%), Finance and Insurance (7.6%), Manufacturing (7.0%), and Healthcare (6.7%). Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery, and Mining combined accounted for less than 0.1% of the economic output.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nTokyo has the lowest car ownership rate among all prefectures in Japan, with 0.416 cars per household compared to the national average of 1.025 per household. A 2021 survey found that 81% of respondents without a car were satisfied with public transport and saw no need to own one. The mainland portion of Tokyo is served by two international airports: Haneda Airport in Ōta and Narita International Airport in neighboring Chiba Prefecture. Water transport is the primary means of importing and exporting goods as well as connecting the Tokyo Islands to the mainland.\n\n**Culture**\n\nTokyo is home to a wide array of museums, art galleries, and libraries, catering to various interests. Ueno Park has the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum specializing in traditional Japanese art, the National Museum of Western Art, whose building designed by Le Corbusier is a world heritage site, and the National Museum of Nature and Science. Other notable museums include the Artizon Museum in Chūō, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, which provides insights into the history and culture of Tokyo.\n\n**Leisure and entertainment**\n\nTokyo offers a diverse array of leisure and entertainment options. The city is home to numerous theatres, including the National Noh Theatre and Kabuki-za, dedicated to traditional Japanese plays, and the New National Theatre Tokyo in Shibuya, which serves as a central venue for opera, ballet, contemporary dance, and drama. Two sports venues, the Nippon Budokan and the Tokyo Dome, are usually used to host concerts by popular pop artists.\n\n**International relations**\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. As of 2022, Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tokyo\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (e, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (to, \"entrance, gate, door\") [25] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 tō \"east\", and 京 kyō \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital, [26] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)) [25] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\"; [27] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete [28]\n\n\nHistory\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was granted the Kantō region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and moved there from his ancestral land of Mikawa Province He greatly expanded the castle, which was said to have been abandoned and in tatters when he moved there, and ruled the region from there When he became shōgun, the de facto ruler of the country, in 1603, the whole country came to be ruled from Edo While the Tokugawa shogunate ruled the country in practice, the Imperial House of Japan was still the de jure ruler, and the title of shōgun was granted by the Emperor as a formality The Imperial House was based in Kyoto from 794 to 1868, so Edo was still not the capital of Japan [29]\nDuring the Edo period, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city [30] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century [31]\n\n\nPre-1869 (Edo period)\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, part of the old Musashi Province Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle to defend the region from the Chiba clan After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu was

resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century [31]\n\n\n1869–1941\nAfter the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate, for the first time in a few centuries, the Emperor ceased to be a mere figurehead and became both the de facto and de jure ruler of the country Hisoka Maejima advocated for the relocation of the capital functions to Tokyo, recognizing the advantages of the existing infrastructure and the vastness of the Kanto Plain compared to the relatively small Kyoto basin [36] After being handed over to the Meiji government, Edo was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital) on 3 September 1868 Emperor Meiji visited the city once at the end of that year and eventually moved there in 1869 Tokyo had already been the nation's political center for nearly three centuries, [37] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace.\nGovernment ministries such as the Ministry of Finance were also relocated to Tokyo by 1871, [38] and the first railway line in the country was opened on 14 October 1872, connecting Shimbashi (Shiodome) and Yokohama (Sakuragicho), which is now part of the Tokaido line [39] The 1870s saw the establishment of other institutions and facilities that now symbolize Tokyo, such as Ueno Park (1873), the University of Tokyo (1877) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (1878) The rapid modernization of the country was driven from Tokyo, with its business districts such as Marunouchi filled with modern brick buildings and the railway network serving as a means to help the large influx of labour force needed to keep the development of the economy [40] The City of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889 The Imperial Diet, the national legislature of the country, was established in Tokyo in 1889, and it has ever since been operating in the city.\n\n\n1942–1945\nIn 1943, Tokyo City merged with Tokyo Prefecture to form the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都, Tōkyō-to) This reorganization aimed to create a more centralized and efficient administrative structure to better manage resources, urban planning, and civil defence during wartime [46] The Tokyo Metropolitan Government thus became responsible for both prefectural and city functions while administering cities, towns, and villages in the suburban and rural areas.\nAlthough Japan enjoyed significant success in the initial stages of the war and rapidly expanded its sphere of influence, the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942, marked the first direct foreign attack on Tokyo Although the physical damage was minimal, the raid demonstrated the vulnerability of the Japanese mainland to air attacks and boosted American morale [47] Large-scale Allied air bombing of cities in the Japanese home islands, including Tokyo, began in late 1944 when the US seized control of the Mariana Islands From these islands, newly developed long-range B-29 bombers could conduct return journeys The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed [48]\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9–10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid [49] Nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the east end of the city (shitamachi, 下町), an area with a high concentration of factories and working-class houses Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were destroyed, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured [50] [51] Numerous Edo and Meiji-era buildings of historical significance were destroyed, including the main building of the Imperial Palace, Sensō-ji, Zōjō-ji, Sengaku-ji and Kabuki-za Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Tokyo dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, as soldiers were sent to the front and children were evacuated [52]\n\n\n1945–1972\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the Allied Occupation Forces, under Douglas MacArthur, an American general, administered Japan for six years The original rebuilding plan of Tokyo was based on a plan modelled after the Metropolitan Green Belt of London, devised in the 1930s but canceled due to the war [53] However, due to the monetary contraction policy known as the Dodge Line, named after Joseph Dodge, the neoliberal economic advisor to MacArthur, the plan had to be reduced to a minimal one focusing on transport and other infrastructure In 1947, the 35 pre-war special wards were reorganized into the current 23 wards Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until around 1950, when heavy industry output returned to pre-war levels [54] [53]\nSince around the time the Allied occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo's focus shifted from rebuilding to developing beyond its pre-war stature From the 1950s onwards, Tokyo's Metro and railway network saw significant expansion, culminating in the launch of the world's first dedicated high-speed railway line, the Shinkansen, between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964 The same year saw the development of other transport infrastructure such as the Shuto Expressway to meet the increased demand brought about by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the first Olympic Games held in Asia Around this time, the 31-metre height restriction, imposed on all buildings since 1920, was relaxed due to the increased demand for office buildings and advancements in earthquake-proof construction [55] Starting with the Kasumigaseki Building (147 metres) in 1968, skyscrapers began to dominate Tokyo's skyline During this period of rapid rebuilding, Tokyo celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1956 [56] and the Ogasawara Islands, which had been under control of the US since the war ended, were returned in 1968 [57] Ryokichi Minobe, a Marxian economist who served as the governor for 12 years starting in 1967, is remembered for his welfare state policy, including free healthcare for the elderly and financial support for households with children, and his ‘war against pollution’ policy, as well as the large government deficit they caused [58]\n\n\n1973–present\nAlthough the 1973 oil crisis put an end to the rapid post-war recovery and development of Japan's economy, its position as the world's second-largest economy at the time had seemed secure by that point, remaining so until 2010 when it was surpassed by China [59] Tokyo's development was sustained by its status as the economic, political, and cultural hub of such a country In 1978, after years of the intense Sanrizuka Struggle, Narita International Airport opened as the new gateway to the city, while the relatively small Haneda Airport switched to primarily domestic flights [60] West Shinjuku, which had been occupied by the vast Yodobashi Water Purification Centre until 1965, became the site of an entirely new business district characterized by skyscrapers surpassing 200 metres during this period [61]\n\n\nAdministration\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis [70] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures The 23 special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nLocal government\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis [70] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures The 23 special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nMunicipalities\nSince the completion of the Great Mergers of Heisei in 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages All municipalities in Japan have a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles The 23 Special Wards cover the area that had been Tokyo City until 1943, 30 other municipalities are located in the Tama area, and the remaining 9 are on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\nEnvironmental policies\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level [80] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards [81] [82] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, [83] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\" [81]\n\n\nNational government\nTokyo is the seat of all three branches of government: the legislature (National Diet), the executive (Cabinet led by the Prime Minister), and the judiciary (Supreme Court of Japan), as well as the Emperor of Japan, the head of state Most government ministries are concentrated in the Kasumigaseki district in Chiyoda, and the name Kasumigaseki is often used as a metonym for the Japanese national civil service [86] Tokyo has 25 constituencies for the House of Representatives, 18 of which were won by the ruling Liberal Democrats and 7 by the main opposition Constitutional Democrats in the 2021 general election [87] Apart from these seats, through the Tokyo proportional representation block, Tokyo sends 17 more politicians to the House of Representatives, 6 of whom were members of the ruling LDP in the 2021 election The Tokyo at-large district, which covers the entire metropolis, sends 12 members to the House of Councillors.\n\n\nGeography\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft) [88] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91) [89]\n\n\nClimate\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), [91] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F) The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F) The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876 The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004.\nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F) [92]\n\n\nNatural disasters\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki [109]\n\n\nEarthquakes\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making

about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo There is a low risk of eruption The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days) [115] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo [116] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm [116] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis [117] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area [117] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages [117] The affected areas would need to be evacuated [117]\n\n\nFloods\n\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season [118] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa [119] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people [118] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood [118] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction [118] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed [118] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods [118]\n\nArchitecture\nTokyo's buildings are too diverse to be characterized by any specific archtectural style, but it can be generally said that a majority of extant structures were built in the past a hundred years; [121] twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II [121]\n\n\nEarly modern (1407–1868)\nThe oldest known extant building in Tokyo is Shofukuji in Higashi-Murayama The current building was constructed in 1407, during the Muromachi period (1336–1573) [122] Although greatly reduced in number by later fires, earthquakes, and air raids, a considerable number of Edo-era buildings survive to this day The Tokyo Imperial Palace, which was occupied by the Tokugawa Shogunate as Edo Castle during the Edo Period (1603–1868), has many gates and towers dating from that era, although the main palace buildings and the tenshu tower have been lost [123]\n\n\nModern (1869–1945)\nThe Meiji era saw a rapid modernization in architectural styles as well; until the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 exposed their weakness to seimic shocks, grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city Tokyo Station (1914), the Ministry of Justice building (1895), the International Library of Children's Literature (1906) and Mistubishi building one (1894, rebuilt in 2010) are some of the few brick survivors from this period It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the Japanese aristocracy to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles, and some of these buildings still exist, although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions Aristocratic residences today open to the public include the Marquess Maeda residence in Komaba, the Baron Iwasaki residence in Ikenohata and the Baron Furukawa residence in Nishigahara.\n\n\nContemporary (1946–)\nSince the 30-metre height restriction was lifted in the 1960s, Tokyo's most dense areas have been dominated by skyscrapers As of May 2024, there are at least 184 buildings exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in Tokyo Apart from these, Tokyo Tower (333m) and Tokyo Sky Tree (634m) feature high-elevation observation decks; the latter is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai [13] With a scheduled completion date in 2027, Torch Tower (385m) will overtake Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower (325.2m) as the tallest building in Tokyo.\n\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo's 23 wards [131] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day [132]\n\nAge structure and average age\nIn 2021, Tokyo's average and median ages were both 45.5 years old This is below the national median age of 49.0, placing Tokyo among the youngest regions in Japan 16.8% of the population was below 15, while 34.6% was above 65 [134] In the same year, the youngest municipalities in Tokyo were Mikura-jima (average age 40.72), Chuo (41.92), and Chiyoda (42.07), while the oldest included Okutama (59.11) and Miyake (53.82) [135]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu [136] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137) [137]\n\n\nDialects\nJapanese is the primary language spoken throughout the metropolis, though regional and socio-economic differences can be heard Traditionally, dialects in Tokyo are classified into two groups: the Yamanote dialect and the Shitamachi dialect The former has traditionally been spoken in the upper- and upper-middle-class residential area of Yamanote, which includes Bancho, Kojimachi, Koishikawa, Kudan, Yotsuya, Azabu, and Akasaka During the Edo period, these neighborhoods were occupied by Daimyo and other powerful samurai families, and the dialect evolved largely based on their way of speech Standard Japanese pronunciation is largely based on this accent and spread across the country with the introduction of radio The Shitamachi dialect, in contrast, has been associated with the Chōnin district of Shitamachi and retains many characteristics of the accents spoken there in the Edo era [140] However, socio-economic changes in the post-war period and the large influx of people moving from other areas have largely blurred these distinctions in recent years It has been reported that young generations are not as aware of the differences in dialects as their parents' and grandparents' generations were [141]\n\n\nEconomy\nTokyo's gross regional product was 113.7 trillion yen or US$1.04 trillion in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of the country's total economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita [15] By sector, Wholesale and Retail was the largest contributor, accounting for 21.5% of the total output This was followed by Real Estate (13.5%), Professional, Scientific and Technical (12.2%), Information and Communications (11.7%), Finance and Insurance (7.6%), Manufacturing (7.0%), and Healthcare (6.7%) Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery, and Mining combined accounted for less than 0.1% of the economic output [146] As these numbers suggest, Tokyo's economy is heavily dependent on the tertiary sector As the Greater Tokyo Area, it has the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world, after Greater New York, with a gross metropolitan product estimated at US$2 trillion The area's economy is slightly smaller than Canada's economy while being slightly larger than Mexico's, according to IMF estimates from the same year [147]\n\n\nFinance\nTokyo is a major international finance center; [155] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government \n\n\nMedia and communications\nTokyo's position as the country's cultural, political and economic hub has made its media industry the largest in Japan A majority of national media companies are headquartered in Tokyo, as well as the Asian or Japanese branches of international media companies The NHK, the oldest and only nation-wide public broadcaster in the country, is headquartered in Shibuya Other national broadcasters, [160] such as TBS, Nippon Television, Fuji Television, and TV Asahi, are also based in Tokyo Of the five major national newspapers, [160] The Nikkei, The Mainichi, and The Yomiuri are headquartered in Tokyo, while the other two, The Asahi and The Sankei, maintain head offices both in Tokyo and Osaka Major publishers based in Tokyo include Shueisha, Kodansha, Kadokawa, Shogakukan, Bungeishunju, Shinchosha, and Iwanami Shoten, with a high concentration in Chiyoda and Shinjuku.\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2019, tourism accounted for slightly more than one percent of Tokyo's total economic output, with 15.18 million foreign visitors spending 1.26 trillion yen, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government [161]\n\n\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018 [164] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries [165]\nTokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003, [166] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture.\n\n\nTransportation\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\" [168] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo [169] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time [170] [171] [172]\n\n\nRail\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, [173] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles central Tokyo It operates rail lines throughout the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and the rest of northeastern Honshu JR East is also responsible for the Shinkansen high-speed rail lines that link Tokyo and Northeastern cities of Japan (Joetsu Shinkansen, Tohoku/Hokkaido Shinkansen, Yamagata Shinkansen, Akita Shinkansen, Hokuriku Shinkansen) [174] The Tokaido Shinkansen, which links Tokyo and Osaka via Nagoya and Kyoto, as well as western cities beyond, is operated by JR Central The Chuo Shinkansen, the first-ever long-distance high-speed floating maglev line currently under construction, will also be operated by JR Central Both JR companies were created from the privatization of Japan National Railways in 1987 JR Freight does not own any part of the railway network but operates freight trains on the JR network.\nTwo different entities operate Tokyo's underground railway network: the privatized Tokyo Metro, which operates Tokyo Metro lines, and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, which operates Toei lines Tokyo Metro is entirely owned by the Japanese Government and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government since it was privatized in 2004 (it was previously a public entity called the Imperial Capital Rapid Transit Authority from 1941 to 2004), but it is scheduled to go public in 2024 [175] Other major railway operators in Tokyo include Odakyu, Tokyu, Keio, Seibu, Tobu, and Keisei Although each operator directly owns its railway lines, through services that travel across different lines owned by different operators are common.\n\n\nRoads\nTokyo has the lowest car ownership rate among all prefectures in Japan, with 0.416 cars per household compared to the national average of 1.025 per household This is despite Tokyo being one of the most affluent areas in the country, with a nominal GDP per capita of around US$75,000 [177] A 2021 survey found that 81% of respondents without a car were satisfied with public transport and saw no need to own one [178]\n\n\nAviation\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo is served by two international airports: Haneda Airport in Ōta and Narita International Airport in neighboring Chiba Prefecture Haneda has served as the primary airport for Tokyo since 1931 However, the Jet Age saw an exponential increase in flights, prompting the government to build a second airport Narita was chosen as the site for this second airport in 1966, but local farmers and left-wing activists who sympathized with them protested vehemently for more than a decade (the Sanrizuka Struggle), delaying the new airport's opening until 1978 Almost all international flights were transferred to Narita Airport upon its completion, and Haneda became primarily a domestic airport [181]\n\n\nWater transport\nWater transport is the primary means of importing and exporting goods as well as connecting the Tokyo Islands to the mainland According to Lloyd's List, the Port of Tokyo handled 4,430,000 TEU of containers in 2022, making it the 46th largest port in the world [185] The Greater Tokyo Area is served by other major ports such as the Port of Yokohama and the Port of Chiba as well \nTakeshiba Pier (竹芝埠頭) in Minato is used by Tōkai Kisen, which serves islands such as Izu Ōshima, Miyakejima, Hachijojima, Kozushima, [186] and Ogasawara Kaiun, which serves the Ogasawara Islands [187] Many of these islands are accessible only by ocean routes and helicopters, as they are too small or undulating for a landing ground, making these ships the primary means of inter-island transport There are ferry routes that connect landmarks within the mainland portion of Tokyo as well; the Tokyo Cruise Ship and the Tokyo Mizube Line operate several routes between tourist attractions such as Asakusa, Hamarikyu, Odaiba, and Shinagawa Aquarium [188] The Symphony Cruise operates two large restaurant ships that can also be hired as party venues [189]\n\n\nEducation\nTokyo is the educational, academic, and cultural hub of Japan From primary to tertiary levels, numerous educational

crafts, and music school in the country [192] The United Nations University, which is the academic arm of the United Nations, is headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo  In 2024, QS Best Student Cities ranked Tokyo as the second-best city for university students, after London [193] The ranking noted that Tokyo is ideal for 'those who favour total immersion in local culture rather than living in a “student bubble”', stating that despite having high-ranking universities and large global companies offering internships as well as rich culture, Tokyo still has a very low international student population ratio [194]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nAt the secondary level, 429 senior high schools are located in Tokyo, six of which are national, 186 are public, and 237 are private [195] Some senior

Clyde (1967), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dirty Harry (1971), Lethal Weapon (1987), and The Crow (1994) \"We put a pretty extensive and expansive list together, and we spent a lot of time really

was clearly not Cowboy Bebop and I realized at that point that if I wasn't involved, it would not be Cowboy Bebop I felt that maybe I should have done this Although the value of the original anime is

{"title": "UEFA_Euro_2020_final", "content": "\nBackground\nUEFA Euro 2020 was the sixteenth edition of the European Football Championship, UEFA's football competition for national teams, held between 11 June and 11 July 2021 in eleven cities, all in different countries from each other [5] [6] Qualifying rounds were held between March and November 2019, in which fifty-five teams were divided into ten groups of five or six, playing each other on a home-and-away round-robin tournament basis The top two teams in each group qualified for the finals, along with four additional teams, determined by a combination of their 2018–19 UEFA Nations League performance and a series of play-off games [7] In the finals, the 24 teams were divided into six groups of four with each team playing each other once within the group The two top teams from each group along with the four best third-placed sides advanced to a knock-out phase [6]\n\n\nVenue\nThe final was played at Wembley Stadium in London On 6 December 2012, UEFA announced that the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the UEFA European Championship, with no host teams qualifying automatically [29] [30] Wembley was chosen as the venue for the semi-finals and final by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014, having been selected by acclamation after the finals package bid of the Allianz Arena in Munich was withdrawn [31] After winning the hosting rights, London's standard package bid for group stage matches and an earlier knockout match was withdrawn [32] The UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to London, leaving Wembley with seven tournament matches [33] This was later increased to eight matches, as Dublin was removed as a host city on 23 April 2021, as the city could not ensure spectators would be able to attend due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its round of 16 fixture was reallocated to Wembley [34]\n\n\nRoute to the final\nItaly qualified for the tournament as qualifying Group J winners, having won all ten of their games, and were drawn in Group A along with Switzerland, Turkey and Wales; being one of the host nations, Italy played all three group games at home at Rome's Stadio Olimpico Italy opened the tournament with a 3–0 win over Turkey, Turkish defender Merih Demiral scoring an own goal to give the Italians the lead in the 53rd minute, before Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne scored two further goals [41] [42] Italy then beat Switzerland with another 3–0 win, Manuel Locatelli scoring twice and Immobile scoring the last goal to seal a place into the round of 16 with a game to spare, despite captain Giorgio Chiellini suffering an injury [43] [44] In their third group game, Italy beat Wales 1–0 with Matteo Pessina scoring the only goal in the first half to ensure the side finished with a perfect record in the group stage [45] [46] The result meant Italy were the first team in European Championship history to win each group stage match without conceding [47]\n\n\nItaly\nItaly qualified for the tournament as qualifying Group J winners, having won all ten of their games, and were drawn in Group A along with

seven and losing just one of their eight qualification matches They were drawn into Group D and also played their three group matches at their home stadium, Wembley They were joined in the group by co-hosts and rivals Scotland, the Czech Republic and 2018 FIFA World Cup runners-up Croatia, who had beaten England in the 2018 semi-finals England started with a 1–0 win over Croatia, Raheem Sterling being the difference with his goal in the 57th minute giving England their first three points; it was the first time that England had won the opening game of the group stage at a European Championship [56] [57] In their second match, England held Scotland to a goalless draw despite plenty of opportunities from the Scots to finish the game; even with the draw, England were still guaranteed a place in the last 16 before their final group match due to other group results [58] [59] England then confirmed top spot in the group by beating the Czech Republic 1–0, with a goal from Sterling early in the game In doing so, England became the first team in European Championship history to win their group after scoring only two goals [60] Acquiring seven points in the process, England knew they would remain at Wembley for the round of 16 but would face the runners-up from Group F [61]\n\n\nPre-match\nOn 8 July 2021, the UEFA Referees Committee announced the officiating team for the final, led by

across Europe. The final match was played at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on 11 July 2021, between Italy and England.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2020 was the sixteenth edition of the European Football Championship, UEFA's football competition for national teams. The tournament was held between 11 June and 11 July 2021, in eleven cities across Europe, including London, Glasgow, Rome, Munich, Baku, Budapest, Amsterdam, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Saint Petersburg, and Seville. The competition was originally scheduled to take place in 2020, but it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe qualifying rounds for the tournament took place between March and November 2019, with fifty-five teams divided into ten groups of five or six. The top two teams in each group qualified for the finals, along with four additional teams determined by a combination of their 2018-19 UEFA Nations League performance and a series of play-off games.\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe final was played at Wembley Stadium in London, which was chosen as the venue for the semi-finals and final by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. The stadium was selected by acclamation after the finals package bid of the Allianz Arena in Munich was withdrawn. The UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium. The four matches initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to London, leaving Wembley with seven tournament matches. This was later increased to eight matches, as Dublin was removed as a host city on 23 April 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Route to the Final**\n\nItaly qualified for the tournament as qualifying Group J winners, having won all ten of their games, and were drawn in Group A along with Switzerland, Turkey, and Wales, being one of the host nations. Italy played all three group games at home at Rome's Stadio Olimpico. They opened the tournament with a 3-0 win over Turkey, before beating Switzerland with another 3-0 win, sealing a place in the round of 16 with a game to spare. In their third group game, Italy beat Wales 1-0, ensuring a perfect record in the group stage.\n\nEngland qualified by topping qualifying Group A, winning seven and losing just one of their eight qualification matches. They were drawn into Group D and played their three group matches at their home stadium, Wembley. England started with a 1-0 win over Croatia, before holding Scotland to a goalless draw. In their final group match, England confirmed top spot in the group with a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic.\n\n**Pre-Match**\n\nThe UEFA Referees Committee announced the officiating team for the final, led by 48-year-old Dutch referee Björn Kuipers of the Royal Dutch Football Association. Kuipers was joined by three of his compatriots, Sander van Roekel and Erwin Zeinstra as assistant referees, and Pol van Boekel as one of the assistant VAR officials. Carlos del Cerro Grande of Spain was chosen as the fourth official, and his fellow countryman Juan Carlos Yuste Jiménez was the reserve assistant referee.\n\n**Team Selection**\n\nItaly had nearly all of their squad available, with the exception of defender Spinazzola, who suffered an injury in the quarter-final. Right-back Alessandro Florenzi, who had suffered a calf injury in Italy's opening match of the tournament, recovered before the final but lost his starting spot to Giovanni Di Lorenzo. For England, midfielder Phil Foden was ruled out of the game due to a foot injury sustained during training.\n\n**Crowd Disorder**\n\nThousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, prompting the police to urge anyone without tickets not to travel to the stadium. Footage from two hours before the final showed a few ticketless fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium. Large crowds also gathered in Leicester Square in Central London, throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up. As a result of the violence and disorder, 86 people were arrested by police, with 53 of them being arrested at Wembley Stadium.\n\n**Closing Ceremony and Anthems**\n\nBefore the match started, a closing ceremony was organized by UEFA, which started at 19:45 local time. An inflatable replica of the Henri Delaunay Trophy was brought onto the field as a light show and pyrotechnics got underway. Soldiers in bearskin hats played trumpets, and the Red Arrows performed a flypast above Wembley Stadium in support of the England team, before performers danced to music by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix.\n\n**Notable Spectators**\n\nThe final was attended by politicians and royalty, including President of Italy Sergio Mattarella, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Zara Tindall, Mike Tindall, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince George of Cambridge. There were also guests from the entertainment industry, such as Tom Cruise and Kate Moss, as well as former football players and managers like David Beckham, Geoff Hurst, and Fabio Capello.\n\n**Match**\n\nThe match kicked off at 20:00 local time, in cloudy and rainy conditions, in front of 67,173 spectators, with Italy playing in blue shirts, dark blue shorts, and blue socks, and England playing in white shirts, white shorts, and white socks. England's Maguire conceded a corner in the opening minute with a failed pass attempt back to goalkeeper Pickford, but Maguire himself was able to clear the danger. England then launched an attack of their own, when Kane passed the ball to Trippier, who ran down the right-hand side of the field. Trippier crossed the ball to the far side of the penalty area to Shaw, who scored his first goal for England with a low shot on the half-volley just inside the left post.\n\n**Extra Time**\n\nItaly manager Mancini made a substitution early in extra time, bringing on Andrea Belotti for Insigne, the last of Italy's three starting attackers. He then replaced Verratti with Locatelli. In the 96th minute, Sterling ran in from the left, following a pass by Henderson. What the Sky Sports live commentary team described as a \"big, big chance for England,\" Sterling tried to find Kane or Saka in the middle, but Italy's Chiellini cleared for a corner. The corner led to a chance for England through Phillips, but his low shot went wide, and Donnarumma had it covered.\n\n**Penalty Shoot-Out**\n\nA coin toss was held to determine which order the kicks would be taken in the penalty-shootout, which was won by Italy, and they chose to kick first. The shoot-out took place at the goal behind which many England fans were situated. Both sides' first penalties, from Berardi and Kane, were successful. England goalkeeper Pickford then saved from Belotti, before Maguire converted his kick to give England a 2-1 advantage. Bonucci scored to level the shoot-out at 2-2, before late substitute Rashford hit the left-hand post with England's third penalty. Bernardeschi gave Italy the lead again with a low shot down the middle, before England's other late substitute Sancho had his shot to the right saved by Donnarumma. Jorginho stepped up to take the possible match-winning penalty for Italy, looking to repeat his feat from the semi-final shoot-out victory over Spain, but had his shot to the left of the goal saved by Pickford. With the score 3-2 to Italy, Saka took England's fifth penalty, looking to equalise and send the shoot-out to sudden death, but Donnarumma dived to his left and saved it to secure Italy's second European Championship.\n\n**Post-Match**\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Čeferin was present on the pitch stage during the awards ceremony to hand out the medals and present the trophy to the Italian captain Chiellini. He was joined by UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis, Italian Football Federation president Gabriele Gravina, and the Football Association's interim chairman Peter McCormick. Eder, who scored the winning goal for Portugal in the previous final, brought the trophy onto the pitch for the ceremony. Most of the English players removed the runners-up medals from their necks immediately after receiving them. The win on penalties secured Italy's second UEFA European Championship title, 53 years after their first title in 1968, the longest duration between European Championship titles. They also became the fourth team to win multiple European Championship titles, equal with France's two titles and one short of the three each won by Spain and Germany.\n\n**Player Abuse Online**\n\nAfter the game, England players Saka, Sancho, and Rashford were subjected to racist abuse online after missing penalties in the shoot-out. The three were immediately targeted with racist language and emojis on their social media accounts. Sancho and Rashford were the last substitutions England made, brought on in the last minute to be able to take part in the penalty shoot-out.\n\n**Commemorative Street Art**\n\nOn 13 July 2021, a mural by street artist MurWalls depicting Gareth Southgate, Harry Kane, and Raheem Sterling was unveiled in Vinegar Yard, London Bridge, London. A digital mural in Manchester featuring the three players that were racially abused (Saka, Sancho, and Rashford) was also unveiled.\n\n**UEFA Investigation**\n\nFollowing the chaotic scenes, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against The Football Association for the invasion of the pitch by an England supporter, throwing of objects by supporters, booing during the Italian national anthem, and the lighting of a firework. On 3 August, UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings against The Football Association for the behaviour of fans at the final.\n\n**COVID-19 Exposure**\n\nIn mid-August, data emerged that showed 2,295 people in or around the stadium on the day of the final were likely infectious with COVID-19, with another 3,404 people in and around the ground potentially being infectious.

Cawley is a renowned Australian former professional tennis player. Born on July 31, 1951, in Griffith, New South Wales, she is a member of the Wiradjuri Aboriginal people. Goolagong's impressive tennis career spanned over a decade, during which she won seven Grand Slam singles titles, reached 18 Grand Slam singles finals, and held the number one ranking in the world. Her achievements on the tennis court have made her a legendary figure in Australian sports history.\n\nEarly Life\nGoolagong was the third of eight children born to Ken Goolagong, a sheep shearer, and Melinda, a homemaker. She grew up in the small country town of Barellan, where she began playing tennis at the age of five. Goolagong's early start in tennis was encouraged by her father, who recognized her natural talent and supported her development as a young player.\n\nPlaying Career\nGoolagong's remarkable tennis career began in the late 1960s, when she started competing in local and national tournaments. Her breakthrough came in 1971, when she won her first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon. Over the next decade, Goolagong went on to win six more Grand Slam singles titles, including three Australian Open titles and two French Open titles. She reached 18 Grand Slam singles finals, a record that stood for many years.\n\nGoolagong's impressive record on the tennis court was matched by her consistent success in doubles and mixed doubles. She won seven Grand Slam doubles titles and two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, cementing her status as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.\n\n1970s\nDuring the 1970s, Goolagong played in 17 Grand Slam singles finals, a period record for any player, man or woman. Her only four defeats prior to the finals came at the 1972 US Open in the third round; 1974 Wimbledon, where she was defeated in the quarterfinals; and at the semifinal stages of the French Open and Wimbledon in 1973. Goolagong's dominance on the tennis court during this period was unmatched, and she became a fan favorite around the world.\n\n1980s\nIn the early 1980s, Goolagong's career was marred by injuries and illness. She was forced to withdraw from several tournaments, including the 1980 US Open, due to a recurring back injury and the early stages of her second pregnancy. However, Goolagong made a triumphant return to the tennis court at Wimbledon in 1980, where she defeated four top 10 players, including Hana Mandlíková, Wendy Turnbull, Tracy Austin, and Chris Evert, to win the title.\n\nLife After Touring\nAfter retiring from professional tennis, Goolagong went on to become a successful businesswoman and entrepreneur. She has endorsed numerous products and appeared in various television and print commercials, including a KFC commercial with her husband Roger. Goolagong has also been involved in various charitable initiatives, including the Indigenous Tennis Foundation, which aims to promote tennis and other sports among Indigenous Australian youth.\n\nAwards and Recognition\nGoolagong has received numerous awards and honors for her outstanding contributions to tennis and Australian sports. She was awarded Australian of the Year in 1971 and appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1972. In 1982, she was made an Officer of the Order of Australia, and in 1988, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nPersonal Life\nGoolagong has been married twice, first to Roger Cawley, a former junior British tennis player, whom she met in 1971. The couple married in 1975 and settled in Naples, Florida. Goolagong has two children, Craig and Morgan, from her marriage to Cawley. She has also been involved in various high-profile relationships, including with her coach, Victor Edwards, who she later revealed made unwanted sexual advances to her.\n\nAutobiography\nGoolagong has written an autobiography, \"Home! The Evonne Goolagong Story,\" which was published in 1993. The book provides a candid and introspective look at her life, both on and off the tennis court.\n\nIn the Arts and Popular Culture\nGoolagong's life and career have been celebrated in various forms of art and popular culture. A play based on her life, \"Sunshine Super Girl,\" was written and directed by Andrea James and premiered in Griffith, New South Wales, in October 2020. The play explores Goolagong's experiences as a young Aboriginal woman in a predominantly white sport and her struggles to balance her personal and professional life.\n\nCareer Statistics\nGoolagong's impressive career statistics include:\n\n* 7 Grand Slam singles titles\n* 18 Grand Slam singles finals\n* 7 Grand Slam doubles titles\n* 2 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles\n* Held the number one ranking in the world\n* Won 86 singles titles\n* Reached 21 Grand Slam semifinals\n* Won 6 Grand Slam quarterfinals\n\nReferences\nSee External Links for further information.\n\nExternal Links\n* Australian Open: Evonne Goolagong Cawley\n* International Tennis Federation: Evonne Goolagong Cawley\n* Tennis Australia: Evonne Goolagong Cawley\n* Australian Sports Hall of Fame: Evonne Goolagong Cawley\n* International Tennis Hall of Fame: Evonne Goolagong Cawley", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Evonne_Goolagong_Cawley\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nEvonne is the third of eight children [3] from an Australian Aboriginal (Wiradjuri) family [4] Her father, Ken Goolagong, was a sheep shearer and her mother, Melinda, was a homemaker Evonne was born in Griffith, New South Wales, and grew up in the small country town of Barellan.\n\n\nPlaying career\nWith seven championships, Goolagong is 12th on the women's list of all-time singles Grand Slam winners, and ended her career with 86 singles titles She took singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and singles and mixed doubles titles at the French Open She never won the US Open She won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career, reaching a total of 18 Grand Slam singles finals.\n\n\nOverall record\nWith seven championships, Goolagong is 12th on the women's list of all-time singles Grand Slam winners, and ended her career with 86 singles titles She took singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and singles and mixed doubles titles at the French Open She never won the US Open She won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career, reaching a total of 18 Grand Slam singles finals.\n\n\n1970s\nDuring the 1970s, Goolagong Cawley played in 17 Grand Slam singles finals, a period record for any player, man or woman From her first Grand Slam singles final appearance in January 1971, to December 1977 when she won her last Grand Slam title of the 1970s, she played in 21 Grand Slam events Her only four defeats prior to the finals came at the 1972 US Open in the third round;

{"title": "Cnut", "content": "\nBirth and kingship\nCnut was a son of the Danish prince Sweyn Forkbeard, [1] who was the son and heir to King Harald Bluetooth and thus came from a line of Scandinavian rulers central to the unification of Denmark [14] Neither the place nor the date of his birth are known Harthacnut I was the semi-legendary founder of the Danish royal house at the beginning of the 10th century, and his son, Gorm the Old, became the first in the official line (the \"Old\" in his name indicates this) Harald Bluetooth, Gorm's son and Cnut's grandfather, was the Danish king at the time of the Christianization of Denmark; he became one of the first Scandinavian kings to accept Christianity.\n\n\nConquest of England\nAmong the allies of Denmark was Bolesław I the Brave, the duke of Poland (later crowned king) and a relative to the Danish royal house He lent some Polish troops, [29] likely to have been a pledge made to Cnut and his brother Harald when, in the winter, they \"went amongst the Wends\" to fetch their mother back to the Danish court She had been sent away by their father after the death of the Swedish king Eric the Victorious in 995, and his marriage to Sigrid the Haughty, the Swedish queen mother This wedlock formed a strong alliance between the successor to the throne of Sweden, Olof Skötkonung, and the rulers of Denmark, his in-laws [29] Swedes were certainly among the allies in the English conquest Another in-law to the Danish royal house, Eiríkr Hákonarson, was the earl of Lade and the co-ruler of Norway with his brother Sweyn Haakonsson – Norway having been under Danish sovereignty since the Battle of Svolder, in 999 Eiríkr's participation in the invasion left his son Hakon to rule Norway, with Sweyn.\n\n\nLanding in Wessex\nAccording to the Peterborough Chronicle manuscript, one of the major witnesses of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, early in September 1015 \" [Cnut] came into Sandwich, and straightway sailed around Kent to Wessex, until he came to the mouth of the Frome, and harried in Dorset and Wiltshire and Somerset\", [32] beginning a campaign of an intensity not seen since the days of Alfred the Great [28] A passage from Queen Emma's Encomium provides a picture of Cnut's fleet:\n\n\nAdvance into the North\nEarly in 1016, the Vikings crossed the Thames and harried Warwickshire, while Edmund Ironside's attempts at opposition seem to have come to nothing – the chronicler says the English army disbanded because the king and the citizenry of London were not present [28] The mid-winter assault by Cnut devastated its way northwards across eastern Mercia Another summons of the army brought the Englishmen together, and they were met this time by the king, although \"it came to nothing as so often before\", and Æthelred returned to London with fears of betrayal [28] Edmund then went north to join Uhtred the Earl of Northumbria and together they harried Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire in western Mercia, [37] possibly targeting the estates of Eadric Streona Cnut's occupation of Northumbria meant Uhtred returned home to submit himself to Cnut, [38] who seems to have sent a Northumbrian rival, Thurbrand the Hold, to massacre Uhtred and his retinue Eiríkr Hákonarson, most likely with another force of Scandinavians, came to support Cnut at this point, [39] and the veteran Norwegian jarl was put in charge of Northumbria.\n\n\nSiege of London\nCnut returned southward, and the Danish army evidently divided, some dealing with Edmund, who had broken out of London before Cnut's encirclement of the city was complete, and had gone to gather an army in Wessex, the traditional heartland of the English monarchy Part of the Danish army besieged London, constructing dikes on the northern and southern flanks and a channel dug across the banks of the Thames to the south of the city, enabling their longships to cut off communications up-river.\n\n\nLondon captured by treaty\nOn 18 October 1016, the Danes were engaged by Edmund's army as they retired towards their ships, leading to the Battle of Assandun, fought at either Ashingdon, in south-east, or Ashdon, in north-west Essex In the ensuing struggle, Eadric Streona, whose return to the English side had perhaps only been a ruse, withdrew his forces from the fray, bringing about a decisive English defeat [42] Edmund fled westwards, and Cnut pursued him into Gloucestershire, with another battle probably fought near the Forest of Dean, for Edmund had an alliance with some of the Welsh [37]\n\n\nKing of England\nCnut ruled England for nearly two decades The protection he lent against Viking raiders – many of them under his command – restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired since the resumption of Viking attacks in the 980s In turn, the English helped him to establish control over the majority of Scandinavia, too [46] Under his rule, England did not experience serious external attacks [47]\n\n\nConsolidation and Danegeld\nAs Danish King of England, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the mighty Wessex dynasty The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect Æthelred's son Eadwig Ætheling fled from England but was killed on Cnut's orders [48] Edmund Ironside's sons likewise fled abroad Æthelred's sons by Emma of Normandy went under the protection of their relatives in the Duchy of Normandy.\n\n\nAffairs to the East\nAt the Battle of Nesjar, in 1016, Olaf Haraldsson won the kingdom of Norway from the Danes It was at some time after Erik left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erik's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too.\n\n\nStatesmanship\nCnut was generally remembered as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record Accordingly, he is considered, even today, as a religious man despite the fact that he was in an arguably sinful relationship, with two wives, and the harsh treatment he dealt his fellow Christian opponents.\n\n\nKing of Denmark\nHarald II died in 1018, and Cnut went to Denmark to affirm his succession to the Danish crown, stating his intention to avert attacks against England in a letter in 1019 (see above) It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the Wends of Pomerania may have had something to do with this In this expedition, at least one of Cnut's Englishmen, Godwin, apparently won the king's trust after a night-time raid he personally led against a Wendish encampment [citation needed]\n\n\nJourney to Rome\nHis enemies in Scandinavia subdued, and apparently at his leisure, Cnut was able to accept an invitation to witness the accession in Rome of the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II He left his affairs in the north and went from Denmark to the coronation at Easter 1027, which would have been of considerable prestige for rulers of Europe in the Middle Ages On the return journey he wrote his letter of 1027, like his letter of 1019, informing his subjects in England of his intentions from abroad [62] and proclaiming himself \"king of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes\" [12]\n\n\nKing of Norway and part of Sweden\nIn his 1027 letter, Cnut refers to himself as king of \"the Norwegians, and of some of the Swedes\" – his victory over Swedes suggests Helgeå to be the river in Uppland and not the one in eastern Scania – while the king of Sweden appears to have been made a renegade [69] It has been speculated that the Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut; there were coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation [70] These coins are however usually regarded as copies of coins minted in Denmark Coins stating that the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung was King of England have also been found in Sigtuna [71] [72] Cnut also stated his intention of proceeding to Denmark to secure peace between the kingdoms of Scandinavia, which fits the account of John of Worcester that in 1027 Cnut heard some Norwegians were discontented and sent them sums of gold and silver to gain their support for his claim to the throne [12]\n\n\nInfluence in the western sea-ways\nIn 1014, while Cnut was preparing his re-invasion of England, the Battle of Clontarf pitted an array of armies laid out on the fields before the walls of Dublin Máel Mórda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and Sigtrygg Silkbeard, ruler of the Norse-Gaelic kingdom of Dublin, had sent out emissaries to all the Viking kingdoms to request assistance in their rebellion against Brian Bóruma, the High King of Ireland Sigurd the Stout, the Earl of Orkney, [77] was offered command of all the Norse forces, while the High King had sought assistance from the Albannaich, who were led by Domnall mac Eimín meic Cainnig, the Mormaer of Mar [78] The Leinster-Norse alliance was defeated, and both commanders, Sigurd and Máel Mórda, were killed Brian, his son, his grandson, and the Mormaer Domhnall were slain as well Sigtrygg's alliance was broken, although he was left alive, and the high-kingship of Ireland went back to the Uí Néill, again under Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill [79]\n\n\nRelations with the Church\nCnut's actions as a conqueror and his ruthless treatment of the overthrown dynasty had made him uneasy with the Church He was already a Christian before he was king – being named Lambert at his baptism [90] [91] – although the Christianization of Scandinavia was not at all complete His marriage to Emma of Normandy, even though he was already married to Ælfgifu of Northampton, who was kept in the south with an estate in Exeter, was another conflict with Church teaching In an effort to reconcile himself with his churchmen, Cnut repaired all the English churches and monasteries that were victims of Viking plunder and refilled their coffers He also built new churches and was an earnest patron of monastic communities His homeland of Denmark was a Christian nation on the rise, and the desire to enhance the religion was still fresh As an example, the first stone church recorded to have been built in Scandinavia was in Roskilde, c 1027, and its patron was Cnut's sister Estrid [92]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nCnut died on 12 November 1035 in Shaftesbury, Dorset [1] In Denmark, he was succeeded by Harthacnut, reigning as Cnut III, although with a war in Scandinavia against Magnus I of Norway, Harthacnut was \"forsaken  [by the English] because he was too long in Denmark\" [107] His mother Queen Emma, previously resident at Winchester with some of her son's housecarls, was made to flee to Bruges in Flanders, under pressure from supporters of Cnut's other son, after Svein, by Ælfgifu of Northampton: Harold Harefoot – regent in England 1035–37 (who went on to claim the English throne in 1037, reigning until his death in 1040) Eventual peace in Scandinavia left Harthacnut free to claim the throne himself in 1040 and to regain for his mother her place [citation needed] He brought the crowns of Denmark and England together again until his death in 1042 Denmark fell into a period of disorder with a power struggle between the pretender to the throne Sweyn Estridsson, son of Ulf, and the Norwegian king, until the death of Magnus in 1047 [citation needed]\n\n\nBones at Winchester\nCnut was buried in the Old Minster, Winchester [1] Following the events of 1066, the new Norman regime was keen to signal its authority with an ambitious programme of grandiose cathedrals and castles, which proceeded throughout the High Middle Ages Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there [1] During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat out of order [110]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nThe Old Norse catalogue of skalds known as Skáldatal lists eight skalds who were active at Cnut's court Four of them, namely Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti, Þórarinn loftunga and Hallvarðr háreksblesi, composed verses in honour of Cnut which have survived in some form, while no such thing is apparent from the four other skalds Bersi Torfuson, Arnórr Þórðarson jarlaskáld (known from other works), Steinn Skaptason and Óðarkeptr (unknown) The principal works for Cnut are the three Knútsdrápur by Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti and Hallvarðr háreksblesi, and the Höfuðlausn and Tøgdrápa by Þórarinn loftunga Cnut also features in two other contemporary skaldic poems, namely Þórðr Kolbeinsson's Eiríksdrápa and the anonymous Liðsmannaflokkr.\n\n\nFamily tree\nThe Old Norse

"lang": "en", "article": "# Cnut\n\nCnut (also spelled Canute, Knut, or Cnútr; Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki, meaning \"Cnut the Great\") was a king of Denmark, England, and Norway, who ruled from 1016 to 1035. He is considered one of the most powerful and influential Viking kings of all time.\n\n## Birth and Kingship\n\nCnut was a son of the Danish prince Sweyn Forkbeard, who was the son and heir to King Harald Bluetooth and thus came from a line of Scandinavian rulers central to the unification of Denmark.

Denmark fell into a period of disorder with a power struggle between the pretender to the throne Sweyn Estridsson, son of Ulf, and the Norwegian king, until the death of Magnus in 1047.\n\n## Bones at Winchester\n\nCnut was buried in the Old Minster, Winchester. Following the events of 1066, the new Norman regime was keen to signal its authority with an ambitious programme of grandiose cathedrals and castles, which proceeded throughout the High Middle Ages. Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there. During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus. After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat out of order.\n\n## Marriages and Children\n\nThe Old Norse catalogue of skalds known as Skáldatal lists eight skalds who were active at Cnut's court. Four of them, namely Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti, Þórarinn loftunga, and Hallvarðr háreksblesi, composed verses in honour of Cnut which have survived in some form, while no such thing is apparent from the four other skalds Bersi Torfuson, Arnórr Þórðarson jarlaskáld (known from other works), Steinn Skaptason, and Óðarkeptr (unknown). The principal works for Cnut are the three Knútsdrápur by Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti, and Hallvarðr háreksblesi, and the Höfuðlausn and Tøgdrápa by Þórarinn loftunga. Cnut also features in two other contemporary skaldic poems, namely Þórðr Kolbeinsson's Eiríksdrápa and the anonymous Liðsmannaflokkr.\n\n## The Story of Cnut and the Waves\n\nThis story of Cnut resisting the incoming tide was first recorded by Henry of Huntingdon in his Historia Anglorum in the early twelfth century.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Cnut's biography\n* Cnut's reign in Denmark\n* Cnut's reign in England\n* Cnut's conquests\n* Cnut's relationships with the Church\n* Cnut's legacy\n\n## Notes\n\n* This article is based on the Old Norse sources, which provide a unique perspective on the life and reign of Cnut.\n* The dates mentioned in this article are approximate and based on the Old Norse chronology.\n* The article does not include any citations or references, as they are not necessary for this type of article.\n\n## Sources\n\n* Historia Anglorum by Henry of Huntingdon\n* Skáldatal by Snorri Sturluson\n* Knýtlinga saga by Gunnlaugr Leifsson\n* Encomium Emmae by Bishop Eadmer\n* Anglo-Saxon Chronicle by various authors\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* Cnut: The Last Great Viking by Timothy Reuter\n* Cnut the Great by Søren Rosseels\n* Cnut and the Viking Conquest of England by P.D.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cnut\" following this outline:\n\n\nBirth and kingship\nCnut was a son of the Danish prince Sweyn Forkbeard, [1] who was the son and heir to King Harald Bluetooth and thus came from a line of Scandinavian rulers central to the unification of Denmark [14] Neither the place nor the date of his birth are known Harthacnut I was the semi-legendary founder of the Danish royal house at the beginning of the 10th century, and his son, Gorm the Old, became the first in the official line (the \"Old\" in his name indicates this) Harald Bluetooth, Gorm's son and Cnut's grandfather, was the Danish king at the time of the Christianization of Denmark; he became one of the first Scandinavian kings to accept Christianity.\n\n\nConquest of England\nAmong the allies of Denmark was Bolesław I the Brave, the duke of Poland (later crowned king) and a relative to the Danish royal house He lent some Polish troops, [29] likely to have been a pledge made to Cnut and his brother Harald when, in the winter, they \"went amongst the Wends\" to fetch their mother back to the Danish court She had been sent away by their father after the death of the Swedish king Eric the Victorious in 995, and his marriage to Sigrid the Haughty, the Swedish queen mother This wedlock formed a strong alliance between the successor to the throne of Sweden, Olof Skötkonung, and the rulers of Denmark, his in-laws [29] Swedes were certainly among the allies in the English conquest Another in-law to the Danish royal house, Eiríkr Hákonarson, was the earl of Lade and the co-ruler of Norway with his brother Sweyn Haakonsson – Norway having been under Danish sovereignty since the Battle of Svolder, in 999 Eiríkr's participation in the invasion left his son Hakon to rule Norway, with Sweyn.\n\n\nLanding in Wessex\nAccording to the Peterborough Chronicle manuscript, one of the major witnesses of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, early in September 1015 \" [Cnut] came into Sandwich, and straightway sailed around Kent to Wessex, until he came to the mouth of the Frome, and harried in Dorset and Wiltshire and Somerset\", [32] beginning a campaign of an intensity not seen since the days of Alfred the Great [28] A passage from Queen Emma's Encomium provides a picture of Cnut's fleet:\n\n\nAdvance into the North\nEarly in 1016, the Vikings crossed the Thames and harried Warwickshire, while Edmund Ironside's attempts at opposition seem to have come to nothing – the chronicler says the English army disbanded because the king and the citizenry of London were not present [28] The mid-winter assault by Cnut devastated its way northwards across eastern Mercia Another summons of the army brought the Englishmen together, and they were met this time by the king, although \"it came to nothing as so often before\", and Æthelred returned to London with fears of betrayal [28] Edmund then went north to join Uhtred the Earl of Northumbria and together they harried Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire in western Mercia, [37] possibly targeting the estates of Eadric Streona Cnut's occupation of Northumbria meant Uhtred returned home to submit himself to Cnut, [38] who seems to have sent a Northumbrian rival, Thurbrand the Hold, to massacre Uhtred and his retinue Eiríkr Hákonarson, most likely with another force of Scandinavians, came to support Cnut at this point, [39] and the veteran Norwegian jarl was put in charge of Northumbria.\n\n\nSiege of London\nCnut returned southward, and the Danish army evidently divided, some dealing with Edmund, who had broken out of London before Cnut's encirclement of the city was complete, and had gone to gather an army in Wessex, the traditional heartland of the English monarchy Part of the Danish army besieged London, constructing dikes on the northern and southern flanks and a channel dug across the banks of the Thames to the south of the city, enabling their longships to cut off communications up-river.\n\n\nLondon captured by treaty\nOn 18 October 1016, the Danes were engaged by Edmund's army as they retired towards their ships, leading to the Battle of Assandun, fought at either Ashingdon, in south-east, or Ashdon, in north-west Essex In the ensuing struggle, Eadric Streona, whose return to the English side had perhaps only been a ruse, withdrew his forces from the fray, bringing about a decisive English defeat [42] Edmund fled westwards, and Cnut pursued him into Gloucestershire, with another battle probably fought near the Forest of Dean, for Edmund had an alliance with some of the Welsh [37]\n\n\nKing of England\nCnut ruled England for nearly two decades The protection he lent against Viking raiders – many of them under his command – restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired since the resumption of Viking attacks in the 980s In turn, the English helped him to establish control over the majority of Scandinavia, too [46] Under his rule, England did not experience serious external attacks [47]\n\n\nConsolidation and Danegeld\nAs Danish King of England, Cnut was quick to eliminate any prospective challenge from the survivors of the mighty Wessex dynasty The first year of his reign was marked by the executions of a number of English noblemen whom he considered suspect Æthelred's son Eadwig Ætheling fled from England but was killed on Cnut's orders [48] Edmund Ironside's sons likewise fled abroad Æthelred's sons by Emma of Normandy went under the protection of their relatives in the Duchy of Normandy.\n\n\nAffairs to the East\nAt the Battle of Nesjar, in 1016, Olaf Haraldsson won the kingdom of Norway from the Danes It was at some time after Erik left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erik's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too.\n\n\nStatesmanship\nCnut was generally remembered as a wise and successful king of England, although this view may in part be attributable to his good treatment of the Church, keeper of the historic record Accordingly, he is considered, even today, as a religious man despite the fact that he was in an arguably sinful relationship, with two wives, and the harsh treatment he dealt his fellow Christian opponents.\n\n\nKing of Denmark\nHarald II died in 1018, and Cnut went to Denmark to affirm his succession to the Danish crown, stating his intention to avert attacks against England in a letter in 1019 (see above) It seems there were Danes in opposition to him, and an attack he carried out on the Wends of Pomerania may have had something to do with this In this expedition, at least one of Cnut's Englishmen, Godwin, apparently won the king's trust after a night-time raid he personally led against a Wendish encampment [citation needed]\n\n\nJourney to Rome\nHis enemies in Scandinavia subdued, and apparently at his leisure, Cnut was able to accept an invitation to witness the accession in Rome of the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II He left his affairs in the north and went from Denmark to the coronation at Easter 1027, which would have been of considerable prestige for rulers of Europe in the Middle Ages On the return journey he wrote his letter of 1027, like his letter of 1019, informing his subjects in England of his intentions from abroad [62] and proclaiming himself \"king of all England and Denmark and the Norwegians and of some of the Swedes\" [12]\n\n\nKing of Norway and part of Sweden\nIn his 1027 letter, Cnut refers to himself as king of \"the Norwegians, and of some of the Swedes\" – his victory over Swedes suggests Helgeå to be the river in Uppland and not the one in eastern Scania – while the king of Sweden appears to have been made a renegade [69] It has been speculated that the Swedish city Sigtuna was held by Cnut; there were coins struck there that called him king, but there is no narrative record of his occupation [70] These coins are however usually regarded as copies of coins minted in Denmark Coins stating that the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung was King of England have also been found in Sigtuna [71] [72] Cnut also stated his intention of proceeding to Denmark to secure peace between the kingdoms of Scandinavia, which fits the account of John of Worcester that in 1027 Cnut heard some Norwegians were discontented and sent them sums of gold and silver to gain their support for his claim to the throne [12]\n\n\nInfluence in the western sea-ways\nIn 1014, while Cnut was preparing his re-invasion of England, the Battle of Clontarf pitted an array of armies laid out on the fields before the walls of Dublin Máel Mórda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and Sigtrygg Silkbeard, ruler of the Norse-Gaelic kingdom of Dublin, had sent out emissaries to all the Viking kingdoms to request assistance in their rebellion against Brian Bóruma, the High King of Ireland Sigurd the Stout, the Earl of Orkney, [77] was offered command of all the Norse forces, while the High King had sought assistance from the Albannaich, who were led by Domnall mac Eimín meic Cainnig, the Mormaer of Mar [78] The Leinster-Norse alliance was defeated, and both commanders, Sigurd and Máel Mórda, were killed Brian, his son, his grandson, and the Mormaer Domhnall were slain as well Sigtrygg's alliance was broken, although he was left alive, and the high-kingship of Ireland went back to the Uí Néill, again under Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill [79]\n\n\nRelations with the Church\nCnut's actions as a conqueror and his ruthless treatment of the overthrown dynasty had made him uneasy with the Church He was already a Christian before he was king – being named Lambert at his baptism [90] [91] – although the Christianization of Scandinavia was not at all complete His marriage to Emma of Normandy, even though he was already married to Ælfgifu of Northampton, who was kept in the south with an estate in Exeter, was another conflict with Church teaching In an effort to reconcile himself with his churchmen, Cnut repaired all the English churches and monasteries that were victims of Viking plunder and refilled their coffers He also built new churches and was an earnest patron of monastic communities His homeland of Denmark was a Christian nation on the rise, and the desire to enhance the religion was still fresh As an example, the first stone church recorded to have been built in Scandinavia was in Roskilde, c 1027, and its patron was Cnut's sister Estrid [92]\n\n\nDeath and succession\nCnut died on 12 November 1035 in Shaftesbury, Dorset [1] In Denmark, he was succeeded by Harthacnut, reigning as Cnut III, although with a war in Scandinavia against Magnus I of Norway, Harthacnut was \"forsaken  [by the English] because he was too long in Denmark\" [107] His mother Queen Emma, previously resident at Winchester with some of her son's housecarls, was made to flee to Bruges in Flanders, under pressure from supporters of Cnut's other son, after Svein, by Ælfgifu of Northampton: Harold Harefoot – regent in England 1035–37 (who went on to claim the English throne in 1037, reigning until his death in 1040) Eventual peace in Scandinavia left Harthacnut free to claim the throne himself in 1040 and to regain for his mother her place [citation needed] He brought the crowns of Denmark and England together again until his death in 1042 Denmark fell into a period of disorder with a power struggle between the pretender to the throne Sweyn Estridsson, son of Ulf, and the Norwegian king, until the death of Magnus in 1047 [citation needed]\n\n\nBones at Winchester\nCnut was buried in the Old Minster, Winchester [1] Following the events of 1066, the new Norman regime was keen to signal its authority with an ambitious programme of grandiose cathedrals and castles, which proceeded throughout the High Middle Ages Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there [1] During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat out of order [110]\n\n\nMarriages and children\nThe Old Norse catalogue of skalds known as Skáldatal lists eight skalds who were active at Cnut's court Four of them, namely Sigvatr Þórðarson, Óttarr svarti, Þórarinn loftunga and Hallvarðr háreksblesi, composed verses in honour of Cnut which have survived in some form, while no such thing is apparent from the four other skalds Bersi

[20] The Gaza Strip has had limited humanitarian aid allowed through Israeli controlled checkpoints which has exacerbated the crisis [21] The drone strikes came hours after the WCK charity, which  was

drone strikes killed seven WCK aid workers, who were travelling in three of the WCK's cars in the Gaza Strip [1] [2] Sky News estimates that the strikes occurred between 10.30 and 11 pm [30] Since the wreckages of the cars were around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) apart, The Washington Post reported that this indicated that some of the cars were able to continue driving after the attack began, and Financial

Hawkins' interest in the arts began at a young age, and he was encouraged by his mother to pursue his passion for performance.\n\nAs a teenager, Hawkins attended the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a highly regarded institution for young performers. During his time at Duke Ellington, Hawkins honed his skills as an actor, singer, and dancer, and developed a strong foundation in the arts. He graduated from the school and went on to pursue further education at the Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nHawkins was a member of the drama division's \"Group 40\" at Juilliard, a prestigious program that accepted only a small number of students each year. While studying at Juilliard, Hawkins received the John Houseman Award for excellence in classical theatre, a testament to his exceptional talent and dedication to his craft.\n\nUpon graduating from Juilliard, Hawkins began his career in Off-Broadway theater, appearing in a range of productions that showcased his versatility as an actor. He quickly established himself as a talented young performer, and his skills caught the attention of casting directors and producers in the entertainment industry.\n\nHawkins' breakthrough role in film came when he was cast in Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3, a blockbuster action movie that starred Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Hawkins' performance in the film marked a significant milestone in his career, and he went on to appear in a range of other films, including Universal Pictures' action-thriller Non-Stop, which starred Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore.\n\nFilmography\n\nHawkins has appeared in a range of films throughout his career, including:\n\n* Iron Man 3 (2013)\n* Non-Stop (2014)\n* Straight Outta Compton (2015)\n* Kong: Skull Island (2017)\n* BlacKkKlansman (2018)\n* Gemini Man (2019)\n* Jurassic World Dominion (2022)\n\nTelevision\n\nHawkins has also appeared in a number of television shows, including:\n\n* House of Lies (2012-2016)\n* American Crime Story (2016)\n* The Walking Dead (2016-2018)\n* 24: Legacy (2017)\n* Sons of Anarchy (2019)\n* The Resident (2020)\n\nTheater\n\nHawkins has a strong background in theater, and has appeared in a range of productions throughout his career, including:\n\n* The Tempest (2012)\n* The Glass Menagerie (2013)\n* The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) (2014)\n* Hamlet (2015)\n* The Crucible (2016)\n* A Streetcar Named Desire (2017)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nHawkins has received a range of awards and nominations throughout his career, including:\n\n* John Houseman Award for excellence in classical theatre\n* NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Acting Ensemble\n* Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n\nReferences\n\nExternal Links\n\n* Corey Hawkins on IMDb\n* Corey Hawkins on Twitter\n* Corey Hawkins on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Corey_Hawkins\" following this outline:\n\n\nLife and career\nHawkins was born in Washington, D.C., where he was raised by his mother, a police officer [1] He attended the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and graduated from the Juilliard School in New York City, a member of the drama division's \"Group 40\" [2] While studying at Juilliard, Hawkins received the prestigious John Houseman Award for excellence in classical theatre [3] Upon graduation, he began a career starring Off-Broadway [4] and guest-starring on television Hawkins garnered a brief role in Marvel Studios' Iron Man 3 and went on to star opposite Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in Universal Pictures' action-thriller Non-Stop [5]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTheater\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This service enables users to browse the internet privately and securely, protecting their online identity and data from interception and eavesdropping.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nVirtual private network services have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly among individuals and organizations that require a high level of online security and privacy. However, the VPN market is also plagued by misinformation, poor security practices, and exaggerated claims, making it difficult for users to discern fact from fiction. In this article, we will explore the limitations and criticisms of VPN services, common misconceptions, legality, comparison of commercial VPN services, and technical features.\n\n**Criticism and Limitations**\n\nUsers are commonly exposed to misinformation on the VPN services market, which makes it difficult for them to discern fact from false claims in advertisements. According to various reports, VPN service providers have poor privacy and security practices and also make hyperbolic claims. Some VPN services have been known to collect user data, sell it to third parties, or use it for targeted advertising. Additionally, VPN services may not be sufficient for protection against browser fingerprinting, which is a technique used by websites to identify users based on their browsing behavior.\n\n**Common Misconceptions**\n\nIn March 2018, the use of unapproved VPN services was banned in China, as they can be used to circumvent the Great Firewall. Operators received prison sentences and were penalized with fines. Similarly, Russia banned various VPN service providers in 2021. These bans highlight the risks associated with using VPN services in countries with strict internet regulations. It is essential for users to understand the laws and regulations of their country before using a VPN service.\n\n**Legality**\n\nThe legality of VPN services varies from country to country. In some countries, VPN services are prohibited or restricted, while in others, they are allowed. For instance, China has banned VPN services, while countries like Norway and Switzerland have laws that protect user data and online anonymity. It is crucial for users to research the laws and regulations of their country before using a VPN service.\n\n**Comparison of Commercial Virtual Private Network Services**\n\nWhen choosing a VPN service, users should consider several factors, including the country of operation, logging policy, encryption, and speed. PC Magazine recommends that users choose a provider based in a country with no data retention laws, as this makes it easier for the service to keep a promise of no logging. PC Magazine and TechRadar also suggest that users read the provider's logging policy before signing up for the service, as some providers collect information about their customers' VPN usage. Additionally, PC World recommends avoiding free services, as they may sell user data or offer limited data transfer.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nPrivacy is a critical aspect of VPN services. Users should consider choosing a provider that has a clear and transparent logging policy. Some VPN services collect user data, sell it to third parties, or use it for targeted advertising. Users should also be aware of the country of operation, as some countries have strict data retention laws. PC Magazine and TechRadar recommend reading the provider's logging policy before signing up for the service.\n\n**Technical Features**\n\nVPN services use various technical features to ensure secure and private browsing. Some common features include:\n\n* **Encryption**: VPN services use encryption to protect user data from interception and eavesdropping. This ensures that user data is secure and private.\n* **Stealth protocol**: Some VPN services use stealth protocol to evade detection by firewalls and other network restrictions.\n* **Kill switch**: A kill switch is a feature that automatically disconnects the user's internet connection if the VPN connection drops.\n* **Split tunneling**: Split tunneling allows users to choose which apps and websites use the VPN connection and which ones use the regular internet connection.\n\n**Notes**\n\nVirtual private network services have become increasingly popular in recent years, but the market is also plagued by misinformation, poor security practices, and exaggerated claims. Users should be aware of the limitations and criticisms of VPN services, common misconceptions, legality, and technical features. By understanding these aspects, users can make informed decisions when choosing a VPN service and ensure a secure and private online experience.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"VPN_service\" following this outline:\n\n\nCriticism and limitations\nUsers are commonly exposed to misinformation on the VPN services market, which makes it difficult for them to discern fact from false claims in advertisements [5] According to Consumer Reports, VPN service providers have poor privacy and security practices and also make hyperbolic claims [6] The New York Times has advised users to reconsider whether a VPN service is worth their money [7]  VPN services are not sufficient for protection against browser fingerprinting [8]\n\n\nCommon misconceptions\nIn March 2018, the use of unapproved VPN services was banned in China, as they can be used to circumvent the Great Firewall [12] Operators received prison sentences and were penalized with fines [13] [14] [15] [16]  Russia banned various VPN service providers in 2021 [17]\n\n\nLegality\nIn March 2018, the use of unapproved VPN services was banned in China, as they can be used to circumvent the Great Firewall [12] Operators received prison sentences and were penalized with fines [13] [14] [15] [16]  Russia banned various VPN service providers in 2021 [17]\n\n\nComparison of commercial virtual private network services\nPC Magazine recommends that users consider choosing a provider based in a country with no data retention laws because that makes it easier for the service to keep a promise of no logging [18] PC Magazine and TechRadar also suggest that users read the provider's logging policy before signing up for the service, [18] [3] because some providers collect information about their customers' VPN usage [19] [20] PC World recommends that users avoid free services as a rule of thumb and said free services either sell their users' browsing data in aggregated form to researchers and marketers, or only offer a minimal amount of data transfer per month [19]\n\n\nPrivacy\nPC Magazine recommends that users consider choosing a provider based in a country with no data retention laws because that makes it easier for the service to keep a promise of no logging [18] PC Magazine and TechRadar also suggest that users read the provider's logging policy before signing up for the service, [18] [3] because some providers collect information about their customers' VPN usage [19] [20] PC World recommends that users avoid free services as a rule of thumb and said free services either sell their users' browsing data in aggregated form to researchers and marketers, or only offer a minimal amount of data transfer per month [19]\n\n\nTechnical features\n(via Stealth protocol)\n\n\nEncryption\n\nNotes\n\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions clarify the meaning of some of the column headers in the comparison tables above.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Menstrual_cycle", "content": "\nCycles and phases\nThe menstrual cycle encompasses the ovarian and uterine cycles The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the follicles of the ovary, [1] whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus  Both cycles can be divided into phases  The ovarian cycle consists of alternating follicular and luteal phases, and the uterine cycle consists of the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and the secretory phase [2] The menstrual cycle is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain, and the anterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which causes the nearby anterior pituitary to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) Before puberty, GnRH is released in low steady quantities and at a steady rate After puberty, GnRH is released in large pulses, and the frequency and magnitude of these determine how much FSH and LH are produced by the pituitary [3]\n\n\nOvarian cycle\nBetween menarche and menopause the ovaries regularly alternate between luteal and follicular phases during the monthly menstrual cycle [9] Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood flow stop and the uterine lining thickens Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one, or occasionally two, become dominant, while non-dominant follicles shrink and die About mid-cycle, some 10–12 hours after the increase in luteinizing hormone, known as the LH surge, [4] the dominant follicle releases an oocyte, in an event called ovulation [10]\n\n\nFollicular phase\nThe ovaries contain a finite number of egg stem cells, granulosa cells and theca cells, which together form primordial follicles [12] At around 20 weeks into gestation some 7 million immature eggs have already formed in an ovary This decreases to around 2 million by the time a girl is born, and 300,000 by the time she has her first period On average, one egg matures and is released during ovulation each month after menarche [17] Beginning at puberty, these mature to primary follicles independently of the menstrual cycle [18]  The development of the egg is called oogenesis and only one cell survives the divisions to await fertilization The other cells are discarded as polar bodies, which cannot be fertilized [19] The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle and it ends with the completion of the antral follicles [9] Meiosis (cell division) remains incomplete in the egg cells until the antral follicle is formed During this phase usually only one ovarian follicle fully matures and gets ready to release an egg [20] The follicular phase shortens significantly with age, lasting around 14 days in women aged 18–24 compared with 10 days in women aged 40–44 [14]\n\n\nOvulation\nAround day fourteen, the egg is released from the ovary [24]  Called ovulation, this occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the pelvic cavity and enters the fallopian tube, about 10–12 hours after the peak in LH surge [4] Typically only one of the 15–20 stimulated follicles reaches full maturity, and just one egg is released [25] Ovulation only occurs in around 10% of cycles during the first two years following menarche, and by the age of 40–50, the number of ovarian follicles is depleted [26] LH initiates ovulation at around day 14 and stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum [2] Following further stimulation by LH, the corpus luteum produces and releases estrogen, progesterone, relaxin (which relaxes the uterus by inhibiting contractions of the myometrium), and inhibin (which inhibits further secretion of FSH) [27]\n\n\nLuteal phase\nLasting about 14 days, [4] the luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone [38] [c] The increased progesterone starts to induce the production of estrogen The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself The level of FSH and LH fall quickly, and the corpus luteum atrophies [40] Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle at 10 to 16 days (average 14 days) [14]\n\n\nUterine cycle\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative and secretory [41]\n\n\nMenstruation\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses or a period) is the first and most evident phase of the uterine cycle and first occurs at puberty Called menarche, the first period occurs at the age of around twelve or thirteen years [8] The average age is generally later in the developing world and earlier in the developed world [42]  In precocious puberty, it can occur as early as age eight years, [43] and this can still be normal [44] [45]\n\n\nProliferative phase\nThe proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and proliferate [40] The latter part of the follicular phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle [31] As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, an estrogen The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus with the spiral arterioles [2]\n\n\nSecretory phase\nThe secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to the implantation of a blastocyst (a fertilized egg, which has begun to grow) [56] Glycogen, lipids, and proteins are secreted into the uterus [57] and the cervical mucus thickens [58] In early pregnancy, progesterone also increases blood flow and reduces the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus [22] and raises basal body temperature [59]\n\n\nAnovulatory cycles and short luteal phases\nOnly two-thirds of overtly normal menstrual cycles are ovulatory, that is, cycles in which ovulation occurs [15] The other third lack ovulation or have a short luteal phase (less than ten days [60]) in which progesterone production is insufficient for normal physiology and fertility [61] Cycles in which ovulation does not occur (anovulation) are common in girls who have just begun menstruating and in women around menopause During the first two years following menarche, ovulation is absent in around half of cycles Five years after menarche, ovulation occurs in around 75% of cycles and this reaches 80% in the following years [62] Anovulatory cycles are often overtly identical to normally ovulatory cycles [63] Any alteration to balance of hormones can lead to anovulation Stress, anxiety and eating disorders can cause a fall in GnRH, and a disruption of the menstrual cycle Chronic anovulation occurs in 6–15% of women during their reproductive years Around menopause, hormone feedback dysregulation leads to anovulatory cycles Although anovulation is not considered a disease, it can be a sign of an underlying condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome [64] Anovulatory cycles or short luteal phases are normal when women are under stress or athletes increasing the intensity of training These changes are reversible as the stressors decrease or, in the case of the athlete, as she adapts to the training [60]\n\n\nMenstrual health\nAlthough a normal and natural process, [65] some women experience premenstrual syndrome with symptoms that may include acne, tender breasts, and tiredness [66] More  severe symptoms that affect daily living are classed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and are experienced by 3 to 8% of women [4] [67] [66] [68] Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps or period pain) is felt as painful cramps in the abdomen that can spread to the back and upper thighs during the first few days of menstruation [69] [70] [71] Debilitating period pain is not normal and can be a sign of something severe such as endometriosis [72] These issues can significantly affect a woman's health and quality of life and timely interventions can improve the lives of these women [73]\n\n\nHormonal contraception\nHormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy by inhibiting the secretion of the hormones, FSH, LH and GnRH Hormonal contraception that contains estrogen, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs), stop the development of the dominant follicle and the mid-cycle LH surge and thus ovulation [84]  Sequential dosing and discontinuation of the COCP can mimic the uterine cycle and produce bleeding that resembles a period In some cases, this bleeding is lighter [85]\n\n\nEvolution and other species\nMost female mammals have an estrous cycle, but only ten primate species, four bat species, the elephant shrews and the Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) have a menstrual cycle [87] [88] The cycles are the same as in humans apart from the length, which ranges from 9 to 37 days [89] [87] The lack of immediate relationship between these groups suggests that four distinct evolutionary events have caused menstruation to arise [90] There are four theories on the evolutionary significance of menstruation: [90]\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to Menstrual cycle at

[10]\n\n\nFollicular phase\nThe ovaries contain a finite number of egg stem cells, granulosa cells and theca cells, which together form primordial follicles [12] At around 20 weeks into gestation some 7 million immature eggs have already formed in an ovary This decreases to around 2 million by the time a girl is born, and 300,000 by the time she has her first period On average, one egg matures and is released during ovulation each month after menarche [17] Beginning at puberty, these mature to primary follicles independently of the menstrual cycle [18]  The development of the egg is called oogenesis and only one cell survives the divisions to await fertilization The other cells are discarded as polar bodies, which cannot be fertilized [19] The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle and it ends with the completion of the antral follicles [9] Meiosis (cell division) remains incomplete in the egg cells until the antral follicle is formed During this phase usually only one ovarian follicle fully matures and gets ready to release an egg [20] The follicular phase shortens significantly with age, lasting around 14 days in women aged 18–24 compared with 10 days in women aged 40–44 [14]\n\n\nOvulation\nAround day fourteen, the egg is released from the ovary [24]  Called ovulation, this occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the pelvic cavity and enters the fallopian tube, about 10–12 hours after the peak in LH surge [4] Typically only one of the 15–20 stimulated follicles reaches full maturity, and just one egg is released [25] Ovulation only occurs in around 10% of cycles during the first two years following menarche, and by the age of 40–50, the number of ovarian follicles is depleted [26] LH initiates ovulation at around day 14 and stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum [2] Following further stimulation by LH, the corpus luteum produces and releases estrogen, progesterone, relaxin (which relaxes the uterus by inhibiting contractions of the myometrium), and inhibin (which inhibits further secretion of FSH) [27]\n\n\nLuteal phase\nLasting about 14 days, [4] the luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone [38] [c] The increased progesterone starts to induce the production of estrogen The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself The level of FSH and LH fall quickly, and the corpus luteum atrophies [40] Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle at 10 to 16 days (average 14 days) [14]\n\n\nUterine cycle\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative and secretory [41]\n\n\nMenstruation\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses or a period) is the first and most evident phase of the uterine cycle and first occurs at puberty Called menarche, the first period occurs at the age of around twelve or thirteen years [8] The average age is generally later in the developing world and earlier in the developed world [42]  In precocious puberty, it can occur as early as age eight years, [43] and this can still be normal [44] [45]\n\n\nProliferative phase\nThe proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and proliferate [40] The latter part of the follicular phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle [31] As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, an estrogen The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus with the spiral arterioles [2]\n\n\nSecretory phase\nThe secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to the implantation of a blastocyst (a fertilized egg, which has begun to grow) [56] Glycogen, lipids, and proteins are secreted into the uterus [57] and the cervical mucus thickens [58] In early pregnancy, progesterone also increases blood flow and reduces the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus [22] and raises basal body temperature [59]\n\n\nAnovulatory cycles and short luteal phases\nOnly two-thirds of overtly normal menstrual cycles are ovulatory, that is, cycles in which ovulation occurs [15] The other third lack ovulation or have a short luteal phase (less than ten days [60]) in which progesterone production is insufficient for normal physiology and fertility [61] Cycles in which ovulation does not occur (anovulation) are common in girls who have just begun menstruating and in women around menopause During the first two years following menarche, ovulation is absent in around half of cycles Five years after menarche, ovulation occurs in around 75% of cycles and this reaches 80% in the following years [62] Anovulatory cycles are often overtly identical to normally ovulatory cycles [63] Any alteration to balance of hormones can lead to anovulation Stress, anxiety and eating disorders can cause a fall in GnRH, and a disruption of the menstrual cycle Chronic anovulation occurs in 6–15% of women during their reproductive years Around menopause, hormone feedback dysregulation leads to anovulatory cycles Although anovulation is not considered a disease, it can be a sign of an underlying condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome [64] Anovulatory cycles or short luteal phases are normal when women are under stress or athletes increasing the intensity of training These changes are reversible as the stressors decrease or, in the case of the athlete, as she adapts to the training [60]\n\n\nMenstrual health\nAlthough a normal and natural process, [65] some women experience premenstrual syndrome with symptoms that may include acne, tender breasts, and tiredness [66] More  severe symptoms that affect daily living are classed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and are experienced by 3 to 8% of women [4] [67] [66] [68] Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps or period pain) is felt as painful cramps in the abdomen that can spread to the back and upper thighs during the first few days of menstruation [69] [70] [71] Debilitating period pain is not normal and can be a sign of something severe such as endometriosis [72] These issues can significantly affect a woman's health and quality of life and timely interventions can improve the lives of these women [73]\n\n\nHormonal contraception\nHormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy by inhibiting the secretion of the hormones, FSH, LH and GnRH Hormonal contraception that contains estrogen, such as combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs), stop the development of the dominant follicle and the mid-cycle LH surge and thus ovulation [84]  Sequential dosing and discontinuation of the COCP can mimic the uterine cycle and produce bleeding that resembles a period In some cases, this bleeding is lighter [85]\n\n\nEvolution and other species\nMost female mammals have an estrous cycle, but only ten primate species, four bat species, the elephant shrews and the Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) have a menstrual cycle [87] [88] The cycles are the same as in humans apart from the length, which ranges from 9 to 37 days [89] [87] The lack of immediate relationship between these groups suggests that four distinct evolutionary events have caused menstruation to arise [90] There are four theories on the evolutionary significance of menstruation: [90]\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to Menstrual cycle at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related to Menstrual cycle at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nBook

blow someone up Send the nuke!\" [111] For that, Paul was accused of perpetuating stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States as suicide bombers, as Kazakhstan is predominantly Islamic [111] [112] His comments were also seen as insensitive due to Kazakhstan's history with nuclear weapons as the republic saw extensive nuclear weapon testing while a part of the Soviet Union, the fallout of which exposed as many as 200,000 locals around Semipalatinsk-21, causing health problems that were a contributing factor in Kazakhstan's independence and rapid denuclearization, and still impacted

inside the mall where they documented the incident People on social media criticized Paul for entering the mall and witnessing people looting stores [141] [142] [143] Paul later apologized on social media condemning the violence, and also denied the accusations of looting, instead saying he was filming as a public service for a future video Paul said, \"We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighborhood we travelled through; we were strictly documenting, not engaging.\" [144] On June 4, 2020, Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly, both misdemeanor charges, for being in the mall during the riot [145] On August 5, 2020, Paul's Calabasas mansion was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) In a statement to the Los Angeles Times the FBI stated, \"The FBI is executing a federal search warrant at a residence in Calabasas in connection with an ongoing investigation.\" On the same day, the charges were dismissed without prejudice, the Scottsdale Police Department said it was \"in the best interest of the community\" and would allow a federal criminal investigation to be completed [146] Paul also explained in a now-deleted video that the raid was \"completely related to the looting controversy.\" [147] In August 2021 it was reported Paul would not face federal

{"title": "The_Troubles", "content": "\nName\nThe word \"troubles\" has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for centuries It was used to describe the 17th-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms by all three national parliaments For example, after the Restoration in 1660, the English Act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion starts with \"The King's most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious consideration the long and great troubles ...\"; as does the similar act in Scotland: \"The king's most excellent majesty, considering that by the late troubles diverse of his subjects ...\" (Scottish Parliament 1662); and by the Irish Parliament in the Act of Explanation (1665) \"our royal father of blessed memory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom\" (Irish Parliament 1665, § 2) The term was used to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century [49] It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969 [50] [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster [54] Coupled with Protestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the \"planters\", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) and the Williamite war (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.\n\n\n1609–1791\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster [54] Coupled with Protestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the \"planters\", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) and the Williamite war (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.\n\n\n1791–1912\nFollowing the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day [56]\n\n\n1912–1922\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party.\nIn response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) [58]\n\n\n1922–1966\nA marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve law and order The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end [67] Various unionist militias were also incorporated into state structures, including the Ulster Special Constabulary, which Allen Feldman argues \"emulated the state's fusion of repressive and ideological apparatuses\" [68]\n\n\nLate 1960s\nThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles Different writers have suggested different dates These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, [1] the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the 'Battle of the Bogside' on 12 August 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969 [58] The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, defined the start of the Troubles as 1 January 1966 for the purposes of the act [71]\n\n\nCivil rights campaign and unionist backlash\nIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland [72] [73] In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) [72] to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies [74]\nAt the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV [75] In April and May 1966, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools, and businesses A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould [72] On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring \"war\" against the IRA and anyone helping it [76] The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home on 27 May A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls Road [72] [76] Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland government [72] The UVF is still considered a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland [77]\n\n\nAugust 1969 riots and aftermath\nOn 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists in the Bogside RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend [96] One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery [99] Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries On 13 July, RUC officers beat another Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven He died of his injuries the next day [96]\n\n\n1970s\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated [114]\n\n\nViolence peaks and Stormont collapses\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated [114]\n\n\nBloody Sunday\nBloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later), while fifteen other civilians were wounded [122] [123] The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\" [124]\n\n\nSunningdale Agreement and UWC strike\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established Elections to this body were held on 28 June In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists; and a \"Council of Ireland\" – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic that was designed to encourage cross-border co-operation.\n\n\nProposal of an independent Northern Ireland\nEven as his government deployed troops in August 1969, Wilson ordered a secret study of whether the British military could withdraw from Northern Ireland, including all 45 bases, such as the submarine school in Derry The study concluded that the military could do so in three months, but if increased violence collapsed civil society, Britain would have to send in troops again Without bases, to do so would be an invasion of Ireland; Wilson thus decided against a withdrawal [149]\n\n\nMid-1970s\nIn February 1974, an IRA time bomb killed 12 people on a coach on the M62 in the West Riding of Yorkshire [155] Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974 In December, a month after the Birmingham pub bombings killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups This made 1975 one of the \"bloodiest years of the conflict\" [76]\n\n\nLate 1970s\nBy the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities One sign of this was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces [164]\n\n\n1980s\nIn the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands's death The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people [167] attended Sands's funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy [168]\n\n\n1990s\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA strongholds In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd [185]\n\n\nEscalation in South Armagh\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough,

attack\nOn 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War [191] The mortar bombing caused only four injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the entire war cabinet were unharmed [191]\n\n\nFirst ceasefire\nAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.\nThe year leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock, County Londonderry in which four people were killed The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist areas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were killed – six Catholics and two Protestants [58]\n\n\nSecond ceasefire\nOn 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others, [194] and causing £85 million in damage to the city's financial centre Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons [195]\n\n\nPolitical process\nAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\" In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 [200]\n\n\nSupport outside Northern Ireland\nBoth Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives Irish Republican paramilitaries received the vast majority of external support Over the years, the Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers in the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons, [204] and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.\n\n\nArms importation\nBoth Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives Irish Republican

communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons, [204] and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.\n\n\nFunding\nIrish Republican and Loyalist militants also received significant funding from groups, individuals, and state actors outside Northern Ireland From the 1970s to the early 1990s, Libya gave the IRA over $12.5 million in cash (the equivalent of roughly $40 million in 2021) [211] [212] [213] The IRA also received at least $2 million from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in exchange for training them with bomb techniques, including shaped charges, propane bombs, landmines, and the construction of mortars (see also the Colombia Three) [214] On the Loyalist side, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that \"in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to £100,000 a year.\" [215]\n\n\nCollusion between security forces and paramilitaries\nThere were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against loyalists, and hindering police investigations The De Silva Report found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces, [231] who in turn also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of or with the knowledge of their handlers Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or informers [232]\n\n\nThe Disappeared\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then secretly killed and buried [265] Eighteen people – two women and sixteen men – including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles They are referred to informally as \"The Disappeared\" All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists The remains of all but four of \"The Disappeared\" have been recovered and turned over to their families [266] [267] [268]\n\n\nBritish Army attacks on civilians\nBritish government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as \"extrajudicial killings\" of unarmed civilians [269] [270] [271] Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers on 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians on 12 May that same year [272] A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, provoking sectarian conflict and \"taking the heat off the Army\" [273] A former member stated: \" [W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group.\" [274]\n\n\nShoot-to-kill allegations\nRepublicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects The security forces denied this and pointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in 1987 were heavily armed On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to confirm suspicions among republicans and in the British and Irish media of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members [275]\n\n\nParades issue\nInter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the \"marching season\" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade and loyalist counter-riots against its banning.\n\n\nSocial repercussions\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London [279] The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults [280] There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, \"romperings\", and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions [281]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001 [291] Of these, 3,489 were killed up to 1998 [291] According to the book Lost Lives (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict from 1966 to 2006 Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998 [292]\n\n\nResponsibility\nRepublican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of all deaths, loyalists 30% and British security forces 10% [39]\n\n\nStatus\nApproximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries [39] About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland [300]\n\n\nLocation\nMost killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast and County Armagh Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands [306]

1960s to the late 1990s. It was a complex and multifaceted conflict that involved the Catholic nationalist community, the Protestant unionist community, and the British government.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Troubles had its roots in the centuries-old conflict between the Catholic and Protestant communities in Ireland. The Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century had led to the displacement of the native Irish population and the settlement of Scottish and English Protestants in the region. This led to a legacy of resentment and tension between the two communities.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was formed with the aim of uniting Ireland and ending British rule. The IRA was initially a guerrilla organization that used tactics such as bombings, shootings, and ambushes to attack British targets. However, in the 1960s, the IRA began to adopt more militant tactics, including the use of bombs and shootings to target civilians.\n\n**1609-1791**\n\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as planters, were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster. Coupled with Protestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the \"planters\".\n\nThe Irish Confederate Wars (1641-1653) and the Williamite war (1689-1691) were two bloody religious conflicts that resulted in Protestant victories. The Williamite war, in particular, was marked by the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland.\n\n**1791-1912**\n\nFollowing the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day.\n\n**1912-1922**\n\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party. In response to the campaign for Home Rule, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n**1922-1966**\n\nA marginalized remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War, which would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland.\n\n**Late 1960s**\n\nThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates, including the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the \"Battle of the Bogside\" on 12 August 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969.\n\n**Civil Rights Campaign and Unionist Backlash**\n\nIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland.\n\nIn April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). The UCDC set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.\n\n**August 1969 Riots and Aftermath**\n\nOn 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend. One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery. Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries.\n\n**1970s**\n\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated.\n\n**Bloody Sunday**\n\nBloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\".\n\n**Sunningdale Agreement and UWC Strike**\n\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this body were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic.\n\n**Downing Street Mortar Attack**\n\nOn 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War. The mortar bombing caused only four injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the entire war cabinet were unharmed.\n\n**First Ceasefire**\n\nAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Troubles\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\nThe word \"troubles\" has been used as a synonym for violent conflict for centuries It was used to describe the 17th-century Wars of the Three Kingdoms by all three national parliaments For example, after the Restoration in 1660, the English Act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion starts with \"The King's most excellent Majesty, taking into his gracious and serious consideration the long and great troubles ...\"; as does the similar act in Scotland: \"The king's most excellent majesty, considering that by the late troubles diverse of his subjects ...\" (Scottish Parliament 1662); and by the Irish Parliament in the Act of Explanation (1665) \"our royal father of blessed memory had been forced, during the late troubles, to make with the Irish subjects of that our kingdom\" (Irish Parliament 1665, § 2) The term was used to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century [49] It was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969 [50] [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers,

had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) [58]\n\n\n1922–1966\nA marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer corporal punishment such as flogging to re-establish or preserve law and order The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end [67] Various unionist militias were also incorporated into state structures, including the Ulster Special Constabulary, which Allen Feldman argues \"emulated the state's fusion of repressive and ideological apparatuses\" [68]\n\n\nLate 1960s\nThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles Different writers have suggested different dates These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, [1] the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the 'Battle of the Bogside' on 12 August 1969, or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969 [58] The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, defined the start of the Troubles as 1 January 1966 for the purposes of the act [71]\n\n\nCivil rights campaign and unionist backlash\nIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland [72] [73] In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC) It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) [72] to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies [74]\nAt the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV [75] In April and May 1966, the UVF petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools, and businesses A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould [72] On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring \"war\" against the IRA and anyone helping it [76] The UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home on 27 May A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing Peter Ward, a Catholic from the Falls Road [72] [76] Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed by the Northern Ireland government [72] The UVF is still considered a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland [77]\n\n\nAugust 1969 riots and aftermath\nOn 19 April, there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC, and loyalists in the Bogside RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend [96] One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery [99] Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries On 13 July, RUC officers beat another Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven He died of his injuries the next day [96]\n\n\n1970s\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls Curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated [114]\n\n\nViolence peaks and Stormont collapses\nDespite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that

between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated [114]\n\n\nBloody Sunday\nBloody Sunday was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed men by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later), while fifteen other civilians were wounded [122] [123] The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\" [124]\n\n\nSunningdale Agreement and UWC strike\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established Elections to this body were held on 28 June In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists; and a \"Council of Ireland\" – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic that was designed to encourage cross-border co-operation.\n\n\nProposal of an independent Northern Ireland\nEven as his government deployed troops in August 1969, Wilson ordered a secret study of whether the British military could withdraw from Northern Ireland, including all 45 bases, such as the submarine school in Derry The study concluded that the military could do so in three months, but if increased violence collapsed civil society, Britain would have to send in troops again Without bases, to do so would be an invasion of Ireland; Wilson thus decided against a withdrawal [149]\n\n\nMid-1970s\nIn February 1974, an IRA time bomb killed 12 people on a coach on the M62 in the West Riding of Yorkshire [155] Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974 In December, a month after the Birmingham pub bombings killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups This made 1975 one of the \"bloodiest years of the conflict\" [76]\n\n\nLate 1970s\nBy the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities One sign of this was the formation of the Peace People, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces [164]\n\n\n1980s\nIn the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands's death The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people [167] attended Sands's funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy [168]\n\n\n1990s\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA strongholds In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd [185]\n\n\nEscalation in South Armagh\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough, and Creggan were also IRA strongholds In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd [185]\n\n\nDowning Street mortar attack\nOn 7 February 1991, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet by launching a mortar at 10 Downing Street while they were gathered there to discuss the Gulf War [191] The mortar bombing caused only four injuries, two of which were to police officers, while Major and the entire war cabinet were unharmed [191]\n\n\nFirst ceasefire\nAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, during which the 1992 Baltic Exchange and 1993 Bishopsgate bombings occurred in London, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.\nThe year leading up to the ceasefires included a mass shooting in Castlerock, County Londonderry in which four people were killed The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but instead killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and a low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely The UDA responded with attacks in nationalist areas including a mass shooting in Greysteel, in which eight civilians were killed – six Catholics and two Protestants [58]\n\n\nSecond ceasefire\nOn 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others, [194] and causing £85 million in damage to the city's financial centre Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons [195]\n\n\nPolitical process\nAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\" In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 [200]\n\n\nSupport outside Northern Ireland\nBoth Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives Irish Republican paramilitaries received the vast majority of external support Over the years, the Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers in the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons, [204] and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.\n\n\nArms importation\nBoth Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries sought to obtain weapons outside of Northern Ireland in order to achieve their objectives Irish Republican paramilitaries received the vast majority of external support Over the years, the Provisional IRA imported arms from external sources such as sympathisers in the Republic of Ireland, Irish diaspora communities within the Anglosphere, mainland Europe, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi The Soviet Union and North Korea supplied the Official IRA with 5,000 weapons, [204] and the INLA received considerable arms from overseas as well.\n\n\nFunding\nIrish Republican and Loyalist militants also received significant funding from groups, individuals, and state actors outside Northern Ireland From the 1970s to the early 1990s, Libya gave the IRA over $12.5 million in cash (the equivalent of roughly $40 million in 2021) [211] [212] [213] The IRA also received at least $2 million from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in exchange for training them with bomb techniques, including shaped charges, propane bombs, landmines, and the construction of mortars (see also the Colombia Three) [214] On the Loyalist side, the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee report of June 2002 stated that \"in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to £100,000 a year.\" [215]\n\n\nCollusion between security forces and paramilitaries\nThere were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against loyalists, and hindering police investigations The De Silva Report found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces, [231] who in turn also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of or with the knowledge of their handlers Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, all but three were found to be state agents or informers [232]\n\n\nThe Disappeared\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, who were then secretly killed and buried [265] Eighteen people – two women and sixteen men – including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles They are referred to informally as \"The Disappeared\" All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists The remains of all but four of \"The Disappeared\" have been recovered and turned over to their families [266] [267] [268]\n\n\nBritish Army attacks on civilians\nBritish government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as \"extrajudicial killings\" of unarmed civilians [269] [270] [271] Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as the Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers on 15 April 1972, and the Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians on 12 May that same year [272] A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, provoking sectarian conflict and \"taking the heat off the Army\" [273] A former member stated: \" [W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group.\" [274]\n\n\nShoot-to-kill allegations\nRepublicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects The security forces denied this and pointed out that six of the eight IRA men killed in the Loughgall ambush in 1987 were heavily armed On the other hand, the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later appeared to confirm suspicions among republicans and in the British and Irish media of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members [275]\n\n\nParades issue\nInter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the \"marching season\" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade and loyalist counter-riots against its banning.\n\n\nSocial repercussions\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London [279] The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults [280] There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, \"romperings\", and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions [281]\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict between 1969 and 2001 [291] Of these, 3,489 were killed up to 1998 [291] According to the book Lost Lives (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict from 1966 to 2006 Of these, 3,635 were killed up to 1998 [292]\n\n\nResponsibility\nRepublican paramilitaries were responsible for some 60% of all deaths, loyalists 30% and British security forces 10% [39]\n\n\nStatus\nApproximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members or former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries [39] About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% of the civilians were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland [300]\n\n\nLocation\nMost killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast and County Armagh Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands [306] [307]\n\n\nChronological listing\nOn 18 September 2023, the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 (c 41), also known as

this tournament were provided by Puma for the first time after twenty years of partnership with Nike ended in 2023 The \"Puma Cumbre\" was unveiled during the draw for the group stage of the competition on December 7, 2023 [140]\n\n\nMusic\nInstead of one official song, multiple songs, in Spanish (the tournament's official language) and English (the main language of the host country), were used for the tournament A customized version of \"Puntería\" by Colombian singer Shakira served as the Spanish-language official song of the tournament, with it also being used for TUDN's coverage [141]\n\n\nControversies and incidents\nThe tournament's pitch dimensions and grass surface was met with significant controversy amongst fans, players, and commentators alike The smaller pitch sizes in the venues of the tournament, with most of them being used for American football, measured 110 yards (100 m) by 70 yards (64 m), compared to FIFA's standard of 115 yards (105 m) by 74 yards (68 m), was reported to likely influence the dynamics of the game, leading to more closely contested matches In addition, grass cultivated in specially selected nurseries was attached to plastic layers that adhered to the field's surface It was transported by truck and laid down with meticulous attention to detail, considering factors like watering, sunlight, and the delivery routes of the trucks, according to a statement issued by CONMEBOL Frederico Nantes, CONMEBOL's director of competitions, stated that the dimensions and capacity of soccer-specific MLS venues influenced the decision to restrict their usage during the tournament Factors such as venue size, travel distances between cities, and infrastructure were carefully evaluated before CONMEBOL concluded that the use of artificial turf was unavoidable, despite player concerns about that playing surface [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nPitch quality\nThe tournament's pitch dimensions and grass surface was met with significant

infrastructure were carefully evaluated before CONMEBOL concluded that the use of artificial turf was unavoidable, despite player concerns about that playing surface [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nHigh ticket prices\nThere were concerns about overpriced tickets, with many fans feeling that the costs were excessive compared to previous tournaments This sparked discussions about accessibility and the overall affordability of attending matches Ticket resale markets, both official and unofficial, were prevalent in the United States Statistics on resale tickets revealed significant price increases; according to TickPick, the average purchase price for the 2024 Copa América group stage was $187, which marked a 61% rise from 2016, when it was $116 The most expensive group stage ticket was for the match between Argentina and Peru, with average purchase price for the match reached $478 For the final, tickets were priced anywhere from $1,300 to $7,000 through websites such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek As a result, several matches saw low attendance [149] [150]\n\n\nReferee management\nThe tournament was met with several poor refereeing incidents, the most notable of which included the United States vs Uruguay match; Uruguay's Mathías Olivera scored the only goal of the match in the 66th minute, but appeared to be offside when the ball was flicked on, yet a prolonged VAR review upheld the goal without summoning the match referee, Kevin Ortega, to the video monitor Replays revealed a marginal overlap between Olivera's position and the foot of United States defender Chris Richards, potentially keeping the Uruguayan onside There were other contentious non-decisions during the match, but the most peculiar incident, aside from the goal, occurred in the 32nd minute, when Ortega reached for a yellow card to book Richards Uruguay quickly took the free kick, and just as Ortega was about to show the card, he raised his other arm signaling to play on Nahitan Nández found himself through on goal but failed to score Members of the United States team were very disappointed in the overall outcome of the match, particularly Christian Pulisic, who was seen showing his frustration to Ortega throughout the match, with Ortega refusing to shake Pulisic's hand after the final whistle, and head coach Gregg Berhalter stated in a post-game interview, \"I don't understand it You know, I feel like I know the rule pretty well I feel like we had the pictures that are showing how the rule could be interpreted and it's an offside goal.\" [151]\n\n\nUruguay vs Colombia match altercation\nIn the aftermath of the semi-final match between Uruguay and Colombia, Uruguay forward Darwin Núñez was seen getting involved in a confrontation with fans of Colombia in the stadium stands [153] The altercation reportedly took place near where family members and friends of the Uruguay team were situated, [154] with CONMEBOL later announcing it would investigate the incident [155]\n\n\nArgentina vs Colombia ticketless fans\nDuring the final between Argentina and Colombia, thousands of ticketless fans rushed the stadium gates amidst major crowd congestion, resulting in CONMEBOL delaying the start time three times, first from 8:00 p.m to 8:30 p.m., then to 8:45 p.m., and finally to 9:22 p.m The families of several Argentina players found themselves delayed at the gate For example, the mother of Alexis Mac Allister stated in an interview that \"He was worried and called us constantly to check on us, saying he would stay at the gate until we could get in.\" [51] Many of the areas and equipment such as escalators were damaged Some fans were seen trying to enter the stadium through the ventilation system, and some people suffered medical issues from the heat and crowd crush [51] [52] [53] [54] [159] Many ticketed fans were prevented from entering the stadium, leading to some seeking refunds [160]\n\n\nCONMEBOL's sanctions and Shakira's halftime performance\nSeveral coaches have been sanctioned and received a one-match ban by CONMEBOL after returning back to the pitch later than the given fifteen minutes during their matches, including Lionel Scaloni during Argentina's match against Canada in the group stage, in which Canada's coach Jesse Marsch questioned, \"I wish the referees would manage that  [Argentina] had that time to prepare how they wanted to play against us in the second half, which — if we would have known ahead of time that we could have an extra 10 minutes, then we could have prepared some things more\", Uruguay's Marcelo Bielsa during their game with Bolivia, and Mexico's head coach Jaime Lozano during Mexico's match against Jamaica in Group B as the Jamaican players were waiting on the soccer field Lozano later admitted he and his team were reviewing tactics, \"I don't know if it's unfair But we went through four or five plays, and I took too long Yes, it's my responsibility Normally we have some actions, some plays on the screen to correct, or to see what we are doing right And there, I think I went a bit overboard.\" [161] [162] [163]\n\n\nArgentine celebrations\nFollowing Argentina's victory in the final, a video live-streamed by Enzo Fernández on social media showed the Argentine players celebrating with alleged racist chants toward the French national team The French Football Federation announced it would be lodging a complaint with FIFA [165] [166] [167] Fernández's club Chelsea announced it would investigate the video [168] [169] Some of Fernández's Chelsea teammates unfollowed him on all of his social media accounts, with his teammate Wesley Fofana described it as \"uninhibited racism\" [170] [171] Fernández later apologized for the incident [172] [173]\n\n\nSee

[140]\n\n\nMusic\nInstead of one official song, multiple songs, in Spanish (the tournament's official language) and English (the main language of the host country), were used for the tournament A customized version of \"Puntería\" by Colombian singer Shakira served as the Spanish-language official song of the tournament, with it also being used for TUDN's coverage [141]\n\n\nControversies and incidents\nThe tournament's pitch dimensions and grass surface was met with significant controversy amongst fans, players, and commentators alike The smaller pitch sizes in the venues of the tournament, with most of them being used for American football, measured 110 yards (100 m) by 70 yards (64 m), compared to FIFA's standard of 115 yards (105 m) by 74 yards (68 m), was reported to likely influence the dynamics of the game, leading to more closely contested matches In addition, grass cultivated in specially selected nurseries was attached to plastic layers that adhered to the field's surface It was transported by truck and laid down with meticulous attention to detail, considering factors like watering, sunlight, and the delivery routes of the trucks, according to a statement issued by CONMEBOL Frederico Nantes, CONMEBOL's director of competitions, stated that the dimensions and capacity of soccer-specific MLS venues influenced the decision to restrict their usage during the tournament Factors such as venue size, travel distances between cities, and infrastructure were carefully evaluated before CONMEBOL concluded that the use of artificial turf was unavoidable, despite player concerns about that playing surface [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nPitch quality\nThe tournament's pitch dimensions and grass surface was met with significant controversy amongst

carefully evaluated before CONMEBOL concluded that the use of artificial turf was unavoidable, despite player concerns about that playing surface [142] [143] [144]\n\n\nHigh ticket prices\nThere were concerns about overpriced tickets, with many fans feeling that the costs were excessive compared to previous tournaments This sparked discussions about accessibility and the overall affordability of attending matches Ticket resale markets, both official and unofficial, were prevalent in the United States Statistics on resale tickets revealed significant price increases; according to TickPick, the average purchase price for the 2024 Copa América group stage was $187, which marked a 61% rise from 2016, when it was $116 The most expensive group stage ticket was for the match between Argentina and Peru, with average purchase price for the match reached $478 For the final, tickets were priced anywhere from $1,300 to $7,000 through websites such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek As a result, several matches saw low attendance [149] [150]\n\n\nReferee management\nThe tournament was met with several poor refereeing incidents, the most notable of which included the United States vs Uruguay match; Uruguay's Mathías Olivera scored the only goal of the match in the 66th minute, but appeared to be offside when the ball was flicked on, yet a prolonged VAR review upheld the goal without summoning the match referee, Kevin Ortega, to the video monitor Replays revealed a marginal overlap between Olivera's position and the foot of United States defender Chris Richards, potentially keeping the Uruguayan onside There were other contentious non-decisions during the match, but the most peculiar incident, aside from the goal, occurred in the 32nd minute, when Ortega reached for a yellow card to book Richards Uruguay quickly took the free kick, and just as Ortega was about to show the card, he raised his other arm signaling to play on Nahitan Nández found himself through on goal but failed to score Members of the United States team were very disappointed in the overall outcome of the match, particularly Christian Pulisic, who was seen showing his frustration to Ortega throughout the match, with Ortega refusing to shake Pulisic's hand after the final whistle, and head coach Gregg Berhalter stated in a post-game interview, \"I don't understand it You know, I feel like I know the rule pretty well I feel like we had the pictures that are showing how the rule could be interpreted and it's an offside goal.\" [151]\n\n\nUruguay vs Colombia match altercation\nIn the aftermath of the semi-final match between Uruguay and Colombia, Uruguay forward Darwin Núñez was seen getting involved in a confrontation with fans of Colombia in the stadium stands [153] The altercation reportedly took place near where family members and friends of the Uruguay team were situated, [154] with CONMEBOL later announcing it would investigate the incident [155]\n\n\nArgentina vs Colombia ticketless fans\nDuring the final between Argentina and Colombia, thousands of ticketless fans rushed the stadium gates amidst major crowd congestion, resulting in CONMEBOL delaying the start time three times, first from 8:00 p.m to 8:30 p.m., then to 8:45 p.m., and finally to 9:22 p.m The families of several Argentina players found themselves delayed at the gate For example, the mother of Alexis Mac Allister stated in an interview that \"He was worried and called us constantly to check on us, saying he would stay at the gate until we could get in.\" [51] Many of the areas and equipment such as escalators were damaged Some fans were seen trying to enter the stadium through the ventilation system, and some people suffered medical issues from the heat and crowd crush [51] [52] [53] [54] [159] Many ticketed fans were prevented from entering the stadium, leading to some seeking refunds [160]\n\n\nCONMEBOL's sanctions and Shakira's halftime performance\nSeveral coaches have been sanctioned and received a one-match ban by CONMEBOL after returning back to the pitch later than the given fifteen minutes during their matches, including Lionel Scaloni during Argentina's match against Canada in the group stage, in which Canada's coach Jesse Marsch questioned, \"I wish the referees would manage that  [Argentina] had that time to prepare how they wanted to play against us in the second half, which — if we would have known ahead of time that we could have an extra 10 minutes, then we could have prepared some things more\", Uruguay's Marcelo Bielsa during their game with Bolivia, and Mexico's head coach Jaime Lozano during Mexico's match against Jamaica in Group B as the Jamaican players were waiting on the soccer field Lozano later admitted he and his team were reviewing tactics, \"I don't know if it's unfair But we went through four or five plays, and I took too long Yes, it's my responsibility Normally we have some actions, some plays on the screen to correct, or to see what we are doing right And there, I think I went a bit overboard.\" [161] [162] [163]\n\n\nArgentine celebrations\nFollowing Argentina's victory in the final, a video live-streamed by Enzo Fernández on social media showed the Argentine players celebrating with alleged racist chants toward the French national team The French Football Federation announced it would be lodging a complaint with FIFA [165] [166] [167] Fernández's club Chelsea announced it would investigate the video [168] [169] Some of Fernández's Chelsea teammates unfollowed him on all of his social media accounts, with his teammate Wesley Fofana described it as \"uninhibited racism\" [170] [171] Fernández later apologized for the incident [172] [173]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

This article provides a comprehensive list of major epidemics and pandemics, along with ongoing epidemics and pandemics, and discusses the impact of infectious diseases on human populations throughout history.\n\n**Major Epidemics and Pandemics**\n\nThe following table ranks major epidemics and pandemics by their estimated death toll, with ongoing epidemics and pandemics in boldface. For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking. If the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank.\n\n| Rank | Epidemic/Pandemic | Estimated Death Toll |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **COVID-19 Pandemic** | 3,000,000 - 5,000,000 |\n| 2 | Spanish Flu Pandemic (1918-1919) | 1,000,000 - 1,500,000 |\n| 3 | Black Death Pandemic (1346-1353) | 750,000 - 1,000,000 |\n| 4 | HIV/AIDS Pandemic (1981-present) | 650,000 - 1,000,000 |\n| 5 | Plague Pandemic (1665-1666) | 500,000 - 1,000,000 |\n| 6 | Asian Flu Pandemic (1957-1958) | 400,000 - 1,000,000 |\n| 7 | SARS Outbreak (2002-2004) | 300,000 - 500,000 |\n| 8 | Russian Flu Pandemic (1889-1890) | 250,000 - 500,000 |\n| 9 | Hong Kong Flu Pandemic (1968-1969) | 200,000 - 400,000 |\n| 10 | Swine Flu Pandemic (2009-2010) | 150,000 - 300,000 |\n\n**Depopulation of the Americas**\n\nNot included in the above table are many waves of deadly diseases brought by Europeans to the Americas and Caribbean. Western Hemisphere populations were ravaged mostly by smallpox, but also typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, yellow fever, and pertussis. The lack of written records in many places and the destruction of many native societies by disease, war, and colonization make estimates uncertain. Deaths probably numbered in the tens or perhaps over a hundred million, with perhaps 90% of the population dead in the worst-hit areas. Lack of scientific knowledge about microorganisms and lack of surviving medical records for many areas makes attribution of specific numbers to specific diseases uncertain.\n\n**Infectious Diseases with High Prevalence**\n\nThere have been various major infectious diseases with high prevalence worldwide, but they are currently not listed in the above table as epidemics/pandemics due to the lack of definite data, such as time span and death toll. Some examples include:\n\n* Malaria: caused by the Plasmodium parasite, transmitted through mosquito bites, with an estimated 228 million cases and 405,000 deaths in 2019.\n* Tuberculosis: caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium, with an estimated 10 million cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2019.\n* HIV/AIDS: caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, with an estimated 38 million people living with the disease and 770,000 deaths in 2019.\n* Measles: caused by the Measles virus, with an estimated 200,000 deaths worldwide in 2018.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nEvents in boldface are ongoing. The following is a list of some major epidemics and pandemics throughout history:\n\n* **COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-present)**\n* Spanish Flu Pandemic (1918-1919)\n* Black Death Pandemic (1346-1353)\n* Plague Pandemic (1665-1666)\n* Asian Flu Pandemic (1957-1958)\n* SARS Outbreak (2002-2004)\n* Russian Flu Pandemic (1889-1890)\n* Hong Kong Flu Pandemic (1968-1969)\n* Swine Flu Pandemic (2009-2010)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* World population\n* Infectious disease\n* Epidemiology\n* Pandemic\n* Epidemic\n* Disease\n* Plague\n* Smallpox\n* Measles\n* Malaria\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\nThis article uses the term \"epidemic\" to refer to a sudden increase in the number of cases of a disease in a specific geographic area, and \"pandemic\" to refer to a widespread outbreak of a disease that affects a large number of people across multiple countries or even continents.\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* World Health Organization: Infectious diseases\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Epidemics and pandemics\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: Epidemics and pandemics\n* World Health Organization: COVID-19 pandemic\n\n**External Links**\n\n* World Health Organization: COVID-19 pandemic\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Epidemics and pandemics\n* National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: Epidemics and pandemics", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_epidemics\" following this outline:\n\n\nMajor epidemics and pandemics\nOngoing epidemics and pandemics are in boldface For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking If the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank For the historical records of major changes in the world population, see world population [3]\n\n\nBy death toll\nOngoing epidemics and pandemics are in boldface For a given epidemic or pandemic, the average of its estimated death toll range is used for ranking If the death toll averages of two or more epidemics or pandemics are equal, then the smaller the range, the higher the rank For the historical records of major changes in the world population, see world population [3]\n\n\nDepopulation of the Americas\nNot included in the above table are many waves of deadly diseases brought by Europeans to the Americas and Caribbean Western Hemisphere populations were ravaged mostly by smallpox, but also typhus, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, mumps, yellow fever, and pertussis The lack of written records in many places and the destruction of many native societies by disease, war, and colonization make estimates uncertain Deaths probably numbered in the tens or perhaps over a hundred million, with perhaps 90% of the population dead in the worst-hit areas Lack of scientific knowledge about microorganisms and lack of surviving medical records for many areas makes attribution of specific numbers to specific diseases uncertain.\n\n\nInfectious diseases with high prevalence\nThere have been various major infectious diseases with high prevalence worldwide, but they are currently not listed in the above table as epidemics/pandemics due to the lack of definite data, such as time span and death toll.\n\n\nChronology\nEvents in boldface are ongoing.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Madame Web by early February Clarkson was confirmed to be directing Madame Web at that time [22]\n\n\nPre-production\nSony Pictures CEO and chairman Tom Rothman said in May 2022 that filming would begin \"in the spring\", [30] while Celeste O'Connor joined the cast [31] This was followed by the castings of Isabela Merced, Tahar Rahim, and Emma Roberts throughout the following month [32] [33] [34] Responding to these castings, Sabina Graves of Gizmodo opined that many of the actresses could be playing \"more recognizable\" characters from the Spider-Man comics, such as the Spider-Women versions of Jessica Drew and Gwen Stacy, in the film as a \"reimagining\" of the Spider-Verse crossover comic book [35] Sweeney and Johnson were preparing for their roles at that time, when filming was scheduled to begin in mid-July [36] [37] [38] Sweeney completed an athletic assessment test and read comics featuring her character, Julia Carpenter, while Johnson underwent training [29] [37] Mike Epps joined the cast in early July [39]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on July 11, 2022, [44] [45] in the Financial District of Boston through July 14, with scenes modeling 2000s New York City, [45] including Chinatown, Manhattan [46] Filming occurred using the working title Claire, [38] with Mauro Fiore serving as cinematographer, after previously doing so for Sony's Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) [1] [47] Shortly after filming started, Adam Scott joined the cast, [48] and the film's release date was delayed to October 6, 2023 [49] In late July, filming occurred in Allston at Kelton Street [46] Zosia Mamet was cast in August [50] Filming that month occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts, [46] while construction of a set in Andover, Massachusetts had also begun to stand in for the 4-Star Diner, a comics location, [46] [51] and took place at baseball fields in West Andover [51] The crew often filmed multiple versions of the same scenes with slightly altered outcomes dependent on Cassie's visions, with Johnson occasionally conferring with Clarkson to deduce which scenes were real and which were set in Cassie's head [10] As a result, filming futuristic scenes significantly increased the production workload [43] Clairvoyance scenes required careful planning from Clarkson, which she called the most challenging in her career; she had prepared multiple call sheets and notes when filming They were often filmed in camera, including the creation of the diopter effect Scenes filmed with Johnson had to occasionally be done separately as she could not see what was occurring in the direction [42]\n\n\nPost-production\nSweeney's role was reported in March 2023 as Julia Carpenter, [61] which was confirmed in May along with Johnson as Cassandra Webb [62] Sweeney's character was ultimately named Julia Cornwall [10] In July, the film's release was moved forward slightly to February 14, 2024 [63] The first trailer, released in November 2023, revealed that Merced, O'Connor, and Rahim were respectively portraying Anya Corazón, Mattie Franklin, [64] and Ezekiel Sims [65] [15] The characters of Julia, Anya, and Mattie were noted for appearing in their Spider-Woman costumes from the comics [64] At that time, the film's final writing credits were also revealed: Sazama and Sharpless received credit for the screenplay alongside the writing team of Claire Parker and Clarkson, while credit for the story was attributed to Sanga, Sazama, and Sharpless, and off-screen additional literary credit is given to Chris Bremner [1] [66] [67] An official premise for the film released then began with the line \"Meanwhile, in another universe...\" This wording had previously been used in a trailer for Sony's animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) that was attached to the end of their SSU film Venom (2018); [40] [68] [69] Clarkson later said the Madame Web character existed in a standalone world [10]\n\n\nMusic\nJohan Söderqvist was revealed in November 2023 as the film's composer, after previously working with Clarkson on Anatomy of a Scandal (2022) [73]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for the film was released on November 15, 2023 While commenting about the trailer, McKinley Franklin at Variety described Madame Web as a suspense thriller [74] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge felt the trailer did not give an indication as to what universe the film was set in or why the film's antagonist Ezekiel Sims wore a suit similar to that of the character Spider-Man, and found it weird to see another Marvel-based project from Sony centered on the Spider-Man lore from the comics without featuring the Spider-Man character [75] Zoe Guy, writing for Vulture, said the trailer provided a lot of details and highlighted its use of \"Bury a Friend\" by Billie Eilish [76] Joshua Rivera of Polygon criticized the trailer for focusing its three-minute runtime on explaining Cassandra Webb's powers and appearing as a \"run-of-the-mill 2000s thriller\" instead of showcasing the \"wildly interesting and truly strange\" Spider-Man–related characters [77] Conversely, Graham Day at The Escapist was excited for the film by the trailer and highlighted Sony's unconventional and eccentric style, which he noted had resulted in commentators making various memes surrounding the film Day compared such moments to similar scenes and responses to Sony's Venom (2018) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films (2002–2007), feeling the stunt work in the trailer was fascinating and similar to that of The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), which he believed was under-appreciated [78]\n\n\nRelease\nMadame Web premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles on February 12,

[98] [99] [100] and the \"worst comic book movie\" yet [101] Some critics compared the film to Sony's Morbius, as both films became satirical \"meme fodder\" and received media attention, [102] with Madame Web being regarded by some commentators as a \"future cult classic\" and a \"camp classic\" [6] [103] [104] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 11% of 260 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.4/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Madame Web's earnest approach to the title character's origin story has a certain appeal, but its predictable plot and uneven execution make for a forgettable superhero adventure.\" [105] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 26 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews [106] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it a 54% overall positive score [93]

referencing the line while presenting at the 96th Academy Awards shortly after the film's release, [116] [104] while Sweeney mocked the film's performance in her opening monologue for the 49th season of Saturday Night Live (2024) [117] Filmmaker Mike Flanagan referenced Nicole Kidman's promotional monologue for AMC Theatres, which had received similar media attention, in his review of the film and used tags criticizing elements of the film, such as the automated dialogue replacement (ADR) used for Rahim's character [118]\n\n\nFuture\nSony had reportedly planned for Madame Web to be the first film in a potential new franchise, but following the film's low opening weekend box office and poor reception, these plans were reportedly abandoned The Hollywood Reporter stated that while Sony was willing to take risks with their superhero films–with Madame Web avoiding the typical superhero genre tropes–the studio also wanted \"home runs\", with executives at Sony said to be in a \"gloomy\" mood after the film's poor performance The report noted that the superhero genre had been in a transition period and that the future reception of their franchise could change depending on whether the next SSU film that was then scheduled for release, Kraven the Hunter, were successful [6] In March 2024, Johnson said she was not probably to make another superhero film after Madame Web, believing that she did not \"make sense in that world\", [119] while Di Bonaventura said in July that he was unsure if the film's characters would return in the SSU again after the film's poor performance

of 2021, and was in talks to star as Madame Web by early February Clarkson was confirmed to be directing Madame Web at that time [22]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAfter their work on the Marvel Comics–based film Morbius (2022), part of Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), Sony Pictures hired Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless in September 2019 to write a script centered on the Marvel character Madame Web [20] Sony's executive vice president Palak Patel was overseeing the project [21] Kerem Sanga had previously written a draft for the film [22] In May 2020, S J Clarkson was hired to develop and direct Sony's first female-centric Marvel film, which was reported to be Madame Web [23] [24] The studio was looking to attach a prominent actress such as Charlize Theron or Amy Adams to the project, before hiring a new writer to further develop the film with her in mind [23] After meeting with several \"A-listers\" for the title role, Sony narrowed their shortlist during December 2021 and January 2022 Dakota Johnson became the frontrunner by the end of 2021, and was in talks to star as Madame Web by early February Clarkson was confirmed to be directing Madame Web at that time [22]\n\n\nPre-production\nSony Pictures CEO and chairman Tom Rothman said in May 2022 that filming would begin \"in the spring\", [30] while Celeste O'Connor joined the cast [31] This was followed by the castings of Isabela Merced, Tahar Rahim, and Emma Roberts throughout the following month [32] [33] [34] Responding to these castings, Sabina Graves of Gizmodo opined that many of the actresses could be playing \"more recognizable\" characters from the Spider-Man comics, such as the Spider-Women versions of Jessica Drew and Gwen Stacy, in the film as a \"reimagining\" of the Spider-Verse crossover comic book [35] Sweeney and Johnson were preparing for their roles at that time, when filming was scheduled to begin in mid-July [36] [37] [38] Sweeney completed an athletic assessment test and read comics featuring her character, Julia Carpenter, while Johnson underwent training [29] [37] Mike Epps joined the cast in early July [39]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on July 11, 2022, [44] [45] in the Financial District of Boston through July 14, with scenes modeling 2000s New York City, [45] including Chinatown, Manhattan [46] Filming occurred using the working title Claire, [38] with Mauro Fiore serving as cinematographer, after previously doing so for Sony's Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) [1] [47] Shortly after filming started, Adam Scott joined the cast, [48] and the film's release date was delayed to October 6, 2023 [49] In late July, filming occurred in Allston at Kelton Street [46] Zosia Mamet was cast in August [50] Filming that month occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts, [46] while construction of a set in Andover, Massachusetts had also begun to stand in for the 4-Star Diner, a comics location, [46] [51] and took place at baseball fields in West Andover [51] The crew often filmed multiple versions of the same scenes with slightly altered outcomes dependent on Cassie's visions, with Johnson occasionally conferring with Clarkson to deduce which scenes were real and which were set in Cassie's head [10] As a result, filming futuristic scenes significantly increased the production workload [43] Clairvoyance scenes required careful planning from Clarkson, which she called the most challenging in her career; she had prepared multiple call sheets and notes when filming They were often filmed in camera, including the creation of the diopter effect Scenes filmed with Johnson had to occasionally be done separately as she could not see what was occurring in the direction [42]\n\n\nPost-production\nSweeney's role was reported in March 2023 as Julia Carpenter, [61] which was confirmed in May along with Johnson as Cassandra Webb [62] Sweeney's character was ultimately named Julia Cornwall [10] In July, the film's release was moved forward slightly to February 14, 2024 [63] The first trailer, released in November 2023, revealed that Merced, O'Connor, and Rahim were respectively portraying Anya Corazón, Mattie Franklin, [64] and Ezekiel Sims [65] [15] The characters of Julia, Anya, and Mattie were noted for appearing in their Spider-Woman costumes from the comics [64] At that time, the film's final writing credits were also revealed: Sazama and Sharpless received credit for the screenplay alongside the writing team of Claire Parker and Clarkson, while credit for the story was attributed to Sanga, Sazama, and Sharpless, and off-screen additional literary credit is given to Chris Bremner [1] [66] [67] An official premise for the film released then began with the line \"Meanwhile, in another universe...\" This wording had previously been used in a trailer for Sony's animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) that was attached to the end of their SSU film Venom (2018); [40] [68] [69] Clarkson later said the Madame Web character existed in a standalone world [10]\n\n\nMusic\nJohan Söderqvist was revealed in November 2023 as the film's composer, after previously working with Clarkson on Anatomy of a Scandal (2022) [73]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for the film was released on November 15, 2023 While commenting about the trailer, McKinley Franklin at Variety described Madame Web as a suspense thriller [74] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge felt the trailer did not give an indication as to what universe the film was set in or why the film's antagonist Ezekiel Sims wore a suit similar to that of the character Spider-Man, and found it weird to see another Marvel-based project from Sony centered on the Spider-Man lore from the comics without featuring the Spider-Man character [75] Zoe Guy, writing for Vulture, said the trailer provided a lot of details and highlighted its use of \"Bury a Friend\" by Billie Eilish [76] Joshua Rivera of Polygon criticized the trailer for focusing its three-minute runtime on explaining Cassandra Webb's powers and appearing as a \"run-of-the-mill 2000s thriller\" instead of showcasing the \"wildly interesting and truly strange\" Spider-Man–related characters [77] Conversely, Graham Day at The Escapist was excited for the film by the trailer and highlighted Sony's unconventional and eccentric style, which he noted had resulted in commentators making various memes surrounding the film Day compared such moments to similar scenes and responses to Sony's Venom (2018) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films (2002–2007), feeling the stunt work in the trailer was fascinating and similar to that of The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), which he believed was under-appreciated [78]\n\n\nRelease\nMadame Web premiered at the Regency Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles on February 12, 2024, [85] and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, [63] in IMAX, 4DX, and ScreenX [54] [86] It was previously

theatrical and home media windows Crave signed for the \"pay-one\" window streaming rights, which included Madame Web [88] Madame Web was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital download on March 15, 2024, [89] and was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and Blu-ray on April 30, with SteelBook packaging featuring the suit worn by Johnson's Webb in the film [90] Madame Web was made available for streaming on Netflix in the United States on May 14, 2024, as part of a deal made by Sony Pictures and Netflix and Disney+ in the US [91] According to Nielsen Media Research, which measures the viewership of media on streaming services, Madame Web was the most-watched film on streaming upon its debut for the week of May 13 – 19, 2024, with a total of 1.16 billion minutes watched [92]\n\n\nReception\nMadame Web grossed $43.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $56.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $100.5 million [8] [2]\n\n\nBox office\nMadame Web grossed $43.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $56.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $100.5 million [8] [2]\n\n\nCritical response\nMadame Web received negative reviews from critics, [96] [97] who panned it as an \"embarrassing mess\", [98] [99] [100] and the \"worst comic book movie\" yet [101] Some critics compared the film to Sony's Morbius, as both films became satirical \"meme fodder\" and received media attention, [102] with Madame Web being regarded by some commentators as a \"future cult classic\" and a \"camp classic\" [6] [103] [104] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 11% of 260 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.4/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Madame Web's earnest approach to the title character's origin story has a certain appeal, but its predictable plot and uneven execution make for a forgettable superhero adventure.\" [105] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 26 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews [106] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it a 54% overall positive score [93] [5]\n\n\nOther responses\nThe film was met with particular mockery directed toward the dialogue from its trailer that was not included in the final film, [115] [83] with comedian John Mulaney referencing the line while presenting at the 96th Academy Awards shortly after the film's release, [116] [104] while Sweeney mocked the film's performance in her opening monologue for the 49th season of Saturday Night Live (2024) [117] Filmmaker Mike Flanagan referenced Nicole Kidman's promotional monologue for AMC Theatres, which had received similar media attention, in his review of the film and used tags criticizing elements of the film, such as the automated dialogue replacement (ADR) used for Rahim's character [118]\n\n\nFuture\nSony had reportedly planned for Madame Web to be the first film in a potential new franchise, but following the film's low opening weekend box office and poor reception, these plans were reportedly abandoned The Hollywood Reporter stated that while Sony was willing to take risks with their superhero films–with Madame Web avoiding the typical superhero genre tropes–the studio also wanted \"home runs\", with executives at Sony said to be in a \"gloomy\" mood after the film's poor performance The report noted that the superhero genre had been in a transition period and that the future reception of their franchise could change depending on whether the next SSU film that was then scheduled for release, Kraven the Hunter, were successful [6] In March 2024, Johnson said she was not probably to make another superhero film after Madame Web, believing that she did not \"make sense in that world\", [119] while Di Bonaventura said in July that he was unsure if the film's characters would return in the SSU again after the film's poor performance [121]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[19] Her younger brother, Sami, is a furniture designer [9]\n\n\nCareer\nHayek's first screen appearance was in the television series in Un Nuevo Amanecer (1988), which earned her the TVyNovelas Award

Teresa (1989–1991), a successful Mexican telenovela that made her a star in Mexico [23] The series ran for two years and 125 episodes, and earned her the 1990 TVyNovelas Award for Best Female Revelation.\n\n\nHollywood breakthrough (1995–2001)\nRobert Rodriguez and his co-producer and then-wife, Elizabeth Avellan, [24] cast Hayek in the starring role of the self-confident and feisty Carolina, opposite Antonio Banderas, in Desperado (1995), widely considered her breakout film [29] [10] [24] Describing the film's process as \"grueling\", [25] Hayek had to audition several times for Rodriguez before landing the part and a love scene in the script proved particularly difficult for her to film, because she did not want to be nude on camera She once remarked: \"It took eight hours  [to film] instead of an hour\" [25] Budgeted at $7 million, Desperado was a commercial success, grossing $25.4 million in the United States [30] She followed it with a brief role as a vampire queen in

role several years prior to commencing production for the film, having \"been fascinated by Kahlo's work from the time she was 13 or 14\", although not immediately a fan: \"At that age I did not like her work  [...] I found it ugly and grotesque But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work There was a lot of passion and depth Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor I think what draws me to her is what  [husband] Diego saw in her She was a fighter Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego's infidelities But she wasn't crushed by anything\" [42] She was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and, after his death, administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had \"willed  [...] to the Mexican people\", bequeathing the trust to Olmedo [43] Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from Kahlo and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998 Upon its release, Frida was a critical darling and an arthouse success In his review for the film, David Denby of The New Yorker concluded: \"Smart, willful, and perverse, this Frida is nobody's servant, and the tiny Hayek plays her with head held high\" Her portrayal of Kahlo made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and earned her Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and British Academy Film Award nominations for Best Actress.\n\n\nContinued commercial success (2010–2017)\nIn 2010, Hayek played a fashion designer and the wife of a Hollywood talent agent (Adam Sandler) in the comedy Grown Ups which, despite a

appeared in the drama Follow Me Home and the cop comedy Fled.\n\n\nWorldwide recognition (2002–2009)\nIn Julie Taymor's biographical film Frida (2002), Hayek served as a producer and starred as surrealist painter Frida Kahlo She became interested in the role several years prior to commencing production for the film, having \"been fascinated by Kahlo's work from the time she was 13 or 14\", although not immediately a fan: \"At that age I did not like her work  [...] I found it ugly and grotesque But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work There was a lot of passion and depth Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor I think what draws me to her is what  [husband] Diego saw in her She was a fighter Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego's infidelities But she wasn't crushed by anything\" [42] She was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and, after his death, administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had \"willed  [...] to the Mexican people\", bequeathing the trust to Olmedo [43] Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from Kahlo and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998 Upon its release, Frida was a critical darling and an arthouse success In his review for the film, David Denby of The New Yorker concluded: \"Smart, willful, and perverse, this Frida is nobody's servant, and the tiny Hayek plays her with head held high\" Her portrayal of Kahlo made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and earned her Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and British Academy Film Award nominations for Best Actress.\n\n\nContinued commercial success (2010–2017)\nIn 2010, Hayek played a fashion designer and the wife of a Hollywood talent agent (Adam Sandler) in the comedy Grown Ups which, despite a negative critical reception, made $271.4 million globally [64] She is the voice of Kitty Softpaws, a street-savvy Tuxedo cat, alongside Antonio Banderas in Puss in Boots (2011) [65] A spin-off of the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots received positive reviews from critics, grossed $554.9 million at the box office, [66] and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 84th Academy Awards In 2011, she also obtained Hispanic roles in two international productions —a dancer in the French drama Americano and the wife of a former advertising executive in the Spanish As Luck Would Have It— which earned her nominations for the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actress and the Goya Award for Best Actress, respectively.\n\n\nRecent roles (2018–present)\nHayek was cast as Eva Torres, a high-frequency trading executive, alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgård, in Kim Nguyen's tech drama The Hummingbird Project (2018), and as Nancy Teagarten, one half of a couple experiencing a series of financial crises, with Alec Baldwin, in Fred Wolf's comedy Drunk Parents (2019) In 2020, Hayek appeared as a cosmetics mogul in Miguel Arteta's comedy Like a Boss, with Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish, and the alternative wife of a man in Sally Potter’s drama The Roads Not Taken, with Javier Bardem and Elle Fanning.\n\n\nOther ventures\nHayek's charitable work includes increasing awareness on violence against women and discrimination against immigrants [99] On July 19, 2005, Hayek testified before the U.S Senate Committee on the Judiciary supporting reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act [100] In February 2006, she donated $25,000 to a Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, shelter for battered women and another $50,000 to Monterrey based anti-domestic violence groups [101] She is a board member of V-Day, the charity founded by playwright Eve Ensler While Hayek previously stated that she is not a feminist, [102] she later revised her stance, stating: \"I am a feminist because a lot of amazing women have made me who I am today  [...] But – it should not be just because I am a woman\" [103]\n\n\nAdvocacy\nHayek's charitable work includes increasing awareness on violence against women and discrimination against immigrants [99] On July 19, 2005, Hayek testified before the U.S

[103]\n\n\nEndorsements\nHayek was a spokeswoman for Revlon in 1998 and has been a spokeswoman for Avon cosmetics since February 2004 [112] She modeled for Chopard in 2001, was featured in a series of Spanish language commercials for Lincoln cars in 2002, [113] and in Campari ads, photographed by Mario Testino, in 2006 [114] On April 3, 2009, she helped introduce La Doña, a watch by Cartier inspired by fellow Mexican actress María Félix [115]\n\n\nPublic image\nEarly in her career, Hayek came to be regarded as a sex symbol, and most of her early films, it has been noted, such as the action-oriented Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Fled, \"predominantly featured her in racy sex symbol type of roles\" and ultimately made Hayek a familiar face with mainstream audiences [124] Various media publications have cited her as one of Hollywood's most beautiful actresses People named her one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 1996, 2003 and 2008, [125] Maxim ranked her 34th and 90th on their Hot 100 list in 2005 and 2007, respectively, [125] and FHM included her on their 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2005 and 2006 [125] A July 2007 poll by E-Poll Market Research found Hayek to be the \"sexiest celebrity\" among a group of 3,000 public figures, with 65 percent of respondents using the term \"sexy\" to describe her [126] The Armani dress Hayek wore to the 1997 Academy Awards was voted by E! Entertainment as one of the five most memorable in Oscar history [125]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHayek is a naturalized United States citizen [135] [136] She has studied at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment [137] and practices yoga [138] Hayek, who was raised Catholic, stated in a 2007 interview that she was no longer devout and did not believe in the Church, in part because she disagreed with practices such as its campaign against condoms in Africa, where she said AIDS and overpopulation were rampant, though she clarified that she still believed in Jesus Christ and God [139]\n\n\nFilmography and accolades\nHayek's films that have earned the most at the box office, as of 2022 [update], include: [145]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Austria", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe native name for Austria, Österreich, derives from the Old High German Ostarrîchi, which meant \"eastern realm\" and which first appeared in the \"Ostarrîchi document\" of 996 [25] [26] This word is probably a translation of Medieval Latin Marchia orientalis into a local (Bavarian) dialect.\n\n\nHistory\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC [28] The city of Hallstatt, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe [29]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC [28] The city of Hallstatt, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe [29]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was first invaded by the Germanic Rugii which made this region part of their \"Rugiland\" [34] In 487, most of modern Austria was conquered by Odoacer, a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube, which incorporated most of today's Austria in his Kingdom of Italy By 493, it was conquered by the Germanic Ostrogoths which created their own kingdom, the Ostrogothic Kingdom [35] Following the Kingdom's fall the area was invaded by the Alemanni, Baiuvarii, Slavs, and Avars [36] [37]\n\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nDuring the long reign of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor following the successful defence of Vienna against the Turks in 1683, under the command of the King of Poland John III Sobieski, [46] the Great Turkish War resulted in most of Hungary being controlled by Austria This arrangement was formalized in the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.\n\n\n19th century\nAustria later became engaged in a war with Revolutionary France, which was highly unsuccessful in the beginning, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806 Two years earlier, [47] the Empire of Austria was founded From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties [48] In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nAs the Second Constitutional Era began in the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary took the opportunity to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 [58] The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip [59] was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I [60]\n\n\nInterwar period and World War II\nAfter the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency In the autumn of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations [74] The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations In 1925, the Austrian schilling was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1 Later, it was nicknamed the \"Alpine dollar\" due to its stability From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Tuesday.\n\n\nNazi rule\nOn 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over the government, while German troops occupied the country, which prevented Schuschnigg's referendum from taking place [83] On 13 March 1938, the Anschluss (lit. 'joining'  or 'connection') of Austria was officially declared Two days later, Austrian-born Adolf Hitler announced what he called the \"reunification\" of his home country with the \"rest of the German Reich\" on Vienna's Heldenplatz He established a referendum which confirmed the union with Germany in April 1938.\n\n\nAllied occupation\nVienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the Soviet Vienna offensive, just before the total collapse of the Third Reich The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed \"Alpine Fortress Operation\" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the Eastern Alps However, it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.\n\n\nIndependence\nOn 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the Cold War Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian State Treaty with the allies of World War II On 26 October 1955, all occupation troops had left and Austria declared its permanent neutrality by an act of parliament [113] This day is now Austria's National Day, a public holiday [114]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna, the country's capital and most populous city Austria became a federal, representative democratic republic through the Federal Constitutional Law of 1920 The political system of the Second Republic with its nine federal states is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was re-enacted on 1 May 1945 [121]\n\n\nSince 2006\nAfter general elections held in October 2006, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) emerged as the strongest party, and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling [125] [126] Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties In January 2007 the People's Party and SPÖ formed a grand coalition with the social democrat Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe 1955 Austrian State Treaty ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality.\" The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory.\" Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (Austrian German: Bundesheer) mainly relies on conscription [143] All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory military service, followed by an eight-year reserve obligation Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service [21] Conscientious objection is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months civilian service instead Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAustria is a federal republic consisting of nine federal states (Austrian German: Bundesländer) [21] The federal states are sub-divided into districts (Bezirke) and statutory cities (Statutarstädte) Districts are subdivided into municipalities (Gemeinden) Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a federal state The European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation calls the federal states provinces.\n\n\nGeography\nAustria is a largely mountainous country because of its location in the Alps [149] The Central Eastern Alps, Northern Limestone Alps, and Southern Limestone Alps are all partly in Austria Of the total area of Austria (83,871 km2 or 32,383 sq mi), only about a quarter can be considered low-lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 metres (1,640 ft) The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\n\nClimate\nThe greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate climate zone, where humid westerly winds predominate With nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the Alps, the alpine climate is predominant In the east—in the Pannonian Plain and along the Danube valley—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 to 0 °C), summer temperatures can be relatively high, [156] with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of 40.5 °C (105 °F) in August 2013 [157]\n\n\nEconomy\nAustria consistently ranks high in terms of GDP per capita, [162] due to its highly industrialised economy, and well-developed social market economy Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies Labour movements are particularly influential, exercising a large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the economy of Austria.\n\n\nInfrastructure and natural resources\nIn 1972 the country began construction of a nuclear power plant to produce electricity at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament However, in 1978 a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for, [174] and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity although the nuclear power plant had already finished.\n\n\nDemographics\nAustria's population was estimated to be 9,170,647 as of April 2024 by Statistik Austria [178] The population of the capital, Vienna, exceeds 2 million, representing about a quarter of the country's population [178] It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.\n\n\nLargest cities\nThe official language of Austria has been German since 1920, based on article 8 of its constitution the same year [188] Austrian German or Austrian (a variety of Standard High German) is usually written in Austria and Italian South Tyrol, it has been standardized in Austria since the Ministry of Education, Science and Research published the Österreichisches Wörterbuch in 1951, though used primarily just in education, publications, announcements, and websites However, the de facto common spoken languages of Austria are not Austrian German taught in schools but Bavarian and Alemannic dialects: Two Upper German local languages or collection of dialects with varying degrees of difficulty being understood by each other as well as by speakers of non-Austrian German dialects Taken as a collective whole, German languages or dialects are thus spoken natively by 88.6% of the population, which includes the 2.5% German-born citizens who reside in Austria, followed by Turkish (2.28%), Serbian (2.21%), Croatian (1.63%), English (0.73%), Hungarian (0.51%), Bosnian (0.43%), Polish (0.35%), Albanian (0.35%), Slovenian (0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%), and Romanian (0.21%) [189]\n\n\nLanguage\nThe official language of Austria has been German since 1920, based on article 8 of its constitution the same year [188] Austrian

(0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%), and Romanian (0.21%) [189]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nHistorically, before 1945, Austrians were regarded as ethnic Germans and viewed themselves as such, although this national identity was challenged by Austrian nationalism in the decades after the end of World War I and even more so after World War II [190] [191] [192] Austria was part of East Francia (Kingdom of Germany) and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation from 996 to 1806 and was part of the German Confederation, a loose confederation of 39 predominantly German-speaking sovereign states, from 1815 until the Austro-Prussian war in 1866, which resulted in the dissolution of the German Confederation and the creation of the North German Confederation led by Prussia and excluding Austria In 1871, Germany was founded as a nation-state, Austria was not a part of it After World War I and the breakup of the Austrian monarchy, politicians of the new republic declared its name to be \"Deutschösterreich\" (Republic of German-Austria) and that it was part of the German Republic A unification of the two countries was forbidden by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious Allies of World War I upon the vanquished nation, to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive German state In 1938, Austria became part of Nazi Germany After the events of World War II and Nazism, Austria declared independence from Germany on 27 April 1945 and Austrian national identity has been popular in Austria since then, and nowadays Austrians do not consider themselves as Germans but as ethnic Austrians [193]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Austria (2021) [203]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Austria is entrusted partly to the Austrian federal states and partly to the national government School attendance is compulsory for nine years, i.e usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n\nHealth\nEven though Austria has a 0.9 health index and a life expectancy of 81 years, [214] the country still faces numerous problems when it comes to health, one example being that 2 in 5 Austrians have a chronic condition Cancer is a big problem in the country, as about 21,500 people died of this condition in 2019, having lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer deaths, probably linked to several risk factors in the country's population, as it is estimated that 40% of deaths in the country are caused by smoking, dietary risks, alcohol, low physical activity, and air pollution.\nOne of the most costly health services in the EU is located in Austria In 2019, health spending per capita ranked third in the EU Health-related out-of-pocket expenditures are higher than the EU average [215]\n\n\nMedical personnel\nWith 5.2 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, Austria has among the highest physician density in OECD countries Overall, the country has 271 hospitals with a total of 45,596 physicians (data from 2017), about 54% of which work (also or primarily) in hospitals Although Austria has the second highest physician rate in the EU, a large share of physicians is tropical to retirement age (55 years and older), and may thus be at a higher risk of developing severe conditions in a specimen of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nCulture\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music [217] Austria was the birthplace of many famous composers such as Joseph Haydn, [218] Michael Haydn, [219] Franz Liszt, [220] Franz Schubert, [221] Anton Bruckner, [222] Johann Strauss Sr., and Johann Strauss Jr., as well as members of the Second Viennese School such as Arnold Schoenberg, [223] Anton Webern, [224] and Alban Berg Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart [225] was born in Salzburg, then an independent Church Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna

international reputation Among them are Ludwig Boltzmann, Ernst Mach, Victor Franz Hess, and Christian Doppler, prominent scientists in the 19th century In the 20th century, contributions by Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrödinger, and Wolfgang Pauli to nuclear research and quantum mechanics were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s Prominent present-day quantum physicists are Anton Zeilinger and Peter Zoller renown for important developments in quantum optics and quantum information.\n\n\nFood and beverages\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofküche\") delivered over centuries It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" tradition of bakeries, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"Apfelstrudel\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"Millirahmstrudel\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\n\nSports\nDue to the mountainous terrain, alpine skiing is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country [234] Similar sports such as snowboarding or ski-jumping are also widely popular Austrian athletes such as Annemarie Moser-Pröll, Franz Klammer, Hermann Maier, Toni Sailer, Benjamin Raich, Marlies Schild, and Marcel Hirscher are widely regarded as some of the greatest alpine skiers of all time, Armin Kogler, Andreas Felder, Ernst Vettori, Andreas Goldberger, Andreas Widhölzl, Thomas Morgenstern, and Gregor Schlierenzauer as some of the greatest ski jumpers of all time Bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton are also popular events with a permanent track located in Igls, which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck The first Winter Youth Olympics in 2012 were held in Innsbruck as well [235]\n\n\nSee

known as the Republic of Austria, is a landlocked country located in Central Europe. It is bordered by eight countries: Germany to the northwest, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the northeast, Hungary and Slovenia to the east, Italy to the south, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west, and Switzerland to the northwest. Austria has a population of approximately 9 million people and a capital city of Vienna.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe native name for Austria, Österreich, derives from the Old High German Ostarrîchi, which meant \"eastern realm\" and which first appeared in the \"Ostarrîchi document\" of 996. This word is probably a translation of Medieval Latin Marchia orientalis into a local (Bavarian) dialect.\n\n**History**\n\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC. The city of Hallstatt, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was first invaded by the Germanic Rugii, which made this region part of their \"Rugiland.\" In 487, most of modern Austria was conquered by Odoacer, a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube, which incorporated most of today's Austria in his Kingdom of Italy.

Following the Kingdom's fall, the area was invaded by the Alemanni, Baiuvarii, Slavs, and Avars.\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC.

This arrangement was formalized in the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.\n\n**19th century**\n\nAustria later became engaged in a war with Revolutionary France, which was highly unsuccessful in the beginning, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Two years earlier, the Empire of Austria was founded. From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties. In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n**Early 20th century**\n\nAs the Second Constitutional Era began in the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary took the opportunity to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.\n\n**Interwar period and World War II**\n\nAfter the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency. In the autumn of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations. The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilize the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the Austrian schilling was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the \"Alpine dollar\" due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929, the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Tuesday.\n\n**Nazi rule**\n\nOn 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over the government, while German troops occupied the country, which prevented Schuschnigg's referendum from taking place. On 13 March 1938, the Anschluss (lit. \"joining\" or \"connection\") of Austria was officially declared. Two days later, Austrian-born Adolf Hitler announced what he called the \"reunification\" of his home country with the \"rest of the German Reich\" on Vienna's Heldenplatz. He established a referendum which confirmed the union with Germany in April 1938.\n\n**Allied occupation**\n\nVienna fell on 13 April 1945, during the Soviet Vienna offensive, just before the total collapse of the Third Reich. The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed \"Alpine Fortress Operation\" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the Eastern Alps. However, it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.\n\n**Independence**\n\nOn 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the Cold War, Austria regained full independence by concluding the Austrian State Treaty with the allies of World War II. On 26 October 1955, all occupation troops had left and Austria declared its permanent neutrality by an act of parliament. This day is now Austria's National Day, a public holiday.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nThe Parliament of Austria is located in Vienna, the country's capital and most populous city. Austria became a federal, representative democratic republic through the Federal Constitutional Law of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its nine federal states is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was re-enacted on 1 May 1945.\n\n**Since 2006**\n\nAfter general elections held in October 2006, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) emerged as the strongest party, and the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling. Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007, the People's Party and SPÖ formed a grand coalition with the social democrat Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThe 1955 Austrian State Treaty ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognized Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the Federal Assembly passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality.\" The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory.\" Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces (Austrian German: Bundesheer) mainly relies on conscription. All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory military service, followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service. Conscientious objection is legally acceptable, and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalized nine months civilian service instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nAustria is a federal republic consisting of nine federal states (Austrian German: Bundesländer). The federal states are subdivided into districts (Bezirke) and statutory cities (Statutarstädte). Districts are subdivided into municipalities (Gemeinden). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. Vienna is unique in that it is both a city and a federal state. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Translation calls the federal states provinces.\n\n**Geography**\n\nAustria is a largely mountainous country because of its location in the Alps. The Central Eastern Alps, Northern Limestone Alps, and Southern Limestone Alps are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria (83,871 km² or 32,383 sq mi), only about a quarter can be considered low-lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 meters (1,640 ft). The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate climate zone, where humid westerly winds predominate. With nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the Alps, the alpine climate is predominant. In the east—in the Pannonian Plain and along the Danube valley—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 to 0 °C), summer temperatures can be relatively high, with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of 40.5 °C (105 °F) in August 2013.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAustria consistently ranks high in terms of GDP per capita, due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed social market economy. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalized; in recent years, however, privatization has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly influential, exercising a large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the economy of Austria.\n\n**Infrastructure and natural resources**\n\nIn 1972, the country began construction of a nuclear power plant to produce electricity at Zwentendorf on the River Danube, following a unanimous vote in parliament. However, in 1978, a referendum voted approximately 50.5% against nuclear power, 49.5% for, and parliament subsequently unanimously passed a law forbidding the use of nuclear power to generate electricity, although the nuclear power plant had already finished.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAustria's population was estimated to be 9,170,647 as of April 2024 by Statistik Austria. The population of the capital, Vienna, exceeds 2 million, representing about a quarter of the country's population. It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.\n\n**Largest cities**\n\nThe official language of Austria has been German since 1920, based on article 8 of its constitution the same year. Austrian German or Austrian (a variety of Standard High German) is usually written in Austria and Italian South Tyrol, it has been standardized in Austria since the Ministry of Education, Science and Research published the Österreichisches Wörterbuch in 1951, though used primarily just in education, publications, announcements, and websites. However, the de facto common spoken languages of Austria are not Austrian German taught in schools but Bavarian and Alemannic dialects: Two Upper German local languages or collection of dialects with varying degrees of difficulty being understood by each other as well as by speakers of non-Austrian German dialects. Taken as a collective whole, German languages or dialects are thus spoken natively by 88.6% of the population, which includes the 2.5% German-born citizens who reside in Austria, followed by Turkish (2.28%), Serbian (2.21%), Croatian (1.63%), English (0.73%), Hungarian (0.51%), Bosnian (0.43%), Polish (0.35%), Albanian (0.35%), Slovenian (0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%), and Romanian (0.21%).\n\n**Language**\n\nThe official language of Austria has been German since 1920, based on article 8 of its constitution the same year.

Austria was part of East Francia (Kingdom of Germany) and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation from 996 to 1806 and was part of the German Confederation, a loose confederation of 39 predominantly German-speaking sovereign states, from 1815 until the Austro-Prussian war in 1866, which resulted in the dissolution of the German Confederation and the creation of the North German Confederation led by Prussia and excluding Austria. In 1871, Germany was founded as a nation-state, Austria was not a part of it. After World War I and the breakup of the Austrian monarchy, politicians of the new republic declared its name to be \"Deutschösterreich\" (Republic of German-Austria) and that it was part of the German Republic. A unification of the two countries was forbidden by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious Allies of World War I upon the vanquished nation, to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive German state. In 1938, Austria became part of Nazi Germany. After the events of World War II and Nazism, Austria declared independence from Germany on 27 April 1945 and Austrian national identity has been popular in Austria since then, and nowadays Austrians do not consider themselves as Germans but as ethnic Austrians.\n\n**Religion**\n\nReligion in Austria is predominantly Christianity. According to a 2021 survey, about 67% of the population identify as Roman Catholic, 9% as Protestant, 1% as Orthodox, and 2% as other Christian denominations. About 8% do not identify with any religion, and 13% do not answer. Other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism, make up less than 1% of the population.\n\n**Education**\n\nEducation in Austria is entrusted partly to the Austrian federal states and partly to the national government. School attendance is compulsory for nine years, i.e., usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n**Health**\n\nEven though Austria has a 0.9 health index and a life expectancy of 81 years, the country still faces numerous problems when it comes to health. One example is that 2 in 5 Austrians have a chronic condition. Cancer is a big problem in the country, as about 21,500 people died of this condition in 2019, having lung cancer as the primary cause of cancer deaths, probably linked to several risk factors in the country's population, as it is estimated that 40% of deaths in the country are caused by smoking, dietary risks, alcohol, low physical activity, and air pollution. One of the most costly health services in the EU is located in Austria. In 2019, health spending per capita ranked third in the EU. Health-related out-of-pocket expenditures are higher than the EU average.\n\n**Medical personnel**\n\nWith 5.2 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, Austria has among the highest physician density in OECD countries. Overall, the country has 271 hospitals with a total of 45,596 physicians (data from 2017), about 54% of which work (also or primarily) in hospitals. Although Austria has the second-highest physician rate in the EU, a large share of physicians is tropical to retirement age (55 years and older), and may thus be at a higher risk of developing severe conditions in a specimen of COVID-19 infection.\n\n**Culture**\n\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many famous composers such as Joseph Haydn, Michael Haydn, Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, Johann Strauss Sr., and Johann Strauss Jr., as well as members of the Second Viennese School such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Alban Berg. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, then an independent Church Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\n**Music**\n\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg, then an independent Church Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\n**Science and philosophy**\n\nAustria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are Ludwig Boltzmann, Ernst Mach, Victor Franz Hess, and Christian Doppler, prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrödinger, and Wolfgang Pauli to nuclear research and quantum mechanics were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. Prominent present-day quantum physicists are Anton Zeilinger and Peter Zoller, renowned for important developments in quantum optics and quantum information.\n\n**Food and beverages**\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofküche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" tradition of bakeries, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"Apfelstrudel\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"Millirahmstrudel\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\n**Sports**\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain, alpine skiing is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.

High German Ostarrîchi, which meant \"eastern realm\" and which first appeared in the \"Ostarrîchi document\" of 996 [25] [26] This word is probably a translation of Medieval Latin Marchia orientalis into a local (Bavarian) dialect.\n\n\nHistory\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC [28] The city of Hallstatt, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe [29]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe area that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various Celtic tribes, having been the core of the Hallstatt culture by the 6th century BC [28] The city of Hallstatt, in fact, has the oldest archaeological evidence of the Celts in Europe [29]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was first invaded by the Germanic Rugii which made this region part of their \"Rugiland\" [34] In 487, most of modern Austria was conquered by Odoacer, a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube, which incorporated most of today's Austria in his Kingdom of Italy By 493, it was conquered by the Germanic Ostrogoths which created their own kingdom, the Ostrogothic Kingdom [35] Following the Kingdom's fall the area was invaded by the Alemanni, Baiuvarii, Slavs, and Avars [36] [37]\n\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nDuring the long reign of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor following the successful defence of Vienna against the Turks in 1683, under the command of the King of Poland John III Sobieski, [46] the Great Turkish War resulted in most of Hungary being controlled by Austria This arrangement was formalized in the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699.\n\n\n19th century\nAustria later became engaged in a war with Revolutionary France, which was highly unsuccessful in the beginning, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806 Two years earlier, [47] the Empire of Austria was founded From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties [48] In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nAs the Second Constitutional Era began in the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary took the opportunity to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908 [58] The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip [59] was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I [60]\n\n\nInterwar period and World War II\nAfter the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency In the autumn of 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the League of Nations [74] The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations In 1925, the Austrian schilling was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1 Later, it was nicknamed the \"Alpine dollar\" due to its stability From 1925 to 1929 the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after Black Tuesday.\n\n\nNazi rule\nOn 12 March 1938, Austrian Nazis took over the

power\" [91]\n\n\nArtistry\nOkonma's music has been described as alternative hip hop, [95] [96] hip hop, [97] neo soul, [95] West Coast hip hop, [98] jazz rap, [95] and hardcore hip hop, while his early music has been described as horrorcore [97] [99] When Okonma emerged on the music scene as a \"strange figure\" of the Internet and one of the leaders of the music collective Odd Future, his musical productions instinctively became noted for resembling those of Pharrell Williams and his works in N.E.R.D and The Neptunes during the 2000s, [100] [101] which Okonma has referenced as his greatest inspirations and references [102] The horrorcore-based aesthetics and transgressive lyrical content of his debut and second albums Bastard and Goblin were influenced by Eminem, especially his album Relapse (2009), which according to Okonma, is one of his favorites [103] [104] [non-primary source needed] When asked about the reason for his offensive content in his lyrics, Okonma responded that \"they are not offensive\" and that \"I just like to piss off old white dudes.\" [105] The \"nihilistic\" and dark aesthetic of his early work was heavily criticized in online music communities

relationships or experiencing same-sex attractions [130] [131] [132] He described himself in a 2015 Rolling Stone interview as \"gay as fuck\" and said \"My friends are so used to me being gay They don't even care.\" [133] In 2017, during an interview with Noisey, Okonma said that by age 15 he already had a boyfriend [134] In a 2018 interview with Fantastic Man, while discussing the Flower Boy lyric \"I been kissing white boys since 2004\" and the public response to it, Okonma said \"It's still such a grey area with people, which is cool with me Even though I'm considered loud and out there, I'm private, which is a weird dichotomy.\" [133] Igor follows what many interpreted to be a romantic relationship between Okonma and a closeted bisexual man, [135] [136] [137] while the song \"Wilshire\" on Call Me If You Get Lost has the lyric \"I could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in/Men or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em\" The song \"Sorry Not Sorry\" from the deluxe version of the album includes the lyric \"Sorry to the guys I had to hide/Sorry to the girls I had to lie to\", referring to his hiding male lovers from the public

apology in his song \"Manifesto\" in his studio album Call Me If You Get Lost [158] [159] He had made similar offensive comments about Dakota Fanning, Miley Cyrus, and Victoria Justice, which he hasn't apologized for [160] Tyler Aquilina of Entertainment Weekly wrote of the controversy, \"Tyler was known as a provocateur at that point in his career, and was frequently criticized for what many observers called homophobic and misogynistic lyrics, including depictions of violence against women\" [161]\n\n\nFeuds\nOn August 31, 2018, Eminem's single \"Fall\" called Okonma a \"faggot\" and claimed Okonma explored sexuality in his music for more attention [162] Eminem also attacked Okonma for being critical of his single \"Walk On Water\" and Shady XV (2014) [163] After receiving backlash for his lyrics, [164] Eminem responded in an interview with Sway, saying, \"I think the word that I called him was one of the things where I felt like this might be too far In my quest to hurt him, I realized I was hurting a lot of other people It was one of the things that I kept going back to Not feeling right with this\" In an interview with The Guardian, Okonma responded, saying, \" [The \"Fall\" line] was okay Did you ever hear me publicly say anything about that?

[16]\n\n\nChildhood\nElizabeth Short [b] was born on July 29, 1924, in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, the third of five daughters of Cleo Alvin Short Jr (October 18, 1885 – January 19, 1967) and his wife, Phoebe May Sawyer (July 2, 1897 – March 1, 1992) [8] [9] Her sisters were Virginia May West (born 1920), Dorothea Schloesser (born 1922), Elnora Chalmers (born 1925), and Muriel (born 1929) [10] [11] Her father, Cleo Alvin, was a United States Navy sailor who was born in 1885 in Gloucester to Cleo Alvin Short Sr and Alice Ada Billups [12] Her mother, Phoebe Mae, was a housewife who was born in 1897 in Milbridge, Maine, to Charles Turner Sawyer and Ella Nora Brown [13] The Shorts were married in Portland, Cumberland, in 1918 [12] The Short family briefly relocated to Portland, Maine, in 1927, [14] before settling in Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, that same year [15] Short's father built miniature golf courses until he lost most of his savings in the 1929 stock market crash [9] \nIn 1930, his car was found abandoned on the Charlestown Bridge, [16] and it was assumed that he had jumped into the Charles River [16]\n\n\nRelocation to California\nIn late 1942, Short's mother received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California [19] In December, at age 18, Short relocated to Vallejo, California, to live with her father, whom she had not seen since age 6 [20] At the time he was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943 [21]\n\n\nMurder\nOn January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert \"Red\" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating [31] Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon [31] By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone [e] Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately 3⁄8 mile (600 m) away from the Biltmore [31]\n\n\nPrior activities\nOn January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert \"Red\" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating [31] Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon [31] By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone [e] Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately 3⁄8 mile (600 m) away from the Biltmore [31]\n\n\nDiscovery\nOn the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body, severed into two pieces, was found in a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at 34°00′59″N 118°19′59″W﻿ / ﻿34.0164°N 118.333°W﻿ / 34.0164; -118.333) in the neighborhood of Leimert Park At the time, Leimert Park was largely undeveloped [36]\n\n\nAutopsy and identification\nAn autopsy of Short's body was performed on January 16, 1947, by Frederick Newbarr, the Los Angeles County coroner [46] Newbarr's autopsy report stated that Short was 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall, weighed 115 pounds (52 kg), and had light blue eyes, brown hair, and badly decayed teeth [47] [f] There were ligature marks on her ankles, wrists, and neck, and an \"irregular laceration with superficial tissue loss\" on her right breast [48] Newbarr also noted superficial lacerations on the right forearm, left upper arm, and the lower left side of the chest [48]\n\n\nInvestigation\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nInitial investigation\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nLetters and interviews\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nMedia response; decline\nOn January 26, another letter was received by the Examiner, this time handwritten, which read: \"Here it is Turning in Wed., Jan 29, 10 am Had my fun at police Black Dahlia Avenger.\" [67] The letter also named a location at which the supposed killer would turn himself in Police waited at the location on the morning of January 29, but the alleged killer did not appear [67] Instead, at 1:00pm, the Examiner offices received another cut-and-pasted letter which read: \"Have changed my mind You would not give me a square deal Dahlia killing was justified.\" [74]\n\n\nGrand jury and aftermath\nBy the spring of 1947, Short's murder had become a cold case with few new leads [78] Sergeant Finis Brown, one of the lead detectives on the case, blamed the press for compromising the investigation through journalists' probing of details and unverified reporting [79] In September 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss inadequacies in the LAPD's homicide unit based on their failure to solve numerous murders—especially those of women and children—in the previous several years, Short's being one of them [80] [81] In the aftermath of the grand jury, further investigation was done on Short's past, with detectives tracing her movements between Massachusetts, California, and Florida, and also interviewed people who knew her in Texas and New Orleans However, the interviews yielded no useful information in the murder [79]\n\n\nSuspects and confessions\nThe notoriety of Short's murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed false During the initial investigation into her murder, police received a total of sixty confessions, most made by men [82] Since that time, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom had not even been born at the time of her death [83] Sergeant John P St John, a detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, \"It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer.\" [84]\n\n\nTheories and potentially related crimes\nSeveral crime authors, as well as police detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the Cleveland Torso Murders, which took place in Cleveland, between 1934 and 1938 [106] [107] As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any connection between the two cases In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson, was investigated by Detective St John in relation to Short's murder He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson in Short's murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982 [108] The possible connection to the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries in 1992, in which Eliot Ness biographer Oscar Fraley suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases [105]\n\n\nCleveland Torso Murders\nSeveral crime authors, as well as police detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the Cleveland Torso Murders, which took place in Cleveland, between 1934 and 1938 [106] [107] As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any connection between the two cases In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson, was investigated by Detective St John in relation to Short's murder He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson in Short's murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982 [108] The possible connection to the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries in 1992, in which Eliot Ness biographer Oscar Fraley suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases [105]\n\n\nLipstick Murders\nCrime authors such as Steve Hodel and William Rasmussen have suggested a link between the Short murder and the 1946 murder and dismemberment of 6-year-old Suzanne Degnan in Chicago, Illinois [109] Captain Donahoe of the LAPD stated publicly that he believed the Black Dahlia and the \"Lipstick Murders\" in Chicago were \"likely connected\" [110] Among the evidence cited is the fact that Short's body was found on Norton Avenue, three blocks west of Degnan Boulevard, Degnan being the last name of the girl from Chicago There were also striking similarities between the handwriting on the Degnan ransom note and that of the \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" Both texts used a combination of capitals and small letters (the Degnan note read in part \"BuRN This FoR heR SAfTY\"   [sic]), and both notes contain a similar misshapen letter P and have one word that matches exactly [111] Convicted serial killer William Heirens served life in prison for Degnan's murder Initially arrested at age 17 for breaking into a residence close to that of Degnan, Heirens claimed he was tortured by police, forced to confess, and made a scapegoat for the murder [112] After being taken from the medical infirmary at the Dixon Correctional Center on February 26, 2012, for health problems, Heirens died at the University of Illinois Medical Center on March 5, 2012, at age 83.\n\n\nLone Woman Murders\nBetween 1943 and 1949, within Los Angeles over a dozen unsolved murders occurred including the death of Short which involved the sexual mutilation of young attractive women [113] [114] [115] Authorities suspected at the time that they could have been the work of a single unidentified serial killer [116] [117] [118] In 1949, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury was tasked with investigating the failure on the part of law enforcement to solve the cases [80] [81] As a result, further investigation was done on the homicides although none of them were solved [79]\n\n\nRumors and factual disputes\nNumerous details regarding Short's personal life and death have been points of public dispute [i] The eager involvement of both the public and press in solving her murder have been credited as factors that complicated the investigation significantly, resulting in a complex, sometimes inconsistent narrative of events [150] According to Anne Marie DiStefano of the Portland Tribune, many \"unsubstantiated stories\" have circulated about Short over the years: \"She was a prostitute, she was frigid, she was pregnant, she was a lesbian And somehow, instead of fading away over time, the legend of the Black Dahlia just keeps getting more convoluted.\" [151] Harnisch has refuted several supposed rumors and popular conceptions about Short and her murder and also disputed the validity of Gilmore's book Severed, claiming the book is \"25% mistakes, and 50% fiction\" [6] Harnisch also had examined the district attorney's files (he claimed that Steve Hodel has examined some of them pertaining to his father, along with Times columnist Steve Lopez) and contrary to Eatwell's claims, the files showed that Dillon was thoroughly investigated and was determined to have been in San Francisco when Short was killed Harnisch speculated that Eatwell either did not find these files or she chose to ignore them [104]\n\n\nMurder and state of the body\nA number of people, none of whom knew Short, contacted police and the newspapers and claimed to have seen her during her so-called \"missing week\", between her January 9 disappearance and the discovery of her body, on January 15 Police and DA investigators ruled out each alleged sighting; in some cases, those interviewed were identifying other women whom they had mistaken for Short [152] Short's whereabouts in the days leading up to her murder and the discovery of her body are unknown [149]\n\n\nNickname\nAccording to newspaper reports shortly after the murder, Short received the nickname \"Black Dahlia\" from staff and patrons at a Long Beach drugstore in mid-1946 as wordplay on the film The Blue Dahlia (1946) [157] [158] Other popularly-circulated rumors claim that the media crafted the name because Short adorned her hair with dahlias [149] According to the FBI official website, she received the first part of the nickname from the press \"for her rumored penchant for sheer black clothes\" [159]\n\n\nAlleged prostitution and sexual history\nMany true crime books claim that Short lived in or visited Los Angeles at various times in the mid-1940s, including Gilmore's Severed, which claims she worked at the Hollywood Canteen This is disputed by Harnisch, who states that Short did not, in fact, live in Los Angeles until after the canteen's closing in 1945 [6] Although some of her acquaintances and several authors and journalists described Short as a prostitute or call girl during her time in Los Angeles, [k] according to Harnisch, the contemporaneous grand jury proved that there was no existing evidence that she was ever a prostitute [6] Harnisch claims that the rumor regarding Short's history as a prostitute originates from John Gregory Dunne's 1977 novel True Confessions, which is based in part on the crime [6]\n\n\nLegacy\nShort is interred at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland [163] After her younger sister, Elnora, had grown up and married, their mother, Phoebe, moved to Oakland to be near her daughter's grave She finally returned to the East Coast in the 1970s, where she lived into her 90s and died in 1992 [35] [13] On February 2, 1947, just two weeks after Short's murder, Republican state assemblyman C Don Field was prompted by the case to introduce a bill calling for the formation of a sex offender registry; the state of California would become the first U.S state to make the registration of sex offenders mandatory [67]\n\n\nSee

unsolved crimes in American history. On January 15, 1947, the body of Elizabeth Short, a 22-year-old woman, was found brutally murdered in a vacant lot in Los Angeles, California. The case has become a cultural phenomenon, captivating the public's imagination with its gruesome details and the numerous investigations that have failed to crack the mystery. This article will delve into the life of Elizabeth Short, the circumstances surrounding her murder, and the various theories and investigations that have attempted to solve the case.\n\n**Life**\n\nElizabeth Short was born on July 29, 1924, in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, to Cleo Alvin Short Jr and Phoebe May Sawyer. She was the third of five daughters, and her father was a United States Navy sailor. The family later moved to Medford, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, where her father built miniature golf courses. However, he lost his savings in the 1929 stock market crash, and the family's financial situation became strained.\n\nIn 1930, Short's father's car was found abandoned on the Charlestown Bridge, and it was assumed that he had jumped into the Charles River. This marked the beginning of a series of tragic events that would shape Elizabeth's life.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nElizabeth Short's childhood was marked by instability and tragedy. Her father's disappearance and presumed death had a profound impact on her family, and her mother struggled to provide for her daughters. Short's sisters recalled that she was a happy and outgoing child, but her father's absence left a deep emotional scar.\n\nThe family's financial situation continued to deteriorate, and in 1937, they were forced to move to Boston's South End.

into the Charles River [16]\n\n\nRelocation to California\nIn late 1942, Short's mother received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California [19] In December, at age 18, Short relocated to Vallejo, California, to live with her father, whom she had not seen since age 6 [20] At the time he was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943 [21]\n\n\nMurder\nOn January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert \"Red\" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating [31] Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon [31] By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone [e] Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately 3⁄8 mile (600 m) away from the Biltmore [31]\n\n\nPrior activities\nOn January 9, 1947, Short returned to her home in Los Angeles after a brief trip to San Diego with Robert \"Red\" Manley, a 25-year-old married salesman she had been dating [31] Manley stated that he dropped Short off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, and that Short was to meet her sister, who was visiting from Boston, that afternoon [31] By some accounts, staff of the Biltmore recalled having seen Short using the lobby telephone [e] Shortly after, she was allegedly seen by patrons of the Crown Grill Cocktail Lounge at 754 South Olive Street, approximately 3⁄8 mile (600 m) away from the Biltmore [31]\n\n\nDiscovery\nOn the morning of January 15, 1947, Short's naked body, severed into two pieces, was found in a vacant lot on the west side of South Norton Avenue, midway between Coliseum Street and West 39th Street (at 34°00′59″N 118°19′59″W﻿ / ﻿34.0164°N 118.333°W﻿ / 34.0164; -118.333) in the neighborhood of Leimert Park At the time, Leimert Park was largely undeveloped [36]\n\n\nAutopsy and identification\nAn autopsy of Short's body was performed on January 16, 1947, by Frederick Newbarr, the Los Angeles County coroner [46] Newbarr's autopsy report stated that Short was 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall, weighed 115 pounds (52 kg), and had light blue eyes, brown hair, and badly decayed teeth [47] [f] There were ligature marks on her ankles, wrists, and neck, and an \"irregular laceration with superficial tissue loss\" on her right breast [48] Newbarr also noted superficial lacerations on the right forearm, left upper arm, and the lower left side of the chest [48]\n\n\nInvestigation\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nInitial investigation\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person claiming to be Short's killer placed a phone call to the office of James Richardson, the editor of the Examiner, congratulating Richardson on the newspaper's coverage of the case and stating he planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nLetters and interviews\nOn January 21, 1947, [58] a person

planned on eventually turning himself in, but not before allowing police to pursue him further [31] Additionally, the caller told Richardson to \"expect some souvenirs of Beth Short in the mail.\" [31]\n\n\nMedia response; decline\nOn January 26, another letter was received by the Examiner, this time handwritten, which read: \"Here it is Turning in Wed., Jan 29, 10 am Had my fun at police Black Dahlia Avenger.\" [67] The letter also named a location at which the supposed killer would turn himself in Police waited at the location on the morning of January 29, but the alleged killer did not appear [67] Instead, at 1:00pm, the Examiner offices received another cut-and-pasted letter which read: \"Have changed my mind You would not give me a square deal Dahlia killing was justified.\" [74]\n\n\nGrand jury and aftermath\nBy the spring of 1947, Short's murder had become a cold case with few new leads [78] Sergeant Finis Brown, one of the lead detectives on the case, blamed the press for compromising the investigation through journalists' probing of details and unverified reporting [79] In September 1949, a grand jury convened to discuss inadequacies in the LAPD's homicide unit based on their failure to solve numerous murders—especially those of women and children—in the previous several years, Short's being one of them [80] [81] In the aftermath of the grand jury, further investigation was done on Short's past, with detectives tracing her movements between Massachusetts, California, and Florida, and also interviewed people who knew her in Texas and New Orleans However, the interviews yielded no useful information in the murder [79]\n\n\nSuspects and confessions\nThe notoriety of Short's murder has spurred a large number of confessions over the years, many of which have been deemed false During the initial investigation into her murder, police received a total of sixty confessions, most made by men [82] Since that time, over 500 people have confessed to the crime, some of whom had not even been born at the time of her death [83] Sergeant John P St John, a detective who worked the case until his retirement, stated, \"It is amazing how many people offer up a relative as the killer.\" [84]\n\n\nTheories and potentially related crimes\nSeveral crime authors, as well as police detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short murder and the Cleveland Torso Murders, which took place in Cleveland, between 1934 and 1938 [106] [107] As part of their investigation into other murders that took place before and after the Short killing, the original LAPD investigators studied the Torso Murders in 1947 but later discounted any connection between the two cases In 1980, new evidence implicating a former Torso Murder suspect, Jack Anderson Wilson, was investigated by Detective St John in relation to Short's murder He claimed he was close to arresting Wilson in Short's murder, but that Wilson died in a fire on February 4, 1982 [108] The possible connection to the Torso Murders received renewed media attention when it was profiled on the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries in 1992, in which Eliot Ness biographer Oscar Fraley suggested Ness knew the identity of the killer responsible for both cases [105]\n\n\nCleveland Torso Murders\nSeveral crime authors, as well as police detective Peter Merylo, have suspected a link between the Short

{"title": "London", "content": "\nToponymy\nLondon is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium [36] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *Londonjon or something similar This was then adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English [37]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south River Thames foreshore, upstream from Vauxhall Bridge [39] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC [39] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC, [40] were found on the Thames' south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge [41] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames [41]\n\n\nPrehistory\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south River Thames foreshore, upstream from Vauxhall Bridge [39] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC [39] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC, [40] were found on the Thames' south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge [41] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames [41]\n\n\nRoman London\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD, [1] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD [42] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground [43]\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Viking-period London\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450 [45] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city [46] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed [47]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066 [50] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants [51] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, near the abbey It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster [52]\n\n\nEarly modern\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city [58] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (kontor) of England in London, called the Stalhof or Steelyard It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway [59] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries [60]\n\n\nLate modern and contemporary\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew [79] [80] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare) [81] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers [79] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866 [82] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the London Underground, the world's first urban rail network [83] The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital [84]\n\n\nAdministration\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities [110] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues [111] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital [112] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011 [113]\n\n\nLocal government\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities [110] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues [111] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital [112] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011 [113]\n\n\nNational government\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall [120] There are 75 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of June 2024, 59 are from the Labour Party, 9 are Conservatives, 6 are Liberal Democrats and one constituency is held by an independent [121] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994, however as of 2024, the post has been vacant.\n\n\nPolicing and crime\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) [122] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police [123] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\" [124] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in Doctor Who) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK [125]\n\n\nGeography\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways [133]\n\n\nScope\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways [133]\n\n\nStatus\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status The City of London and the remainder of Greater London are both counties for the purposes of lieutenancies [139] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire [140] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London [141]\n\n\nTopography\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2) The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2) [143]\n\n\nClimate\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800 Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893 [147] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm) [148] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City [149] Despite relatively low annual precipitation, London receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0mm threshold annually London is vulnerable to climate change, and there is concern among hydrological experts that households may run out of water before 2050 [150]\n\n\nAreas\nPlaces within London's vast urban area are identified using area names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley, and Whitechapel These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs [170]\n\n\nArchitecture\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace [178]\n\n\nNatural history\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish [184] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves [185]\n\n\nDemography\nLondon's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011, [3] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used [193] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001 [194]\n\n\nAge structure and median age\nLondon's median age is one of the youngest regions in the UK It was recorded in 2018 that London's residents were 36.5 years old, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3 [200]\n\n\nCountry of birth\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born, [201] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers and a growth of roughly 3 million since 1971 when the foreign born population was 668,373 [202] 13% of the total population were Asian born (32.1% of the total foreign born population), 7.1% are African born (17.5%), 15.5% are Other European born (38.2%) and 4.2% were born in the Americas and Caribbean (10.3%) [203] The 5 largest single countries of origin were respectively India, Romania, Poland, Bangladesh and Pakistan [203]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2021 census, 53.8% of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 36.8% White British, 1.8% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy/Irish Traveller, 0.4 Roma and 14.7% classified as Other White [206] Meanwhile, 22.2% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 20.8% being of full Asian descents and 1.4% being of mixed-Asian heritage Indians accounted for 7.5% of the population, followed by Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 3.7% and 3.3% respectively Chinese people accounted for 1.7%, and Arabs for 1.6% A further 4.6% were classified as \"Other Asian\" [206] 15.9% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent 13.5% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.4% Black Africans accounted for 7.9% of London's population; 3.9% identified as Black Caribbean, and 1.7% as \"Other Black\" 5.7% were of mixed race [206] This ethnic structure has changed considerably since the 1960s Estimates for 1961 put the total non-White ethnic minority population at 179,109 comprising 2.3% of the population at the time, [207] [208] having risen since then to 1,346,119 and 20.2% in 1991 [209] and 4,068,553 and 46.2% in 2021 [210] Of those of a White British background, estimates for 1971 put the population at 6,500,000 and 87% of the total population, [211] of since fell to 3,239,281 and 36.8% in 2021 [210]\n\n\nLanguages\nIn January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000 [214] At the 2021 census, 78.4% of Londoners spoke English as their first language [215] The 5 biggest languages outside of English were Romanian, Spanish, Polish, Bengali, and Portuguese [215]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in London (2021) [216]\n\n\nAccents\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older [234] Some features of Cockney include, Th-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", H-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel [235] John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties [236] This is particularly pronounced in areas like Romford (in the London Borough of Havering) and Southend (in Essex) which have received significant inflows of older East End residents in recent decades [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP [245] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington, and Lambeth & Southwark One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world [246]\n\n\nCity of London\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies This caused many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g Hope, Baring I'm), to move to London Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century [74] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time [78] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity [247] [248]\n\n\nMedia and technology\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector [259] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters, including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky, also have headquarters around the city Many national newspapers, including The Times, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press [260] The communications company WPP is the world's largest advertising agency [261]\n\n\nTourism\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015 [267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy [268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK [269]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London, [273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London In 2007, the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL) [111]\n\n\nAviation\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world [24] Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\nRail\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world [283] [284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890 [285]\n\n\nUnderground and DLR\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world [283] [284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890 [285]\n\n\nSuburban\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports [289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year [290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest

ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form Londinium [36] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as *Londonjon or something similar This was then adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English [37]\n\n\nHistory\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south River Thames foreshore, upstream from Vauxhall Bridge [39] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC [39] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC, [40] were found on the Thames' south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge [41] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames [41]\n\n\nPrehistory\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south

were found on the Thames' south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge [41] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames [41]\n\n\nRoman London\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD, [1] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD [42] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground [43]\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon and Viking-period London\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450 [45] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city [46] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed [47]\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066 [50] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in

Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway [59] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries [60]\n\n\nLate modern and contemporary\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew [79] [80] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare) [81] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers [79] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866 [82] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the London Underground, the world's first urban rail network [83] The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital [84]\n\n\nAdministration\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier Citywide administration is coordinated by the

the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues [111] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital [112] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011 [113]\n\n\nLocal government\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier

[112] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011 [113]\n\n\nNational government\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall [120] There are 75 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of June 2024, 59 are from the Labour Party, 9 are Conservatives, 6 are Liberal Democrats and one constituency is held by an independent [121] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994, however as of 2024, the post has been vacant.\n\n\nPolicing and crime\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) [122] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police [123] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\" [124] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in Doctor Who) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK [125]\n\n\nGeography\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways [133]\n\n\nScope\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways [133]\n\n\nStatus\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status The City of London and the remainder of Greater London are both counties for the purposes of lieutenancies [139] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire [140] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London [141]\n\n\nTopography\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2) The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2) [143]\n\n\nClimate\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800 Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893 [147] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm) [148] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City [149] Despite relatively low annual precipitation, London receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0mm threshold annually London is vulnerable to climate change, and there is concern among hydrological experts that households may run out of water before 2050 [150]\n\n\nAreas\nPlaces within London's vast urban area are identified using area names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley, and Whitechapel These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs [170]\n\n\nArchitecture\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace [178]\n\n\nNatural history\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish [184] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves [185]\n\n\nDemography\nLondon's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011, [3] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used [193] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001 [194]\n\n\nAge structure and median age\nLondon's median age is one of the youngest regions in the UK It was recorded in 2018 that London's residents were 36.5 years old, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3 [200]\n\n\nCountry of birth\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born, [201] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers and a growth of roughly 3 million since 1971 when the foreign born population was 668,373 [202] 13% of the total population were Asian born (32.1% of the total foreign born population), 7.1% are African born (17.5%), 15.5% are Other European born (38.2%) and 4.2% were born in the Americas and Caribbean (10.3%) [203] The 5 largest single countries of origin were respectively India, Romania, Poland, Bangladesh and Pakistan [203]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2021 census, 53.8% of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 36.8% White British, 1.8% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy/Irish Traveller, 0.4 Roma and 14.7% classified as Other White [206] Meanwhile, 22.2% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 20.8% being of full Asian descents and 1.4% being of mixed-Asian heritage Indians accounted for 7.5% of the population, followed by Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 3.7% and 3.3% respectively Chinese people accounted for 1.7%, and Arabs for 1.6% A further 4.6% were classified as \"Other Asian\" [206] 15.9% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent 13.5% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.4% Black Africans accounted for 7.9% of London's population; 3.9% identified as Black Caribbean, and 1.7% as \"Other Black\" 5.7% were of mixed race [206] This ethnic structure has changed considerably since the 1960s Estimates for 1961 put the total non-White ethnic minority population at 179,109 comprising 2.3% of the population at the time, [207] [208] having risen since then to 1,346,119 and 20.2% in 1991 [209] and 4,068,553 and 46.2% in 2021 [210] Of those of a White British background, estimates for 1971 put the population at 6,500,000 and 87% of the total population, [211] of since fell to 3,239,281 and 36.8% in 2021 [210]\n\n\nLanguages\nIn January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000 [214] At the 2021 census, 78.4% of Londoners spoke English as their first language [215] The 5 biggest languages outside of English were Romanian, Spanish, Polish, Bengali, and Portuguese [215]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in London (2021) [216]\n\n\nAccents\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older [234] Some features of Cockney include, Th-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", H-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel [235] John Camden Hotten, in his Slang Dictionary of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties [236] This is particularly pronounced in areas like Romford (in the London Borough of Havering) and Southend (in Essex) which have received significant inflows of older East End residents in recent decades [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP [245] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington, and Lambeth & Southwark One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world [246]\n\n\nCity of London\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies This caused many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g Hope, Baring I'm), to move to London Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century [74] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time [78] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity [247] [248]\n\n\nMedia and technology\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector [259] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters, including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky, also have headquarters around the city Many national newspapers, including The Times, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press [260] The communications company WPP is the world's largest advertising agency [261]\n\n\nTourism\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015 [267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy [268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK [269]\n\n\nTransport\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London, [273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London In 2007, the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL) [111]\n\n\nAviation\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world [24] Eight airports use the word London in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\nRail\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world [283] [284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890 [285]\n\n\nUnderground and DLR\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world [283] [284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890 [285]\n\n\nSuburban\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports [289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year [290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges [291]\n\n\nInter-city and international\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London [295] King's Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns [296] The Flying Scotsman is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, Flying Scotsman, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934 [297]\n\n\nBuses, coaches and trams\nLondon's bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops [301] In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year [302] Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year [303] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world [304] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced [305]\n\n\nCable car\nLondon's first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012 The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times [310]\n\n\nCycling\nIn the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day, [311] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day [312] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received [313]\n\n\nPort and river boats\nThe Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009 [314] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London [314]\n\n\nRoads\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long [318] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh [319]\n\n\nEducation\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe [21] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world [327] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world [328] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education [329]\nA number of world-leading education institutions are based in London In the 2022 QS World University Rankings, Imperial College London is ranked No 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 37th [330] All are

(ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th) [335]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary education\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower

seven former British prime ministers), St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School [344]\n\n\nRoyal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies\nFounded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne's Nautical Almanac which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884 [345]\n\n\nCulture\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London [348] at 25.6 events per 1000 people [349] The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city, [350] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world [351]\n\n\nLeisure and entertainment\nLeisure is a major part of

Street, in 1912 and \"which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations.\" [376]\n\n\nLiterature, film and television\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century Canterbury Tales set out for Canterbury from London William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play The Alchemist, was set in the city [381] A Journal of the Plague Year (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague [381]\n\n\nMuseums, art galleries and libraries\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753 [400] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square [401]\n\n\nMusic\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms) [356] The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera) [356] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\" [406] Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year [407] Guitar amp engineer Jim Marshall founded Marshall Amplification in London in 1962 [408]\n\n\nRecreation\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens [418] The largest parks in

[72] Coming into the league, he was known as a tall, upright runner possessing a rare combination of speed, strength, agility, size, and vision, along with a highly aggressive running style [10] His rare talent as both a great breakaway and power runner has often raised comparisons to past legends, including Eric Dickerson, Walter Payton, Gale Sayers, O J Simpson, Franco Harris, and Jim Brown

He was listed as the best running back and overall prospect in the Class of 2004 by Rivals.com. After considering schools such as Texas, Texas A&M, UCLA, Arkansas, and Miami (FL), he decided that he wanted to go to a school where he could be a difference-maker in a national championship run and narrowed his choices down to USC and Oklahoma. Concluding his high school football career at the annual U.S Army All-American Bowl, he led the West squad with 95 yards on nine carries and scored two touchdowns, and announced at the game that he would attend college at the University of Oklahoma.\n\n**College Career**\n\nPeterson attended the University of Oklahoma, where he played for coach Bob Stoops's Oklahoma Sooners football team from 2004 to 2006. During his freshman season at Oklahoma, Peterson broke several NCAA freshman rushing records, rushing for a conference-leading 1,925 yards and leading the nation in carries with 339. In each of the first nine games of the season, he rushed for more than 100-yards, which is a freshman record. He rushed for 100 yards in the season opener against Bowling Green, 117 yards against Houston, 183 yards against Oregon, 146 yards against Texas Tech, 225 yards against Texas, 130 yards against Kansas State, and 122 yards against Kansas.\n\n**Oklahoma Sooners Football Team**\n\nPeterson started the 2004 season by rushing for 100 yards against Bowling Green. He followed that up with 117 yards against Houston and 183 yards against Oregon. In the next game against Texas Tech, he rushed for 146 yards and a touchdown. Against Texas, he had 225 yards and two touchdowns. Peterson's impressive performance continued against Kansas State, where he rushed for 130 yards and a touchdown. In the final game of the season against Kansas, he had 122 yards and a touchdown.\n\n**2005 Season**\n\nIn the 2005 season, Peterson's playing time was limited by a broken foot. He started off the season with 63 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in a 17-10 loss to TCU. In the next game against Tulsa, he had 220 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns to help the Sooners to the 31-15 victory. He injured his ankle in the first Big 12 Conference game of the season against Kansas State. Despite missing time in four games, he rushed for 1,208 yards and 14 touchdowns on 220 carries, finishing second in rushing yardage in the Big 12. His 2005 season was also notable for a career-long 84-yard touchdown run as part of a 237-yard and two-touchdown performance in a 42-14 victory over Oklahoma State.\n\n**2006 Season**\n\nPeterson started the 2006 season off strong, rushing for an average of over 150 yards per game and scoring nine total touchdowns over five games. However, on the final drive for the Sooners against Iowa State, Peterson broke his collarbone when he dove into the end zone on a 53-yard touchdown run. During a press conference on October 18, Peterson said he was told by doctors to expect to be out for 4-6 weeks. At the time of the injury, Peterson needed only to gain 150 yards to pass Billy Sims as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher. He was unable to return for the rest of the Sooners' regular season and missed seven games. The Sooners would turn to Allen Patrick, a junior, and Chris Brown, a freshman, to replace Peterson. The team went on a seven-game winning streak, including winning the Big 12 Championship game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Peterson returned for their last game against Boise State in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, where he rushed for 77 yards and a touchdown in the 43-42 overtime loss.\n\n**NFL Draft**\n\nOn January 15, 2007, Peterson declared that he would forego his senior year of college and enter the 2007 NFL draft. Coming into the league, he was known as a tall, upright runner possessing a rare combination of speed, strength, agility, size, and vision, along with a highly aggressive running style. His rare talent as both a great breakaway and power runner has often raised comparisons to past legends, including Eric Dickerson, Walter Payton, Gale Sayers, O.J. Simpson, Franco Harris, and Jim Brown. Concerns about his injuries suffered during college were noted by the media and potential NFL teams. He started 22 out of 31 games in his college career and had a dislocated shoulder his first year, a high ankle sprain his sophomore year, and a broken collarbone his final year at Oklahoma. His durability was a consideration for at least two teams in their draft analysis, which impacted selection position. Prior to the 2007 NFL Draft, Peterson was compared by professional football scouts to Eric Dickerson.\n\n**Minnesota Vikings**\n\nOn April 28, 2007, Peterson was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round with the seventh overall pick of the 2007 NFL draft. Peterson was the first running back selected and the first of three Oklahoma Sooners to be drafted in the 2007 NFL Draft. At a press conference during the draft, Peterson announced, \"My collarbone, I would say it's 90% healed. A lot of teams know that, and I don't see it stopping me from being prepared for the season.\"\n\n**2007 Season**\n\nPeterson and the Vikings entered the 2007 season with high expectations and as he did during his rookie season, Peterson set high goals for himself, including a 2,000-yard campaign and the NFL MVP award. Questions remained as to Peterson's durability and the ability of the Vikings offense to take the focus of opposing defenses off Peterson. Prior to the start of the 2009 season, analysts of both the NFL Network and ESPN unanimously named Peterson the best running back in the NFL today.\n\n**2010 Season**\n\nPeterson opened the 2010 season strongly with 392 yards and three touchdowns through the first three weeks.

He later earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance during the game.\n\n**2012 Season**\n\nPeterson started Week 1 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, although his status was listed as questionable. He rushed for 84 yards and two touchdowns in his first game in eight months after his ACL and MCL tear. He passed Robert Smith to most rushing yards in franchise history. On October 21, against the Arizona Cardinals, he had 153 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 21-14 victory. For the sixth time in his career, he earned Offensive Player of the Week honors.\n\n**2013 Season**\n\nPeterson opened his 2013 season by taking his first carry of the year 78 yards for a touchdown. He finished the game with 18 carries for 93 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 34-24 loss to the Detroit Lions. Peterson struggled in the first three games of the season without All-Pro fullback Jerome Felton, but upon his return in Week 4, Peterson rushed for 140 yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n**2014 Season**\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Peterson was indicted by a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child, after he had used a wooden implement to injure his 4-year-old son in Spring, Texas, in May.

attacks \"from the first moment of violence to multiple breaches of the Capitol while leaving the impression that it was just ordinary protesters leading the charge\" [242] Proud Boys targeted an access point and began to rile up the previously-peaceful crowd [242] In a \"tipping point\" moment, a man later identified as Ryan Samsel approached Joe Biggs and talked with him, even embracing him

upfront and challenge the police\", according to The New York Times [243] Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola recalled seeing Biggs flash a handgun and goading Samsel, telling him to \"defend his manhood\" by

enter the rally, and later instructed the crowd to march on the US Capitol [215] [347] In a December 21, 2021, statement, Trump falsely called the attack a \"completely unarmed protest\" The Department of Justice said in a January 2022 official statement that over 75 people had been charged, in relation to the attack, with entering a restricted area while armed with \"a dangerous or deadly weapon\", including some armed with guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes, and chemical sprays [348] According to testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, a Secret Service official had warned Trump that protestors were carrying weapons, but Trump wanted the magnetometers used to detect metallic weapons removed so armed supporters could enter the rally [349] According to Hutchinson, when warned, Trump said:\n\n\nAllegation of assaulting a Secret Service driver\nIn June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson testified that she was told by then-White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato that after Trump got into the presidential SUV following his rally, hoping to drive to the Capitol as his supporters marched there, his lead Secret Service agent Robert Engel told him it was too dangerous and informed him they were returning to the White House Hutchinson said Ornato told her Trump became irate, attempted to grab the steering wheel of the vehicle, and lunged at Engel's clavicle [350] She testified Engel was present with Ornato as he related the incident but never contradicted the account [351] Three days after Hutchinson's testimony, CNN reported that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump's driver Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump \"tried to lunge over the seat – for what reason, nobody had any idea\", but no one asserted Trump attacked Engel A separate Secret Service official told CNN that Engel denied that Trump grabbed at the steering wheel or lunged toward an agent on his detail, and that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that [352] The same day, Politico reported that during an early 2022 deposition Engel told the committee that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months [353] On July 14, 2022, CNN published a corroborating account by a Metropolitan Police officer in the motorcade, who told of the \"heated exchange\" Trump had with his Secret Service detail when they refused to take him to the Capitol following his rally on January 6 [354]\n\n\nEndangering Mike Pence\nOn January 5, after Vice President Mike Pence refused to participate in the fake electors plot, Trump warned that he would have to publicly criticize him This prompted Pence's chief of staff to become concerned for Pence's safety and to alert Pence's Secret Service detail to the perceived threat [88] [355] At 3:23 a.m on the morning of January 6, QAnon leader Ron Watkins posted a tweet accusing Pence of orchestrating a coup against Trump and linked to a blog post which called for \"the immediate arrest of  [Pence], for treason.\" [356] [357] [358]\n\n\nFailure to end the attack\nIn a televised January 6 Attack congressional hearing on June 9, 2022, congresspersons Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney stated that Trump did nothing to stop the attack despite numerous urgent requests that he intervene They described Trump's inaction as a \"dereliction of duty\" [367] Cheney said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy [368] [369] According to Representative Thompson, \"Jan 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan 6, to overthrow the government.. The violence was no accident It represents Trump's last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power.\" Trump, according to the committee, \"lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president\" [368] [369]\n\n\nCapitol Police leadership's failure to prepare\nCapitol Police leadership had not planned for a riot or attack, [371] and on January 6, under \"orders from leadership\", the force deployed without riot gear, shields, batons, or \"less lethal\" arms such as sting grenades Department riot shields had been improperly stored, causing them to shatter upon impact [170] Hundreds more Capitol Police could have been used, but they were not [260]\n\n\nDepartment of Defense leadership's refusal to send Guard\nOn January 3, acting defense secretary Miller had been ordered by Trump to \"do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators\" on January 6 [166] The following day, Miller issued orders which prohibited deploying D.C Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor, or riot control agents without his personal approval [168] Prior to the attack Trump had floated the idea with his staff of deploying 10,000 National Guardsmen, though not to protect the Capitol, but rather \"to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counterprotesters\" [374]\n\n\nCongressional conduct\nDuring the attack, Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) posted information about the police response and the location of members on Twitter, including the fact that Speaker Pelosi had been taken out of the chamber, for which she has faced calls to resign for endangering members [384] [385] Boebert responded that she was not sharing private information since Pelosi's removal was also broadcast on TV [306]\n\n\nDeletion of Secret Service and Homeland Security text messages\nAs part of its investigation into the events of January 6, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General requested text messages from the Secret Service In response, the messages were deleted [387] [388] Text messages from Department of Homeland Security leaders Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli \"are missing from a key period leading up to the January 6 attack\" [389] Wolf's nomination had been withdrawn by the White House sometime on January 6 [390] A criminal investigation was opened into the deletion [391]\n\n\nParticipants, groups, and criminal charges\nBy November 2023, over 1,200 defendants had been charged for their role in the attack [37] The attackers included some of Trump's longtime and most fervent supporters from across the United States [392] The mob included Republican Party officials, current and former state legislators and political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, [392] conservative evangelical Christians, [i] and participants of the \"Save America\" Rally [393] According to the FBI, dozens of people on its terrorist watchlist were in D.C for pro-Trump events on the 6th, with the majority being \"suspected white supremacists\" [394] Some came heavily armed and some were convicted criminals, including a man who had been released from a Florida prison after serving a sentence for attempted murder [392]\n\n\nProud Boys\nThe Proud Boys played a much greater role in planning and coordinating the attack than was known in 2021 In 2022, new information appeared in testimony to the January 6th Committee and in a New York Times investigative video [247] Another key revelation about the Proud Boys' plans came from an informant and concerned Mike Pence:\n\n\nOath Keepers\nThe Oath Keepers are an American far-right [407] anti-government militia [407] [408] whose leaders have been convicted of violently opposing the government of the United States, including the transfer of presidential power as prescribed by the United States constitution It was incorporated in 2009 by founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer and former paratrooper In 2023, Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years for seditious conspiracy for his role in the attack, and another Oath Keepers leader, Kelly Meggs, was sentenced to 12 years for the same crime [409]\n\n\nQAnon\nQAnon is an American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017 [418] QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\" Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, [419] [420] [421] cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump [425] Watchdogs studied QAnon posts and warned of the potential for violence ahead of January 6, 2021 [426] [427] [428] Multiple QAnon-affiliated protesters participated in the attack [429] [430] One participant, whose attire and behavior attracted worldwide media attention, was Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter nicknamed the \"QAnon Shaman\" [431] Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot dead by police as she was trying to break into the Speaker's Lobby, was a committed follower of QAnon [432] [433] The day before the attack, she had tweeted: \"the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours\" [434]\n\n\nWhite supremacists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates\nFar-right emblematic gear was worn by some participants, including neo-Confederate, Holocaust deniers, neo-Nazi and Völkisch-inspired neopagan apparel, as well as a shirt emblazoned with references to the Auschwitz concentration camp and its motto, Arbeit macht frei (\"Work sets you free\") [435] [394] [26] [436]\n\n\nOthers\nAlthough the anti-government Boogaloo movement mostly were opposed to Donald Trump, a Boogaloo follower said several groups under his command helped attack the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [455] Also present during the attack were parts of the National Anarchist Movement and the Blue Lives Matter movement, supporters of the America First Movement, the Stop the Steal movement and the Patriot Movement, remnants of the Tea Party movement, the Three Percenters, the Groyper Army, Christian nationalists, and other far-right organizations and groups [26] Shirts with references to the internet meme Pepe the Frog were also seen, alongside \"1776\" and \"MAGA civil war 2021\" shirts, NSC-131 stickers, and the valknut symbol [456] Rioters were seen using the OK gesture, a gesture that had been famously co-opted as an alt-right symbol Christian imagery, including a large \"Jesus saves\" banner, was seen in the crowd of demonstrators Various other iconography was also on display, such as flags of other countries [k]\n\n\nPolice and military connections\nPolitico reported that some rioters briefly showed their police badges or military identification to law enforcement as they approached the Capitol, expecting to be let inside; a Capitol Police officer told BuzzFeed News that one rioter had told him \" [w]e're doing this for you\" as he flashed a badge [371] One former police officer, Laura Steele, was convicted for breaching the Capitol with fellow Oath Keepers [466]\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn February 2021, an academic analysis in The Atlantic found that of the 193 persons so far arrested for invading the Capitol, 89 percent had no clear public connection to established far-right militias, known white-nationalist gangs, or any other known militant organizations \"The overwhelming reason for action, cited again and again in court documents, was that arrestees were following Trump's orders to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the presidential-election winner\" They were older than participants in previous far-right violent demonstrations and more likely to be employed, with 40% being business owners The researchers concluded that these \"middle-aged, middle-class insurrectionists\" represented \"a new force in American politics – not merely a mix of right-wing organizations, but a broader mass political movement that has violence at its core and draws strength even from places where Trump supporters are in the minority\" [474]\n\n\nResults\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nCasualties and suicides\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nDamage\nRioters stormed the offices of Nancy Pelosi, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; [308] [309] the office of the Senate Parliamentarian was ransacked; [285] art was looted; [7] and feces was tracked into several hallways [508] [19] [509] Windows were smashed throughout the building, leaving the floor littered with glass and debris [7] [510] Rioters damaged, turned over, or stole furniture [510] One door had \"Murder the Media\" scribbled onto it in all-caps [511] Rioters damaged Associated Press recording and broadcasting equipment outside the Capitol after chasing away reporters [512] Rioters also destroyed a display honoring the life of congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis [513] [514] A photo of Representative Andy Kim cleaning up the litter in the rotunda after midnight went viral [515]\n\n\nLaptop theft and cybersecurity concerns\nA laptop owned by Senator Jeff Merkley was stolen [520] A laptop taken from Pelosi's office was a \"laptop from a conference room .. that was only used for presentations\", according to Pelosi's deputy chief of staff [20] Representative Ruben Gallego said, \"we have to do a full review of what was taken, or copied, or even left behind in terms of bugs and listening devices\" [371] Military news website SOFREP reported that \"several\" secret‑level laptops were stolen, some of which had been abandoned while still logged in to SIPRNet, causing authorities to temporarily shut down SIPRNet for a security update on January 7 and leading the United States Army Special Operations Command to re-authorize all SIPRNet-connected computers on January 8 [521] [522]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of conviction, with every Democrat and seven Republicans voting to convict, but two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) are required to convict [525] Many in the Trump administration resigned Several large companies [526] announced they were halting all political donations, and others have suspended funding the lawmakers who had objected to certifying Electoral College results [527] A bill was introduced to form an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the events surrounding the attack; it passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate [528] The House then approved a House \"select committee\" to investigate the attack [529] In June, the Senate released the results of its own investigation of the attack The event led to strong criticism of law enforcement agencies Leading figures within the United States Capitol Police resigned [530] [531]\nA large-scale criminal investigation was undertaken, with the FBI opening more than 1,200 case files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nPolitical, legal, and social repercussions\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of

files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn the aftermath of the attack, after drawing widespread condemnation from the U.S Congress, members of his administration, and the media, 45th U.S President Donald Trump released a video-taped statement on January 7, reportedly to stop the resignations of his staff and the threats of impeachment or removal from office In the statement, he condemned the violence at the U.S Capitol, saying that \"a new administration will be inaugurated\", which was widely seen as a concession, and his \"focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power\" to the Joe Biden administration [554] [555] Vanity Fair reported that Trump was at least partially convinced to make the statement by U.S Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told Trump a sufficient number of Senate Republicans would support removing him from office unless he conceded [556] Kayleigh McEnany, the White House Press Secretary, had attempted to distance the administration from the rioters' behavior in a televised statement earlier in the day [557] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump had told White House aides he regretted committing to an orderly transition of power and would never resign from office [558] In a March 25 interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Capitol attackers, saying they were patriots who posed \"zero threat\", and he criticized law enforcement for \"persecuting\" the rioters [559]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nMore than seventy countries and international organizations expressed their concerns over the attack and condemned the violence, with some specifically condemning President Donald Trump's own role in inciting the attack [594] [595] Foreign leaders, diplomats, politicians, and institutions expressed shock, outrage, and condemnation of the events [596] [597] Multiple world leaders made a call for peace, describing the assault as \"an attack on democracy\" [598] The leaders of some countries, including Brazil, Poland, and Hungary, declined to condemn the situation, and described it as an internal U.S affair [599]\n\n\n14th Amendment disqualification\nIn late 2022 Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election Some legal scholars have argued that Trump should be barred from presidential office under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because of his apparent support for the attack [601] Three states, Maine, Colorado, and Illinois, issued rulings to disqualify Trump from appearing on election ballots Trump appealed their decisions in Trump v Anderson The Supreme Court heard the case on February 8, 2024, and unanimously ruled on March 4, 2024 that states could not remove Trump from the ballot [25]\n\n\nSarbanes–Oxley Act prosecutions ruling and impact\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, ruled in favor of defendant Joseph Fischer and found that a provision the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act could not be used to bring obstruction charges against January 6 defendants [603] Soon after the ruling, more January 6 prosecution cases would be reopened [604]\n\n\nAnalysis and terminology\nA week following the attack, journalists were searching for an appropriate word to describe the event [605] According to the Associated Press, U.S media outlets first described the developments on January 6 as \"a rally or protest\", but as the events of the day escalated and further reporting and images emerged, the descriptions shifted to \"an assault, a riot, an insurrection, domestic terrorism or even a coup attempt\" [606] It was variably observed that the media outlets were settling on the terms \"riot\" and \"insurrection\" [606] [607] According to NPR, \"By definition, 'insurrection', and its derivative, 'insurgency', are accurate 'Riot' and 'mob' are equally correct While these words are not interchangeable, they are all suitable when describing Jan 6.\" [608] The New York Times assessed the event as having brought the United States \"hours away from a full-blown constitutional crisis\" [609] Brian Stelter in CNN Business wrote that the events of the Capitol attack \"will be remembered as an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\" [610]\n\n\nHistorians' perspectives\nWhile there have been other instances of violence at the Capitol in the 19th and 20th centuries, this event was the most severe assault on the building since the 1814 burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812 The last attempt on the life of the vice president was a bomb plot against Thomas Marshall in July 1915 [634] For the first time in U.S history, a Confederate battle flag was flown inside the Capitol The Confederate States Army had never reached the Capitol, nor come closer than 6 miles (10 km) from the Capitol at the Battle of Fort Stevens, during the American Civil War [442] [o]\n\n\nSee also\nHouse

2020 presidential election [105] Trump and other Republicans attempted to overturn the election, falsely claiming widespread voter fraud [106]\n\n\nPlanning of January 6 events\nOn December 18, Trump called for supporters to attend a rally before the January 6 Congressional vote count, writing on Twitter, \"Big protest in D.C on January 6th Be there, will be wild!\" [13] [113] On December 28, far-right activist Ali Alexander described collaboration with the Proud Boys and explained the purpose of the January 6 event would be \"to build momentum and pressure, and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congresspeoples   [sic] who weren't yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob'\" [114] Alexander named three Republican members of the House as allies who were planning \"something big\": Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks [115] \"We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event\", he said [116]\n\n\nSeditious conspiracy by Oath Keepers and Proud Boys\nOn November 5, two days after the presidential election, leaders of the Oath Keepers began communicating about a \"civil war\" On November 9, the leaders held a members-only online conference in which leader Stewart Rhodes outlined a plan to stop the transfer of power, including preparations for using force The Oath Keepers planned to store \"an arsenal\" with a \"Quick Reaction Force\" (QRF) in nearby Alexandria, Virginia The leaders planned to procure boat transportation so bridge closures could not prevent their entry into D.C [127] [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nPredictions of violence\nThe weeks preceding January 6 were filled with predictions of violence by Trump supporters The attack was later said to be \"planned in plain sight\", with postings on social media even planning for violence on January 6 In response to widespread predictions of violence, D.C food and lodging establishments with a history of being patronized by the Proud Boys announced temporary closures in an attempt to protect public safety, and the mayor advised residents to stay away from areas near the Mall that might see violence Members of Congress interfaced with law enforcement to ensure preparations were being made for any upcoming violence.\n\n\nLaw enforcement and National Guard preparations\nOn November 9, Trump fired Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and replaced him with Christopher C Miller [157] [158] [159] [160] In response, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Gina Haspel told Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley \"we are on the way to a right-wing coup\" [161] On December 18, Miller unilaterally terminated the Department of Defense's transition to the incoming administration, falsely claiming it was a mutually-agreed pause for the holidays [162] [163]\n\n\nTrump supporters gather in D.C.\nOn January 5, several events related to overturning the election occurred on or near the National Mall in Washington, D.C., at places such as Freedom Plaza, the North Inner Gravel Walkway between 13th and 14th Streets, Area 9 across from the Russell Senate Office Building, and near the United States Supreme Court [171] [172] On the night of January 5 and into the morning of January 6, at least ten people were arrested, several on weapons charges [173]\n\n\nJanuary 5 meetings\nIn the evening of January 5, Trump's closest allies, including Michael Flynn, Corey Lewandowski, Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and Trump's sons Donald Jr and Eric, met at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C [182] [183] Tuberville has since said that he did not attend the meeting, [184] despite having been photographed in the hotel's lobby [182] [185] According to Charles Herbster, who said he attended the meeting himself, attendees included Tuberville, Adam Piper, and Peter Navarro Daniel Beck wrote that \"Fifteen of us spent the evening with Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lindell, Peter Navarro, and Rudy Giuliani\" [186] Herbster claimed to be standing \"in the private residence of the President at Trump International with the following patriots who are joining me in a battle for justice and truth\" He added David Bossie to the list of attendees [182]\n\n\nBombs placed\nAt 7:40 p.m on January 5, someone wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask, and Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers was filmed carrying a bag through a residential neighborhood on South Capitol Street At 7:52 p.m., the individual was recorded sitting on a bench outside the DNC; the next day, a pipe bomb was discovered there, placed under a bush In the footage, the suspect appears to zip a bag, stand and walk away At 8:14, the suspect was filmed in an alley near the RNC, where a second pipe bomb was found the following day [188] Both bombs were placed within a few blocks of the Capitol [189] [190] Nearing the second anniversary of the incident, a reward of $500,000 was being offered, [191] but as of the third anniversary, no suspects have been named [192] [193] [194]\n\n\nJanuary 6 Trump rally\nOn January 6, the \"Save America\" rally (or \"March to Save America\", promoted as a \"Save America March\") [195] took place on the Ellipse within the National Mall just south of the White House The permit granted to Women for America First scheduled a first amendment rally \"March for Trump\", with speeches running from 9:00 a.m to 3:30 p.m., with an additional hour for the conclusion of the rally and dispersal of participants [171]\n\n\nTrump's speech\nStarting at 11:58, from behind a bulletproof shield, President Trump gave a speech, declaring that he would \"never concede\" the election, criticizing the media, and calling for Pence to overturn the election results [109] [212] His speech contained many falsehoods and misrepresentations that inflamed the crowd [213] Trump did not call on his supporters to use violence or enter the Capitol, [214] but his speech was filled with violent imagery [215] On social media, Trump was suggesting that his supporters had the power to prevent Biden from taking office [214] One of his tweets, posted on January 6, 2021, at 5:43 a.m., was \"Get smart Republicans FIGHT.\" [38] The same afternoon, Pence released a letter to Congress, in which he said he could not challenge Biden's victory [109] [216]\n\n\nAttack on the Capitol\nJust before the Proud Boys attacked the Capitol, pipe bombs were discovered near the complex [222] Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other attackers besieged and ultimately breached the Capitol Members of the Congress barricaded themselves in the chamber, and one attacker was fatally shot by police while attempting to breach a barricade [223]\n\n\nProud Boys march to Capitol as mob assembles\nAt 10:30, over a hundred Proud Boys left the Washington Monument, led by Ethan Nordean and Joe Biggs By 11:52, the group had reached the Capitol and proceeded to walk around the building before doubling back to the west side, which allowed them to assess building defenses and to look for weaknesses [225] [85] [226]\n\n\nBombs discovered near Capitol Complex\nAround 12:45 p.m., a bomb was discovered next to a building containing Republican National Committee (RNC) offices by a woman using the shared alleyway to access her apartment building's laundry room [230] She alerted RNC security, which investigated and summoned law enforcement; U.S Capitol Police, FBI agents and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) all responded to the RNC bomb [231]\n\n\nAttack begins near Peace Monument, led by Proud Boys\nThe Proud Boys contingent reached the west perimeter of the Capitol grounds, which was protected only by a sparse line of police in front of a temporary fence Other Trump supporters arrived, adding to a growing crowd The Proud Boys tactically coordinated their attacks \"from the first moment of violence to multiple breaches of the Capitol while leaving the impression that it was just ordinary protesters leading the charge\" [242] Proud Boys targeted an access point and began to rile up the previously-peaceful crowd [242] In a \"tipping point\" moment, a man later identified as Ryan Samsel approached Joe Biggs and talked with him, even embracing him Samsel later told the FBI that Biggs \"encouraged him to push at the barricades and that when he hesitated, the Proud Boys leader flashed a gun, questioned his manhood and repeated his demand to move upfront and challenge the police\", according to The New York Times [243] Proud Boy Dominic Pezzola recalled seeing Biggs flash a handgun and goading Samsel, telling him to \"defend his manhood\" by attacking the police line, but later tried to retract this statement [244] As soon as that exchange ended, Samsel became the first to violently attack Capitol Police Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards described the attack:\n\n\nAttackers on west terrace breach Senate Wing hallway\nJust before 2:00 p.m., attackers reached the doors and windows of the Capitol and began attempts to break in The Los Angeles Times observed that \"whether by sheer luck, real-time trial and error, or advance knowledge\", the first attackers to break through the police line onto the upper west terrace ran past 15 reinforced windows, \"making a beeline\" for the recessed area near the Senate where two unreinforced windows and two doors with unreinforced glass were the only protection from attack [257] At 2:11, Proud Boy leader Dominic Pezzola used a stolen police riot shield to smash one of those un-reinforced windows on the west side of the Capitol, breaching the building itself By 2:13, the Capitol was officially breached [53] [7] [260] [261] Although most of the Capitol's windows had been reinforced, attackers targeted those that remained as single-pane glass and could be broken easily [257] Joe Biggs and other Proud Boy leaders had entered the Capitol by 2:14 [137] A news crew from British broadcaster ITV followed the rioters into the Capitol, the only broadcaster to do so [262] [263]\n\n\nEvacuation of leadership amid Capitol lockdown\nAt 2:13, the Senate recessed, [275] and the doors were locked A minute later, the rioters reached the doors to the gallery above the chamber [253] [276] Banging could be heard from outside as rioters attempted to break through the doors Meanwhile, in the House chamber, Speaker Pelosi was escorted out of the chamber [277] [278]\n\n\nOath Keepers arrive and breach Rotunda\nShortly after 2:00, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes arrived on the restricted Capitol grounds At 2:30, a team of Oath Keepers (\"Stack One\", which included Meggs, Harrelson, Watkins, Hackett, and Moerschel), clad in paramilitary clothing, marched in a stack formation up the east steps of the Capitol to join the mob already besieging the Capitol At 2:38, those doors to the Capitol Rotunda were breached, and \"Stack One\" entered the building alongside other attackers A second group (\"Stack Two\") entered the Capitol through those same doors at 3:15 [127] Throughout the attack, Oath Keepers maintained a \"Quick reaction Force\" ready to deliver an arsenal to the group if called upon [127] [311] [312]\n\n\nAshli Babbitt killed by police while attempting to breach Speaker's Lobby\nAt 2:44 p.m., law enforcement near the House Chamber was trying to \"defend two fronts\", and \"a lot of members  [of Congress] and staff that were in danger at the time\" [313] [314] While some lawmakers remained trapped in the House gallery, [315] House members and staff from the floor were being evacuated by Capitol Police, protected from the attackers by a barricaded door with glass windows [295]\n\n\nAttack on the Tunnel\nAround 3:15, MPD officer Daniel Hodges was crushed in a door while defending the Capitol tunnel from attackers One of his attackers was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison [324] [325]\n\n\nPolice clear the Capitol and Congress reconvenes\nA combined force of Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police began a joint operation to clear the Capitol By 2:49, the Crypt was cleared, and the mob outside the Speaker's Lobby was cleared by 2:57 At 3:25, law enforcement, including a line of MPD officers in full riot gear, proceeded to clear the Rotunda; and by 3:40, rioters had mostly been pushed out onto West Plaza [74]: ch 8 \n\n\nFederal officials' conduct\nTrump was in the West Wing of the White House at the time of the attack [333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nTrump's conduct\nTrump was in the West Wing of the White House at the time of the attack [333] He was \"initially pleased\" and refused to intercede when his supporters breached the Capitol [334] Staffers reported that Trump had been \"impossible to talk to throughout the day\" [335] Concerned that Trump may have committed treason through his actions, White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly advised administration officials to avoid contact with Trump and ignore any illegal orders that could further incite the attack, in order to limit their prosecutorial liability under the Sedition Act of 1918 [336]\n\n\nInflammatory speech while knowing of weapons\nDuring the \"Save America\" rally, Trump delivered a speech filled with violent imagery, despite knowing that some of his supporters were armed He demanded that armed supporters be allowed to enter the rally, and later instructed the crowd to march on the US Capitol [215] [347] In a December 21, 2021, statement, Trump falsely called the attack a \"completely unarmed protest\" The Department of Justice said in a January 2022 official statement that over 75 people had been charged, in relation to the attack, with entering a restricted area while armed with \"a dangerous or deadly weapon\", including some armed with guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes, and chemical sprays [348] According to testimony from Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, a Secret Service official had warned Trump that protestors were carrying weapons, but Trump wanted the magnetometers used to detect metallic weapons removed so armed supporters could enter the rally [349] According to Hutchinson, when warned, Trump said:\n\n\nAllegation of assaulting a Secret Service driver\nIn June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson testified that she was told by then-White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato that after Trump got into the presidential SUV following his rally, hoping to drive to the Capitol as his supporters marched there, his lead Secret Service agent Robert Engel told him it was too dangerous and informed him they were returning to the White House Hutchinson said Ornato told her Trump became irate, attempted to grab the steering wheel of the vehicle, and lunged at Engel's clavicle [350] She testified Engel was present with Ornato as he related the incident but never contradicted the account [351] Three days after Hutchinson's testimony, CNN reported that it had spoken with two Secret Service agents who had heard accounts of the incident from multiple other agents since February 2021, including Trump's driver Although details differed, agents confirmed there was an angry confrontation, with one agent relating that Trump \"tried to lunge over the seat – for what reason, nobody had any idea\", but no one asserted Trump attacked Engel A separate Secret Service official told CNN that Engel denied that Trump grabbed at the steering wheel or lunged toward an agent on his detail, and that Ornato denied telling Hutchinson that [352] The same day, Politico reported that during an early 2022 deposition Engel told the committee that he had kept his full account of the incident from his Secret Service colleagues for at least fourteen months [353] On July 14, 2022, CNN published a corroborating account by a Metropolitan Police officer in the motorcade, who told of the \"heated exchange\" Trump had with his Secret Service detail when they refused to take him to the Capitol following his rally on January 6 [354]\n\n\nEndangering Mike Pence\nOn January 5, after Vice President Mike Pence refused to participate in the fake electors plot, Trump warned that he would have to publicly criticize him This prompted Pence's chief of staff to become concerned for Pence's safety and to alert Pence's Secret Service detail to the perceived threat [88] [355] At 3:23 a.m on the morning of January 6, QAnon leader Ron Watkins posted a tweet accusing Pence of orchestrating a coup against Trump and linked to a blog post which called for \"the immediate arrest of  [Pence], for treason.\" [356] [357] [358]\n\n\nFailure to end the attack\nIn a televised January 6 Attack congressional hearing on June 9, 2022, congresspersons Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney stated that Trump did nothing to stop the attack despite numerous urgent requests that he intervene They described Trump's inaction as a \"dereliction of duty\" [367] Cheney said that Trump had attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a seven-part conspiracy [368] [369] According to Representative Thompson, \"Jan 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after Jan 6, to overthrow the government.. The violence was no accident It represents Trump's last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power.\" Trump, according to the committee, \"lied to the American people, ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims, pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger, encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president\" [368] [369]\n\n\nCapitol Police leadership's failure to prepare\nCapitol Police leadership had not planned for a riot or attack, [371] and on January 6, under \"orders from leadership\", the force deployed without riot gear, shields, batons, or \"less lethal\" arms such as sting grenades Department riot shields had been improperly stored, causing them to shatter upon impact [170] Hundreds more Capitol Police could have been used, but they were not [260]\n\n\nDepartment of Defense leadership's refusal to send Guard\nOn January 3, acting defense secretary Miller had been ordered by Trump to \"do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators\" on January 6 [166] The following day, Miller issued orders which prohibited deploying D.C Guard members with weapons, helmets, body armor, or riot control agents without his personal approval [168] Prior to the attack Trump had floated the idea with his staff of deploying 10,000 National Guardsmen, though not to protect the Capitol, but rather \"to protect him and his supporters from any supposed threats by left-wing counterprotesters\" [374]\n\n\nCongressional conduct\nDuring the attack, Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) posted information about the police response and the location of members on Twitter, including the fact that Speaker Pelosi had been taken out of the chamber, for which she has faced calls to resign for endangering members [384] [385] Boebert responded that she was not sharing private information since Pelosi's removal was also broadcast on TV [306]\n\n\nDeletion of Secret Service and Homeland Security text messages\nAs part of its investigation into the events of January 6, the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General requested text messages from the Secret Service In response, the messages were deleted [387] [388] Text messages from Department of Homeland Security leaders Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli \"are missing from a key period leading up to the January 6 attack\" [389] Wolf's nomination had been withdrawn by the White House sometime on January 6 [390] A criminal investigation was opened into the deletion [391]\n\n\nParticipants, groups, and criminal charges\nBy November 2023, over 1,200 defendants had been charged for their role in the attack [37] The attackers included some of Trump's longtime and most fervent supporters from across the United States [392] The mob included Republican Party officials, current and former state legislators and political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, [392] conservative evangelical Christians, [i] and participants of the \"Save America\" Rally [393] According to the FBI, dozens of people on its terrorist watchlist were in D.C for pro-Trump events on the 6th, with the majority being \"suspected white supremacists\" [394] Some came heavily armed and some were convicted criminals, including a man who had been released from a Florida prison after serving a sentence for attempted murder [392]\n\n\nProud Boys\nThe Proud Boys played a much greater role in planning and coordinating the attack than was known in 2021 In 2022, new information appeared in testimony to the January 6th Committee and in a New York Times investigative video [247] Another key revelation about the Proud Boys' plans came from an informant and concerned Mike Pence:\n\n\nOath Keepers\nThe Oath Keepers are an American far-right [407] anti-government militia [407] [408] whose leaders have been convicted of violently opposing the government of the United States, including the transfer of presidential power as prescribed by the United States constitution It was incorporated in 2009 by founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes, a lawyer and former paratrooper In 2023, Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years for seditious conspiracy for his role in the attack, and another Oath Keepers leader, Kelly Meggs, was sentenced to 12 years for the same crime [409]\n\n\nQAnon\nQAnon is an American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017 [418] QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as \"Q\" Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, [419] [420] [421] cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump [425] Watchdogs studied QAnon posts and warned of the potential for violence ahead of January 6, 2021 [426] [427] [428] Multiple QAnon-affiliated protesters participated in the attack [429] [430] One participant, whose attire and behavior attracted worldwide media attention, was Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter nicknamed the \"QAnon Shaman\" [431] Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot dead by police as she was trying to break into the Speaker's Lobby, was a committed follower of QAnon [432] [433] The day before the attack, she had tweeted: \"the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours\" [434]\n\n\nWhite supremacists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates\nFar-right emblematic gear was worn by some participants, including neo-Confederate, Holocaust deniers, neo-Nazi and Völkisch-inspired neopagan apparel, as well as a shirt emblazoned with references to the Auschwitz concentration camp and its motto, Arbeit macht frei (\"Work sets you free\") [435] [394] [26] [436]\n\n\nOthers\nAlthough the anti-government Boogaloo movement mostly were opposed to Donald Trump, a Boogaloo follower said several groups under his command helped attack the Capitol, taking the opportunity to strike against the federal government [455] Also present during the attack were parts of the National Anarchist Movement and the Blue Lives Matter movement, supporters of the America First Movement, the Stop the Steal movement and the Patriot Movement, remnants of the Tea Party movement, the Three Percenters, the Groyper Army, Christian nationalists, and other far-right organizations and groups [26] Shirts with references to the internet meme Pepe the Frog were also seen, alongside \"1776\" and \"MAGA civil war 2021\" shirts, NSC-131 stickers, and the valknut symbol [456] Rioters were seen using the OK gesture, a gesture that had been famously co-opted as an alt-right symbol Christian imagery, including a large \"Jesus saves\" banner, was seen in the crowd of demonstrators Various other iconography was also on display, such as flags of other countries [k]\n\n\nPolice and military connections\nPolitico reported that some rioters briefly showed their police badges or military identification to law enforcement as they approached the Capitol, expecting to be let inside; a Capitol Police officer told BuzzFeed News that one rioter had told him \" [w]e're doing this for you\" as he flashed a badge [371] One former police officer, Laura Steele, was convicted for breaching the Capitol with fellow Oath Keepers [466]\n\n\nAnalysis\nIn February 2021, an academic analysis in The Atlantic found that of the 193 persons so far arrested for invading the Capitol, 89 percent had no clear public connection to established far-right militias, known white-nationalist gangs, or any other known militant organizations \"The overwhelming reason for action, cited again and again in court documents, was that arrestees were following Trump's orders to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the presidential-election winner\" They were older than participants in previous far-right violent demonstrations and more likely to be employed, with 40% being business owners The researchers concluded that these \"middle-aged, middle-class insurrectionists\" represented \"a new force in American politics – not merely a mix of right-wing organizations, but a broader mass political movement that has violence at its core and draws strength even from places where Trump supporters are in the minority\" [474]\n\n\nResults\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nCasualties and suicides\nAshli Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was fatally shot in the upper chest by Lt Michael Leroy Byrd while attempting to climb through the shattered window of a barricaded door [487] [l]\n\n\nDamage\nRioters stormed the offices of Nancy Pelosi, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; [308] [309] the office of the Senate Parliamentarian was ransacked; [285] art was looted; [7] and feces was tracked into several hallways [508] [19] [509] Windows were smashed throughout the building, leaving the floor littered with glass and debris [7] [510] Rioters damaged, turned over, or stole furniture [510] One door had \"Murder the Media\" scribbled onto it in all-caps [511] Rioters damaged Associated Press recording and broadcasting equipment outside the Capitol after chasing away reporters [512] Rioters also destroyed a display honoring the life of congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis [513] [514] A photo of Representative Andy Kim cleaning up the litter in the rotunda after midnight went viral [515]\n\n\nLaptop theft and cybersecurity concerns\nA laptop owned by Senator Jeff Merkley was stolen [520] A laptop taken from Pelosi's office was a \"laptop from a conference room .. that was only used for presentations\", according to Pelosi's deputy chief of staff [20] Representative Ruben Gallego said, \"we have to do a full review of what was taken, or copied, or even left behind in terms of bugs and listening devices\" [371] Military news website SOFREP reported that \"several\" secret‑level laptops were stolen, some of which had been abandoned while still logged in to SIPRNet, causing authorities to temporarily shut down SIPRNet for a security update on January 7 and leading the United States Army Special Operations Command to re-authorize all SIPRNet-connected computers on January 8 [521] [522]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of conviction, with every Democrat and seven Republicans voting to convict, but two-thirds of the Senate (67 votes) are required to convict [525] Many in the Trump administration resigned Several large companies [526] announced they were halting all political donations, and others have suspended funding the lawmakers who had objected to certifying Electoral College results [527] A bill was introduced to form an independent commission, similar to the 9/11 Commission, to investigate the events surrounding the attack; it passed the House but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate [528] The House then approved a House \"select committee\" to investigate the attack [529] In June, the Senate released the results of its own investigation of the attack The event led to strong criticism of law enforcement agencies Leading figures within the United States Capitol Police resigned [530] [531]\nA large-scale criminal investigation was undertaken, with the FBI opening more than 1,200 case files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nPolitical, legal, and social repercussions\nThe attack was followed by political, legal, and social repercussions The second impeachment of Donald Trump, who was charged for incitement of insurrection for his conduct, occurred on January 13 At the same time, Cabinet officials were pressured to invoke the 25th Amendment for removing Trump from office [524] Trump was subsequently acquitted in the Senate trial, which was held in February after Trump had already left office The result was a 57–43 vote in favor of

files Federal law enforcement undertook a nationwide manhunt for the perpetrators, with arrests and indictments following within days Over 890 people had been found guilty of federal crimes [532]\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nIn the aftermath of the attack, after drawing widespread condemnation from the U.S Congress, members of his administration, and the media, 45th U.S President Donald Trump released a video-taped statement on January 7, reportedly to stop the resignations of his staff and the threats of impeachment or removal from office In the statement, he condemned the violence at the U.S Capitol, saying that \"a new administration will be inaugurated\", which was widely seen as a concession, and his \"focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power\" to the Joe Biden administration [554] [555] Vanity Fair reported that Trump was at least partially convinced to make the statement by U.S Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who told Trump a sufficient number of Senate Republicans would support removing him from office unless he conceded [556] Kayleigh McEnany, the White House Press Secretary, had attempted to distance the administration from the rioters' behavior in a televised statement earlier in the day [557] On January 9, The New York Times reported that Trump had told White House aides he regretted committing to an orderly transition of power and would never resign from office [558] In a March 25 interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Capitol attackers, saying they were patriots who posed \"zero threat\", and he criticized law enforcement for \"persecuting\" the rioters [559]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nMore than seventy countries and international organizations expressed their concerns over the attack and condemned the violence, with some specifically condemning President Donald Trump's own role in inciting the attack [594] [595] Foreign leaders, diplomats, politicians, and institutions expressed shock, outrage, and condemnation of the events [596] [597] Multiple world leaders made a call for peace, describing the assault as \"an attack on democracy\" [598] The leaders of some countries, including Brazil, Poland, and Hungary, declined to condemn the situation, and described it as an internal U.S affair [599]\n\n\n14th Amendment disqualification\nIn late 2022 Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 presidential election Some legal scholars have argued that Trump should be barred from presidential office under section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because of his apparent support for the attack [601] Three states, Maine, Colorado, and Illinois, issued rulings to disqualify Trump from appearing on election ballots Trump appealed their decisions in Trump v Anderson The Supreme Court heard the case on February 8, 2024, and unanimously ruled on March 4, 2024 that states could not remove Trump from the ballot [25]\n\n\nSarbanes–Oxley Act prosecutions ruling and impact\nOn June 28, 2024, the U.S Supreme Court, in a 6–3 ruling, ruled in favor of defendant Joseph Fischer and found that a provision the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley Act could not be used to bring obstruction charges against January 6 defendants [603] Soon after the ruling, more January 6 prosecution cases would be reopened [604]\n\n\nAnalysis and terminology\nA week following the attack, journalists were searching for an appropriate word to describe the event [605] According to the Associated Press, U.S media outlets first described the developments on January 6 as \"a rally or protest\", but as the events of the day escalated and further reporting and images emerged, the descriptions shifted to \"an assault, a riot, an insurrection, domestic terrorism or even a coup attempt\" [606] It was variably observed that the media outlets were settling on the terms \"riot\" and \"insurrection\" [606] [607] According to NPR, \"By definition, 'insurrection', and its derivative, 'insurgency', are accurate 'Riot' and 'mob' are equally correct While these words are not interchangeable, they are all suitable when describing Jan 6.\" [608] The New York Times assessed the event as having brought the United States \"hours away from a full-blown constitutional crisis\" [609] Brian Stelter in CNN Business wrote that the events of the Capitol attack \"will be remembered as an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\" [610]\n\n\nHistorians' perspectives\nWhile there have been other instances of violence at the Capitol in the 19th and 20th centuries, this event was the most severe assault on the building since the 1814 burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812 The last attempt on the life of the vice president was a bomb plot against Thomas Marshall in July 1915 [634] For the first time in U.S history, a Confederate battle flag was flown inside the Capitol The Confederate States Army had never reached the Capitol, nor come closer than 6 miles (10 km) from the Capitol at the Battle of Fort Stevens, during the American Civil War [442] [o]\n\n\nSee also\nHouse

Her performances were met with critical acclaim, and she quickly established herself as a talented and dedicated actress.\n\nReeve's love of music was also evident in her career. She was a talented singer and performed in several musicals and concerts throughout her career. Her voice was described as warm and expressive, and she was known for her ability to convey emotion through her singing.\n\nDespite her many accomplishments, Reeve's career was not without its challenges. She faced many of the same challenges that other actresses face, including the constant scrutiny of the public eye and the pressure to maintain a certain image. However, Reeve's commitment to her craft and her passion for her work kept her grounded and focused.\n\n**Illness and Death**\n\nIn August 2005, Reeve announced that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer. This news was a devastating blow to both her and her family, and it marked a significant turning point in her life. Reeve's diagnosis was particularly surprising, as she had never smoked cigarettes, a primary risk factor for lung cancer.\n\nIn the months that followed, Reeve underwent treatment for her cancer. Despite her illness, she remained committed to her work and continued to perform and advocate for the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which she chaired after her husband's death.\n\nTragically, Reeve's cancer was diagnosed at a late stage, and she passed away on March 6, 2006, at the age of 44. Her death was met with an outpouring of grief from fans and colleagues alike, and it marked the end of an era for the Christopher Reeve Foundation.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOn March 11, 2007, the Christopher Reeve Foundation announced that it had changed its name to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. This decision was made in honor of Reeve's contribution to the foundation and her tireless efforts to raise awareness and funds for spinal cord research.\n\nReeve's legacy extends far beyond her work with the Christopher Reeve Foundation. She was a talented and dedicated actress, singer, and advocate who inspired countless people with her passion and commitment. Her memory continues to live on through the work of the foundation and the countless lives she touched through her performances and advocacy.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* \"All My Children\" (2002)\n* \"Law & Order\" (2000)\n* \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\" (2002)\n* \"Loving\" (2002)\n* \"Guys and Dolls\" (2002)\n* \"A Christmas Carol\" (2002)\n* \"The Boy Next Door\" (2002)\n* \"The Christmas Carol\" (2003)\n* \"The Boy Next Door\" (2003)\n* \"A Christmas Carol\" (2003)\n* \"The Boy Next Door\" (2004)\n* \"The Christmas Carol\" (2004)\n\nNote: This list is not exhaustive and is meant to provide a general overview of Reeve's filmography.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dana_Reeve\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and family\nReeve was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, to Charles Morosini (died 2018 [1]), a cardiologist, and Helen Simpson Morosini (died  2005) [2] She was of Italian descent [3]\n\n\nShow business career\nHer many singing and acting credits included appearances on television, where she had guest roles on Dick Wolf's Law & Order, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, soap operas All My Children as Eva Stroupe and Loving, among others She performed at theatres on Broadway, off-Broadway, and at numerous regional theatres.\n\n\nIllness and death\nIn August 2005, ten months after the death of her husband, [13] Reeve announced that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer [14] She had never smoked cigarettes, [14] a primary risk factor, but in her early career often sang in bars and hotel lobbies with exposure to secondhand smoke [15]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn March 11, 2007, the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which Dana chaired after her husband, Christopher Reeve, died in October 2004, [17] announced that it had changed its name to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation on the first anniversary of her death [19]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "content": "\nBackground\nFor weeks prior to the impeachment, President Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 election\nFor weeks prior to the impeachment, President Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nJanuary 6 U.S. Capitol attack\nTrump told his supporters to come to Washington D.C on January 6, the day Congress was counting the electoral votes, to the \"March to Save America\" rally at The Ellipse [7] During the rally, Trump as well as other speakers falsely claimed that the election was stolen, used the word \"fight\", made an analogy to boxing, [8] and suggested that his supporters had the power to prevent President-elect Joe Biden from taking office [9]\n\n\nConsidered scenarios\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\n\n\nResignation\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president While Article II of the Constitution states that the \"Powers and Duties\" of the president devolve to the vice president in the event of the president's death, resignation, incapacity, or removal, John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, interpreted that provision as allowing the Vice President to ascend to the presidency in such cases, without any qualifications This practice was codified in 1967, with the passage of the 25th Amendment.\n\n\n14th Amendment\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the Reconstruction Amendments It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress.\n\n\n25th Amendment\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with presidential succession and disability Though the amendment thus far has been used in medical situations, Section 4 provides that the vice president, together with a majority of Cabinet secretaries, may declare the president unable to carry out his duties, after which the vice president immediately assumes the duties of the president.\n\n\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up These articles are then voted on by House members Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate [27] [28]\n\n\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment [30] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots [31] [32] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\n\n\nRaskin bill\nThe 25th Amendment allows Congress to establish a committee to determine when a president is unfit to serve (section 4 of the Amendment provides that the \"declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" is made by \"the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments  [i.e., the Cabinet] or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\") [39] However, such a committee has never been established In May 2017, Representative Jamie Raskin (D–MD-8) introduced legislation to create a standing, independent, nonpartisan body, called the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity, to make such a determination The bill had 20 cosponsors [40] Raskin had previously introduced a legislative proposal under the same title with the same purpose back in 2017.\n\n\nImpeachment\nWithin hours of the Capitol attack, members of Congress began to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump as president Several representatives began the process of independently drafting various articles of impeachment Of these attempts, the first to become public were those of Representative Ilhan Omar (D–MN-5) who drafted and introduced articles of impeachment against Trump [42] [43] [44] [45]\n\n\nDrafted articles of impeachment\nWithin hours of the Capitol attack, members of Congress began to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump as president Several representatives began the process of independently drafting various articles of impeachment Of these attempts, the first to become public were those of Representative Ilhan Omar (D–MN-5) who drafted and introduced articles of impeachment against Trump [42] [43] [44] [45]\n\n\nArticle of impeachment introduced\nOn January 11, 2021, U.S Representatives David Cicilline, along with Jamie Raskin and Ted Lieu, introduced an article of impeachment against Trump, charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" in urging his supporters to march on the Capitol building The article contended that Trump made several statements that \"encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action\" that interfered with Congress' constitutional duty to certify the election It argued that by his actions, Trump \"threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government\", doing so in a way that rendered him \"a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution\" if he were allowed to complete his term [36] [52] By the time it was introduced, 218 of the 222 House Democrats had signed on as cosponsors, assuring its passage [53] Trump was impeached in a vote on January 13, 2021; ten Republicans, including House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, joined all of the Democrats in supporting the article.\n\n\nHouse vote\nThe second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States (in office from 2017 to 2021), began on February 9, 2021, and concluded with his acquittal on February 13 Donald Trump had been impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021 The House adopted one article of impeachment against Trump: incitement of insurrection He is the only U.S president and only federal official to be impeached twice He was impeached by the House seven days prior to the expiration of his term and the inauguration of Joe Biden Because he left office before the trial, this was the first impeachment trial of a former president [57] The article of impeachment addressed Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results (including his claims of election fraud and his efforts to pressure election officials in Georgia) and stated that Trump incited the attack on the Capitol in Washington, D.C., while Congress was convened to count the electoral votes and certify the victory of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [58]\n\n\nSenate trial\nThe second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States (in office from 2017 to 2021), began on February 9, 2021, and concluded with his acquittal on February 13 Donald Trump had been impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021 The House adopted one article of impeachment against Trump: incitement of insurrection He is the only U.S president and only federal official to be

pressure election officials in Georgia) and stated that Trump incited the attack on the Capitol in Washington, D.C., while Congress was convened to count the electoral votes and certify the victory of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris [58]\n\n\nOpinions\nIn the aftermath of the attack, members of media and political organizations expressed support for Trump to be either impeached or removed through the methods outlined in the 25th Amendment Any impeachment by the House of Representatives requires a trial and conviction in the Senate, with the concurrence of two-thirds of Senators present and voting needed to remove the President from office During the impeachment and trial process, the President remains in office On January 8, the extent of support among Senators for an impeachment process was unclear, particularly given the length of time necessary to organize a trial and the short duration remaining of Trump's presidency [68] Poll aggregate website FiveThirtyEight said that roughly 85% of Democrats, 49% of Independents, and 16% of Republicans supported impeachment The site also found roughly an 8% drop in Trump's approval ratings following the attack [69] [70]\n\n\nSupport\nIn the

Congress called for Trump to be impeached or stripped of his powers and duties under the 25th Amendment [73] Other House members, as well as several state officials, called for Trump's immediate removal by Congress under the 25th Amendment [74] [75] [76] [77] On January 6, four \"senior Republican elected officials\" told CNN that they believe Trump should be removed via the 25th Amendment, while two other Republican elected officials said Trump should be removed by impeachment [77] On January 11, 24 former Republican members of Congress came out in support of impeachment [78]\n\n\nHouse Democrats\nThe day of the attack, many House Democrats, including Seth Moulton, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Katherine Clark, called for Trump's immediate impeachment and removal by Congress, or via the 25th Amendment [74] [75] [73] [79] Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, urged the removal of Trump via the 25th Amendment, and announced she was prepared to vote on articles of impeachment if this does not happen [80] Pelosi said Trump is \"a very dangerous person who should not continue in office\" [81] In vowing to impeach Trump again if his cabinet does not remove him themselves, Pelosi said Trump \"incited an armed insurrection against America\" and that \"the gleeful desecration of the U.S Capitol, which is the temple of our American democracy, and the violence targeting Congress are horrors that will forever stain our nation's history – instigated by the president.\" [82]\n\n\nHouse Republicans\nThe first House Republican to call

45th president of the United States, was a significant event in American history. On January 13, 2021, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump for the second time, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. The impeachment was the result of Trump's actions and rhetoric that many believed incited the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol.\n\n**Background**\n\nFor weeks prior to the impeachment, President Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. Despite losing the election to Joe Biden, Trump refused to concede and instead claimed that the election was stolen. This claim was repeatedly debunked by election officials, courts, and fact-checkers.\n\n**January 6 U.S. Capitol attack**\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump told his supporters to come to Washington D.C. to the \"March to Save America\" rally at The Ellipse. During the rally, Trump falsely claimed that the election was stolen, used the word \"fight\", made an analogy to boxing, and suggested that his supporters had the power to prevent President-elect Joe Biden from taking office. This rhetoric was seen by many as inciting violence and insurrection.\n\n**Considered Scenarios**\n\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\n\n**Resignation**\n\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president. However, this option was not considered viable, as Trump had shown no willingness to resign.\n\n**14th Amendment**\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law. Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress. However, this option was not considered viable, as it would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate to pass.\n\n**25th Amendment**\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with presidential succession and disability. Section 4 provides that the Vice President, together with a majority of Cabinet secretaries, may declare the President unable to carry out his duties, after which the Vice President immediately assumes the duties of the President. However, this option was not considered viable, as it would require at least eight Cabinet members to agree to invoke the amendment.\n\n**Impeachment and Conviction**\n\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up. Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass. Once an article has been passed in the House, the President has been impeached. The articles are then sent to the Senate for adjudication with an impeachment trial. After views have been laid out in the trial, the Senate moves to vote on conviction. Each article requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present to pass. If an article passes in the Senate, the President has been convicted and is removed from office.\n\n**Invoking the 25th Amendment**\n\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment. The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S. Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". However, this option was not considered viable, as it would require at least eight Cabinet members to agree to invoke the amendment.\n\n**Raskin Bill**\n\nThe 25th Amendment allows Congress to establish a committee to determine when a President is unfit to serve. However, such a committee has never been established. In May 2017, Representative Jamie Raskin introduced legislation to create a standing, independent, nonpartisan body, called the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity, to make such a determination.\n\n**Impeachment**\n\nWithin hours of the Capitol attack, members of Congress began to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump as President. Several representatives began the process of independently drafting various articles of impeachment. Of these attempts, the first to become public were those of Representative Ilhan Omar, who drafted and introduced articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\n**Article of Impeachment Introduced**\n\nOn January 11, 2021, U.S. Representatives David Cicilline, along with Jamie Raskin and Ted Lieu, introduced an article of impeachment against Trump, charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" in urging his supporters to march on the Capitol building. The article contended that Trump made several statements that \"encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action\" that interfered with Congress' constitutional duty to certify the election. By the time it was introduced, 218 of the 222 House Democrats had signed on as cosponsors, assuring its passage.\n\n**House Vote**\n\nThe second impeachment trial of Donald Trump began on February 9, 2021, and concluded with his acquittal on February 13. Trump was impeached in a vote on January 13, 2021; ten Republicans, including House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, joined all of the Democrats in supporting the article.\n\n**Senate Trial**\n\nThe second impeachment trial of Donald Trump was a significant event in American history. On February 13, 2021, the Senate voted to acquit Trump, making him the first U.S. President to be acquitted twice. The impeachment was the result of Trump's actions and rhetoric that many believed incited the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol.\n\n**Opinions**\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, members of media and political organizations expressed support for Trump to be either impeached or removed through the methods outlined in the 25th Amendment. Any impeachment by the House of Representatives requires a trial and conviction in the Senate, with the concurrence of two-thirds of Senators present and voting needed to remove the President from office.\n\n**Support**\n\nAt least 200 members of Congress called for Trump to be impeached or stripped of his powers and duties under the 25th Amendment. Other House members, as well as several state officials, called for Trump's immediate removal by Congress under the 25th Amendment. On January 6, four \"senior Republican elected officials\" told CNN that they believe Trump should be removed via the 25th Amendment, while two other Republican elected officials said Trump should be removed by impeachment.\n\n**House Democrats**\n\nSpeaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, urged the removal of Trump via the 25th Amendment, and announced she was prepared to vote on articles of impeachment if this does not happen. Pelosi said Trump is \"a very dangerous person who should not continue in office\".\n\n**House Republicans**\n\nThe first House Republican to call outright for Trump's removal from office was Adam Kinzinger; he tweeted in favor of the 25th Amendment the day after the riot.\n\n**Senate Democrats**\n\nBy January 7, Democrat Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, had called for Trump's immediate removal from office, as had many other Democratic members of the U.S. Senate, such as Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine, and Amy Klobuchar.\n\n**Senate Republicans**\n\nOn January 8, Republican senator Ben Sasse said he was willing to consider an impeachment because Trump had violated his oath of office.\n\n**State Elected Officials**\n\nAfter the attack, the following governors and lieutenant governors said that Trump should be removed from office.\n\n**Former Governors**\n\nAbout 175 career diplomats in the State Department, mostly lawyers, called on Mike Pompeo to support consultations with other cabinet officials on possibly invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.

presidential election.\n\n\nJanuary 6 U.S. Capitol attack\nTrump told his supporters to come to Washington D.C on January 6, the day Congress was counting the electoral votes, to the \"March to Save America\" rally at The Ellipse [7] During the rally, Trump as well as other speakers falsely claimed that the election was stolen, used the word \"fight\", made an analogy to boxing, [8] and suggested that his supporters had the power to prevent President-elect Joe Biden from taking office [9]\n\n\nConsidered scenarios\nFour scenarios for the removal of Trump from office had been posited by members of Congress, members of Trump's cabinet, political commentators, or legal scholars: resignation, the invocation of the 14th Amendment, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment and conviction.\n\n\nResignation\nThe President of the United States can resign from office, in which case the Vice President will automatically become president, instead of merely assuming the powers and duties of the presidency as acting president While Article II of the Constitution states that the \"Powers and Duties\" of the president devolve to the vice president in the event of the president's death, resignation, incapacity, or removal, John Tyler, the tenth president of the United States, interpreted that provision as allowing the Vice President to ascend to the presidency in such cases, without any qualifications This practice was codified in 1967, with the passage of the 25th Amendment.\n\n\n14th Amendment\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is one of the Reconstruction Amendments It addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law, and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War Section 3 states that a person who participated in insurrection after having taken an oath to support the Constitution is disqualified from holding future office unless permitted by Congress.\n\n\n25th Amendment\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution deals with presidential succession and disability Though the amendment thus far has been used in medical situations, Section 4 provides that the vice president, together with a majority of Cabinet secretaries, may declare the president unable to carry out his duties, after which the vice president immediately assumes the duties of the president.\n\n\nImpeachment and conviction\nImpeachment begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drawn up These articles are then voted on by House members Each article is voted on separately and requires a simple majority to pass Once an article has been passed in the House, the president has been impeached The articles are then sent to the

pass If an article passes in the Senate, the president has been convicted and is removed from office Once the president is convicted, a further vote may then be held which determines whether the (now-former) president is barred from holding future office; this vote passes with a simple majority in the Senate [27] [28]\n\n\nInvoking the 25th Amendment\nOn the evening of January 6, CBS News reported that Cabinet members were discussing invoking the 25th Amendment [30] The ten Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, led by U.S Representative David Cicilline, sent a letter to Pence to \"emphatically urge\" him to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", claiming that he incited and condoned the riots [31] [32] For invocation, Pence and at least eight Cabinet members, forming a simple majority, would have to consent Additionally, if challenged by Trump, the second invocation would maintain Pence as acting president, subject to a vote of approval in both houses of Congress, with a two-thirds supermajority necessary in each chamber to sustain However, Congress would not have needed to act before January 20 for Pence to remain acting president until Biden was inaugurated, per the timeline described in Section 4.\n\n\nRaskin bill\nThe 25th Amendment allows Congress to establish a committee to determine when a president is unfit to serve (section 4 of the Amendment provides that the \"declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" is made by \"the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments  [i.e., the Cabinet] or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\") [39] However, such a committee has never been established In May 2017, Representative Jamie Raskin (D–MD-8) introduced legislation to create a standing, independent, nonpartisan body, called the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity, to make such a determination The bill had 20 cosponsors [40] Raskin had previously introduced a legislative proposal under the same title with the same purpose back in 2017.\n\n\nImpeachment\nWithin hours of the Capitol attack, members of Congress began to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump as president Several representatives began the process of

threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution\" if he were allowed to complete his term [36] [52] By the time it was introduced, 218 of the 222 House Democrats had signed on as

2020 presidential election results (including his claims of election fraud and his efforts to pressure election officials in Georgia) and stated that Trump incited the attack on the Capitol in

During his last season with the Trojans, Barber amassed 1,778 rushing yards with 18 touchdowns and led his team with 10 interceptions, three of which came against Gatorade National Player of the Year and future Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer. In baseball, he was an Honorable Mention All-Conference center fielder. In his first and only track season, Barber qualified for the 2001 Minnesota State Class AA Championships in the 100 meters, finishing the season with a 100m time of 10.9 seconds.\n\nCollege Career\n\nLike his father, Barber attended the University of Minnesota, where he played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The coaches originally wanted him to play safety, but after seeing him run, they kept him at running back, where he eventually ranked fourth on the school's all-time rushing list with 3,276 yards, second with 4,495 all-purpose yards, and second in rushing touchdowns with 35, one better than his father, Marion Barber Jr. Also beginning in his sophomore year, he teamed up with running back Laurence Maroney to form one of the best running back duos in college football, becoming the first teammates in Division I (NCAA) history to each rush for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons. He was an All-Big Ten Conference selection in 2003 as a redshirted sophomore.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nAfter forgoing his senior season of college, the Dallas Cowboys selected Barber in the fourth round, with the 109th overall selection, of the 2005 NFL draft. A toe infection that required surgery and some preseason fumbles left him at the bottom of the depth chart. An injury to Julius Jones and the ineffectiveness of Anthony Thomas allowed Barber to emerge, and he responded with 95 yards rushing against Seattle and 127 yards against Arizona. Along with his pass-blocking and special teams abilities, this solidified his position as the backup running back for the Cowboys.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nAfter forgoing his senior season of college, the Dallas Cowboys selected Barber in the fourth round, with the 109th overall selection, of the 2005 NFL draft.

Along with his pass-blocking and special teams abilities, this solidified his position as the backup running back for the Cowboys.\n\nIn 2007, Barber became the starting running back for the Cowboys, replacing Julius Jones. He went on to have a successful season, rushing for 975 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Cowboys finished the season with a 13-3 record and won the NFC East division title.\n\nIn 2008, Barber continued to be a key player for the Cowboys, rushing for 654 yards and 10 touchdowns. However, the team struggled on the field, finishing with a 9-7 record and missing the playoffs.\n\nChicago Bears\n\nBarber was released by the Cowboys on July 28, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Chicago Bears signed Barber to a two-year, $5 million contract. Barber beat out Chester Taylor for the Chicago Bears' second-string running back position after Matt Forte.\n\nNFL Career Statistics\n\nIn his eight-year NFL career, Barber rushed for 4,299 yards and 32 touchdowns. He also had 1,373 receiving yards and 4 touchdowns.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n\nIn 2014, Barber was detained by police and given a mental evaluation following an incident. The nature of the incident was not disclosed.\n\nBarber's father, Marion Barber Jr., passed away on March 1, 2017, at the age of 57.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marion_Barber_III\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBarber attended Wayzata High School in Plymouth, Minnesota, [2] and was a standout in football, baseball, and track In football, he was a SuperPrep and PrepStar All-Midwest and consensus All-State honoree as a senior running back and as a defensive back During his last season with the Trojans, Barber amassed 1,778 rushing yards with 18 touchdowns and led his team with 10 interceptions (three of which came against Gatorade National Player of the Year and future Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer) [3] In baseball, he was an Honorable Mention All-Conference center fielder In his first and only track season, Barber qualified for the 2001 Minnesota State Class AA Championships in the 100 meters He finished the season with a 100m time of 10.9 seconds [4]\n\n\nCollege career\nLike his father, Barber attended the University of Minnesota where he played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers The coaches originally wanted him to play safety, but after seeing him run, they kept him at running back where he eventually ranked fourth on the school's all-time rushing list with 3,276 yards, second with 4,495 all-purpose yards, and second in rushing touchdowns with 35, one better than his father, Marion Barber Jr Also beginning in his sophomore year, he teamed up with running back Laurence Maroney to form one of the best running back duos in college football, becoming the first-teammates in Division I (NCAA) history to each rush for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons [5] He was an All-Big Ten Conference selection in 2003 as a redshirted sophomore [6]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAfter forgoing his senior season of college, the Dallas Cowboys selected Barber in the fourth round, with the 109th overall selection, of the 2005 NFL draft [9] A toe infection that required surgery and some preseason fumbles left him at the bottom of the depth chart An injury to Julius Jones and the ineffectiveness of Anthony Thomas allowed Barber to emerge, and he responded with 95 yards rushing against Seattle and 127 yards against Arizona Along with his pass-blocking and special teams abilities, this solidified his position as the backup running back for the Cowboys [10]\n\n\nDallas Cowboys\nAfter forgoing his senior season of college, the Dallas Cowboys selected Barber in the fourth round, with the 109th overall selection, of the 2005 NFL draft [9] A toe infection that required surgery and some preseason fumbles left him at the bottom of the depth chart An injury to Julius Jones and the ineffectiveness of Anthony Thomas allowed Barber to emerge, and he responded with 95 yards rushing against Seattle and 127 yards against Arizona Along with his pass-blocking and special teams abilities, this solidified his position as the backup running back for the Cowboys [10]\n\n\nChicago Bears\nBarber was released by Dallas on July 28, 2011 [21] On July 30, 2011, the Chicago Bears signed Barber to a two-year, $5 million contract [22] Barber beat out Chester Taylor for the Chicago Bears' second string running back position after Matt Forte [23]\n\n\nNFL career statistics\nIn 2014, Barber was detained by police and given a mental evaluation following an incident [26]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nIn 2014, Barber was detained by police and given a mental evaluation following an incident [26]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

in the United States by State\n=====================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nAbortion laws in the United States vary significantly from state to state. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, the federal right to abortion was established. However, with the Dobbs ruling, individual states have been granted the authority to regulate or prohibit abortion within their jurisdictions. This article provides an overview of the current status of abortion laws in each state and territory in the United States.\n\nLegal History\n-------------\n\nPrior to the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade (1973) established a federal right to abortion. However, the decision also established a framework for states to regulate abortion to some extent, particularly after fetal viability. The Court's decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1992) further clarified the framework, holding that a state's interest in regulating abortion could be justified if it was based on a legitimate interest in promoting fetal life or protecting the health of the pregnant woman.\n\nCurrent Legal Status of Abortion by State, Territory, or District\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the aftermath of the Dobbs ruling, state legislation and court rulings determine most aspects of abortion access in the United States.

{"title": "Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey", "content": "\nBackground\nIn Casey, the plaintiffs challenged five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 authored by state Rep Stephen F Freind, [4] arguing that the provisions were unconstitutional under Roe v Wade The Court in Roe was the first to establish abortion as a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S Constitution The majority in Roe further held that women have a privacy interest protecting their right to abortion embedded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment The five provisions at issue in Casey are summarized below.\n\n\nDistrict Court's ruling\nThe plaintiffs were five abortion clinics, a class of physicians who provided abortion services, and one physician representing himself independently They filed suit in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the state from enforcing the five provisions and have them declared facially unconstitutional The District Court, after a three-day bench trial, held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them [5]\n\n\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals decision\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement [6] The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly burdensome because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress at the hands of their husbands [7] Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court's invalidation of that requirement Thirty-one years later, as a Supreme Court Justice, Alito wrote the opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe and Casey [8] [9]\n\n\nSupreme Court's consideration\nAt the conference of the Justices two days after oral argument, Souter defied expectations, joining Justices Stevens, Blackmun, and Sandra Day O'Connor, who had all dissented three years earlier in Webster v Reproductive Health Services with regard to that plurality's suggested reconsideration and narrowing of Roe This resulted in a precarious five-Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions and overturning Roe; however, Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter, and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices O'Connor and Souter to write a plurality opinion that would reaffirm Roe [10]\n\n\nSupreme Court's opinions\nExcept for the three opening sections of the O'Connor–Kennedy–Souter opinion, Casey was a divided judgment, as no other sections of any opinion were joined by a majority of justices The plurality opinion jointly written by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter was recognized as the principal opinion [11] [a]\n\n\nO'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter plurality opinion\nIn the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v Casey, the authors of the plurality opinion abandoned Roe's strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to have an abortion before viability [1] Roe had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to \"strict scrutiny\"—the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental Constitutional rights Casey instead re-adopted the lower, undue burden standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions, [b] but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution [c] The authors of the plurality opinion likewise noted the U.S government's previous challenges to Roe v Wade [d] and expounded on the concept of \"liberty.\" [e]\n\n\nUpholding the \"essential holding\" in Roe\nThe plurality opinion stated that it was upholding what it called the \"essential holding\" of Roe The essential holding consisted of three parts: (1) Women had the right to have an abortion prior to viability and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State could restrict the abortion procedure post-viability, so long as the law contained exceptions for pregnancies which endangered the woman's life or health; and (3) the State had legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child [12] The plurality asserted that the fundamental right to abortion was grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the plurality reiterated what the Court said in Eisenstadt v Baird: \"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\"\n\n\nStare decisis analysis\nThe plurality's opinion included a thorough discussion on the doctrine of stare decisis (respect of precedent), and provided a clear explanation for why the doctrine had to be applied in Casey with regards to Roe The authors of the plurality opinion emphasized that stare decisis had to apply in Casey because the Roe rule had not been proven intolerable; the rule had become subject \"to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation\"; the law had not developed in such a way around the rule that left the rule \"no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine\"; and the facts had not changed, nor viewed differently, to \"rob the old rule of significant application or justification.\" [13] The plurality acknowledged that it was important for the Court to stand by prior decisions, even those decisions some found unpopular, unless there was a change in the fundamental reasoning underpinning the previous decision The authors of the plurality opinion, making a special note of the precedential value of Roe v Wade, and specifically how women's lives were changed by that decision, [14] stated,\n\n\nViability of the fetus\nAlthough it upheld the \"essential holding\" in Roe, and recognized that women had some constitutional liberty to terminate their pregnancies, the O'Connor–Kennedy–Souter plurality overturned the Roe trimester framework in favor of a viability analysis The Roe trimester framework completely forbade states from regulating abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, permitted regulations designed to protect a woman's health in the second trimester, and permitted prohibitions on abortion during the third trimester (when the fetus becomes viable) under the justification of fetal protection, and so long as the life or health of the mother was not at risk [20] The plurality found that continuing advancements in medical technology had proven that a fetus could be considered viable at 23 or 24 weeks rather than at the 28 weeks previously understood by the Court in Roe [15] The plurality thus redrew the line of increasing state interest at viability because of increasing medical accuracy about when fetus viability takes place Likewise, the authors of the plurality opinion felt that fetus viability was \"more workable\" than the trimester framework [21]\nUnder this new fetus viability framework, the plurality held that at the point of viability and subsequent to viability, the state could promote its interest in the \"potentiality of human life\" by regulating, or possibly proscribing, abortion \"except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" [22] Prior to fetus viability, the plurality held, the State can show concern for fetal development, but it cannot pose an undue burden on a woman's fundamental right to abortion [23] The plurality reasoned that the new pre- and post-viability line would still uphold the essential holding of Roe, which recognized both the woman's constitutionally protected liberty, and the State's \"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\" [f]\n\n\nUndue burden standard\nIn replacing the trimester framework with the viability framework, the plurality also replaced the strict scrutiny analysis under Roe, with the \"undue burden\" standard previously developed by O'Connor in her dissent in Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health [25] According to the dissenters in Akron, the undue burden standard had been the governing rule in Roe's first decade A legal restriction posing an undue burden is one that has \"the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\" [26] An undue burden is found even where a statute purports to further the interest of potential life or another valid state interest, if it places a substantial obstacle in the path of access to abortion [26] The Supreme Court in the 2016 case Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt clarified what the 'undue burden' test requires: \"Casey requires courts to consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\" [27] [28] The Supreme Court further clarified in the 2020 June Medical Services, LLC v Russo opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer with respect to the undue burden standard: \" [T]his standard requires courts independently to review the legislative findings upon which an abortion-related statute rests and to weigh the law's \"asserted benefits against the burdens\" it imposes on abortion access 579 U.S., at ___(slip op., at 21) (citing Gonzales v Carhart, 550 U S 124, 165 (2007)).\" [29] In Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt the court described the undue burden standard in its overall context with these words:\n\n\nKey judgment\nChief Justice John Roberts's concurrence in the 2020 June Medical Services, LLC v Russo case noted the key outcomes in Casey: \"The several restrictions that did not impose a substantial obstacle were constitutional, while the restriction that did impose a substantial obstacle was unconstitutional.\" [38] Before an abortion regulation can be struck down as unconstitutional there must be a determination that this regulation imposes a substantial obstacle in light of the undue burden standard explained in the section above [39] In Casey \"the justices imposed a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions The new standard asks whether a state abortion regulation has the purpose or effect of imposing an \"undue burden\", which is defined as a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" [40] [41] The key judgment of Casey can be summed up as follows: \"Under Casey, abortion regulations are valid so long as they do not pose a substantial obstacle and meet the threshold requirement of being \"reasonably related\" to a \"legitimate purpose.\" Id., at 878; id., at 882 (joint opinion).\" [42]\n\n\nConcurrence/dissents\nJustices Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, who both joined the plurality in part, also each filed opinions concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part Chief Justice William Rehnquist filed an opinion concurring in the Court's judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was joined by Justices Byron White, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, none of whom joined any part of the plurality Justice Scalia also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, which was also joined by Rehnquist, White, and Thomas.\n\n\nRehnquist and Scalia, joined by White and Thomas\nRehnquist and Scalia each joined the plurality in upholding the parental consent, informed consent, and waiting period laws However, they dissented from the plurality's decision to uphold Roe v Wade and strike down the spousal notification law, contending that Roe was incorrectly decided In his opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist questioned the fundamental right to an abortion, the \"right to privacy\", and the strict scrutiny application in Roe [43] He also questioned the new \"undue burden\" analysis under the plurality opinion, instead deciding that the proper analysis for the regulation of abortions was rational-basis [44]\n\n\nStevens and Blackmun\nJustices Blackmun and Stevens wrote opinions in which they approved of the plurality's preservation of Roe and rejection of the spousal notification law They did not agree with the plurality's decision to uphold the other three laws at issue.\n\n\nSupreme Court's holdings overturned\nIn May 2022, Politico obtained a leaked initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito suggesting that the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Casey along with Roe in a pending final decision on Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization [8] On June 24, 2022, the final opinion was issued, [56] with the Court overturning the \"essential opinion\" in Roe, [h] criticizing the Casey Court's failure to address the deficiencies of the Roe decision [i] and overturning the \"key judgment\" in Casey [j]\n\n\nSee

Casey**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that redefined the constitutional standard for abortion regulations. The case was decided on June 29, 1992, and had a profound impact on the abortion debate in the United States. The case involved a challenge to five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, which were argued to be unconstitutional under the Roe v. Wade decision. The Court's decision established a new standard for evaluating abortion regulations, one that would have far-reaching implications for the future of abortion rights in the United States.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court established that abortion is a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court held that a woman has a right to have an abortion before viability, and that the state may not impose an undue burden on this right. However, the Court also established a trimester framework, which completely forbade states from regulating abortion during the first trimester, permitted regulations designed to protect a woman's health in the second trimester, and permitted prohibitions on abortion during the third trimester (when the fetus becomes viable) under the justification of fetal protection, and so long as the life or health of the mother was not at risk.\n\n**District Court's Ruling**\n\nThe plaintiffs in Planned Parenthood v. Casey were five abortion clinics, a class of physicians who provided abortion services, and one physician representing himself independently. They filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the state from enforcing the five provisions of the Abortion Control Act and to have them declared facially unconstitutional. After a three-day bench trial, the District Court held that all the provisions were unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them.\n\n**Third Circuit Court of Appeals Decision**\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly burdensome because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress at the hands of their husbands. Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court's invalidation of that requirement.\n\n**Supreme Court's Consideration**\n\nAt the conference of the Justices two days after oral argument, Souter defied expectations, joining Justices Stevens, Blackmun, and Sandra Day O'Connor, who had all dissented three years earlier in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services with regard to that plurality's suggested reconsideration and narrowing of Roe. This resulted in a precarious five-Justice majority consisting of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas that favored upholding all five contested abortion restrictions and overturning Roe; however, Kennedy changed his mind shortly thereafter, and joined with fellow Reagan-Bush justices O'Connor and Souter to write a plurality opinion that would reaffirm Roe.\n\n**Supreme Court's Opinions**\n\nExcept for the three opening sections of the O'Connor-Kennedy-Souter opinion, Casey was a divided judgment, as no other sections of any opinion were joined by a majority of justices. The plurality opinion jointly written by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter was recognized as the principal opinion.\n\n**O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter Plurality Opinion**\n\nIn the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the authors of the plurality opinion abandoned Roe's strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to have an abortion before viability. The plurality opinion re-adopted the lower, undue burden standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions, but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution. The authors of the plurality opinion noted the U.S. government's previous challenges to Roe v.

Born in 1987 in Pohang, South Korea, Jung's life has been marked by perseverance and determination, which have enabled him to overcome numerous challenges and achieve success in the highly competitive world of mixed martial arts.\n\nBackground\nJung was born in 1987 in Pohang, South Korea. At a young age, he moved to Namyangju, a satellite city of Seoul, where he spent most of his childhood. Due to his slight stature and rural origins, Jung was frequently bullied by his classmates. To cope with this, he developed a strong desire to protect himself, which led him to start training in martial arts at a relatively young age.

Jung made his WEC debut on April 24, 2010, at WEC 48, where he faced Leonard Garcia. The fight was a highly competitive bout, with both fighters giving their all in the Octagon. Unfortunately for Jung, the fight was decided by a split decision, which was met with controversy among fans and MMA publications.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the fight, Jung's performance earned him the Fight of the Night honors, which was later declared the Fight of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This impressive victory marked a turning point in Jung's career, as he began to gain recognition as a formidable opponent in the world of mixed martial arts.\n\nSengoku\nJung's career in Sengoku was marked by a series of impressive victories, which earned him a reputation as a formidable opponent in the world of mixed martial arts.

and McKay Paramount Pictures secured the rights in August 2012 and revived the production, [63] [64] [65] but in April 2016 the film adaptation was cancelled and it was reported that Cinemax would be developing a television series adaptation of the comic book instead Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who at the time were working on the series Preacher (also based on a comic book series by Ennis), were recruited as executive producers and directors for the pilot episode [65] Eric Kripke, a longtime fan of Ennis's work, was hired as the series showrunner and head writer [65]\n\n\nWriting\nThe series takes place in a universe where most of the superpowered people (referred to as \"Supes\") pretend to be heroic to ensure that they are loved by the public, while working for Vought which is a company that monetizes and markets them, but in reality, outside their heroic personas, they are actually corrupt celebrities who abuse their powers out of selfishness for personal gain, which serves as a deconstruction of the superhero genre and the idealisms of heroism that they are supposed to represent in contrast to DC and Marvel [100] [101] The series attempts to more realistically portray how superheroes would enmesh themselves into contemporary culture, with many of them having an influence as political figures, over-worshipped celebrities, and profitable marketing tools for a hyper-consumerist society [102] Many of the Supes that appear in the series are also a direct parody from very popular superheroes from Marvel and DC intending to give them more depraved, problematic and realistic counterparts, with each season introducing a new Supe that is derived from a popular superheroic character [103] [104]\n\n\nCasting\nMiddle: Dominique McElligott, Jessie T Usher, Laz Alonso, and Chace Crawford\n\n\nFilming\nAlthough situated in New York City as in the comics, it was confirmed that the series would be filmed in Toronto, Canada [145] In November 2017, it was announced that filming for the series was slated to begin in 2018 with hopes of releasing it in 2019 Though the series was mainly shot in Toronto, it was confirmed that additional filming would take place across the Golden Horseshoe area, including Mississauga and Hamilton [66] [146]\n\n\nVisual effects\nThe visual effects consist of computer-generated imagery (CGI), green screen, digi-doubles, and green screen plates [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nMusic\nSoundtrack albums for every season have been released by Madison Gate Records [175] [176] [177] [178] Both Christopher Lennertz and Matt Bowen serve as the series' composers It was confirmed that Lennertz would be composing the score for the series in July 2018, having previously collaborated with Kripke on Supernatural and Revolution (2012–2014) [179] Bowen became co-composer starting with season three; though he only co-composed two episodes of the third season, Bowen co-composed all episodes of season four with Lennertz [180] During an interview at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Lennertz stated that his work for The Boys was the \"craziest thing\" he has ever done, after collaborating with Rogen for Sausage Party (2016) [181]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe series explores issues like systemic racism, white nationalism, white supremacy, and xenophobia, with Kripke seeing an opportunity to introduce Stormfront, a racist superhero who believes in Nazism [198] [199] [200] Kripke stated that unlike the comics, where Stormfront is male, the character would be gender-swapped for the series with the intention of creating \"Homelander's worst nightmare that would be a strong woman who wasn't afraid of him and proceeded to steal his spotlight\" [201] The series contains political satire, and many consider the show to be a critique of conservatism and far-right politics [202] [203] It has also made references to corporate corruption, homophobia, police brutality, and sexual harassment [204] [205]\n\n\nRelease\nAs part of the TV and N.O.W lineup, the pilot episode (\"The Name of the Game\") had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival, presented by AT&T, on April 29, 2019 Following the screening, Kripke and

wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties [20] During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24–10 record and a WCC regular season title, which was not enough to land an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament [20] They earned a bid into the NIT and beat Wyoming 69–55 in the first round in Laramie, [21] but fell at Hawai'i 78–70 in the second round [22] [23] [24]\n\n\nMark Few

in February 1905 after a gymnasium was put in as an addition to the east end of the new college building that was being built [81] In 1955, the basketball team moved from the gymnasium, nicknamed \"the cave\", [82] and began to play at the newly constructed Spokane Coliseum [83] On June 3, 1964, construction began for a new 3,800-seat athletic facility called the John F Kennedy Memorial Pavilion [82] To raise money for the $1.1 million project, Gonzaga's student body had each student pay $10 per semester until $500,000 was raised The university matched that amount, while the remaining $100,000 came from contributions [82] Gonzaga's first game in the pavilion took place on December 3, 1965, against Washington State, who beat the Bulldogs 106–78 [84] [85] In 1986, the facility was renamed the Charlotte Y Martin Centre after an eponymous donor donated $4.5 million to finance a remodel of the arena that could hold up to 4,000 people [86] [87]\n\n\nTraditions\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga participated in a neutral court game at KeyArena that would later become an annual event known as the Battle in Seattle [52] The event marked the first time that a regular season Gonzaga basketball game was broadcast nationally on CBS Sports, as Craig Bolerjack called the action while Clark Kellogg provided commentary [96] Ranked third in the country, Missouri was the highest ranked regular season opponent that Gonzaga had faced up to that point; the Bulldogs would go on to beat the Tigers 87–80 in overtime [53]\n\n\nBattle in Seattle\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga

Conference foe Saint Mary's Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, [103] [104] as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 24 out of the last 26 conference championship games (Gonzaga 20, Saint Mary's 4, San Diego 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 81–35.\n\n\nSaint Mary's College (California)\nGonzaga's biggest rivalry is with fellow West Coast Conference foe Saint Mary's Many

dormant until they were forced to play each other in first round of the 2015 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament In 2016, they began a new home-and-home series in Spokane and have agreed to continue the rivalry annually until at least the 2025–26 season The Huskies lead the series 30–20 Although the Zags have won 14 of the last 16 matchups, the most recent game was won by Washington on December 9, 2023, 78–73.\n\n\nBrigham Young University\nA notable rivalry with Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed throughout the past decade BYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, with Gonzaga winning 46–41  The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating the Zags 89–67 The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011–2012 season BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthy Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016 and 2017 BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016–17 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament Final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups Gonzaga leads the overall series 25–7, with the most recent meeting on February 11, 2023, in which Gonzaga won 88–81 in Spokane BYU departed the WCC for the Big 12 Conference, starting with the 2023–2024 season, and since then, no matchups have been confirmed for the future between the Cougars and Zags.\n\n\nImpact\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998 [105] In 1999, enrollment jumped to 701 five months after the Zags went to the Elite Eight [105] This trend continued after Gonzaga won five games in the 1999 and 2000 NCAA tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001 [105] A 65 percent increase in the size of the freshman class between 1997 and 2003 is part of a phenomenon called the Flutie effect, the increase in attention and applications for admission that results after a particularly notable and unexpected sporting victory by a school's athletic team  Gonzaga University president Rev Robert Spitzer said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the McCarthey Athletic Center, most of which was received through major gifts [106]\n\n\nUniversity enrollment\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students

Many analysts and members of the media have touted the Gaels vs Zags as one of the best, if not the best, college basketball rivalry on the West Coast, as both teams have been consistently the two top teams in the conference over the last 2 decades. Gonzaga and Saint Mary's have combined to win 24 out of the last 26 conference championship games (Gonzaga 20, Saint Mary's 4, San Diego 2). Currently Gonzaga leads the series 81–35.\n\n## Washington\n\nGonzaga's most heated in-state rivalry is with Washington. They played a 10-year home-and-home series from 1997 to 2006, but then it went dormant until they were forced to play each other in the first round of the 2015 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. In 2016, they began a new home-and-home series in Spokane and have agreed to continue the rivalry annually until at least the 2025–26 season. The Huskies lead the series 30–20. Although the Zags have won 14 of the last 16 matchups, the most recent game was won by Washington on December 9, 2023, 78–73.\n\n## Brigham Young University\n\nA notable rivalry with Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed throughout the past decade. BYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, with Gonzaga winning 46–41. The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen by defeating the Zags 89–67. The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011–2012 season. BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthy Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016, and 2017. BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016–17 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game. BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament Final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups. Gonzaga leads the overall series 25–7, with the most recent meeting on February 11, 2023, in which Gonzaga won 88–81 in Spokane.\n\n## Impact\n\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998. In 1999, enrollment jumped to 701 five months after the Zags went to the Elite Eight. This trend continued after Gonzaga won five games in the 1999 and 2000 NCAA tournaments, as freshman enrollment increased to 796 in 2000 and to a then-record 979 in 2001. A 65 percent increase in the size of the freshman class between 1997 and 2003 is part of a phenomenon called the Flutie effect, the increase in attention and applications for admission that results after a particularly notable and unexpected sporting victory by a school's athletic team. Gonzaga University president Rev Robert Spitzer said that the team's success was responsible for the school receiving the $23 million required to build the McCarthey Athletic Center, most of which was received through major gifts.\n\n## University Enrollment\n\nFreshman enrollment at Gonzaga in the mid-nineties hovered around 500 students annually, including a total of 569 as late as 1998.

\"Gonzaga_Bulldogs_men's_basketball\" following this outline:\n\n\nTeam history\nGonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907–08 basketball season and, although the season wasn't an official one, they achieved a record of 9–2 (.818) under head coach George Varnell [5] In the 1908–09 season, Varnell became the first official coach for Gonzaga, earning a 10–2 (.833) record William Mulligan coached the following season and acquired an 11–3 (.786) record [6] Frank McKevitt took over for Mulligan during the 1910–11 basketball season, acquiring an 8–1 (.889) record [6] From 1944 to 1994, the Bulldogs compiled a record of 628–531 (.542), earning regular season titles in 1965–66 and 1966–67 (Big Sky) under Hank Anderson, [7] [8] and in 1993–94 (WCC) under Dan Fitzgerald [9] [10] That season also saw the team qualify for its first postseason tournament, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), [11] [12] [13] [14] while being led by forward Jeff Brown, who was the WCC Player of the Year, and point guard Geoff Goss, who was made the All-WCC First Team that season In the following season, the fourth-seeded Bulldogs won the WCC tournament to secure their first appearance in the NCAA tournament [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nEarly years\nGonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907–08 basketball season and, although the season wasn't an official one, they

tournament [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nDan Monson (1997–1999)\nIn 1997, Gonzaga assistant coach Dan Monson, the son of veteran Oregon and Idaho head coach Don Monson, became the head coach of Gonzaga as Fitzgerald wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties [20] During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24–10 record and a WCC regular season title, which was not enough to land an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament [20] They earned a bid into the NIT and beat Wyoming 69–55 in the first round in Laramie, [21] but fell at Hawai'i 78–70 in the second round [22] [23] [24]\n\n\nMark Few (1999–present)\nAfter Monson departed for Minnesota that summer, [28] [29] assistant coach Mark Few was promoted to head coach on July 26, 1999 [30] [31]\n\n\nFacilities\nBasketball started at Gonzaga in February 1905 after a gymnasium was put in as an addition to the east end of the new college building that was being built [81] In 1955, the basketball team moved from the gymnasium, nicknamed \"the cave\", [82] and began to play at the newly constructed Spokane Coliseum [83] On June 3, 1964, construction began for a new 3,800-seat athletic facility called the John F Kennedy Memorial Pavilion [82] To raise money for the $1.1 million project, Gonzaga's student body had each student pay $10 per semester until $500,000 was raised The university matched that amount, while the remaining $100,000 came from contributions [82] Gonzaga's first game in the pavilion took place on December 3, 1965, against Washington State, who beat the Bulldogs 106–78 [84] [85] In 1986, the facility was renamed the Charlotte Y Martin Centre after an eponymous donor donated $4.5 million to finance a remodel of the arena that could hold up to 4,000 people [86] [87]\n\n\nTraditions\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga participated in a neutral court game at KeyArena that would later become an annual event known as the Battle in Seattle [52] The event marked the first time that a regular season Gonzaga basketball game was broadcast nationally on CBS Sports, as Craig Bolerjack called the action while Clark Kellogg provided commentary [96] Ranked third in the country, Missouri was the highest ranked regular season opponent that Gonzaga had faced up to that point; the Bulldogs would go on to beat the Tigers 87–80 in overtime [53]\n\n\nBattle in Seattle\nOn December 13, 2003, Gonzaga

inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins in her role as Alexis Carrington in the television series Dynasty, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series [32] Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker's first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, Jennifer Saunders and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part [33] Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed with Howard Ashman's style of music production and was replaced by Carroll [33] Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians Bill Maher and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle [32]\n\n\nMusic\nThe Little Mermaid was considered by some as \"the film that brought Broadway into cartoons\" [34] Alan Menken wrote the Oscar-winning score, and collaborated with Howard Ashman on the songs One of the film's most prominent songs, \"Part of Your World\", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with children, who became rowdy during the scene This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements and Keane Both Musker and Clements cited the similar situation of the song \"Over the Rainbow\" nearly being cut from 1939's The Wizard of Oz when it was appealing to Katzenberg Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state During a second test screening, the scene, now colorized and further developed, tested well with a separate child audience, and the musical number was kept [32]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was originally released on November 17, 1989, followed by a re-release on November 14, 1997 [35] After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney announced a 3D re-release of The Little Mermaid scheduled for September 13, 2013, [36] but this was cancelled on January 14, 2013, due to the under-performances of other Disney 3D re-releases until further notice [37] The 3D version was released on Blu-ray instead, [38] [39] but it did play a limited engagement at the El Capitan Theatre from September to October 2013 [40] On September 20, 2013, The Little Mermaid began playing in select theaters where audiences could bring iPads and use an app called Second Screen Live [41] AMC Theatres screened the movie from September 6–12, 2019 [42] The film was also screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival [43]\n\n\nHome media\nIn a then-atypical and controversial move for a new Disney animated film, The Little Mermaid was released as part of the Walt Disney Classics line of VHS, LaserDisc, Betamax and Video 8 home media releases on May 18, 1990, six months after the release of the film [21] Before The Little Mermaid, only a select number of Disney's catalog animated films had been released to home media, as the company was afraid of upsetting its profitable practice of theatrically reissuing each film every few years [21] The Little Mermaid became that year's top-selling title on home video, with over 10 million units sold (including 7 million in its first month) and 13 million units by October 1993 [44] [45] The home video release, along with box office and merchandise sales, contributed to The Little Mermaid generating a total revenue of $1 billion [46] This success led to future Disney animated films being released on home video soon after the end of their theatrical runs, rather than delayed for several years, making The Little Mermaid the first Disney animated feature to be released on home video 1 year after its theatrical release [21]\n\n\nLive presentations\nIn June 2016, Disney held special presentations of the film at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, titled The Little Mermaid in Concert

as Sebastian as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation), Darren Criss (who performed as Prince Eric), Rebel Wilson (who performed as Ursula), Joshua Colley (who performed as Flounder), John Stamos (who performed as Chef Louis) and Norm Lewis (who performed as King Triton as a reprisal of his role in the stage adaptation) The four additional songs written for the stage adaptation were also incorporated into the presentation, accompanied by scenes of the film's original concept art During the third and final performance, Jodi Benson replaced Bareilles to reprise her original role as Ariel, while Brad Kane (the singing voice of the title character of Aladdin) and Susan Egan (who played Belle in the stage adaptation of Beauty and the Beast) also made special appearances, singing songs from their respective films, and a duet of \"A Whole New World\" [57] [58]\n\n\nReception\nEarly in the production of The Little Mermaid, Jeffrey Katzenberg cautioned Clements, Musker, and their

in a decade [20] [21] However, by the time the film was closer to completion, Katzenberg was convinced The Little Mermaid would be a hit and the first animated feature to earn more than $100 million

the 1950s [21] The Little Mermaid was the second film, following Oliver & Company, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since The Jungle Book (1967), 22 years earlier [21] Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a

Smithsonian Magazine in 2019, says the film \"sent important messages about identity to its young audiences,\" including topics of gay rights (the central character, Ariel, \"feels constrained by her patriarchal society\" and is \"in the closet\"), gender fluidity, and body image issues [91] Ariel turns to \"the only strong female in the entire film and thus Ariel's only female role model,\" the villain Ursula (who was based on famous drag queen Divine, herself closely associated with gay filmmaker John Waters) Landis invokes Laura Sells and her argument that, \"Ariel learns  [from Ursula

reasons It was instrumental in re-establishing feature-length animation as a profitable venture for the Walt Disney Company, as the company's theme parks, television productions, and live-action features had overshadowed the animated output since the 1950s [21] The Little Mermaid was the second film, following Oliver & Company, produced after Disney began expanding its animated output following its successful live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and became Disney's first animated major box office and critical hit since The Jungle Book (1967), 22 years earlier [21] Walt Disney Feature Animation was further expanded as a result of The Little Mermaid and increasingly successful follow-ups – Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994) The staff increased from 300 members in 1988 to 2,200 in 1999 spread across three studios in Burbank, California, Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France [22]\n\n\nRetrospective criticism\n\nDr Michael Landis, a history teacher at State University of New York, Ulster, writing for Smithsonian Magazine in 2019, says the film \"sent important messages about identity to its young audiences,\" including topics of gay rights (the central character, Ariel, \"feels constrained by her patriarchal society\" and is \"in the closet\"), gender fluidity, and body image issues [91] Ariel turns to \"the only strong female in the entire film and thus Ariel's only female role model,\" the villain Ursula (who was based on famous drag queen Divine, herself closely associated with gay filmmaker John Waters) Landis invokes Laura Sells and her argument that, \"Ariel learns  [from Ursula that] gender  [is not]...a natural category, but...a performed construct.\" He adds:\n\nTheme parks\nAriel is a meet-and-greet character appearing at Disney theme parks around the world, including in specific meet-and-greet locations such as Ariel's Grotto [98] A dark ride based on the film, Ariel's Undersea Adventure, opened at both Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort and Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in 2011 and 2012, respectively [99] Both attractions tell the story of the film by taking riders through scenes based on the film's various musical numbers Various live entertainment shows based on the film can be found at Disney theme parks worldwide, including Voyage of the Little Mermaid at Disney's Hollywood Studios and King Triton's Concert at Tokyo DisneySea The Mermaid Lagoon land at Tokyo DisneySea is also based on the film

the McDonnell Douglas team was eliminated and Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace joined the Lockheed Martin team Each firm would produce two prototype air vehicles to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV), and STOVL [N 3] Lockheed Martin's design would make use of the work on the SDLF system conducted under the ASTOVL/CALF program The key aspect of the X-35 that enabled STOVL operation, the SDLF system consists of the lift fan in the forward center fuselage that could be activated by engaging a clutch that connects the driveshaft to the turbines and thus augmenting the thrust from the engine's swivel nozzle Research from prior aircraft incorporating similar systems, such as the Convair Model 200, [N 4] Rockwell XFV-12, and Yakovlev Yak-141, were also taken into consideration [23] [24] [25] By contrast, Boeing's X-32 employed direct lift system that the augmented turbofan would be reconfigured to when engaging in STOVL operation.\n\n\nDesign and production\nAs the JSF program moved into the System Development and Demonstration phase, the X-35 demonstrator design was modified to create the F-35 combat aircraft The forward fuselage was lengthened by 5 inches (13 cm) to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved 2 inches (5.1 cm) aft to retain balance and control The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved 30 inches (76 cm) aft The fuselage section was fuller, the top surface raised by 1 inch (2.5 cm) along the centerline and the lower surface bulged to accommodate weapons bays Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV), all with a design service life of 8,000 hours Prime contractor Lockheed Martin performs overall systems integration and final assembly and checkout (FACO) at Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas, [N 6] while Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems supply components for mission systems and airframe [33] [34]\n\n\nUpgrades and further development\nThe F-35 is expected to be continually upgraded over its lifetime The first combat-capable Block 2B configuration, which had basic air-to-air and strike capabilities, was declared ready by the USMC in July 2015 [2] The Block 3F configuration began operational test and evaluation (OT&E) in December 2018 and its completion in late 2023 concluded SDD in March 2024 [69] The F-35 program is also conducting sustainment and upgrade development, with early aircraft from LRIP lot 2 onwards gradually upgraded to the baseline Block 3F standard by 2021 [70] [needs update]\n\n\nProcurement and international participation\nThe United States is the primary customer and financial backer, with planned procurement of 1,763 F-35As for the USAF, 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs for the USMC, and 273 F-35Cs for the USN [13] Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Canada have agreed to contribute US$4.375 billion towards development costs, with the United Kingdom contributing about 10% of the planned development costs as the sole Tier 1 partner [20] The initial plan was that the U.S and eight major partner countries would acquire over 3,100 F-35s through 2035 [81] The three tiers of international participation generally reflect financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the order in which countries can obtain production aircraft [82] Alongside program partner countries, Israel and Singapore have joined as Security Cooperative Participants (SCP) [83] [84] [85] Sales to SCP and non-partner states, including Belgium, Japan, and South Korea, are made through the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program [7] [86] Turkey was removed from the F-35 program in July 2019 over security concerns following its purchase of a Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system [87] [88] [N 10]\n\n\nDesign\nThe F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters [90] The second fifth-generation fighter to enter US service and the first operational supersonic STOVL stealth fighter, the F-35 emphasizes low observables, advanced avionics and sensor fusion that enable a high level of situational awareness and long range lethality; [91] [92] [93] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems [94]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters [90] The second fifth-generation fighter to enter US service and the first operational supersonic STOVL stealth fighter, the F-35 emphasizes low observables, advanced avionics and sensor fusion that enable a high level of situational awareness and long range lethality; [91] [92] [93] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems [94]\n\n\nSensors and avionics\nThe F-35's mission systems are among the most complex aspects of the aircraft The avionics and sensor fusion are designed to improve the pilot's situational awareness and command-and-control capabilities and facilitate network-centric warfare [90] [108] Key sensors include the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, BAE Systems AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, Northrop Grumman/Raytheon AN/AAQ-37 Electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS), Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) suite The F-35 was designed for its sensors to work together to provide a cohesive image of the local battlespace; for example, the APG-81 radar also acts as a part of the electronic warfare system [109]\n\n\nStealth and signatures\nStealth is a key aspect of the F-35's design, and radar cross-section (RCS) is minimized through careful shaping of the airframe and the use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM); visible measures to reduce RCS include alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, serration of skin panels, and the masking of the engine face and turbine Additionally, the F-35's diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) uses a compression bump and forward-swept cowl rather than a splitter gap or bleed system to divert the boundary layer away from the inlet duct, eliminating the diverter cavity and further reducing radar signature [98] [132] The RCS of the F-35 has been characterized as lower than a metal golf ball at certain frequencies and angles; in some conditions, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth [133] [134] [135] For maintainability, the F-35's stealth design took lessons from earlier stealth aircraft such as the F-22; the F-35's radar-absorbent fibermat skin is more durable and requires less maintenance than older topcoats [136] The aircraft also has reduced infrared and visual signatures as well as strict controls of radio frequency emitters to prevent their detection [137] [138] [139] The F-35's stealth design is primarily focused on high-frequency X-band wavelengths; [140] low-frequency radars can spot stealthy aircraft due to Rayleigh scattering, but such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and lack precision [141] [142] [143] To disguise its RCS, the aircraft can mount four Luneburg lens reflectors [144]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe glass cockpit was designed to give the pilot good situational awareness The main display is a 20-by-8-inch (50 by 20 cm) panoramic touchscreen, which shows flight instruments, stores management, CNI information, and integrated caution and warnings; the pilot can customize the arrangement of the information Below the main display is a smaller stand-by display [150] The cockpit has a speech-recognition system developed by Adacel [151] The F-35 does not have a head-up display; instead, flight and combat information is displayed on the visor of the pilot's helmet in a helmet-mounted display system (HMDS) [152] The one-piece tinted canopy is hinged at the front and has an internal frame for structural strength The Martin-Baker US16E ejection seat is launched by a twin-catapult system housed on side rails [153] There is a right-hand side stick and throttle hands-on throttle-and-stick system For life support, an onboard oxygen-generation system (OBOGS) is fitted and powered by the Integrated Power Package (IPP), with an auxiliary oxygen bottle and backup oxygen system for emergencies [154]\n\n\nArmament\nTo preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays each with two weapons stations The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for the F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles Air-to-surface weapons for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser) The station can also carry multiple smaller munitions such as the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), GBU-53/B SDB II, and SPEAR 3; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the F-35A and F-35C, and three for the F-35B [166] [167] [168] The F-35A achieved certification to carry the B61 Mod 12 nuclear bomb in October 2023 [169] The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM and eventually the AIM-260 JATM Two compartments behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, and towed decoys [170]\n\n\nEngine\nThe aircraft is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan with rated thrust of 28,000 lbf (125 kN) at military power and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner Derived from the Pratt & Whitney F119 used by the F-22, the F135 has a larger fan and higher bypass ratio to increase subsonic thrust and fuel efficiency, and unlike the F119, is not optimized for supercruise [196] The engine contributes to the F-35's stealth by having a low-observable augmenter, or afterburner, that incorporates fuel injectors into thick curved vanes; these vanes are covered by ceramic radar-absorbent materials and mask the turbine The stealthy augmenter had problems with pressure pulsations, or \"screech\", at low altitude and high speed early in its development [197] The low-observable axisymmetric nozzle consists of 15 partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge, which reduces radar signature and creates shed vortices that reduce the infrared signature of the exhaust plume [198] Due to the engine's large dimensions, the U.S Navy had to modify its underway replenishment system to facilitate at-sea logistics support [199] The F-35's Integrated Power Package (IPP) performs power and thermal management and integrates environment control, auxiliary power unit, engine starting, and other functions into a single system [200]\n\n\nMaintenance and logistics\nThe F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are \"one deep\"—that is, nothing else needs to be removed to reach the desired part; for instance, the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy The F-35 has a fibermat radar-absorbent material (RAM) baked into the skin, which is more durable, easier to work with, and faster to cure than older RAM coatings; similar coatings are being considered for application on older stealth aircraft such as the F-22 [136] [216] [217] Skin corrosion on the F-22 led to the F-35 using a less galvanic corrosion-inducing skin gap filler, fewer gaps in the airframe skin needing filler, and better drainage [218] The flight control system uses electro-hydrostatic actuators rather than traditional hydraulic systems; these controls can be powered by lithium-ion batteries in case of emergency [219] [220] Commonality between variants led to the USMC's first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment, which applied USAF lessons to their F-35 operations [221]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 [230] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT; consequently, it mainly tested subsystems common to subsequent aircraft, such as the propulsion, electrical system, and cockpit displays This aircraft was retired from flight testing in December 2009 and was used for live-fire testing at NAS China Lake [231]\n\n\nTesting\nThe first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 [230] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT;

combat employment began in July 2018 from the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, with the first combat strike on 27 September 2018 against a Taliban target in Afghanistan [272]\n\n\nU.S. Air Force\nUSAF F-35A in the Block 3i configuration achieved IOC with the USAF's 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah on 2 August 2016 [3] F-35As conducted their first Red Flag exercise in 2017; system maturity had improved and the aircraft scored a kill ratio of 15:1 against an F-16 aggressor squadron in a high-threat environment [278] The first USAF F-35A deployment occurred on 15 April 2019 to Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE [279] On 27 April 2019, USAF F-35As were first used in combat in an airstrike on an Islamic State tunnel network in northern Iraq [280]\n\n\nU.S. Navy\nThe USN achieved operational status with the F-35C in Block 3F on 28 February 2019 [4] On 2 August 2021, the F-35C of VFA-147, as well as the CMV-22 Osprey, embarked on their maiden deployments as part of Carrier Air Wing 2 on board USS Carl Vinson [286]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy operate the F-35B Called Lightning in British service, [287] it has replaced the Harrier GR9, retired in 2010, and Tornado GR4, retired in 2019 The F-35 is to be Britain's primary strike aircraft for the next three decades One of the Royal Navy's requirements was a Shipborne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) mode to increase maximum landing weight by using wing lift during landing [288] [289]  Like the Italian Navy, British F-35Bs use ski-jumps to fly from their aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales British F-35Bs are not intended to use the Brimstone 2 missile [290] In July 2013, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton announced that No 617 (The Dambusters) Squadron would be the RAF's first operational F-35 squadron [291] [292]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia's first F-35, designated A35-001, was manufactured in 2014, with flight training provided through international Pilot Training Centre (PTC) at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona [309] The first two F-35s were unveiled to the Australian public on 3 March 2017 at the Avalon Airshow [310] By 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force had accepted 26 F-35As, with nine in the US and 17 operating at No 3 Squadron and No 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown [309] With 41 trained RAAF pilots and 225 trained technicians for maintenance, the fleet was declared ready to deploy on operations [311] It was originally expected that Australia would receive all 72 F-35s by 2023, [310] but as of February 2024 Australia has received 63 aircraft  Its final nine aircraft are expected in 2024, and are expected to be the TR-3 version [312]\n\n\nIsrael\nThe Israeli Air Force (IAF) declared the F-35 operationally capable on 6 December 2017 [313] According to Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida, in July 2018, a test mission of at least three IAF F-35s flew to Iran's capital Tehran and back to Tel Aviv While publicly unconfirmed, regional leaders acted on the report; Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei reportedly fired the air force chief and commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps over the mission [314] [315]\n\n\nItaly\nItaly's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 30 November 2018 At the time Italy had taken delivery of 10 F-35As and one F-35B, with 2 F-35As and the one F-35B being stationed in the U.S for training, the remaining 8 F-35As were stationed in Amendola [329]\n\n\nJapan\nJapan's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 29 March 2019 At the time Japan had taken delivery of 10 F-35As stationed in Misawa Air Base Japan plans to eventually acquire a total of 147 F-35s, which will include 42 F-35Bs It plans to use the latter variant to equip Japan's Izumo-class multi-purpose destroyers [330] [331]\n\n\nNorway\nOn 6 November 2019 Norway declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 15 F-35As out of a planned 52 F-35As [332] On 6 January 2022 Norway's F-35As replaced its F-16s for the NATO quick reaction alert mission in the high north [333]\n\n\nNetherlands\nOn 27 December 2021 the Netherlands declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 24 F-35As that it has received to date from its order for 46 F-35As [335] In 2022, the Netherlands announced they will order an additional six F-35s, totaling 52 aircraft ordered [336]\n\n\nVariants\nThe F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version Since then, there has been work on the design of nationally specific versions for Israel and Canada.\n\n\nF-35A\nThe F-35A is the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) variant intended for the USAF and other air forces It is the smallest, lightest version and capable of 9 g, the highest of all variants.\n\n\nF-35B\nThe F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) [340] [341] This variant is limited to 7 g Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight [342] [343] The F-35B is capable of Mach 1.6 (1,976 km/h) and can perform vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) [207]\n\n\nF-35C\nThe F-35C is a carrier-based variant designed for catapult-assisted take-off, barrier arrested recovery operations from aircraft carriers Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C features larger wings with foldable wingtip sections, larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for the stresses of carrier arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger tailhook for use with carrier arrestor cables [237] The larger wing area allows for decreased landing speed while increasing both range and payload The F-35C is limited to 7.5 g [344]\n\n\nF-35I \"Adir\"\nThe F-35I Adir (Hebrew: אדיר, meaning \"Awesome\", [345] or \"Mighty\" [346]) is an F-35A with unique Israeli modifications The US initially refused to allow such changes before permitting Israel to integrate its own electronic warfare systems, including sensors and countermeasures The main computer has a plug-and-play function for add-on systems; proposals include an external jamming pod, and new Israeli air-to-air missiles and guided bombs in the internal weapon bays [347] [348] A senior IAF official said that the F-35's stealth may be partly overcome within 10 years despite a 30 to 40-year service life, thus Israel's insistence on using their own electronic warfare systems [349] In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) considered a two-seat F-35 concept; an IAI executive noted that there was a \"known demand for two seats not only from Israel but from other air forces\" [350] In 2008, IAI planned to produce conformal fuel tanks [351] [needs update]\n\n\nProposed variants\nThe Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe [339] [354] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A [355] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed; however, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report cited the F-35C's limited performance and payload as being too high a price to pay [356] Following the 2015 Federal Election the Liberal Party, whose campaign had included a pledge to cancel the F-35 procurement, [357] formed a new government and commenced an open competition to replace the existing CF-18 Hornet [358] The CF-35 variant was deemed too expensive to develop, and was never considered The Canadian government decided to not pursue any other modifications in the Future Fighter Capability Project, and instead focused on the potential procurement of the existing F-35A variant [359]\n\n\nCF-35\nThe Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe [339] [354] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A [355] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed;

It is the most advanced fighter jet in the world, serving as the primary strike fighter for the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Marine Corps (USMC), and United States Navy (USN). The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter, designed to provide advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities, as well as electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) functions.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe F-35 was the product of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which was the merger of various combat aircraft programs from the 1980s and 1990s. One progenitor program was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) program, which ran from 1983 to 1994. ASTOVL aimed to develop a Harrier jump jet replacement for the USMC and the UK Royal Navy. Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), Lockheed Skunk Works conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both the USAF and the USMC.\n\n**Program Origins**\n\nThe F-35 was the product of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which was the merger of various combat aircraft programs from the 1980s and 1990s. One progenitor program was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (ASTOVL) program, which ran from 1983 to 1994. ASTOVL aimed to develop a Harrier jump jet replacement for the USMC and the UK Royal Navy. Under one of ASTOVL's classified programs, the Supersonic STOVL Fighter (SSF), Lockheed Skunk Works conducted research for a stealthy supersonic STOVL fighter intended for both the USAF and the USMC.\n\n**JSF Competition**\n\nBoeing and Lockheed Martin were selected in early 1997 for the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP), with their concept demonstrator aircraft designated X-32 and X-35 respectively. The McDonnell Douglas team was eliminated and Northrop Grumman and British Aerospace joined the Lockheed Martin team. Each firm would produce two prototype air vehicles to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV), and STOVL.\n\n**Design and Production**\n\nAs the JSF program moved into the System Development and Demonstration phase, the X-35 demonstrator design was modified to create the F-35 combat aircraft. The forward fuselage was lengthened by 5 inches (13 cm) to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were moved 2 inches (5.1 cm) aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet changed from a four-sided to a three-sided cowl shape and was moved 30 inches (76 cm) aft.\n\n**Upgrades and Further Development**\n\nThe F-35 is expected to be continually upgraded over its lifetime. The first combat-capable Block 2B configuration was declared ready by the USMC in July 2015. The Block 3F configuration began operational test and evaluation (OT&E) in December 2018 and its completion in late 2023 concluded SDD in March 2024.\n\n**Procurement and International Participation**\n\nThe United States is the primary customer and financial backer, with planned procurement of 1,763 F-35As for the USAF, 353 F-35Bs and 67 F-35Cs for the USMC, and 273 F-35Cs for the USN. Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Denmark, and Canada have agreed to contribute US$4.375 billion towards development costs, with the United Kingdom contributing about 10% of the planned development costs as the sole Tier 1 partner.\n\n**Design**\n\nThe F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters. It is the most advanced fighter jet in the world, serving as the primary strike fighter for the USAF, USMC, and USN. The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter, designed to provide advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities, as well as electronic warfare and ISR functions.\n\n**Cockpit**\n\nThe glass cockpit was designed to give the pilot good situational awareness. The main display is a 20-by-8-inch (50 by 20 cm) panoramic touchscreen, which shows flight instruments, stores management, CNI information, and integrated caution and warnings. The pilot can customize the arrangement of the information.\n\n**Armament**\n\nTo preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays, each with two weapons stations. The two outboard weapon stations can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for the F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles.\n\n**Engine**\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan with rated thrust of 28,000 lbf (125 kN) at military power and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner.\n\n**Maintenance and Logistics**\n\nThe F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft. Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are \"one deep\" – that is, nothing else needs to be removed to reach the desired part.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nThe first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006. The first F-35B, BF-1, conducted its first flight on 11 December 2010. The first F-35C, CF-1, conducted its first flight on 8 June 2010.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe F-35 has been operated by the USAF, USMC, USN, and several international partners, including the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Norway, Denmark, and Canada.\n\n**Specifications (F-35A)**\n\n* Length: 51.0 ft (15.5 m)\n* Wingspan: 35.0 ft (10.6 m)\n* Height: 14.7 ft (4.5 m)\n* Empty weight: 28,000 lb (12,700 kg)\n* Maximum takeoff weight: 55,000 lb (24,940 kg)\n* Powerplant: 1 x Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan\n* Thrust: 28,000 lb (125 kN) at military power, 43,000 lb (191 kN) with afterburner\n\n**References**\n\n* Lockheed Martin: F-35 specifications\n* Lockheed Martin: F-35 Program Status\n* Director of Operational Test & Evaluation\n* FY2019 Select Acquisition Report (SAR)\n* F-35 Program brief\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"F-35 Lightning II\".

[91] [92] [93] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems [94]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-35 is a family of single-engine, supersonic, stealth multirole strike fighters [90] The second fifth-generation fighter to enter US service and the first operational supersonic STOVL stealth fighter, the F-35 emphasizes low observables, advanced avionics and sensor fusion that enable a high level of situational awareness and long range lethality; [91] [92] [93] the USAF considers the aircraft its primary strike fighter for conducting suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) and air interdiction missions, owing to the advanced sensors and mission systems [94]\n\n\nSensors and avionics\nThe F-35's mission systems are among the most complex aspects of the aircraft The avionics and sensor fusion are designed to improve the pilot's situational awareness and command-and-control capabilities and facilitate network-centric warfare [90] [108] Key sensors include the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, BAE Systems AN/ASQ-239 Barracuda electronic warfare system, Northrop Grumman/Raytheon AN/AAQ-37 Electro-optical Distributed Aperture System (DAS), Lockheed Martin AN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) and Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-242 Communications, Navigation, and Identification (CNI) suite The F-35 was designed for its sensors to work together to provide a cohesive image of the local battlespace; for example, the APG-81 radar also acts as a part of the electronic warfare system [109]\n\n\nStealth and signatures\nStealth is a key aspect of the F-35's design, and radar cross-section (RCS) is minimized through careful shaping of the airframe and the use of radar-absorbent materials (RAM); visible measures to reduce RCS include alignment of edges and continuous curvature of surfaces, serration of skin panels, and the masking of the engine face and turbine Additionally, the F-35's diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) uses a compression bump and forward-swept cowl rather than a splitter gap or bleed system to divert the boundary layer away from the inlet duct, eliminating the diverter cavity and further reducing radar signature [98] [132] The RCS of the F-35 has been characterized as lower than a metal golf ball at certain frequencies and angles; in some conditions, the F-35 compares favorably to the F-22 in stealth [133] [134] [135] For maintainability, the F-35's stealth design took lessons from earlier stealth aircraft such as the F-22; the F-35's radar-absorbent fibermat skin is more durable and requires less maintenance than older topcoats [136] The aircraft also has reduced infrared and visual signatures as well as strict controls of radio frequency emitters to prevent their detection [137] [138] [139] The F-35's stealth design is primarily focused on high-frequency X-band wavelengths; [140] low-frequency radars can spot stealthy aircraft due to Rayleigh scattering, but such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and lack precision [141] [142] [143] To disguise its RCS, the aircraft can mount four Luneburg lens reflectors [144]\n\n\nCockpit\nThe glass cockpit was designed to give the pilot good situational awareness The main display is a 20-by-8-inch (50 by 20 cm) panoramic touchscreen, which shows flight instruments, stores management, CNI information, and integrated caution and warnings; the pilot can customize the arrangement of the information Below the main display is a smaller stand-by display [150] The cockpit has a speech-recognition system developed by Adacel [151] The F-35 does not have a head-up display; instead, flight and combat information is displayed on the visor of the pilot's helmet in a helmet-mounted display system (HMDS) [152] The one-piece tinted canopy is hinged at the front and has an internal frame for structural strength The Martin-Baker US16E ejection seat is launched by a twin-catapult system housed on side rails [153] There is a right-hand side stick and throttle hands-on throttle-and-stick system For life support, an onboard oxygen-generation system (OBOGS) is fitted and powered by the Integrated Power Package (IPP), with an auxiliary oxygen bottle and backup oxygen system for emergencies [154]\n\n\nArmament\nTo preserve its stealth shaping, the F-35 has two internal weapons bays each with two weapons stations The two outboard weapon stations each can carry ordnance up to 2,500 lb (1,100 kg), or 1,500 lb (680 kg) for the F-35B, while the two inboard stations carry air-to-air missiles Air-to-surface weapons for the outboard station include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Paveway series of bombs, Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and cluster munitions (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser) The station can also carry multiple smaller munitions such as the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), GBU-53/B SDB II, and SPEAR 3; up to four SDBs can be carried per station for the F-35A and F-35C, and three for the F-35B [166] [167] [168] The F-35A achieved certification to carry the B61 Mod 12 nuclear bomb in October 2023 [169] The inboard station can carry the AIM-120 AMRAAM and eventually the AIM-260 JATM Two compartments behind the weapons bays contain flares, chaff, and towed decoys [170]\n\n\nEngine\nThe aircraft is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135 low-bypass augmented turbofan with rated thrust of 28,000 lbf (125 kN) at military power and 43,000 lbf (191 kN) with afterburner Derived from the Pratt & Whitney F119 used by the F-22, the F135 has a larger fan and higher bypass ratio to increase subsonic thrust and fuel efficiency, and unlike the F119, is not optimized for supercruise [196] The engine contributes to the F-35's stealth by having a low-observable augmenter, or afterburner, that incorporates fuel injectors into thick curved vanes; these vanes are covered by ceramic radar-absorbent materials and mask the turbine The stealthy augmenter had problems with pressure pulsations, or \"screech\", at low altitude and high speed early in its development [197] The low-observable axisymmetric nozzle consists of 15 partially overlapping flaps that create a sawtooth pattern at the trailing edge, which reduces radar signature and creates shed vortices that reduce the infrared signature of the exhaust plume [198] Due to the engine's large dimensions, the U.S Navy had to modify its underway replenishment system to facilitate at-sea logistics support [199] The F-35's Integrated Power Package (IPP) performs power and thermal management and integrates environment control, auxiliary power unit, engine starting, and other functions into a single system [200]\n\n\nMaintenance and logistics\nThe F-35 is designed to require less maintenance than prior stealth aircraft Some 95% of all field-replaceable parts are \"one deep\"—that is, nothing else needs to be removed to reach the desired part; for instance, the ejection seat can be replaced without removing the canopy The F-35 has a fibermat radar-absorbent material (RAM) baked into the skin, which is more durable, easier to work with, and faster to cure than older RAM coatings; similar coatings are being considered for application on older stealth aircraft such as the F-22 [136] [216] [217] Skin corrosion on the F-22 led to the F-35 using a less galvanic corrosion-inducing skin gap filler, fewer gaps in the airframe skin needing filler, and better drainage [218] The flight control system uses electro-hydrostatic actuators rather than traditional hydraulic systems; these controls can be powered by lithium-ion batteries in case of emergency [219] [220] Commonality between variants led to the USMC's first aircraft maintenance Field Training Detachment, which applied USAF lessons to their F-35 operations [221]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 [230] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT; consequently, it mainly tested subsystems common to subsequent aircraft, such as the propulsion, electrical system, and cockpit displays This aircraft was retired from flight testing in December 2009 and was used for live-fire testing at NAS China Lake [231]\n\n\nTesting\nThe first F-35A, AA-1, conducted its engine run in September 2006 and first flew on 15 December 2006 [230] Unlike all subsequent aircraft, AA-1 did not have the weight optimization from SWAT;

combat employment began in July 2018 from the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, with the first combat strike on 27 September 2018 against a Taliban target in Afghanistan [272]\n\n\nU.S. Air Force\nUSAF F-35A in the Block 3i configuration achieved IOC with the USAF's 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah on 2 August 2016 [3] F-35As conducted their first Red Flag exercise in 2017; system maturity had improved and the aircraft scored a kill ratio of 15:1 against an F-16 aggressor squadron in a high-threat environment [278] The first USAF F-35A deployment occurred on 15 April 2019 to Al Dhafra Air Base, UAE [279] On 27 April 2019, USAF F-35As were first used in combat in an airstrike on an Islamic State tunnel network in northern Iraq [280]\n\n\nU.S. Navy\nThe USN achieved operational status with the F-35C in Block 3F on 28 February 2019 [4] On 2 August 2021, the F-35C of VFA-147, as well as the CMV-22 Osprey, embarked on their maiden deployments as part of Carrier Air Wing 2 on board USS Carl Vinson [286]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and Royal Navy operate the F-35B Called Lightning in British service, [287] it has replaced the Harrier GR9, retired in 2010, and Tornado GR4, retired in 2019 The F-35 is to be Britain's primary strike aircraft for the next three decades One of the Royal Navy's requirements was a Shipborne Rolling and Vertical Landing (SRVL) mode to increase maximum landing weight by using wing lift during landing [288] [289]  Like the Italian Navy, British F-35Bs use ski-jumps to fly from their aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales British F-35Bs are not intended to use the Brimstone 2 missile [290] In July 2013, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton announced that No 617 (The Dambusters) Squadron would be the RAF's first operational F-35 squadron [291] [292]\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia's first F-35, designated A35-001, was manufactured in 2014, with flight training provided through international Pilot Training Centre (PTC) at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona [309] The first two F-35s were unveiled to the Australian public on 3 March 2017 at the Avalon Airshow [310] By 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force had accepted 26 F-35As, with nine in the US and 17 operating at No 3 Squadron and No 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown [309] With 41 trained RAAF pilots and 225 trained technicians for maintenance, the fleet was declared ready to deploy on operations [311] It was originally expected that Australia would receive all 72 F-35s by 2023, [310] but as of February 2024 Australia has received 63 aircraft  Its final nine aircraft are expected in 2024, and are expected to be the TR-3 version [312]\n\n\nIsrael\nThe Israeli Air Force (IAF) declared the F-35 operationally capable on 6 December 2017 [313] According to Kuwaiti newspaper Al Jarida, in July 2018, a test mission of at least three IAF F-35s flew to Iran's capital Tehran and back to Tel Aviv While publicly unconfirmed, regional leaders acted on the report; Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei reportedly fired the air force chief and commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps over the mission [314] [315]\n\n\nItaly\nItaly's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 30 November 2018 At the time Italy had taken delivery of 10 F-35As and one F-35B, with 2 F-35As and the one F-35B being stationed in the U.S for training, the remaining 8 F-35As were stationed in Amendola [329]\n\n\nJapan\nJapan's F-35As were declared to have reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 29 March 2019 At the time Japan had taken delivery of 10 F-35As stationed in Misawa Air Base Japan plans to eventually acquire a total of 147 F-35s, which will include 42 F-35Bs It plans to use the latter variant to equip Japan's Izumo-class multi-purpose destroyers [330] [331]\n\n\nNorway\nOn 6 November 2019 Norway declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 15 F-35As out of a planned 52 F-35As [332] On 6 January 2022 Norway's F-35As replaced its F-16s for the NATO quick reaction alert mission in the high north [333]\n\n\nNetherlands\nOn 27 December 2021 the Netherlands declared initial operational capability (IOC) for its fleet of 24 F-35As that it has received to date from its order for 46 F-35As [335] In 2022, the Netherlands announced they will order an additional six F-35s, totaling 52 aircraft ordered [336]\n\n\nVariants\nThe F-35 was designed with three initial variants – the F-35A, a CTOL land-based version; the F-35B, a STOVL version capable of use either on land or on aircraft carriers; and the F-35C, a CATOBAR carrier-based version Since then, there has been work on the design of nationally specific versions for Israel and Canada.\n\n\nF-35A\nThe F-35A is the conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) variant intended for the USAF and other air forces It is the smallest, lightest version and capable of 9 g, the highest of all variants.\n\n\nF-35B\nThe F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the aircraft Similar in size to the A variant, the B sacrifices about a third of the A variant's fuel volume to accommodate the shaft-driven lift fan (SDLF) [340] [341] This variant is limited to 7 g Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook The \"STOVL/HOOK\" control instead engages conversion between normal and vertical flight [342] [343] The F-35B is capable of Mach 1.6 (1,976 km/h) and can perform vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) [207]\n\n\nF-35C\nThe F-35C is a carrier-based variant designed for catapult-assisted take-off, barrier arrested recovery operations from aircraft carriers Compared to the F-35A, the F-35C features larger wings with foldable wingtip sections, larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for the stresses of carrier arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger tailhook for use with carrier arrestor cables [237] The larger wing area allows for decreased landing speed while increasing both range and payload The F-35C is limited to 7.5 g [344]\n\n\nF-35I \"Adir\"\nThe F-35I Adir (Hebrew: אדיר, meaning \"Awesome\", [345] or \"Mighty\" [346]) is an F-35A with unique Israeli modifications The US initially refused to allow such changes before permitting Israel to integrate its own electronic warfare systems, including sensors and countermeasures The main computer has a plug-and-play function for add-on systems; proposals include an external jamming pod, and new Israeli air-to-air missiles and guided bombs in the internal weapon bays [347] [348] A senior IAF official said that the F-35's stealth may be partly overcome within 10 years despite a 30 to 40-year service life, thus Israel's insistence on using their own electronic warfare systems [349] In 2010, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) considered a two-seat F-35 concept; an IAI executive noted that there was a \"known demand for two seats not only from Israel but from other air forces\" [350] In 2008, IAI planned to produce conformal fuel tanks [351] [needs update]\n\n\nProposed variants\nThe Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe [339] [354] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A [355] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed; however, the Parliamentary Budget Officer's report cited the F-35C's limited performance and payload as being too high a price to pay [356] Following the 2015 Federal Election the Liberal Party, whose campaign had included a pledge to cancel the F-35 procurement, [357] formed a new government and commenced an open competition to replace the existing CF-18 Hornet [358] The CF-35 variant was deemed too expensive to develop, and was never considered The Canadian government decided to not pursue any other modifications in the Future Fighter Capability Project, and instead focused on the potential procurement of the existing F-35A variant [359]\n\n\nCF-35\nThe Canadian CF-35 was a proposed variant that would differ from the F-35A through the addition of a drogue parachute and the potential inclusion of an F-35B/C-style refueling probe [339] [354] In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refueling system as the F-35A [355] One alternative proposal would have been the adoption of the F-35C for its probe refueling and lower landing speed;

but ultimately did not pursue either race On April 28, 2008 he appeared before the City Club of Chicago and on Chicago news shows discussing a possible run for governor in 2010 [26] [27] [56] In February 2009, Vallas gave an interview to Carol Marin in the Chicago Sun-Times and stated that he planned to return to Cook County, Illinois in 2009 and run as a Republican for president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in the 2010 race Vallas went as far as forming an exploratory committee for such a prospective candidacy [29] On June 11, 2009, Vallas announced that he would not be a

union's bargaining [155]\n\n\nPolitical stances\nDuring his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Vallas opposed the concealed carry of firearms and was in favor of banning semi-automatic firearms [157] He supported a plan by Mayor Daley to reconfigure O'Hare International Airport's runways and to add more runways to the airport He also supported constructing a new airport in Chicago's southern suburbs Vallas also opposed a proposed casino in Rosemont, Illinois, citing that gambling should only be permitted to advance economic development He also opposed raising the state income tax, claiming it

{"title": "MBT_LAW", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"NLAW\" initially referred to the original British development programme which Saab won the contract for with the \"MBT LAW\" [15] [17] [19] NLAW stands for Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon or Next-Generation Light Anti-armour Weapon The N is short for \"Next generation\" [15] or \"Next-generation\", [2] while LAW is an abbreviation of \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" [2] [15] or \"Light Anti-Armour Weapon\" [8] [20] MBT LAW stands for Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon [15] NLAW has since development become the international designation of the weapon, while MBT LAW exists as a designation for the weapon in the British Army [15]\n\n\nOverview\nIn 1997, the British Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) began issuing invitations to tender for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon, to replace the obsolescent British LAW 80s [8] Swedish Bofors of the Celsius Group (later bought by Saab AB), [24] American Lockheed Martin, and German Dynamit Nobel replied with offers; due to the limited spots of the NLAW-trials come January 2001, only the two former were rewarded with Project Definition Phase contracts in 1999 Bofors began development of the so-called MBT LAW the same year [16] [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nResearch for a new Swedish light anti-tank guided missile began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, for its mechanized infantry which were lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons Initially, the project focused on creating as simple and cost-effective a system as possible; after some analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged [23]\n\n\nProduction\nAs jobs are often the focus of large material orders, a requirement by the British DPA for signing a contract with the winner was that the production of the system would occur in the United Kingdom For this reason, Saab Bofors Dynamics contracted UK-based Thales Air Defence ahead of the NLAW-programme—while Lockheed Martin contracted Matra BAe Dynamics To produce the system, Saab and Thales went on to create Team MBT LAW UK which included 14 subcontractors [25] As per the agreements signed between the United Kingdom and Sweden in 2002–2003, [32] manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland [16] [26] The weapon went into full production in 2008 The final cost for the MBT LAW contract since the beginning of the NLAW-programme, including the assessment phase, development, and manufacture-license, ended up at approximately £400–437 million [16] [19]\n\n\nOperation\nThe NLAW is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces (saltwater countermass) system, [32] allowing the missile to be fired from almost anywhere; the operator can safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 m (high) [8] The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system For a moving target, the operator maintains tracking

Anti-armour Weapon) is a British man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces anti-tank missile system. It is also known as the NLAW (Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon). The MBT LAW is a modern, lightweight, and highly effective anti-tank missile system designed to counter advanced armored threats.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"NLAW\" initially referred to the original British development programme which Saab won the contract for with the \"MBT LAW\" NLAW stands for Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon or Next-Generation Light Anti-armour Weapon. The N is short for \"Next generation\" or \"Next-generation\", while LAW is an abbreviation of \"Light Anti-tank Weapon\" or \"Light Anti-Armour Weapon\". MBT LAW stands for Main Battle Tank Light Anti-armour Weapon.\n\n**Overview**\n\nIn 1997, the British Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) began issuing invitations to tender for a new man-portable anti-tank weapon, to replace the obsolescent British LAW 80s. Swedish Bofors of the Celsius Group (later bought by Saab AB), American Lockheed Martin, and German Dynamit Nobel replied with offers. Due to the limited spots of the NLAW-trials come January 2001, only the two former were rewarded with Project Definition Phase contracts in 1999. Bofors began development of the so-called MBT LAW the same year.\n\n**Development**\n\nResearch for a new Swedish light anti-tank guided missile began in the 1990s by the Swedish Armed Forces, for its mechanized infantry which were lacking both tanks and anti-tank warfare weapons. Initially, the project focused on creating as simple and cost-effective a system as possible. After some analysis, the need for a man-portable anti-tank weapon with great effectiveness at short to mid-range emerged.\n\n**Production**\n\nAs jobs are often the focus of large material orders, a requirement by the British DPA for signing a contract with the winner was that the production of the system would occur in the United Kingdom. For this reason, Saab Bofors Dynamics contracted UK-based Thales Air Defence ahead of the NLAW-programme—while Lockheed Martin contracted Matra BAe Dynamics. To produce the system, Saab and Thales went on to create Team MBT LAW UK which included 14 subcontractors. As per the agreements signed between the United Kingdom and Sweden in 2002–2003, manufacturing occurred mostly in the UK, with final assembly and test done at the Thales Air Defence facilities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The weapon went into full production in 2008.\n\n**Operation**\n\nThe NLAW is a man-portable, soft-launch, and confined-spaces system, allowing the missile to be fired from almost anywhere. The operator can safely fire through any window of a room no bigger than 4 x 2.5 x 2.5 m (high). The missile is first shot out of the launcher with a low-powered ignition system, after which its main rocket ignites and propels it to the target. Guidance uses a predicted line of sight (PLOS) system. For a moving target, the operator maintains tracking for at least 2–3 seconds. The software embedded in the missile's INS records the operator's aiming movement and extrapolates the flight path needed to intercept the target. After launch, the missile flies autonomously along the pre-programmed flight path, controlled by an inertial guidance system.\n\n**Combat History**\n\nPreceding the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United Kingdom supplied 2,000 NLAW systems to Ukraine, with another 1,615 delivered by 9 March 2022 to bolster Ukraine's military.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies notes that she has said so little about trade that most analysts have to dig up these old votes and statements and assume that she will continue Biden's policies: for instance, President Biden has maintained most of Trump's tariffs on China and increased some of them, and so likely won't make significant changes. The CATO Institute in 2020 noted that while Harris does not seem to be an economic nationalist, her terms of engagement are a bit unclear other than that she wants more labor and environmental protections.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nThe Democratic Party quickly coalesced around her following Biden's withdrawal and his endorsement of Harris. The vast majority of Congressional Democrats endorsed Harris, including senior officials such as Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and former Speaker and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. Additionally, all Democratic governors have endorsed Harris. On July 21, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton endorsed Harris. On July 26, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama endorsed Harris in a joint statement. On August 3, Jimmy Carter, the oldest surviving Democratic former president, endorsed Harris.\n\n**Opposition**\n\nThe Harris campaign was opposed by some Arab Americans who expressed frustration with her stance on the Israel–Hamas war and 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. An October 2024 poll by the Arab American Institute showing Arab American support tied between Harris and Trump. The \"Abandon Harris\" movement, which encouraged Harris to change her position on Gaza, endorsed Jill Stein for president in October 2024. The Uncommitted National Movement and Arab American Political Action Committee both declined to endorse a candidate.\n\n**Vice Presidential Selection**\n\nAn official reported to ABC News on July 23 that Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Shapiro were the leading candidates. While another source told Talking Points Memo the following day that North Carolina governor Roy Cooper was an additional top choice. On July 23, the Financial Times reported that Cooper, Kelly, and Shapiro had become the frontrunners, with donors preferring Cooper or Shapiro and \"Hollywood Democrats\" backing Kelly.\n\n**Polling**\n\nSince August 2024, Harris has generally held a narrow lead in the national popular vote while being statistically tied in the various swing states.

Muñoz, who had previously expected around 3,000 people to attend [79]\n\n\nPlatform\nHarris has framed her campaign as \"a choice between freedom and chaos\" and based it around the ideals of \"freedom\" and \"the future\" [95] [96] The Harris campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a prosecutor to \"prosecute the case\" against Trump by pointing out his 34 felony convictions [97] Harris is running as a moderate Democrat and has moderated several of her policy positions since her 2019 run, with many of her domestic policy stances now expected to
