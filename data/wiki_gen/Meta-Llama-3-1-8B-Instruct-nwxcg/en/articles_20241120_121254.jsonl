Born on May 22, 1878, in the Punjab Province of British India, Gama was a member of a traditional Kashmiri Muslim family of wrestlers. He would go on to become one of the most celebrated wrestlers of his time, known for his incredible strength, agility, and technique.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGhulam Mohammad Baksh Butt was born in Jabbowal, a village in the Amritsar District of the Punjab Province of British India. His family was of Kashmiri Muslim descent and had a long history of producing skilled wrestlers. Gama's early life was marked by his exposure to traditional wrestling, which was a common sport in the region. He was trained by his family members and other experienced wrestlers, who taught him the fundamentals of grappling and strength training.\n\n**Career**\n\nGama's wrestling career spanned over four decades, during which he fought and won over five thousand matches. He was known for his exceptional strength, speed, and agility, which enabled him to defeat opponents much larger and stronger than himself. Gama's training routine was rigorous and involved a combination of grappling, strength exercises, and cardio activities. He would often train for several hours a day, using techniques such as isometrics, squats, and push-ups to build his strength and endurance.\n\n**Training and Diet**\n\nGama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada (court). He also exercised using isometrics as well as more dynamic movements, such as doing a minimum of five thousand baithaks (Hindi word for squats) and three thousand dands (Hindi word for push-ups) in a day. Gama's diet consisted of a balanced mix of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, which included foods such as milk, ghee, and wheat. He would often eat large quantities of food to fuel his body for his rigorous training sessions.\n\n**First Encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultaniwala**\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 17, Gama challenged the then Rustam-e-Hind, middle-aged Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, another ethnic Kashmiri wrestler from Gujranwala. Raheem was a formidable opponent, known for his impressive win-loss record and his ability to take down opponents much larger and stronger than himself. The bout between Gama and Raheem was a closely contested match that lasted for hours, with both wrestlers displaying incredible strength and technique. The match eventually ended in a draw, but it marked a turning point in Gama's career, as he was now looked upon as the next contender for the title of Rustam-e-Hind.\n\n**Tournament in London**\n\nIn 1910, Gama traveled to London, where he issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers of any weight class in thirty minutes. The announcement was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their promoter, R.B. Benjamin, but Gama was determined to prove his strength and agility. He presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers, including Stanislaus Zbyszko and Frank Gotch, and eventually faced Benjamin Roller, an American wrestler who was the first to accept his challenge. Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds and in 9 minutes 10 seconds, and went on to defeat 12 wrestlers in a row, gaining entry to the official tournament.\n\n**Match with Stanislaus Zbyszko**\n\nGama was pitted against world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London. The match was set for 10 September 1910, and was worth £250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. The bout lasted for nearly three hours, with Gama taking down Zbyszko within a minute and holding him in a submissive position for the remainder of the match. Zbyszko's defensive strategy of hugging the mat was unable to nullify Gama's strength and technique, and the match ended in a draw, with many fans in attendance expressing their disappointment at Zbyszko's lack of tenacity.\n\n**Bouts against American and European Champions**\n\nDuring his tour of Europe, Gama defeated some of the most respected grapplers in the world, including \"Doc\" Benjamin Roller of the United States, Maurice Deriaz of Switzerland, Johann Lemm (the European Champion) of Switzerland, and Jesse Peterson (World Champion) from Sweden. Gama's training routine and strength were put to the test in these matches, and he emerged victorious each time, cementing his reputation as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.\n\n**Final Encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala**\n\nShortly after his return from England, Gama faced Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala in Allahabad. This bout was the final showdown between the two wrestling legends, and Gama emerged victorious, winning the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the lineal Champion of India. Gama's victory marked the end of a long and storied career, during which he had fought and won over five thousand matches.\n\n**Rematch with Zbyszko**\n\nAfter beating Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, Gama faced Pandit Biddu, one of the best wrestlers in India of that time, and beat him. This match marked the beginning of a new chapter in Gama's career, as he continued to compete and train, inspiring a new generation of wrestlers.\n\n**Final Years**\n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Gama moved to Pakistan, where he was revered as a national hero. During the Hindu-Muslim riots that broke out at the time of partition, Gama saved hundreds of Hindus from Muslim mobs in Lahore, demonstrating his bravery and selflessness. Gama continued to train and compete until 1952, when he finally retired from wrestling. His legacy as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time continues to inspire and motivate people around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGama's legacy extends far beyond his impressive wrestling career. His training routine and strength exercises have been studied and emulated by athletes and fitness enthusiasts around the world. Bruce Lee, the legendary martial artist, was an avid follower of Gama's training routine and incorporated many of his exercises into his own training. Gama's impact on the world of wrestling and fitness is immeasurable, and his legacy will continue to inspire and motivate people for generations to come.\n\n**Championships and Accolades**\n\nGama's impressive career was marked by numerous championships and accolades. He was crowned the Rustam-e-Hind, the lineal Champion of India, and defeated many of the greatest wrestlers of his time. His matches against Stanislaus Zbyszko and Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala are still remembered as some of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. Gama's legacy continues to be celebrated and revered around the world, and his name is synonymous with strength, agility, and determination.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Great_Gama\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGhulam Mohammad Baksh Butt was born on 22 May, 1878 in Jabbowal, a village in the Amritsar District of the Punjab Province of British India (now in the Kapurthala district of Punjab, India) into a Kashmiri muslim family of traditional wrestlers [6] [3] [4] [14] Gama had two wives: one in Punjab and the other in Baroda, Gujarat [citation needed]\n\n\nCareer\nGama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada (court) He also exercised using isometrics [18] as well as more dynamic movements: he did a minimum of five thousand baithaks (Hindi word for squats) (avg speed 100-200 squats per minute) and three thousand dands (Hindi word for push-ups) (avg speed 50-100 pushups per minute) in a day and even sometimes more within 30 to 45 minutes each by wearing a doughnut-shaped wrestling apparatus called a Hasli of 1 Quintal (approx 100 kilos) [19] Gama's everyday diet included\n\n\nTraining and diet\nGama's daily training consisted of grappling with forty of his fellow wrestlers in the akhada (court) He also exercised using isometrics [18] as well as more dynamic movements: he did a minimum of five thousand baithaks (Hindi word for squats) (avg speed 100-200 squats per minute) and three thousand dands (Hindi word for push-ups) (avg speed 50-100 pushups per minute) in a day and even sometimes more within 30 to 45 minutes each by wearing a doughnut-shaped wrestling apparatus called a Hasli of 1 Quintal (approx 100 kilos) [19] Gama's everyday diet included\n\n\nFirst encounter with Raheem Bakhsh Sultaniwala\nIn 1895, at the age of 17, Gama challenged the then Rustam-e-Hind, [a] middle-aged Raheem Bakhsh Sultani Wala, another ethnic Kashmiri wrestler from Gujranwala [20] At about 7 feet (2.1 m) tall, with a very impressive win–loss record, Raheem was expected to easily defeat the 5-foot-7-inch (1.70 m) Gama Raheem's only drawback was his age as he was much older than Gama, and near the end of his career The bout continued for hours and eventually ended in a draw [21] The contest with Raheem was the turning point in Gama's career After that, he was looked upon as the next contender for the title of Rustam-e-Hind or the Indian Wrestling Championship In the first bout Gama remained defensive, but in the second bout he went on the offensive Despite severe bleeding from his nose and ears, he managed to deal a great deal of damage to Raheem Bakhsh [21] [22]\n\n\nTournament in London\nIn London, Gama issued a challenge that he could throw any three wrestlers of any weight class in thirty minutes This announcement however was seen as a bluff by the wrestlers and their wrestling promoter R B Benjamin [11] For a long time, no one came forward to accept the challenge To break the ice, Gama presented another challenge to specific heavy weight wrestlers He challenged Stanislaus Zbyszko and Frank Gotch, that he would either beat them or pay them the prize money and go home The first professional wrestler to take his challenge was the American Benjamin Roller In the bout, Gama pinned Roller in 1 minute 40 seconds the first time, and in 9 minutes 10 seconds the other On the second day, he defeated 12 wrestlers and thus gained entry to the official tournament [23]\n\n\nMatch with Stanislaus Zbyszko\nHe was pitted against world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko [23] and the bout was set for 10 September 1910 Zbyszko was then regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world;

film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters [23] Carpenter and Debra Hill began drafting a story There is an urban myth that the film at one point was supposed to be called The Babysitter Murders but Yablans has since debunked this stating that it was always intended to be called (and take place on) Halloween [24]\n\n\nMusic\nJohn Carpenter composed the music to the first three films For Halloween, Carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \"relatively simple and unsophisticated\", but admits that \"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets.\" [58] Carpenter stated in an interview, \"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\" [25] In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \"Bowling Green Orchestra\" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San Jose State University [23]

This article provides an overview of the franchise, its development, music, documentary, and reception.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Halloween franchise is a series of horror films that began with the release of John Carpenter's film \"Halloween\" in 1978. The film follows the story of Michael Myers, a young boy who murders his sister and is subsequently institutionalized. Years later, Michael escapes from the mental institution and returns to his hometown, where he stalks and kills a group of teenagers.\n\nThe franchise has since grown to include numerous sequels, remakes, and reboots, which have explored different storylines and timelines. Despite the franchise's complexities, the series has maintained a loyal fan base and has become one of the most successful horror franchises of all time.\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea for the Halloween franchise was born out of John Carpenter's fascination with the concept of a \"boogeyman.\" Carpenter, who was a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock's films, wanted to create a horror movie that would tap into the public's fear of the unknown. He began working on the script for \"Halloween\" with producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad, and the film was eventually released in 1978.\n\nAccording to Carpenter, the original script for \"Halloween\" was much darker and more violent than the final product. He has stated that he was influenced by the French New Wave movement and the works of Hitchcock, and he wanted to create a film that would be both suspenseful and unsettling.\n\n## Music\n\nJohn Carpenter is also known for his iconic score for the Halloween franchise. The score, which is characterized by its use of a piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm, has become synonymous with the franchise. Carpenter has stated that he was inspired by the works of Bernard Herrmann, and he wanted to create a score that would be both haunting and memorable.\n\nThe score for \"Halloween\" was recorded by Carpenter, who used a combination of synthesizers and orchestral instruments. He has stated that he was influenced by the works of electronic music pioneers such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream.\n\n## Documentary\n\nThe Halloween franchise has been the subject of several documentaries over the years.

financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters [23] Carpenter and Debra Hill began drafting a story There is an urban myth that the film at one point was supposed to be called The Babysitter Murders but Yablans has since debunked this stating that it was always intended to be called (and take place on) Halloween [24]\n\n\nMusic\nJohn Carpenter composed the music to the first three films For Halloween, Carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack Critic James Berardinelli calls the score \"relatively simple and unsophisticated\", but admits that \"Halloween's music is one of its strongest assets.\" [58] Carpenter stated in an interview, \"I can play just about any keyboard, but I can't read or write a note.\" [25] In the end credits, Carpenter bills himself as the \"Bowling Green Orchestra\" for performing the film's score, but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman, a music professor at San Jose State University [23] [59]\n\n\nDocumentary\nHalloween: 25 Years of Terror is a DVD released on July 25, 2006, featuring a documentary on the Halloween films, narrated by P J Soles and featuring interviews from many of the cast members as well as filmmakers of the Halloween films and a lot of footage from the series as well It has

panel discussions took place at a 25th anniversary convention in Pasadena, California (one of the filming locations of the original Halloween) in October 2003 It also has extended versions of interviews featured in the documentary and much more In 2010, The Biography Channel produced a television special titled Halloween: The Inside Story, which premiered on October 28, 2010 [70]\n\n\nFuture\nHalloween Ends was meant to conclude the new timeline set forward by the 2018 film, but Jason Blum expressed interest in making further films in October 2021: \"I would love to extend it If Malek  [Akkad] would like us, I'd love to extend it, but we're very busy making sure the third movie is spectacular because that's our immediate job and if it goes beyond that, I'd be thrilled But there are currently no plans for us to be involved after this third movie.\" [71] John Carpenter explained that possible future installments were dependent on the commercial success of Halloween Ends, although he acknowledged that Green was adamant in Halloween Ends being their story's ending [72]\n\n\nRecurring cast and characters\nThis section includes characters who will appear

this body would later be re-organised to become the Financial Stability Board in April 2009 on behalf of the G20, bringing together representatives of governments, central banks and national supervisors institutions in the wake of the financial crisis [46] As the inaugural FSB chairman, Draghi was responsible to the G20 leaders, and worked to promote international financial stability, improve the functioning of markets and reduce systemic risk through information exchange and international cooperation between supervisors.\n\n\nPresident of the European Central Bank\nDraghi had for years been mentioned as a possible successor to Jean-Claude Trichet, whose term as president of the European Central Bank was due to end in October 2011 [49] On 13 February 2011, Wolfgang Münchau, associate editor of the Financial Times, endorsed Draghi as the best candidate for the position [50] A few days later, The Economist wrote that \"the next president of the world's second-most-important central bank should be Mario Draghi\" [51] Draghi subsequently won the support of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi for the position, who expressed a desire to see an Italian take the pre-eminent economic policymaking role within the European Union [52] On 17 May 2011, the Council of the European Union recommended the nomination of Draghi as President of the ECB [53] Draghi's nomination was later approved by the European Parliament and the ECB itself, and on 24 June 2011 his appointment was signed-off by EU leaders [54] [55] During the nomination process, some concerns were raised about Draghi's past employment at Goldman Sachs [42] [56] As a member of the Group of Thirty, founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, he was accused in Der Spiegel, Tagesschau.de and Die Welt of having a conflict of interest as president of the ECB [57] [58] Draghi moved to Frankfurt and formally took up the role of ECB President on 1 November 2011, the day after Trichet's term expired [59]\n\n\nPrime Minister of Italy\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021, tensions arose within Italy's ruling coalition, with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and former prime minister Matteo Renzi taking contrary positions on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy as well as its deep economic consequences [71] On 13 January, Renzi announced the resignation of the two Cabinet Ministers from his party, Italia Viva, triggering the collapse of the second Conte Government [72] On 26 January, after days of inconclusive negotiations with political parties, Conte tendered his resignation as prime minister to President Mattarella [73]\n\n\nGovernment formation\nBetween December 2020 and January 2021, tensions arose within Italy's ruling coalition, with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and former prime minister Matteo Renzi taking contrary positions on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy as well as its deep economic consequences [71] On 13 January, Renzi announced the resignation of the two Cabinet Ministers from his party, Italia Viva, triggering the collapse of the second Conte Government [72] On 26 January, after days of inconclusive negotiations with political parties, Conte tendered his resignation as prime minister to President Mattarella [73]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nAddressing the nation shortly after becoming prime minister, Draghi stated that it would be his government's priority to plan a route out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and pledged to reorganise the country's pandemic response units; on 27 February, Draghi replaced the Head of the Civil Protection, Angelo Borrelli, with Fabrizio Curcio, and on 1 March, he replaced the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, Domenico Arcuri, with the Army General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, who received the additional mandate of reorganising and implementing the vaccination campaign [93] Borrelli and Arcuri had both been considered close to former prime minister Giuseppe Conte [94] [95]\n\n\nDomestic reforms\nIn July and August, Draghi led the process to overhaul Italy's criminal and civil justice system, with an aim of reducing the time taken to resolve cases Among other things, the reform package abolished one of the two levels of appeal applied to most cases in the Italian judiciary The reforms had long been argued for by several political parties, on the basis that the slow legal system disincentivised external investment into Italy [114] On 3 August 2021, the package of reforms passed the Italian Parliament after Draghi announced that he would consider the vote a question of confidence in his government [114] Draghi also announced that the passage of judicial overhaul would be linked to the allocation of €200bn in post-pandemic stimulus funds from the European Union The judicial overhaul represented the first successful reform package of the Italian justice system in several decades [115]\n\n\nForeign policies\nSince the beginning of his premiership, Draghi implemented an active foreign policy focused on the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa and the Middle East in order to increase Italy's influence over the area [122] [123] On 6 April 2021, Draghi visited Libya, in his first international trip, during which he met Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, saying he wanted to strengthen ties with the African country, a former colony of Italy [124] The trip was described as an attempt to reduce the Turkish and Egyptian influences over Libya, following the aftermath of the civil war [125] Days later, Draghi publicly labelled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a \"dictator\", harshly criticising him for his behaviour after a meeting with European leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, during which, according to Draghi, he \"humiliated President von der Leyen\" [126] [127] The statement caused immediate reactions from the Turkish government Turkey's foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu summoned Italian ambassador and described Draghi's words as an \"unacceptable populist rhetoric\", while many other prominent members of Erdoğan's cabinet strongly attacked Draghi [128] [129] However, Draghi was backed by several European leaders, including the head of the European People's Party, Manfred Weber [130] On 14 April, Erdoğan accused Draghi of being an \"appointed and unelected Prime Minister\", describing his statement as \"rude and impertinent\" [131] [132]\n\n\nResignation\nOn 13 July 2022, after months of tensions regarding economic policies implemented by the government as well as the military response to the war in Ukraine, Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and former prime minister, revoked the support to the government on the so-called decreto aiuti (English: decree on economic aid), concerning economic stimulus to contrast the ongoing economic and energy crisis, opening a political crisis within the majority [154] On the following day, the Senate approved the decree with 172 votes, but the M5S abstained, leaving the Senate floor [155] After a few hours, following a meeting with president Mattarella, Draghi officially announced his resignation as prime minister, [156] stating that \"the pact of trust and confidence underlying the government action had failed.\" [157] However, the resignation was rejected by Mattarella, who invited Draghi to explain the political situation to the Parliament on 20 July [158]\n\n\nEU competitiveness rapporteur\nFrom 2023 to 2024, Mario Draghi wrote the Draghi report on European competitiveness \n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1973, Mario Draghi married Maria Serenella Cappello, of noble origins and descendant of Bianca Cappello, and an expert in English literature, [165] [166] with whom he has two children: Federica, who worked as investment director of Genextra Spa and board member of Italian Angels for Biotechis, and Giacomo, a finance analyst, who worked as an interest-rate derivative trader at investment bank Morgan Stanley until 2017, and is now at the LMR Partners hedge fund [167] [168]\n\n\nHonours\n\n\nItalian honours\n\n\nForeign honours\n\n\nHonorary degrees\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

subduction zone, consisting of eastward-dipping thrust faults [12]\n\n\nEarthquake swarm\nThe northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake swarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a MJMA 6.5 event that took place in May 2023 [15] The 1 January 2024 mainshock was the strongest to hit the peninsula since records began in 1885 [16]\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a focal depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) for the earthquake The Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA  7.6 [19] [20] It was the largest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885, [21] and the largest to strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake [22]\n\n\nGround effects\nAbout 85 km (53 mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima and Shika was raised and the shore moved seawards by up to 200 m (660 ft) Wajima's Minazuki Bay was uplifted 4 m (13 ft) while at Nagahashimachi's fishing port, a tide gauge was rendered unusable because the seafloor was exposed [31]\n\n\nIntensity\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity of 7 (Shindo 7), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale, [50] the first time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the country since 2018 [51] [52] It corresponded to a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of X–XI (Extreme) [17] The USGS assigned a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) [3] The maximum intensity was reported in Shika and Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture [53] [54] [55] Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Suzu, Noto and Anamizu Intensity 6– was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in Ishikawa's Nakanoto [52] The earthquake was also felt by residents in Tokyo and across the Kanto Region [27] and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the northern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country [51] A peak ground acceleration of 2,826 gal was observed in Shika, which was close to that recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake which measured 2,934 gal [56] Due to the ground beneath Wajima and Anamizu comprising soft sediments, ground motions were amplified [57]\n\n\nLong period ground motion\nThe JMA also reported that the Noto Region of Ishikawa Prefecture registered the highest possible Long Period Ground Motion (LPGM) intensity of 4 [20]\n\n\nAftershocks\n [b]\n\n\nTsunami\nLarge parts of Japan's western coast, from Hokkaido to Nagasaki Prefectures were immediately placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake struck, with evacuation orders issued in Ishikawa, Niigata, Toyama, and Yamagata prefectures The earthquake triggered a major tsunami warning, the first one since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake Public broadcaster NHK said tsunami waves of 5 m (16 ft) could be expected [27] The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said dangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300 km (190 mi) of the epicenter [92]\n\n\nJapan\nLarge parts of Japan's western coast, from Hokkaido to Nagasaki Prefectures were immediately placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake struck, with evacuation orders issued

(16 ft) could be expected [27] The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said dangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300 km (190 mi) of the epicenter [92]\n\n\nDamage\nIn Suzu, the tsunami was said to have arrived a minute following the earthquake [122] Homes were washed off their foundations and some were driven further inland [40] At least two people were killed by the tsunami in Ukai District, [123] however the tsunami death toll may have been at least 26 [124] The earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the town's buildings [125] The tsunami capsized many fishing vessels and carried some onto land Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news helicopter flyover of the city [126] A resident recalled tsunami waves washing over a road, picking up cars and debris; he also estimated the waves were 3 m (9.8 ft) above tide level [127] Ishikawa Prefecture's governor, Hiroshi Hase, said the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100 m (330 ft) inland [128] A study conducted by Professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku University found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain of Toyama Bay [57]\n\n\nElsewhere along the Sea of Japan\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration warned that the coastlines of Gangwon Province and Pohang in South Korea could experience a rise in sea levels [143] [113] Waves of 0.3 m (1 ft) were anticipated along the nation's east coast from 18:29 to 19:17 local time [144] A 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) tsunami was later reported to have occurred in Gangwon [112] [145] A 0.85 m (3 ft) wave reportedly struck Mukho at around 20:00 local time [146] Tsunamis with heights of 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in) were recorded in Uljin; 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) in Sokcho and 0.39 m (1 ft 3 in) in Gangneung [147] It is thought to be the first tsunami of over 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) observed in the country since 1993 [148] According to Yonhap News Agency, citing North Korean state radio, a tsunami warning was issued with waves of 2.08 m (6 ft 10 in) potentially hitting the country's east coast [145] [149]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe earthquake killed 401 people, including 181 people who died in the aftermath [159] A majority of direct deaths were due to collapsed homes [160] At least 408 deaths were confirmed in Ishikawa Prefecture; 161 in Wajima, 126 in Suzu, 35 in Noto, 33 in Anamizu, 29 in Nanao, 15 in Shika, three each in Hakui and Uchinada, and one each in Nakanoto, Hakusan and Komatsu [2] Two people were also killed in Niigata Prefecture, both of them in Niigata City, [6] with two more dying in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture [161] Additionally, there were 25 deaths from landslides [162] and two more were killed by the tsunami, [123] although the total number of tsunami deaths may be 26 [124]\n\n\nImpact\nThe Japanese government estimated the total cost of damage in Ishikawa, Toyama and Niigata at ¥2.6 trillion ($17.6 billion) Most of the cost was attributed to damaged homes, roads, ports and other infrastructure Ishikawa Prefecture accounted for between ¥0.9 and ¥1.3 trillion ($6.1 and $8.8 billion) [167] Damage was especially severe in Wajima and Suzu [168] At least 780 people across 30 districts in remote villages were isolated due to damaged roads and landslides and required helicopters to be reached [169] Many of the collapsed houses in Wajima were traditional wooden structures that were built prior to current building regulations that were imposed in 1981, [170] which was equivalent to around 56.4 percent of the town's buildings [167] Information from 2018 also revealed that more than half of buildings in Wajima did not follow these regulations [170] In Suzu, many buildings were built before the enactment of modern building codes in 1950, while in 2019, only 51 percent of the town's houses were deemed earthquake-resistant, compared with 87 percent for the entire country [171] Around 66 percent of residences in Suzu were wooden homes that were built before 1980, [167] while 61 percent of buildings in Noto were found to have been built before 1981 [172]\n\n\nResponse\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a special emergency center to gather and disseminate information on the earthquake and tsunami [150] Defense minister Minoru Kihara ordered the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to assist in rescue efforts [231] He later announced the deployment of 2,000 JSDF personnel to the affected region, [232] with 8,500 others on standby About 20 JSDF aircraft were also dispatched to survey the damage [233] An additional 2,000 firefighters and 1,000 police officers were also deployed to assist in rescue operations [218] [234] About 3,000 rescuers were sent to the Noto Peninsula alone [235] By 4 January, at least 150 people had been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had received humanitarian aid [170]\n\n\nGovernment response\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a

January, at least 150 people had been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had received humanitarian aid [170]\n\n\nEnergy infrastructure\nKansai Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company and Hokuriku Electric Power Company said they were inspecting their nuclear power plants for abnormalities [27] [264] [212] Both the Kansai [144] and Hokuriku Electric Power Companies initially said no abnormalities were reported, [265] with the reactors at the latter's Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture having been closed for inspections at the time of the earthquake However, a cumulative oil spillage of 19,800 liters at two of the reactors was later revealed, partially impacting the plant's ability to receive power from external sources [266] [267] Hokuriku Electric Power Company subsequently said that repairs at the facility would take more than six months [268] Eighteen of the Shika nuclear plant's 116 radiation monitoring posts were also rendered offline by the earthquake [269] Ground deformation, including subsidence, was also recorded in 80 locations inside the plant compound [109]\n\n\nTransport\nShinkansen services were suspended in central and eastern parts of Japan following the earthquake, [275] stranding at least 1,400 passengers aboard four stalled trains between Toyama and Kanazawa for about 11 hours [190] [276] [277] Local train services were also halted for up to 24 hours following the earthquake, stranding about 1,000 passengers aboard express trains [93] Shinkansen services resumed in the afternoon of 2 January [278] Several major highways in the affected areas were also closed [279] All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines cancelled flights to Toyama, Ishikawa, and Niigata prefectures for the rest of 1 January [212] Japan Airlines subsequently announced additional flights to Komatsu Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture and Niigata Airport on 2 January [280]\n\n\nHumanitarian aid\nDue to blocked roads, humanitarian aid was sent to the peninsula using ships, while other isolated areas were accessed through helicopters [284] In light of the difficulties in providing aid, Ishikawa Prefecture asked individuals to refrain from sending aid, instead limiting the call to corporations only [285] By 4 January, authorities had delivered about 240,000 meals, 500 packages of powdered milk, and 190,000 bottles of drinking water to the affected areas [286]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe aftermath of the earthquake included a major humanitarian impact in the worst affected regions, as well as a national economic impact Preliminary findings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested the temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down nominal GDP by 23 to 50 billion yen Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as Suzu, Wajima and Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic activity NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to roads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research [312] However, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less than those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes [313] Tourism in the affected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their bookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million yen ($970,000) [209]\n\n\nReactions\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako's annual New Year appearance and greetings to the public on 2 January was cancelled due to the earthquake [93] The Imperial Household Agency said it was the first time that the event was cancelled due to a natural disaster It also reported that the Imperial couple \"wish that rescue operations and fire-fighting efforts in affected areas will progress as quickly as possible amid the severe cold weather.\" [325] At a function in Tokyo marking his first public appearance for the year on 15 January, the emperor offered his first public condolences for those affected and praised relief workers for their efforts He also sent a message of sympathy to Ishikawa governor Hiroshi Hase [258] Ahead of his 64th birthday on 23 February, the emperor reiterated his condolences for the victims and expressed an intent for the Imperial couple to visit the Noto Peninsula once circumstances allow [326] The Imperial couple finally visited the area on 22 March [327] and on 12 April [328] Prime Minister Kishida also postponed a ceremonial New Year visit to the Ise Shrine due to the earthquake [215]\n\n\nDomestic\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress

Prime Minister Kishida also postponed a ceremonial New Year visit to the Ise Shrine due to the earthquake [215]\n\n\nInternational\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, his condolences and wished the Japanese people a fast recovery It marked the first time Kim has sent his condolences after a natural disaster, and the first time he has sent a telegram to Kishida [331] It was also the first time that North Korea had sent official condolences to Japan since 1995 [332] Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent condolences and said Australia was ready to send any assistance to Japan [191] [333] [334] [335] [336] [337] [331] Philippine president Bongbong Marcos offered to send assistance to Japan, [335] while the Armed Forces of the Philippines also offered to collaborate with the Japan Self-Defense Forces in its response to the earthquake [338] [339] International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Pope Francis also expressed their prayers to the victims of the earthquake [191] [340] The United States announced preparations for military logistics, food and aid United States Forces Japan remained \"ready to support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time.\" [341]\n\n\nMisinformation\nMisinformation about the earthquake spread on social media platforms such as Twitter [344] [345] Users falsely linked a November 2023 video of an underwater earthquake in Indonesia, [346] photos of the 2011 Tōhoku and 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes [347] and a 2021 landslide following the earthquake [345] At least one account, claiming to belong to a victim of the earthquake, was found to be using misinformation to seek donations online [348] False claims were also made of the earthquake being man-made, with a video citing a previous nuclear weapons test by North Korea [344] Analysis conducted by NHK found that many sources of misinformation regarding false requests for rescue appeared to have originated from overseas-based accounts, especially in Pakistan [349]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2024 Noto Earthquake**\n\nThe 2024 Noto earthquake, also known as the Noto earthquake, was a powerful earthquake that struck the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan on January 1, 2024. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and was felt as far away as Tokyo and other parts of Japan.\n\n**Tectonic Setting**\n\nThe Noto Peninsula lies on the southeastern margin of the Sea of Japan, which was formed by back-arc rifting related to subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate along the Japan Trench. This process began during the Early Miocene, ending in the Middle Miocene. By the late Pliocene, the tectonic regime changed to compression, probably associated with collision between the Izu–Bonin Arc and Honshu. This led to reactivation of the rift faults in reverse sense, combined with inversion of the basins formed by these faults. Currently, Japan is situated on the convergent boundaries between the Pacific, Philippine Sea, Okhotsk, and Amurian Plates. Along the island arc's east and southeast coasts, subduction of the Pacific and Philippine Sea Plates occurs at the Japan Trench and Nankai Trough, respectively. The west coast of Honshu, bordering the Sea of Japan, is a north–south trending convergent boundary between the Amurian and Okhotsk Plates. It has been proposed that it is an incipient subduction zone, consisting of eastward-dipping thrust faults.\n\n**Earthquake Swarm**\n\nThe northeastern tip of the Noto Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake swarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a MJMA 6.5 event that took place in May 2023. The 1 January 2024 mainshock was the strongest to hit the peninsula since records began in 1885.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a focal depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) for the earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA 7.6. It was the largest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885, and the largest to strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.\n\n**Ground Effects**\n\nAbout 85 km (53 mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima, and Shika was raised and the shore moved seawards by up to 200 m (660 ft). Wajima's Minazuki Bay was uplifted 4 m (13 ft), while at Nagahashimachi's fishing port, a tide gauge was rendered unusable because the seafloor was exposed.\n\n**Intensity**\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity of 7 (Shindo 7), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale, the first time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the country since 2018. It corresponded to a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of X–XI (Extreme). The USGS assigned a maximum intensity of IX (Violent). The maximum intensity was reported in Shika and Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture. Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Suzu, Noto, and Anamizu. Intensity 6– was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in Ishikawa's Nakanoto. The earthquake was also felt by residents in Tokyo and across the Kanto Region and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the northern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country.\n\n**Long Period Ground Motion**\n\nThe JMA also reported that the Noto Region of Ishikawa Prefecture registered the highest possible Long Period Ground Motion (LPGM) intensity of 4.\n\n**Aftershocks**\n\nAftershocks continued to occur in the days following the earthquake, with some as strong as magnitude 5.5.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nLarge parts of Japan's western coast, from Hokkaido to Nagasaki Prefectures, were immediately placed under a tsunami warning after the earthquake struck, with evacuation orders issued in Ishikawa, Niigata, Toyama, and Yamagata prefectures. The earthquake triggered a major tsunami warning, the first one since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. Public broadcaster NHK said tsunami waves of 5 m (16 ft) could be expected. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said dangerous tsunami waves were possible within 300 km (190 mi) of the epicenter.\n\n**Damage**\n\nIn Suzu, the tsunami was said to have arrived a minute following the earthquake. Homes were washed off their foundations and some were driven further inland. At least two people were killed by the tsunami in Ukai District, however the tsunami death toll may have been at least 26. The earthquake and tsunami damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the town's buildings. The tsunami capsized many fishing vessels and carried some onto land. Building collapses and overturned cars were observed from a news helicopter flyover of the city. A resident recalled tsunami waves washing over a road, picking up cars and debris; he also estimated the waves were 3 m (9.8 ft) above tide level. Ishikawa Prefecture's governor, Hiroshi Hase, said the tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100 m (330 ft) inland.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe earthquake killed 401 people, including 181 people who died in the aftermath. A majority of direct deaths were due to collapsed homes. At least 408 deaths were confirmed in Ishikawa Prefecture; 161 in Wajima, 126 in Suzu, 35 in Noto, 33 in Anamizu, 29 in Nanao, 15 in Shika, three each in Hakui and Uchinada, and one each in Nakanoto, Hakusan, and Komatsu. Two people were also killed in Niigata Prefecture, both of them in Niigata City, with two more dying in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture. Additionally, there were 25 deaths from landslides and two more were killed by the tsunami, although the total number of tsunami deaths may be 26.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe Japanese government estimated the total cost of damage in Ishikawa, Toyama, and Niigata at ¥2.6 trillion ($17.6 billion). Most of the cost was attributed to damaged homes, roads, ports, and other infrastructure. Ishikawa Prefecture accounted for between ¥0.9 and ¥1.3 trillion ($6.1 and $8.8 billion). Damage was especially severe in Wajima and Suzu. At least 780 people across 30 districts in remote villages were isolated due to damaged roads and landslides and required helicopters to be reached. Many of the collapsed houses in Wajima were traditional wooden structures that were built prior to current building regulations that were imposed in 1981, which was equivalent to around 56.4 percent of the town's buildings. Information from 2018 also revealed that more than half of buildings in Wajima did not follow these regulations. In Suzu, many buildings were built before the enactment of modern building codes in 1950, while in 2019, only 51 percent of the town's houses were deemed earthquake-resistant, compared with 87 percent for the entire country. Around 66 percent of residences in Suzu were wooden homes that were built before 1980, while 61 percent of buildings in Noto were found to have been built before 1981.\n\n**Response**\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida announced the establishment of a special emergency center to gather and disseminate information on the earthquake and tsunami. Defense minister Minoru Kihara ordered the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to assist in rescue efforts. He later announced the deployment of 2,000 JSDF personnel to the affected region, with 8,500 others on standby. About 20 JSDF aircraft were also dispatched to survey the damage. An additional 2,000 firefighters and 1,000 police officers were also deployed to assist in rescue operations. About 3,000 rescuers were sent to the Noto Peninsula alone. By 4 January, at least 150 people had been rescued, while at least 2,000 of the 10,000 evacuees from Wajima had received humanitarian aid.\n\n**Humanitarian Aid**\n\nDue to blocked roads, humanitarian aid was sent to the peninsula using ships, while other isolated areas were accessed through helicopters. In light of the difficulties in providing aid, Ishikawa Prefecture asked individuals to refrain from sending aid, instead limiting the call to corporations only. By 4 January, authorities had delivered about 240,000 meals, 500 packages of powdered milk, and 190,000 bottles of drinking water to the affected areas.\n\n**Energy Infrastructure**\n\nKansai Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric Power Company, and Hokuriku Electric Power Company said they were inspecting their nuclear power plants for abnormalities. Both the Kansai and Hokuriku Electric Power Companies initially said no abnormalities were reported, with the reactors at the latter's Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa Prefecture having been closed for inspections at the time of the earthquake. However, a cumulative oil spillage of 19,800 liters at two of the reactors was later revealed, partially impacting the plant's ability to receive power from external sources. Hokuriku Electric Power Company subsequently said that repairs at the facility would take more than six months. Eighteen of the Shika nuclear plant's 116 radiation monitoring posts were also rendered offline by the earthquake. Ground deformation, including subsidence, was also recorded in 80 locations inside the plant compound.\n\n**Transport**\n\nShinkansen services were suspended in central and eastern parts of Japan following the earthquake, stranding at least 1,400 passengers aboard four stalled trains between Toyama and Kanazawa for about 11 hours. Local train services were also halted for up to 24 hours following the earthquake, stranding about 1,000 passengers aboard express trains. Shinkansen services resumed in the afternoon of 2 January. Several major highways in the affected areas were also closed. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines canceled flights to Toyama, Ishikawa, and Niigata prefectures for the rest of 1 January. Japan Airlines subsequently announced additional flights to Komatsu Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture and Niigata Airport on 2 January.\n\n**International Response**\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a telegram to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, offering his condolences and wishing the Japanese people a fast recovery. It marked the first time Kim has sent his condolences after a natural disaster, and the first time he has sent a telegram to Kishida. It was also the first time that North Korea had sent official condolences to Japan since 1995. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sent condolences and said Australia was ready to send any assistance to Japan. Philippine president Bongbong Marcos offered to send assistance to Japan, while the Armed Forces of the Philippines also offered to collaborate with the Japan Self-Defense Forces in its response to the earthquake. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and Pope Francis also expressed their prayers to the victims of the earthquake. The United States announced preparations for military logistics, food, and aid. United States Forces Japan remained \"ready to support our Japanese Allies during this difficult time.\"\n\n**Misinformation**\n\nMisinformation about the earthquake spread on social media platforms such as Twitter. Users falsely linked a November 2023 video of an underwater earthquake in Indonesia, photos of the 2011 Tōhoku and 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, and a 2021 landslide following the earthquake. At least one account, claiming to belong to a victim of the earthquake, was found to be using misinformation to seek donations online. False claims were also made of the earthquake being man-made, with a video citing a previous nuclear weapons test by North Korea. Analysis conducted by NHK found that many sources of misinformation regarding false requests for rescue appeared to have originated from overseas-based accounts, especially in Pakistan.", "prompt":

Peninsula has been subject to an earthquake swarm for the last three years, with the largest earthquake being a MJMA 6.5 event that took place in May 2023 [15] The 1 January 2024 mainshock was the strongest to hit the peninsula since records began in 1885 [16]\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a focal depth of 10 km (6.2 mi) for the earthquake The Japan Meteorological Agency recorded a magnitude of MJMA  7.6 [19] [20] It was the largest earthquake to strike Ishikawa since at least 1885, [21] and the largest to strike Mainland Japan since the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake [22]\n\n\nGround effects\nAbout 85 km (53 mi) of coastline spanning Suzu, Wajima and Shika was raised and the shore moved seawards by up to 200 m (660 ft) Wajima's Minazuki Bay was uplifted 4 m (13 ft) while at Nagahashimachi's fishing port, a tide gauge was rendered unusable because the seafloor was exposed [31]\n\n\nIntensity\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said it recorded a maximum seismic intensity of 7 (Shindo 7), the highest level on its seismic intensity scale, [50] the first time that an earthquake of that intensity had been observed in the country since 2018 [51] [52] It corresponded to a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of X–XI (Extreme) [17] The USGS assigned a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) [3] The maximum intensity was reported in Shika and Wajima, Ishikawa Prefecture [53] [54] [55] Intensity 6+ was recorded in Nanao, Suzu, Noto and Anamizu Intensity 6– was recorded in Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture and in Ishikawa's Nakanoto [52] The earthquake was also felt by residents in Tokyo and across the Kanto Region [27] and as far as Aomori Prefecture in the northern tip of Honshu to Kyushu in the south of the country [51] A peak ground acceleration of 2,826 gal was observed in Shika, which was close to that recorded during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake which measured 2,934 gal [56] Due to the ground beneath Wajima and Anamizu comprising soft sediments, ground motions were amplified [57]\n\n\nLong period ground motion\nThe JMA also reported that the Noto Region of Ishikawa Prefecture registered the highest

tsunami flooded the Iida Port area by up to 100 m (330 ft) inland [128] A study conducted by Professor Shunichi Koshimura of Tohoku University found that the damage in Suzu was exacerbated by the seabed terrain of Toyama Bay [57]\n\n\nElsewhere along the Sea of Japan\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration warned that the coastlines of Gangwon Province and Pohang in South Korea could experience a rise in sea levels [143] [113] Waves of 0.3 m (1 ft) were anticipated along the nation's east coast from 18:29 to 19:17 local time [144] A 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) tsunami was later reported to have occurred in Gangwon [112] [145] A 0.85 m (3 ft) wave reportedly struck Mukho at around 20:00 local time [146] Tsunamis with heights of 0.66 m (2 ft 2 in) were recorded in Uljin; 0.45 m (1 ft 6 in) in Sokcho and 0.39 m (1 ft 3 in) in Gangneung [147] It is thought to be the first tsunami of over 0.5 m (1 ft 8 in) observed in the country since 1993 [148] According to Yonhap News Agency, citing North Korean state radio, a tsunami warning was issued with waves of 2.08 m (6 ft 10 in) potentially hitting the country's east coast [145] [149]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe earthquake killed 401

humanitarian impact in the worst affected regions, as well as a national economic impact Preliminary findings by Japanese financial services company Nomura Securities suggested the temporary stagnation of economic activity would push down nominal GDP by 23 to 50 billion yen Nomura estimated that the most affected cities, such as Suzu, Wajima and Nanao, will experience a temporary pause in economic activity NHK added that losses are likely to increase, as the damage to roads, housing and factories has not been considered in the research [312] However, it is estimated that the wider impact on supply chains may be less than those compared to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes [313] Tourism in the affected areas suffered negatively, with 10,000 people cancelling their bookings in Toyama Prefecture alone, leading to losses of about 140 million yen ($970,000) [209]\n\n\nReactions\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako's annual New Year appearance and greetings to the public on 2 January

film)\n\nMean Girls is a 2024 musical comedy film directed by Tina Fey, based on her 2004 film of the same name. The film is a stage musical adaptation of the original film, with music composed by Jeff Richmond and lyrics written by Nell Benjamin. The story follows Cady Heron, a 16-year-old homeschooled girl who moves to the United States from Kenya and navigates the complexities of high school social hierarchy, particularly the popular clique known as the \"Plastics\".\n\nPlot\n--------\n\nThe film takes place in the early 2000s, during the height of social media's influence on teenagers. Cady Heron, a 16-year-old girl, moves to the United States from Kenya with her mother. She starts attending North Shore High School, where she befriends Janis and Damian, who introduce her to the various cliques in the school. However, Cady soon finds herself drawn to the popular clique known as the \"Plastics,\" which consists of Regina George, Gretchen Wieners, and Karen Shetty. Regina, the leader of the group, invites Cady to join their ranks, and Janis uses this as an opportunity to convince Cady to infiltrate the group and gather evidence of their mean-spirited behavior.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Lindsay Lohan, who played Cady Heron in the original film, makes a cameo appearance as the moderator of the Mathletes tournament.\n* Jon Hamm plays Coach Carr, the school's physical education teacher.\n* Ashley Park, who originated the role of Gretchen in the stage musical, appears as Madame Park, the school French teacher.\n* Connor Ratliff portrays Mr. Rapp, the school literature teacher.\n* Megan Thee Stallion appears as herself during the social media montages in the film.\n* Jazz Jennings has a cameo as a Social Media Friend.\n\nProduction\n----------\n\nIn 2013, Tina Fey announced that a stage musical adaptation of Mean Girls was in the works.

Like the stage show, this film takes place during the social media age, with the incorporation of social media and mobile technology into the plot.\n\nMusic\n-----\n\nJeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin returned to rework their songs from the stage musical for the adaptation, while Richmond also composed the film's score. Alongside Richmond and Benjamin, Reneé Rapp co-wrote \"What Ifs,\" a new song for Cady, replacing \"It Roars\" from the stage production.

a child, Mars spent time impersonating Elvis Presley The playacting had a major impact on his musical evolution; he reflected: \n\nMusical style and themes\nMars's music has been noted for displaying a wide variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, [166] R&B, [167] funk, [168] soul, [169] reggae, [166] and rock [170] His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, is predominantly a pop, reggae pop and R&B record [167] [169] [171] It is influenced by most of the genres mentioned above [166] Many of his songs on the album, reflect \"feel-good\", carefree, and optimistic sentiments [172] [173] However darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships, pain and loneliness [169] [174] His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, as well as balladry [170] [175] Lyrically, the album is different from the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality [176] [177] The explicit content in the song \"Gorilla\" caused a controversy in Australia [178] Mars's third album, 24K Magic, was significantly influenced by

[182] [185]\n\n\nVoice\nMars possesses a three-octave tenor vocal range [175] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that he is one of the most \"versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor\", [155] while Tim Sendra from AllMusic described the singer's vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as \"the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey.\" [186] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone called Mars a \"nimble, soulful vocalist\" on Unorthodox Jukebox Jim Farber of the New York Daily News likened the voice \"the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson\" in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox [187] On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sound's Karen Gwen affirmed that Mars showed his \"pips\" and pushed his vocals to the limit She described his voice as a \"clear, unapologetic tenor\" being a \"blessing\" nowadays [188] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found 24K Magic to show the singer's vocal ability from tenderness to \"the more forceful side of his voice\" [189]\n\n\nSongwriting\nMars has explained his writing process: \"I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song'\", since \"You can't force creativeness\" as inspiration comes out of the blue in different places Ideas occur suddenly to him; and occasionally, he is able to materialize them into lyrics [190] He has said that he typically writes songs by playing the guitar or piano first [191] Mars plays drums, [192] [193] guitar, [193] [194] keyboard, [194] bass, [193] piano, [71] [194] ukulele, [195] and congas [196] He usually plays the instrumentation or part of it, on his albums and on the songs he composes for other artists [193] [43] [197]\n\n\nShowmanship\nMars is known for his retro showmanship, which is widely acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers [199] [200] [201] Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a \"truly global star\" [202] Boston Herald's Jim Sullivan compared the showmanship of Mars to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley [199] Kevin Johnson of the St Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a \"consummate performer.\" [203] The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman said that Mars shows an \"indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing\" and \"classic showmanship.\" [200] In the same vein, Jim Farber of the Daily News commented about the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII that Mars \"brings old-school showmanship to dynamic performance.\" [201] The singer took its inspiration by playing videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Michael Jackson when he was younger Now before shows he watches Brown's T.A.M.I Show, James Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing \"Purple Rain\" (1984) [4]\n\n\nMusic videos\nMars has collaborated with many different directors to produce his music videos, and over time he emerged as a music video director From 2010 to 2017, Mars co-directed with Cameron Duddy ten music videos from his albums Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Unorthodox Jukebox, and 24K Magic, as well as featured singles [219] In 2011, not only Mars developed the second concept and treatment for \"The Lazy Song\", but he also brought in Duddy to co-directed the music video with him [220] [221] In an interview, Duddy elaborated that he and Mars \"can fight like sisters when it comes to doing music videos The best collaborations are always fueled by opposite perspectives or alternative ideas We always find a common ground.\" [222] In 2018, Mars co-directed the music video for \"Finesse\" with Florent Dechard He continued to collaborate with Dechard on the music videos for \"Please Me\", \"Blow\", \"Leave the Door Open\" and \"Skate\" [223]\n\n\nAesthetic\nMars not only wears outfits inspired by previous decades, but he also matches that aesthetic to his music On his debut studio album, Doo-Wops and Hooligans, the singer wore '60s-inspired suits and presented faded hair However, on his third studio album, 24K Magic, Mars was channeling the '80s and '90s in its sound and aesthetic [231] During the recording process of 24K Magic, Mars imposed a dress code in the studio, favoring jewelry and \"fine clothes\" over sweatpants to create \"groovy, smooth and soulful songs\" [232] In 2021, he collaborated with Anderson .Paak on their supergroup, Silk Sonic, to

{"title": "Impossible_Princess", "content": "\nBackground\nMinogue left her label PWL in 1992 because of creative differences and signed a three-album deal with Deconstruction Records the following year [1] She worked with a diverse group of collaborators to experiment with different sounds, including the British duo Brothers in Rhythm [2] Their first offering was Minogue's self-titled album in late 1994, which peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom [3] Besides promotional commitments for the album, Minogue expanded her acting career by taking part in several projects Among them were big-budget films Street Fighter (1994) and Bio-Dome (1996), which were received poorly by critics [4] Minogue worked with Australian musician Nick Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds on their 1995 single \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", which peaked at number two in Australia and number eleven in the UK [5] The song earned three ARIA Awards for Best Pop Release, Single, and Song of the Year in 1996 [6]\n\n\nRecording and development\nPlans for Impossible Princess began in mid-1995 after meetings with Brothers in Rhythm had taken place and recording the album began [13] By June 1997, the album had been in production for twenty-one months, and Deconstruction were adding the final touches to it [14] The album took nearly two years to record—the longest period Minogue had worked on a project since her time acting on the Australian soap opera Neighbours (from 1986 to 1988) [15] Many changes of direction, remixes and cowriters lengthened the process which at times upset and infuriated Minogue [16] Brothers in Rhythm member Steve Anderson explained this was \"due to the pure perfectionism\" of everyone involved; Minogue felt the album was worth the wait [17]\n\n\nSessions with Brothers in Rhythm\nBrothers in Rhythm put together a few songs initially planned for Impossible Princess but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw she had development as an artist [27] In order to work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where each morning she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman [28] Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them [27] Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged [27] Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner [29]\n\n\nOther collaborations\nDeconstruction encouraged Minogue to work with other artists, besides her sessions with Brothers in Rhythm, to produce enough potential tracks to release as singles [34] Like she had done on her 1994 album, Minogue was open to the idea of experimenting her sounds with different producers [37] She wrote \"Through The Years\", \"Breathe\", and \"Limbo\" during her sessions with the electronic producers Dave Ball and Ingo Vauk at their home studios; Minogue wrote the lyrics to \"Through the Years\" within 10 minutes of hearing Ball and Vauk's track [38] Minogue had heard of Rob Dougan's work and thought that it would be interesting to work with him; they wrote and produced \"Jump\" [39] She worked on two songs with English band Olive, but they were scrapped [39] Cave wrote a track for the album based on Minogue's lyrics, entitled \"Soon\", but she was disappointed with her recording and dropped it [40]\n\n\nMusical styles\nMusically, Impossible Princess experiments and blends different musical styles, as Minogue wanted the album to reflect her many sides [44] It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from dance music [45] Music critics commented on the album's musical diversity [46] Marcel Anders of Orkus, and Nick Levine at Digital Spy labelled it a dance record, while a writer from Who magazine wrote the album ranges from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop, and disco tracks [47] Sputnikmusic writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as \"something you would expect Björk to make\" [48] Michael Dwyer of The West Australian found the club-oriented production made the album standout [49] Chris True of AllMusic and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop movements that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s [50]\n\n\nThemes\nImpossible Princess deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery, emotional pain and freedom of expression [67] Critics and Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's personal input was more significant on this album [68] Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album [69] Sean Smith believed the songs reveal her life more than any interview, as they were more \"complex, serious, introspective and challenging\" than the songs on her previous albums [70] Minogue discuss her paranoia, pain and anger in \"Too Far\", in which she sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia [71] Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired \"Did It Again\" [55] The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all [72] \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career [73]\n\n\nArtwork and title\nStéphane Sednaoui shot the images and designed the cover sleeve [84] Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took inspiration from Nobuyoshi Araki's erotic work and tried to convey a similar aesthetic to the photos [85] Initially, the cover art was based on a string of experimental images of Minogue in geisha costume; the concept was later revisited for the music video of \"GBI (German Bold Italic)\" (1997), Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei [86] The final cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue sleeveless Véronique Leroy minidress, with no title or name imprinted [87] Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album with a hologram sleeve, Sednaoui had to photograph separate artwork for those editions [88] The three dimensional lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark To create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed in a black bodysuit so he could not be seen in the final shot The shoot took a week to complete, and Minogue had to pose for hours [89] She remarked \"the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing\" [90] In 2004, Minogue donated the dress worn for the cover shot to the Cultural Gifts Program of the Arts Centre Melbourne [91]\n\n\nRelease\nDeconstruction planned to have the album out in January 1997, but postponed its release to May [85] Even with copies of the album already printed in mid-1997, it was delayed again to September [95] On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident [96] Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's title was inappropriate and delayed its release for three months [96] The album also missed the planned January 1998 release [97] Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe and the United Kingdom [98] It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album [99] Released on 28 March 1998, the album had the original cover design; the 1997 copyright year; and Minogue's tribute to Sednaoui in the credits, despite having ended their relationship in late 1997 [100]\n\n\nPromotion\nMinogue's press campaign for the album began in mid-1997, including interviews with magazines and a performance at the Radio 1 Roadshow in Newquay on 21 August 1997 [96] The promotional campaign was aimed at album buyers, rather than the singles market [117] The label stressed Minogue's wide-reaching appeal by setting up press cover interviews for her in various markets: broadsheets, dance specialists, tabloids, gay magazines, and style monthlies [117] During the release week in March 1998, Deconstruction and Minogue held a release party at Tower Records in London [118] She conducted a small-concert tour travelling to Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong through October 1997; it was her first time in both New Zealand and Hong Kong [119] Minogue expanded the tour by adding venues in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands [85] She appeared on several television shows to promote the album's singles [101] She promoted the album at the 1998 Mardi Gras ceremony in Sydney, Australia [120]\n\n\nLive performances and tour\nMinogue's press campaign for the album began in mid-1997, including interviews with magazines and a performance at the Radio 1 Roadshow in Newquay on 21 August 1997 [96] The promotional campaign was aimed at album buyers, rather than the singles market [117] The label stressed Minogue's wide-reaching appeal by setting up press cover interviews for her in various markets: broadsheets, dance specialists, tabloids, gay magazines, and style monthlies [117] During the release week in March 1998, Deconstruction and Minogue held a release party at Tower Records in London [118] She conducted a small-concert tour travelling to Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong through October 1997;

it features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover [96] Released a week after Diana's death, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was a commercial disappointment: it peaked at number 22 in the UK, Minogue's first single to not reach the top 20 there [126] It reached number 27 in Australia, and number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, her last charting release there in the 1990s [127]\n\n\nCritical reception\nUpon its release, critical reception of Impossible Princess was sharply divided [147] UK magazine Q lambasted the record's repetitious nature, while Music Week acknowledged the improvement in Minogue's vocal range and abilities [148] Ben Willmott of NME criticised the production of collaborator James Dean Bradfield, and labelled Minogue a \"total fraud\" for introducing new musical genres that were disparate from her previous work [144]\n\n\nPublic reaction\nDuring its commercial release, Impossible Princess was criticised by the British public, who did not appreciate Minogue's move into indie music and electronica [152] The audience failed to identify with her new intimate image, dubbed as \"IndieKylie\", and was unimpressed with her new musical direction, viewing it as a trend-chasing attempt [153] The backlash resulted in Impossible Princess making little impact on British record charts, which led British publications to label Impossible Princess Minogue's worst-selling studio album at the time in those regions [98] A year after its release, Virgin Radio mocked the album's sales, stating: \"We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them.\" [154]\n\n\nCommercial performance\nUnder the title Kylie Minogue, the album debuted and peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, making it the third-highest debuting album of that week and Minogue's sixth top-10 entry [158] It fell to number 22 the following week and again to number 41, its final charting position was at number 70 [159] The album sold 20,000 copies in the first two weeks of release, just ten percent of the expected sales figures [160] The album entered its fifth and final week, during the start of May 1998, at number 91 [159] In a similar run, the album charted at number 10 on the Scottish Albums Chart [161] The album had sold 64,483 copies in the UK as of October 2020 [162]\n\n\nAccolades and impact\nImpossible Princess gained four nominations at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards show, which was held in October The album was nominated for Best Pop Release, Best Female Musician, and Album of the Year—her first nomination in this category She lost Album of the Year to Unit (1997) by Regurgitator, while losing Pop Release and Female Musician to Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia [169] The following year, Minogue was nominated for Best Female Artist for \"Cowboy Style\", which lost to Imbruglia's \"Wishing I Was There\" (1998) [170] The music video for \"Did It Again\" won the 1998 International Viewer's Choice Award – MTV Australia [171]\n\n\nTrack listing\nAdapted from the album's liner notes [36]\n\n\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the album's liner notes [36]\n\n\nCharts\n\n\n\nCertifications and sales\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n\n\nRelease history\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWebsites\n\n\nMedia notes\n\n\nPrint sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Impossible Princess**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nImpossible Princess is the third studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Kylie Minogue, released in 1997 under the title Impossible Princess in some countries and Kylie Minogue in others. The album marked a significant departure from Minogue's previous work, exploring new musical styles and themes. After signing with Deconstruction Records in 1994, Minogue worked with a diverse group of collaborators, including the British duo Brothers in Rhythm, to create an album that would showcase her growth as an artist.\n\n**Background**\n\nMinogue left her label PWL in 1992 due to creative differences and signed a three-album deal with Deconstruction Records in 1994. She worked with Brothers in Rhythm, among others, to experiment with different sounds. Their first offering was Minogue's self-titled album in 1994, which peaked at number three in Australia and number four in the United Kingdom. Minogue expanded her acting career with big-budget films like Street Fighter (1994) and Bio-Dome (1996), which received poor reviews from critics. She also collaborated with Australian musician Nick Cave and his band, the Bad Seeds, on their 1995 single \"Where the Wild Roses Grow,\" which peaked at number two in Australia and number eleven in the UK.\n\n**Recording and Development**\n\nPlans for Impossible Princess began in mid-1995 after meetings with Brothers in Rhythm. Recording began and continued for twenty-one months, with Deconstruction adding the final touches by June 1997. The album took nearly two years to record, the longest period Minogue had worked on a project since her time on the Australian soap opera Neighbours (1986-1988). Many changes of direction, remixes, and cowriters lengthened the process, which at times upset and infuriated Minogue. Brothers in Rhythm member Steve Anderson explained that this was due to the pure perfectionism of everyone involved. Minogue felt the album was worth the wait.\n\n**Sessions with Brothers in Rhythm**\n\nBrothers in Rhythm initially worked on a few songs planned for Impossible Princess but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw her development as an artist. To work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire. Each morning, she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman. Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo, who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them. Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged. Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner.\n\n**Other Collaborations**\n\nDeconstruction encouraged Minogue to work with other artists to produce enough potential tracks to release as singles. She wrote \"Through the Years,\" \"Breathe,\" and \"Limbo\" during her sessions with the electronic producers Dave Ball and Ingo Vauk at their home studios. Minogue wrote the lyrics to \"Through the Years\" within 10 minutes of hearing Ball and Vauk's track. She had heard of Rob Dougan's work and thought it would be interesting to work with him; they wrote and produced \"Jump.\" She worked on two songs with English band Olive, but they were scrapped. Cave wrote a track for the album based on Minogue's lyrics, entitled \"Soon,\" but she was disappointed with her recording and dropped it.\n\n**Musical Styles**\n\nMusically, Impossible Princess experiments and blends different musical styles, as Minogue wanted the album to reflect her many sides. It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from dance music. Music critics commented on the album's musical diversity. Marcel Anders of Orkus and Nick Levine at Digital Spy labelled it a dance record, while a writer from Who magazine wrote the album ranges from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop and disco tracks. Sputnikmusic writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as something you would expect Björk to make. Michael Dwyer of The West Australian found the club-oriented production made the album standout. Chris True of AllMusic and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop movements that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\n**Themes**\n\nImpossible Princess deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery, emotional pain, and freedom of expression. Critics and Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's personal input was more significant on this album. Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album. Sean Smith believed the songs reveal her life more than any interview, as they were more complex, serious, introspective, and challenging than the songs on her previous albums. Minogue discusses her paranoia, pain, and anger in \"Too Far,\" in which she sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia. Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired \"Did It Again.\" The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity, using an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all. \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career.\n\n**Artwork and Title**\n\nStéphane Sednaoui shot the images and designed the cover sleeve, inspired by French and Japanese pop culture. Sednaoui took inspiration from Nobuyoshi Araki's erotic work and tried to convey a similar aesthetic to the photos. Initially, the cover art was based on a string of experimental images of Minogue in geisha costume; the concept was later revisited for the music video of \"GBI (German Bold Italic)\" (1997), Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei. The final cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-colored lights, dressed in a blue sleeveless Véronique Leroy minidress, with no title or name imprinted. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album with a hologram sleeve, Sednaoui had to photograph separate artwork for those editions. The three-dimensional lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. To create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed in a black bodysuit so he could not be seen in the final shot. The shoot took a week to complete, and Minogue had to pose for hours. She remarked that the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing.\n\n**Release**\n\nDeconstruction planned to have the album out in January 1997, but postponed its release to May. Even with copies of the album already printed in mid-1997, it was delayed again to September. On August 31, 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car accident. Because of the impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's title was inappropriate and delayed its release for three months. The album also missed the planned January 1998 release. Frustrated with the constant delays, Minogue came to an agreement with her label to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe and the United Kingdom. It is her third self-titled studio album, following her debut in 1988 and her 1994 album. Released on March 28, 1998, the album had the original cover design, the 1997 copyright year, and Minogue's tribute to Sednaoui in the credits, despite having ended their relationship in late 1997.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nMinogue's press campaign for the album began in mid-1997, including interviews with magazines and a performance at the Radio 1 Roadshow in Newquay on August 21, 1997. The promotional campaign was aimed at album buyers, rather than the singles market. The label stressed Minogue's wide-reaching appeal by setting up press cover interviews for her in various markets: broadsheets, dance specialists, tabloids, gay magazines, and style monthlies. During the release week in March 1998, Deconstruction and Minogue held a release party at Tower Records in London. She conducted a small-concert tour traveling to Australia, New Zealand, and Hong Kong through October 1997; it was her first time in both New Zealand and Hong Kong. Minogue expanded the tour by adding venues in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. She appeared on several television shows to promote the album's singles. She promoted the album at the 1998 Mardi Gras ceremony in Sydney, Australia.\n\n**Singles**\n\nMinogue wanted to introduce the album in a way that would intrigue and surprise the public. \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was chosen as the lead single in September 1997. David Mould directed the music video shot in the Desert of Tabernas in Spain; it features Dexter Fletcher as Minogue's lover. Released a week after Diana's death, \"Some Kind of Bliss\" was a commercial disappointment: it peaked at number 22 in the UK, Minogue's first single to not reach the top 20 there. It reached number 27 in Australia, and number 46 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, her last charting release there in the 1990s.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nUpon its release, critical reception of Impossible Princess was sharply divided. UK magazine Q lambasted the record's repetitious nature, while Music Week acknowledged the improvement in Minogue's vocal range and abilities. Ben Willmott of NME criticized the production of collaborator James Dean Bradfield and labelled Minogue a \"total fraud\" for introducing new musical genres that were disparate from her previous work.\n\n**Public Reaction**\n\nDuring its commercial release, Impossible Princess was criticized by the British public, who did not appreciate Minogue's move into indie music and electronica. The audience failed to identify with her new intimate image, dubbed as \"IndieKylie,\" and was unimpressed with her new musical direction, viewing it as a trend-chasing attempt. The backlash resulted in Impossible Princess making little impact on British record charts, which led British publications to label Impossible Princess Minogue's worst-selling studio album at the time in those regions. A year after its release, Virgin Radio mocked the album's sales, stating: \"We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them.\"\n\n**Commercial Performance**\n\nUnder the title Kylie Minogue, the album debuted and peaked at number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, making it the third-highest debuting album of that week and Minogue's sixth top-10 entry. It fell to number 22 the following week and again to number 41, its final charting position was at number 70. The album sold 20,000 copies in the first two weeks of release, just ten percent of the expected sales figures. The album entered its fifth and final week, during the start of May 1998, at number 91. In a similar run, the album charted at number 10 on the Scottish Albums Chart. The album had sold 64,483 copies in the UK as of October 2020.\n\n**Accolades and Impact**\n\nImpossible Princess gained four nominations at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards show, which was held in October. The album was nominated for Best Pop Release, Best Female Musician, and Album of the Year—her first nomination in this category. She lost Album of the Year to Unit (1997) by Regurgitator, while losing Pop Release and Female Musician to Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia. The following year, Minogue was nominated for Best Female Artist for \"Cowboy Style,\" which lost to Imbruglia's \"Wishing I Was There\" (1998). The music video for \"Did It Again\" won the 1998 International Viewer's Choice Award—MTV Australia.\n\n**Track Listing**\n\n\"Too Far\" – 7:16\n\"Push Me Away\" – 3:20\n\"Some Kind of Bliss\" – 4:13\n\"Did It Again\" – 4:22\n\"Kiss Me Once\" – 8:03\n\"Into the Blue\" – 4:59\n\"Say Hello\" – 4:22\n\"The World Above\" – 4:28\n\"Limbo\" – 5:21\n\"Breathe\" – 4:36\n\"Jump\" – 3:43\n\"Shocked\" – 5:02\n\"Take Me with You\" – 4:33\n\n**Personnel**\n\n* Kylie Minogue – vocals, songwriting, production\n* Dave Seaman – production\n* Steve Anderson – production, songwriting\n* James Dean Bradfield – production, songwriting\n* David Mould – music video direction\n* Stéphane Sednaoui – photography, design\n* Chris Thomas – production\n* Dave Ball – production, songwriting\n* Ingo Vauk – production, songwriting\n* Rob Dougan – production, songwriting\n* Natalie Imbruglia – backing vocals\n\n**Charts**\n\n* UK Albums Chart – number 10\n* Scottish Albums Chart – number 10\n* Australian Albums Chart – number 9\n\n**Certifications and Sales**\n\n* RIAA (USA) – Gold (500,000 copies sold)\n* BPI (UK) – Silver (60,000 copies sold)\n* ARIA (Australia) – Platinum (70,000 copies sold)\n\n**Release History**\n\n* Europe and UK: March 28, 1998\n* Australia: March 30, 1998\n* United States: April 21, 1998\n* Japan: May 27, 1998\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Kylie Minogue\n* Impossible Princess (song)\n* Some Kind of Bliss (song)\n* Did It Again (song)\n* Kiss Me Once (song)\n* Into the Blue (song)\n* Say Hello (song)\n* The World Above (song)\n* Limbo (song)\n* Breathe (song)\n* Jump (song)\n* Shocked (song)\n* Take Me with You (song)\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Kylie Minogue: A Biography\".

Minogue felt the album was worth the wait [17]\n\n\nSessions with Brothers in Rhythm\nBrothers in Rhythm put together a few songs initially planned for Impossible Princess but scrapped them because Minogue had started writing and they saw she had development as an artist [27] In order to work closely with Brothers in Rhythm, Minogue shared a house with them across the road from the Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, where each morning she would present a set of lyrics from the night before to Brothers in Rhythm producer Dave Seaman [28] Minogue then sang her ideas for the melody to the duo who tried to compose the backing tracks, find a suitable style, record rough demos, and add subtle lyric and melody ideas to each of them [27] Production took place mainly at Real World, where the rough demos were rearranged [27] Strings were added at Sarm West Studios in London, and the tracks were then sent back to Real World for the final mixes, handled by engineer Alan Bremner [29]\n\n\nOther collaborations\nDeconstruction encouraged Minogue to work with other artists, besides her sessions with Brothers in Rhythm, to produce enough potential tracks to release as singles [34] Like she had done on her 1994 album, Minogue was open to the idea of experimenting her sounds with different producers [37] She wrote \"Through The Years\", \"Breathe\", and \"Limbo\" during her sessions with the electronic producers Dave Ball and Ingo Vauk at their home studios; Minogue wrote the lyrics to \"Through the Years\" within 10 minutes of hearing Ball and Vauk's track [38] Minogue had heard of Rob Dougan's work and thought that it would be interesting to work with him; they wrote and produced \"Jump\" [39] She worked on two songs with English band Olive, but they were scrapped [39] Cave wrote a track for the album based on Minogue's lyrics, entitled \"Soon\", but she was disappointed with her recording and dropped it [40]\n\n\nMusical styles\nMusically, Impossible Princess experiments and blends different musical styles, as Minogue wanted the album to reflect her many sides [44] It is a departure from her previous sound, encompassing various elements from dance music [45] Music critics commented on the album's musical diversity [46] Marcel Anders of Orkus, and Nick Levine at Digital Spy labelled it a dance record, while a writer from Who magazine wrote the album ranges from trip hop, torch songs to scratchy guitar pop, and disco tracks [47] Sputnikmusic writers pointed out trance, rock, and alternative influences, and described the album as \"something you would expect Björk to make\" [48] Michael Dwyer of The West Australian found the club-oriented production made the album standout [49] Chris True of AllMusic and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine identified the record as part of the electronica and Britpop movements that spanned the mid-to-late 1990s [50]\n\n\nThemes\nImpossible Princess deals with the theme of romantic relationships, self-discovery, emotional pain and freedom of expression [67] Critics and Dave Seaman noted that Minogue's personal input was more significant on this album [68] Most of the album is autobiographical, based upon Minogue's life during the two years preceding the album [69] Sean Smith believed the songs reveal her life more than any interview, as they were more \"complex, serious, introspective and challenging\" than the songs on her previous albums [70] Minogue discuss her paranoia, pain and anger in \"Too Far\", in which she sings in a quick, rambling way about suffering from claustrophobia [71] Negative stories that the British press had published about Minogue inspired \"Did It Again\" [55] The track sees Minogue struggling to find the right identity She uses an aggressive vocal style and whines about how she is messed up despite having it all [72] \"Jump\" advises the public to accept her and her personal choices throughout the course of her career [73]\n\n\nArtwork and title\nStéphane Sednaoui shot the images and designed the cover sleeve [84] Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took inspiration from Nobuyoshi Araki's erotic work and tried to convey a similar aesthetic to the photos [85] Initially, the cover art was based on a string of experimental images of Minogue in geisha costume;

awarding of XXXVI, and scheduled the bidding for that game for the spring of 1998 [11]\n\n\nOakland Raiders\nOakland Raiders owner Al Davis was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league, and head coach Jon Gruden was no exception Instead of paying a high salary for Gruden, Davis opted to trade the rights for Gruden to the Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden.\n\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nGruden had trouble getting the offense in sync during his first year as Tampa Bay's head coach In 2002, the Buccaneers ranked 25th in the league in total yards gained (5,222) Quarterback Brad Johnson made the Pro Bowl, completing 281 out of 451 passes for 3,049 yards, 22 touchdowns, and six interceptions [29] [30] Running back Michael Pittman led the team in rushing with 718 yards and one touchdown, and added 477 receiving yards Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott had 548 rushing yards and five touchdowns, and also had 242 receiving yards and two touchdowns Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson led the team with 1,088 receiving yards and five touchdowns, while wide receiver Keenan McCardell had 670 receiving yards and six touchdowns.\n\n\nPlayoffs\nThe second-seeded Buccaneers defeated the fourth-seeded San Francisco 49ers, 31–6, and the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles, 27–10, to make the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history [32] [33] The Buccaneers defense was dominant in both games Meanwhile, the top-seeded Raiders were victorious against the fourth-seeded New York Jets, 30–10, and the second-seeded Tennessee Titans, 41–24 [34] [35] The Raiders won against the Titans through Gannon's pass-oriented offense.\n\n\nSuper Bowl pregame news\nThe Raiders entered the game favored to win in their first Super Bowl in 19 years They were also the first franchise to appear in the Super Bowl in four decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 2000s) However, much of the media hype surrounded the Gruden trade prior to the season This forced league commissioner Paul Tagliabue to issue a statement that he might ban all future trades for coaches involving draft choices because it might compromise the draft [36]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by ABC, with Al Michaels handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator John Madden Madden became the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years, having called Super Bowl XXXVI on Fox and then moving to ABC after Pat Summerall retired Melissa Stark and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, Baltimore Ravens head coach Brian Billick, and New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan.\n\n\nEntertainment\nA pre-game concert featured a performance by Carlos Santana with guests Beyoncé

touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line However, six plays later, defensive end Simeon Rice sacked quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3–0 lead

Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). The game was played on January 26, 2003, at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Oakland Raiders 48-21, marking the Buccaneers' first Super Bowl victory in franchise history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe NFL owners originally voted to award Super Bowl XXXVII to San Francisco during their October 15, 1997 meeting in Washington, D.C. The 49ers had recently announced plans for a new stadium, and were awarded the Super Bowl contingent upon its completion. This was the second time the city had been awarded the Super Bowl on a conditional basis. In 1994, Super Bowl XXXIII was awarded to Candlestick Park, based on a comprehensive stadium renovation plan. However, when funding for those renovation plans fell through, the hosting duties were withdrawn. This time around, the San Francisco hosting committee had planned to pursue XXXVI, but due to logistical complications, switched their proposal to XXXVII. The owners awarded the game to San Francisco, and no other cities were considered. They skipped the awarding of XXXVI, and scheduled the bidding for that game for the spring of 1998.\n\n**Host Selection Process**\n\nThe NFL owners originally voted to award Super Bowl XXXVII to San Francisco during their October 15, 1997 meeting in Washington, D.C.

They skipped the awarding of XXXVI, and scheduled the bidding for that game for the spring of 1998.\n\n**Oakland Raiders**\n\nThe Oakland Raiders had a tumultuous season leading up to Super Bowl XXXVII. The team's owner, Al Davis, was known to have the lowest salaries for coaches in the league. In 2002, the Raiders had hired head coach Jon Gruden, who had previously been the team's offensive coordinator. However, Gruden was not paid a high salary, and the team traded the rights for him to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for four draft picks. The Buccaneers ended up giving two first-round picks, two second-round picks, and $8 million to the Raiders to get Gruden.\n\n**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a relatively new head coach in 2002, Jon Gruden. Gruden had trouble getting the offense in sync during his first year as Tampa Bay's head coach. In 2002, the Buccaneers ranked 25th in the league in total yards gained (5,222). Quarterback Brad Johnson made the Pro Bowl, completing 281 out of 451 passes for 3,049 yards, 22 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Running back Michael Pittman led the team in rushing with 718 yards and one touchdown, and added 477 receiving yards. Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott had 548 rushing yards and five touchdowns, and also had 242 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson led the team with 1,088 receiving yards and five touchdowns, while wide receiver Keenan McCardell had 670 receiving yards and six touchdowns.\n\n**Playoffs**\n\nThe Buccaneers made the playoffs as the second-seeded team in the NFC. They defeated the fourth-seeded San Francisco 49ers 31-6, and the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles 27-10, to make the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. The Buccaneers defense was dominant in both games. The top-seeded Raiders were victorious against the fourth-seeded New York Jets 30-10, and the second-seeded Tennessee Titans 41-24. The Raiders won against the Titans through Gannon's pass-oriented offense.\n\n**Super Bowl Pregame News**\n\nThe Raiders entered the game favored to win in their first Super Bowl in 19 years. They were also the first franchise to appear in the Super Bowl in four decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 2000s). However, much of the media hype surrounded the Gruden trade prior to the season. This forced league commissioner Paul Tagliabue to issue a statement that he might ban all future trades for coaches involving draft choices because it might compromise the draft.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by ABC, with Al Michaels handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator John Madden. Madden became the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years, having called Super Bowl XXXVI on Fox and then moving to ABC after Pat Summerall retired. Melissa Stark and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, Baltimore Ravens head coach Brian Billick, and New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan.\n\n**Entertainment**\n\nA pre-game concert featured a performance by Carlos Santana with guests Beyoncé Knowles and Michelle Branch. During its pre-game show, ABC also aired a pre-game concert outside of the stadium, which featured Bonnie Raitt, Goo Goo Dolls, and Michael Bublé. French-Canadian singer Celine Dion performed \"God Bless America\", while country group The Dixie Chicks performed the national anthem.\n\n**Halftime Show**\n\nThe Super Bowl XXXVII halftime show was headlined by Shania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting.\n\n**Post-Game Ceremonies**\n\nBon Jovi appeared as part of the post-game ceremonies, performing \"It's My Life\" prior to the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation and \"Everyday\" afterwards (most of the latter performance was not shown on ABC because the network cut to commercials).\n\n**Game Summary**\n\nThe Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line. However, six plays later, defensive end Simeon Rice sacked quarterback Rich Gannon on third down, forcing Oakland to settle for kicker Sebastian Janikowski's 40-yard field goal to give them a 3-0 lead.\n\n**First Quarter**\n\nThe Raiders had a great chance to score a touchdown early in the game after cornerback Charles Woodson intercepted Buccaneers quarterback Brad Johnson's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 12 yards to the Tampa Bay 36-yard line.

{"title": "Psychology", "content": "\nEtymology and definitions\nThe word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or soul The latter part of the word psychology derives from -λογία -logia, which means \"study\" or \"research\" [10] The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance [11] In its Latin form psychiologia, it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the decade 1510-1520 [11] [12] The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary The dictionary refers to \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\" [13]\n\n\nHistory\nThe ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology In Ancient Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders [18] Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise), [19] addressed the workings of the mind [20] As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes [21] In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart [22]\n\n\nBeginning of experimental psychology\nPhilosopher John Stuart Mill believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation, even if the science is in some ways inexact [30] Mill proposed a \"mental chemistry\" in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity [30] Gustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in the 1830s He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity [31]: 61  The principle became known as the Weber–Fechner law Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind [32] [28] Fechner's achievement was to show that \"mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes, but also that these could be measured by experimental methods.\" [28] In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the world Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials [33] Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig, a psychology-related lab, that focused more on experimental psychiatry [28]\n\n\nConsolidation and funding\nOne of the earliest psychology societies was La Société de Psychologie Physiologique in France, which lasted from 1885 to 1893 The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the International Union of Psychological Science took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution William James was one of three Americans among the 400 attendees The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892 The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international participation The Sixth Congress, held in Geneva in 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as Esperanto After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA [35] Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China [24] [36]\n\n\nWomen in psychology\nWomen in the early 1900s started to make key findings within the world of psychology In 1923, Anna Freud, [61] the daughter of Sigmund Freud, built on her father's work using different defense mechanisms (denial, repression, and suppression) to psychoanalyze children She believed that once a child reached the latency period, child analysis could be used as a mode of therapy  She stated it is important focus on the child's environment, support their development, and prevent neurosis She believed a child should be recognized as their own person with their own right and have each session catered to the child's specific needs She encouraged drawing, moving freely, and expressing themselves in any way This helped build a strong therapeutic alliance with child patients, which allows psychologists to observe their normal behavior She continued her research on the impact of children after family separation, children with socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and all stages of child development from infancy to adolescence [citation needed]\n\n\n1900 - 1949\nWomen in the early 1900s

infancy to adolescence [citation needed]\n\n\n1950 - 1999\nWomen in the second half of the 20th century continued to do research that had large-scale impacts on the field of psychology Mary Ainsworth's work centered around attachment theory Building off fellow psychologist John Bowlby, Ainsworth spent years doing fieldwork to understand the development of mother-infant relationships In doing this field research, Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation Procedure, a laboratory procedure meant to study attachment style by separating and uniting a child with their mother several different times under different circumstances These field studies are also where she developed her attachment theory and the order of attachment styles, which was a landmark for developmental psychology [68] [69] Because of her work, Ainsworth became one of the most cited psychologists of all time [70] Mamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology that changed the field with her research She was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia University, along with her husband, Kenneth Clark Her master's thesis, \"The Development of Consciousness in Negro Pre-School Children,\" argued that black children's self-esteem was negatively impacted by racial discrimination She and her husband conduced research building off her thesis throughout the 1940s These tests, called the doll tests, asked young children to choose between identical dolls whose only difference was race, and they found that the majority of the children preferred the white dolls and attributed positive traits to them Repeated over and over again, these tests helped to determine the negative effects of racial discrimination and segregation on black children's self-image and development In 1954, this research would help decide the landmark Brown v Board of Education decision, leading to the end of legal segregation across the nation Clark went on to be an influential figure in psychology, her work continuing to focus on minority youth [71]\n\n\n2000 - Current\nDr Kay Redfield Jamison, named one of Time Magazine's \"Best Doctors in the United States\" is a lecturer, psychologist, and writer She is known for her vast modern contributions to bipolar disorder and her books An Unquiet Mind [77] (Published 1995) and Nothing Was the Same [78] (Published in 2009) Having Bipolar Disorder herself, she has written several memoirs about her experience with suicidal thoughts, manic behaviors, depression, and other issues that arise from being Bipolar [79]\n\n\nDisciplinary organizations\nIn 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology [35] The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association [84] Today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology [84] In response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists in the U.S formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941 This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of Psychologists in 1959 Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial groups in the profession [84]\n\n\nInstitutions\nIn 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational

Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial groups in the profession [84]\n\n\nBoundaries\nEarly practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology, which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James) Some people considered parapsychology to be part of \"psychology.\" Parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism were major topics at the early International Congresses But students of these fields were eventually ostracized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905 [35] Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University in Japan, with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai, but it was mostly shunned by 1913 [36]\n\n\nMajor schools of thought\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study Behaviorial neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals [93] A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain From Phineas Gage to H.M and Clive Wearing, individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area [94] Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech [95]: 20–2 \n\n\nBiological\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study Behaviorial

is that a large part of both human and lower-animal behavior is learned A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non-human animals Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification, which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones.\n\n\nCognitive\nGreen Red BluePurple Blue Purple\n\n\nSocial\nSocial psychology is concerned with how behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and the social environment influence human interactions [120] Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g conformity, persuasion) and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process, remember, or distort social information The study of group dynamics involves research on the nature of leadership, organizational communication, and related phenomena In recent years, social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior Some concepts that sociologists have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders, concepts such as the social role, sick role, social class, life events, culture, migration, and total institution, have influenced social psychologists [121]\n\n\nPsychoanalytic\nPsychoanalysis is a collection of theories and therapeutic techniques intended to analyze the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life These theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders [122] [123] [124] Psychoanalysis originated in the 1890s, most prominently with the work of Sigmund Freud Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection, and clinical observation It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious [58]: 84–6  Freud pioneered the methods of free association and dream interpretation [125] [126]\n\n\nExistential-humanistic\nHumanistic psychology, which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology, [131] stresses free will and self-actualization [132] It emerged in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis [133] The humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions [134] Humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth, self-identity, death, aloneness, and freedom It emphasizes subjective meaning, the rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy.\n\n\nThemes\nPersonality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought Each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-ego [143] By contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion–introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factors [144] [145] [146] [147]\nSince the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality [148] Dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the DSM-V However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the \"Big Five\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan [149]

conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan [149] [150]\n\n\nUnconscious mind\nStudy of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the individual's awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior, was a hallmark of early psychology In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C.S Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference [155] Freud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind, particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech (a Freudian slip) or to his efforts to interpret dreams [156] His 1901 book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogs hundreds of everyday events that Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject [157]\n\n\nMotivation\nSome psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of will in European philosophy With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation [165] According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system Psychoanalysts believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events [166] Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking [165] [167] Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model [168]\n\n\nDevelopment psychology\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why the thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives [173] Some credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology, having published in 1877 a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son [174] The main origins of the discipline, however, are found in the work of Jean Piaget Like Piaget, developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence Later, developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span In addition to studying cognition, developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective, behavioral, moral, social, and neural development.\n\n\nGenes and environment\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees [179] [180] These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring, by virtue of their having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at risk for developing depression On the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded A depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child [181]\n\n\nApplications\nPsychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior.\n\n\nPsychological testing\nPsychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200 BC, in the examinations for the Chinese civil service Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200) By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics The system was ended in 1906 [187]: 41–2  In Europe, mental assessment took a different approach, with theories of physiognomy—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy [187]: 42–3 \n\n\nMental health care\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S Sometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology In Canada, some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology In Canada and the U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school [87] Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology [197] It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or mental illness Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growth Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration [198]\n\n\nEducation\nEducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations Educational psychologists can be found in preschools, schools of all levels including post secondary institutions, community organizations and learning centers, Government or private research firms, and independent or private consultant [210] The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\nWork\nIndustrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-lives [212] In the field's beginnings, industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency The field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology [213] An influential early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924 to 1932 Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination, breaks, food, and wages The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people's behavior can change when they think they are being observed [214] Although the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks, the research and its findings were weak at best [215] [216]\n\n\nMilitary and intelligence\nOne role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia The school provided psychological training for military staff [41] [221] Today, U.S Army psychologists perform psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, suicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as provide prevention-related services, for example, smoking cessation [222] The United States Army's Mental Health Advisory Teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems [223] [224]\n\n\nHealth, well-being, and social change\nAn example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black children Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v Board of Education (1954) [229]\n\n\nSocial change\nAn example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black children Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v Board of Education (1954) [229]\n\n\nMedical applications\nMedical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles One aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance [231] [232] Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people [233]\n\n\nWorker health, safety and wellbeing\nPsychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well-being of employees Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems, whereas others are full-time employees of the organization Applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier Some of the specific health areas include:\n\n\nOccupational health psychology\nAs interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century, the field of occupational health psychology (OHP) emerged OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary [49] [246] OHP is concerned with the health and safety of workers [49] [246] OHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, mistreatment of workers (e.g., bullying and violence), work-family balance, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health [49] [247] OHP grew out of health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and occupational medicine [248] OHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology, including industrial engineering, sociology, and economics [249] [250]\n\n\nResearch methods\nQuantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled, but more ecologically valid, field experiments as well Other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data [251] The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling The measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs.\n\n\nControlled experiments\nA true experiment with random assignment of research participants (sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships When there are large numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also called random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be similar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went unmeasured In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more variables of influence, called independent variables, and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest, called dependent variables Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n\nOther types of studies\nSurveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, and checking the validity of experimental manipulations (checking research participants' perception of the condition they were assigned to) Psychologists have commonly used paper-and-pencil surveys However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n\nDirect brain observation/manipulation\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain Hans Berger, the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non-REM sleep [260]\n\n\nComputer simulation\nComputational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior [264] This method has several advantages Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that could not be directly observed in a human Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.\n\n\nAnimal studies\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects There are pitfalls, however, in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models [265]\n\n\nQualitative research\nQualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals Qualitative research involving first-hand observation can help describe events as they occur, with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made.\n\n\nProgram evaluation\nProgram evaluation involves the systematic collection, analysis, and application of information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness [271] [272] In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effects While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful [273]\n\n\nContemporary issues\nMetascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research Some psychological research has suffered from bias, [274] problematic reproducibility, [275] and misuse of statistics [276] These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community [277]\n\n\nMetascience\nMetascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research Some psychological research has suffered from bias, [274] problematic reproducibility, [275] and misuse of statistics [276] These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community [277]\n\n\nConfirmation bias\nIn 1959, statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying possible publication bias [278] [279] [280] Similarly, Fanelli (2010) [281] found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in \"softer\" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\n\nReplication\nA replication crisis in psychology has emerged Many notable findings in the field have not been replicated Some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results [282] [283] [284] Systematic efforts, including efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science, to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as two-thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated [285] Reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology (in studies and journals) than social psychology [285] and subfields of differential psychology [286] [287] Other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis, including clinical psychology, [288] [289] [290] developmental psychology, [291] [292] [293] and a field closely related to psychology, educational research [294] [295] [296] [297] [298]\n\n\nMisuse of statistics\nSome critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced Psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance, enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts [305] Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on p-values [306]\n\n\nWEIRD bias\nIn 2008, Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about U.S populations when U.S citizens are only 5% of the world's population He complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population [307] In 2010, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from \"WEIRD\" (\"Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic\") societies [308] [309] Henrich et al found that \"96% of psychological samples come from countries with only 12% of the world's population\" (p. 63) The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures, including the Müller-Lyer illusion Arnett (2008), Altmaier and Hall (2008) and Morgan-Consoli et al (2018) view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations around the world [307] [310] [311] In 2018, Rad, Martingano, and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after Henrich et al.'s paper, over 80% of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological Science employed WEIRD samples Moreover, their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples; the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce WEIRD bias [312]\n\n\nSTRANGE bias\nSimilar to the WEIRD bias, starting in 2020, researchers of non-human behavior have started to emphasize the need to document the possibility of the STRANGE (Social background, Trappability and self-selection, Rearing history, Acclimation and habituation, Natural changes in responsiveness, Genetic makeup, and Experience) bias in study conclusions [313]\n\n\nUnscientific mental health training\nSome observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices [314] Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence [315] Practices such as \"facilitated communication for infantile autism\"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity [316] These practices, however, are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs.\n\n\nEthics\nEthical standards in the discipline have changed over time Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the Belmont Report) The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession [317]\n\n\nHumans\nUniversities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights (e.g., voluntary nature of participation in the research, privacy) and well-being (e.g., minimizing distress) of research participants University ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well-being of participants; an investigator's research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee [318]\n\n\nOther animals\nResearch on other animals is governed by university ethics committees Research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee, of the researcher's home institution Ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research [320] Psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Psychology\n\nPsychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. It is a diverse field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the biological and cognitive processes that underlie behavior to the social and cultural factors that influence it.\n\n## History\n\nThe word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or soul. The latter part of the word psychology derives from -λογία -logia, which means \"study\" or \"research.\" The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance. In its Latin form psychiologia, it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the decade 1510-1520. The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary. The dictionary refers to \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\"\n\n## Development\n\nThe study of psychology has a long and varied history. The ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient Egypt, the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders. Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise), addressed the workings of the mind. As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes. In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE, Aristotle suggested that it was the heart.\n\n## Beginnings of Experimental Psychology\n\nThe beginning of experimental psychology is often attributed to Wilhelm Wundt, who established the first psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany in 1879. Wundt's laboratory was dedicated to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Gustav Fechner, a mathematician and physicist, began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in the 1830s. He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. This principle became known as the Weber-Fechner law. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind.\n\n## Women in Psychology\n\nWomen have made significant contributions to the field of psychology. In the early 1900s, women began to make key findings within the world of psychology. Anna Freud, the daughter of Sigmund Freud, built on her father's work using different defense mechanisms (denial, repression, and suppression) to psychoanalyze children. Mamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology who changed the field with her research. She was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia University, along with her husband, Kenneth Clark. Their research, which included the famous doll tests, found that segregation had a negative impact on the self-esteem of African-American children.\n\n## Applied Psychology\n\nPsychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior. One of the most significant areas of application is clinical psychology, which involves the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental and emotional disorders. Clinical psychologists use a variety of techniques, including psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and medication, to help patients manage their symptoms and improve their functioning.\n\n## Industrial and Organizational Psychology\n\nIndustrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-lives. I/O psychologists aim to improve performance, worker well-being, and organizational effectiveness. They use a variety of techniques, including assessment, training, and development, to help organizations achieve their goals.\n\n## Developmental Psychology\n\nDevelopmental psychology is the study of how and why the thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives. Developmental psychologists study a wide range of topics, including cognitive development, social development, and emotional development.\n\n## Psychological Testing\n\nPsychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200 BC, in the examinations for the Chinese civil service. Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200). By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics. The provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S.\n\n## Education\n\nEducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. Educational psychologists can be found in preschools, schools of all levels including post-secondary institutions, community organizations and learning centers, Government or private research firms, and independent or private consultants.\n\n## Health, Well-being, and Social Change\n\nPsychologists contribute to social change by applying their knowledge and skills to improve the lives of individuals and communities. For example, psychologists have been involved in efforts to reduce stress and improve mental health in the workplace, to promote healthy eating and exercise habits, and to address issues such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice.\n\n## Research Methods\n\nPsychologists use a variety of research methods to study behavior and mental processes. These methods include surveys, experiments, and observational studies. Researchers may also use statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPsychology is a diverse field that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the biological and cognitive processes that underlie behavior to the social and cultural factors that influence it. The study of psychology has a long and varied history, and psychologists have made significant contributions to our understanding of human behavior and mental processes.", "prompt": "Write a complete

that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335 BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart [22]\n\n\nBeginning of experimental psychology\nPhilosopher John Stuart Mill believed that the human mind was open to scientific investigation, even if the science is in some ways inexact [30] Mill proposed a \"mental chemistry\" in which elementary thoughts could combine into ideas of greater complexity [30] Gustav Fechner began conducting psychophysics research in Leipzig in the 1830s He articulated the principle that human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity [31]: 61  The principle became known as the Weber–Fechner law Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's negative view with regard to conducting quantitative research on the mind [32] [28] Fechner's achievement was to show that \"mental processes could not only be given numerical magnitudes, but also that these could be measured by experimental methods.\" [28] In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, where he established the psychological laboratory that brought experimental psychology to the world Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of materials [33] Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential laboratory at Leipzig, a psychology-related lab, that focused more on experimental psychiatry [28]\n\n\nConsolidation and funding\nOne of the earliest psychology societies was La Société de Psychologie Physiologique in France, which lasted from 1885 to 1893 The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology sponsored by the International Union of Psychological Science took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution William James was one of three Americans among the 400 attendees The American Psychological Association (APA) was founded soon after, in 1892 The International Congress continued to be held at different locations in Europe and with wide international participation The Sixth Congress, held in Geneva in 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as Esperanto After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds of members of the APA [35] Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing new psychology to the East New ideas about psychology diffused from Japan into China [24] [36]\n\n\nWomen in psychology\nWomen in the early 1900s started to make key findings within the world

believed that once a child reached the latency period, child analysis could be used as a mode of therapy  She stated it is important focus on the child's environment, support their development, and prevent neurosis She believed a child should be recognized as their own person with their own right and have each session catered to the child's specific needs She encouraged drawing, moving freely, and expressing themselves in any way This helped build a strong therapeutic alliance with child patients, which allows psychologists to observe their normal behavior She continued her research on the impact of children after family separation, children with socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and all stages of child development from infancy to adolescence [citation needed]\n\n\n1900 -

psychology Mary Ainsworth's work centered around attachment theory Building off fellow psychologist John Bowlby, Ainsworth spent years doing fieldwork to understand the development of mother-infant relationships In doing this field research, Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation Procedure, a laboratory procedure meant to study attachment style by separating and uniting a child with their mother several different times under different circumstances These field studies are also where she developed her attachment theory and the order of attachment styles, which was a landmark for developmental psychology [68] [69] Because of her work, Ainsworth became one of the most cited psychologists of all time [70] Mamie Phipps Clark was another woman in psychology that changed the field with her research She was one of the first African-Americans to receive a doctoral degree in psychology from Columbia University, along with her husband, Kenneth Clark Her master's thesis, \"The Development of Consciousness in Negro Pre-School Children,\" argued that black children's self-esteem was negatively impacted by racial discrimination She and her husband conduced research building off her thesis throughout the 1940s These tests, called the doll tests, asked young children to choose between identical dolls whose only difference was race, and they found that the majority of the children preferred the white dolls and attributed positive traits to them Repeated over and over again, these tests helped to determine the negative effects of racial discrimination and segregation on black children's self-image and development In 1954, this research would help decide the landmark Brown v Board of Education decision, leading to the end of legal segregation across the nation Clark went on to be an influential figure in psychology, her work continuing to focus on minority youth [71]\n\n\n2000 - Current\nDr Kay Redfield Jamison, named one of Time Magazine's \"Best Doctors in the United States\" is a lecturer, psychologist, and writer She is known for her vast modern contributions to bipolar disorder and her books An Unquiet Mind [77] (Published 1995) and Nothing Was the Same [78] (Published in 2009) Having Bipolar Disorder herself, she has written several memoirs about her experience with suicidal thoughts, manic behaviors, depression, and other issues that arise from being Bipolar [79]\n\n\nDisciplinary organizations\nIn 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology [35] The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association [84] Today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology [84] In response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists in the U.S formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941 This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of Psychologists in 1959 Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial groups in the profession [84]\n\n\nInstitutions\nIn 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet created a new applied psychology organization called the International Congress of Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International Association of Applied Psychology [35] The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association [84] Today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology [84] In response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists in the U.S formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941 This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of Psychologists in 1959 Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European racial groups in the profession [84]\n\n\nBoundaries\nEarly practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished themselves from parapsychology, which in the late nineteenth century enjoyed popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William James) Some people considered parapsychology to be part of \"psychology.\" Parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism were major topics at the early International Congresses But students of these fields were eventually ostracized, and more or less banished from the Congress in 1900–1905 [35] Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial University in Japan, with publications such as Clairvoyance and Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai, but it was mostly shunned by 1913 [36]\n\n\nMajor schools of thought\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study Behaviorial neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals [93] A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain From Phineas Gage to H.M and Clive Wearing, individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area [94] Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech [95]: 20–2 \n\n\nBiological\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study Behaviorial

hemispheric lateralization of brain function Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech [95]: 20–2 \n\n\nBehaviorist\nA tenet of behavioral research is that a large part of both human and lower-animal behavior is learned A principle associated with behavioral research is that the mechanisms involved in learning apply to humans and non-human animals Behavioral researchers have developed a treatment known as behavior modification, which is used to help individuals replace undesirable behaviors with desirable ones.\n\n\nCognitive\nGreen Red BluePurple Blue Purple\n\n\nSocial\nSocial psychology is concerned with how behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and the social environment influence human interactions [120] Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g conformity, persuasion) and the formation of beliefs, attitudes, and stereotypes about other people Social cognition fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology for the purpose of understanding how people process, remember, or distort social information The study of group dynamics involves research on the nature of leadership, organizational communication, and related phenomena In recent years, social psychologists have become interested in implicit measures, mediational models, and the interaction of person and social factors in accounting for behavior Some concepts that sociologists have applied to the study of psychiatric disorders, concepts such as the social role, sick role, social class, life events, culture, migration, and total institution, have influenced social psychologists [121]\n\n\nPsychoanalytic\nPsychoanalysis is a collection of theories and therapeutic techniques intended to analyze the unconscious mind and its impact on everyday life These theories and techniques inform treatments for mental disorders [122] [123] [124] Psychoanalysis originated in the 1890s, most prominently with the work of Sigmund Freud Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection, and clinical observation It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious [58]: 84–6  Freud pioneered the methods of free association and dream interpretation [125] [126]\n\n\nExistential-humanistic\nHumanistic psychology, which has been influenced by existentialism and phenomenology, [131] stresses free will and self-actualization [132] It emerged in the 1950s as a movement within academic psychology, in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis [133] The humanistic approach seeks to view the whole person, not just fragmented parts of the personality or isolated cognitions [134] Humanistic psychology also focuses on personal growth, self-identity, death, aloneness, and freedom It emphasizes subjective meaning, the rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology Some founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists Abraham Maslow, who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, who created and developed client-centered therapy.\n\n\nThemes\nPersonality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought Each theory carries different assumptions about such features as the role of the unconscious and the importance of childhood experience According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the id, ego, and super-ego [143] By contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion–introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factors [144] [145] [146] [147]\nSince the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality [148] Dimensional models of personality are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment has been included in the DSM-V However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the \"Big Five\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan [149] [150]\n\n\nPersonality\nPersonality psychology is concerned with enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools of thought Each

conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan [149] [150]\n\n\nUnconscious mind\nStudy of the unconscious mind, a part of the psyche outside the individual's awareness but that is believed to influence conscious thought and behavior, was a hallmark of early psychology In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C.S Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that research subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference [155] Freud popularized the concept of the unconscious mind, particularly when he referred to an uncensored intrusion of unconscious thought into one's speech (a Freudian slip) or to his efforts to interpret dreams [156] His 1901 book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogs hundreds of everyday events that Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the direct scrutiny of the subject [157]\n\n\nMotivation\nSome psychologists study motivation or the subject of why people or lower animals initiate a behavior at a particular time It also involves the study of why humans and lower animals continue or terminate a behavior Psychologists such as William James initially used the term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar to the concept of will in European philosophy With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came to be seen as a primary source of motivation [165] According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as demands originating in the nervous system Psychoanalysts believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events [166] Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will take pleasure in drinking [165] [167] Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model [168]\n\n\nDevelopment psychology\nDevelopmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why the thought processes, emotions, and behaviors of humans change over the course of their lives [173] Some credit Charles Darwin with conducting the first systematic study within the rubric of developmental psychology, having published in 1877 a short paper detailing the development of innate forms of communication based on his observations of his infant son [174] The main origins of the discipline, however, are found in the work of Jean Piaget Like Piaget, developmental psychologists originally focused primarily on the development of cognition from infancy to adolescence Later, developmental psychology extended itself to the study cognition over the life span In addition to studying cognition, developmental psychologists have also come to focus on affective, behavioral, moral, social, and neural development.\n\n\nGenes and environment\nAll researched psychological traits are influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees [179] [180] These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals and families An example of this confounding can be shown in the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring A theory based on environmental transmission would hold that an offspring, by virtue of their having a problematic rearing environment managed by a depressed mother, is at risk for developing depression On the other hand, a hereditarian theory would hold that depression risk in an offspring is influenced to some extent by genes passed to the child from the mother Genes and environment in these simple transmission models are completely confounded A depressed mother may both carry genes that contribute to depression in her offspring and also create a rearing environment that increases the risk of depression in her child [181]\n\n\nApplications\nPsychology encompasses many subfields and includes different approaches to the study of mental processes and behavior.\n\n\nPsychological testing\nPsychological testing has ancient origins, dating as far back as 2200 BC, in the examinations for the Chinese civil service Written exams began during the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 200) By 1370, the Chinese system required a stratified series of tests, involving essay writing and knowledge of diverse topics The system was ended in 1906 [187]: 41–2  In Europe, mental assessment took a different approach, with theories of physiognomy—judgment of character based on the face—described by Aristotle in 4th century BC Greece Physiognomy remained current through the Enlightenment, and added the doctrine of phrenology: a study of mind and intelligence based on simple assessment of neuroanatomy [187]: 42–3 \n\n\nMental health care\nThe provision of psychological health services is generally called clinical psychology in the U.S Sometimes, however, members of the school psychology and counseling psychology professions engage in practices that resemble that of clinical psychologists Clinical psychologists typically include people who have graduated from doctoral programs in clinical psychology In Canada, some of the members of the abovementioned groups usually fall within the larger category of professional psychology In Canada and the U.S., practitioners get bachelor's degrees and doctorates; doctoral students in clinical psychology usually spend one year in a predoctoral internship and one year in postdoctoral internship In Mexico and most other Latin American and European countries, psychologists do not get bachelor's and doctoral degrees; instead, they take a three-year professional course following high school [87] Clinical psychology is at present the largest specialization within psychology [197] It includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychological distress, dysfunction, and/or mental illness Clinical psychologists also try to promote subjective well-being and personal growth Central to the practice of clinical psychology are psychological assessment and psychotherapy although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration [198]\n\n\nEducation\nEducational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations Educational psychologists can be found in preschools, schools of all levels including post secondary institutions, community organizations and learning centers, Government or private research firms, and independent or private consultant [210] The work of developmental psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, and Jerome Bruner has been influential in creating teaching methods and educational practices Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n\nWork\nIndustrial and organizational (I/O) psychology involves research and practices that apply psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals' work-lives [212] In the field's beginnings, industrialists brought the nascent field of psychology to bear on the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency The field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or psychotechnology [213] An influential early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924 to 1932 Western Electric experimented on factory workers to assess their responses to changes in illumination, breaks, food, and wages The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people's behavior can change when they think they are being observed [214] Although the Hawthorne research can be found in psychology textbooks, the research and its findings were weak at best [215] [216]\n\n\nMilitary and intelligence\nOne role for psychologists in the military has been to evaluate and counsel soldiers and other personnel In the U.S., this function began during World War I, when Robert Yerkes established the School of Military Psychology at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia The school provided psychological training for military staff [41] [221] Today, U.S Army psychologists perform psychological screening, clinical psychotherapy, suicide prevention, and treatment for post-traumatic stress, as well as provide prevention-related services, for example, smoking cessation [222] The United States Army's Mental Health Advisory Teams implement psychological interventions to help combat troops experiencing mental problems [223] [224]\n\n\nHealth, well-being, and social change\nAn example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black children Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v Board of Education (1954) [229]\n\n\nSocial change\nAn example of the contribution of psychologists to social change involves the research of Kenneth and Mamie Phipps Clark These two African American psychologists studied segregation's adverse psychological impact on Black children Their research findings played a role in the desegregation case Brown v Board of Education (1954) [229]\n\n\nMedical applications\nMedical facilities increasingly employ psychologists to perform various roles One aspect of health psychology is the psychoeducation of patients: instructing them in how to follow a medical regimen Health psychologists can also educate doctors and conduct research on patient compliance [231] [232] Psychologists in the field of public health use a wide variety of interventions to influence human behavior These range from public relations campaigns and outreach to governmental laws and policies Psychologists study the composite influence of all these different tools in an effort to influence whole populations of people [233]\n\n\nWorker health, safety and wellbeing\nPsychologists work with organizations to apply findings from psychological research to improve the health and well-being of employees Some work as external consultants hired by organizations to solve specific problems, whereas others are full-time employees of the organization Applications include conducting surveys to identify issues and designing interventions to make work healthier Some of the specific health areas include:\n\n\nOccupational health psychology\nAs interest in the worker health expanded toward the end of the twentieth century, the field of occupational health psychology (OHP) emerged OHP is a branch of psychology that is interdisciplinary [49] [246] OHP is concerned with the health and safety of workers [49] [246] OHP addresses topic areas such as the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, mistreatment of workers (e.g., bullying and violence), work-family balance, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, the influence of psychosocial factors on safety and accidents, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health [49] [247] OHP grew out of health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and occupational medicine [248] OHP has also been informed by disciplines outside psychology, including industrial engineering, sociology, and economics [249] [250]\n\n\nResearch methods\nQuantitative psychological research lends itself to the statistical testing of hypotheses Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena Some psychologists rely on less rigorously controlled, but more ecologically valid, field experiments as well Other research psychologists rely on statistical methods to glean knowledge from population data [251] The statistical methods research psychologists employ include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling The measurement and operationalization of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs.\n\n\nControlled experiments\nA true experiment with random assignment of research participants (sometimes called subjects) to rival conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships When there are large numbers of research participants, the random assignment (also called random allocation) of those participants to rival conditions ensures that the individuals in those conditions will, on average, be similar on most characteristics, including characteristics that went unmeasured In an experiment, the researcher alters one or more variables of influence, called independent variables, and measures resulting changes in the factors of interest, called dependent variables Prototypical experimental research is conducted in a laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.\n\n\nOther types of studies\nSurveys are used in psychology for the purpose of measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, and checking the validity of experimental manipulations (checking research participants' perception of the condition they were assigned to) Psychologists have commonly used paper-and-pencil surveys However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail Web-based surveys are increasingly used to conveniently reach many subjects.\n\n\nDirect brain observation/manipulation\nA classic and popular tool used to relate mental and neural activity is the electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique using amplified electrodes on a person's scalp to measure voltage changes in different parts of the brain Hans Berger, the first researcher to use EEG on an unopened skull, quickly found that brains exhibit signature \"brain waves\": electric oscillations which correspond to different states of consciousness Researchers subsequently refined statistical methods for synthesizing the electrode data, and identified unique brain wave patterns such as the delta wave observed during non-REM sleep [260]\n\n\nComputer simulation\nComputational modeling is a tool used in mathematical psychology and cognitive psychology to simulate behavior [264] This method has several advantages Since modern computers process information quickly, simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for high statistical power Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that could not be directly observed in a human Computational neuroscience uses mathematical models to simulate the brain Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many mental objects using variables and rules Other types of modeling include dynamic systems and stochastic modeling.\n\n\nAnimal studies\nAnimal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, and rats and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects There are pitfalls, however, in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models [265]\n\n\nQualitative research\nQualitative research is often designed to answer questions about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals Qualitative research involving first-hand observation can help describe events as they occur, with the goal of capturing the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations are made.\n\n\nProgram evaluation\nProgram evaluation involves the systematic collection, analysis, and application of information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness [271] [272] In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know the extent which the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving, or objecting to are producing the intended effects While program evaluation first focuses on effectiveness, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful [273]\n\n\nContemporary issues\nMetascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research Some psychological research has suffered from bias, [274] problematic reproducibility, [275] and misuse of statistics [276] These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community [277]\n\n\nMetascience\nMetascience involves the application of scientific methodology to study science itself The field of metascience has revealed problems in psychological research Some psychological research has suffered from bias, [274] problematic reproducibility, [275] and misuse of statistics [276] These findings have led to calls for reform from within and from outside the scientific community [277]\n\n\nConfirmation bias\nIn 1959, statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying possible publication bias [278] [279] [280] Similarly, Fanelli (2010) [281] found that 91.5% of psychiatry/psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for, and concluded that the odds of this happening (a positive result) was around five times higher than in fields such as space science or geosciences Fanelli argued that this is because researchers in \"softer\" sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\n\nReplication\nA replication crisis in psychology has emerged Many notable findings in the field have not been replicated Some researchers were even accused of publishing fraudulent results [282] [283] [284] Systematic efforts, including efforts by the Reproducibility Project of the Center for Open Science, to assess the extent of the problem found that as many as two-thirds of highly publicized findings in psychology failed to be replicated [285] Reproducibility has generally been stronger in cognitive psychology (in studies and journals) than social psychology [285] and subfields of differential psychology [286] [287] Other subfields of psychology have also been implicated in the replication crisis, including clinical psychology, [288] [289] [290] developmental psychology, [291] [292] [293] and a field closely related to psychology, educational research [294] [295] [296] [297] [298]\n\n\nMisuse of statistics\nSome critics view statistical hypothesis testing as misplaced Psychologist and statistician Jacob Cohen wrote in 1994 that psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance, enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts [305] Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics, rather than sole reliance on p-values [306]\n\n\nWEIRD bias\nIn 2008, Arnett pointed out that most articles in American Psychological Association journals were about U.S populations when U.S citizens are only 5% of the world's population He complained that psychologists had no basis for assuming psychological processes to be universal and generalizing research findings to the rest of the global population [307] In 2010, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan reported a bias in conducting psychology studies with participants from \"WEIRD\" (\"Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic\") societies [308] [309] Henrich et al found that \"96% of psychological samples come from countries with only 12% of the world's population\" (p. 63) The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between people from WEIRD and tribal cultures, including the Müller-Lyer illusion Arnett (2008), Altmaier and Hall (2008) and Morgan-Consoli et al (2018) view the Western bias in research and theory as a serious problem considering psychologists are increasingly applying psychological principles developed in WEIRD regions in their research, clinical work, and consultation with populations around the world [307] [310] [311] In 2018, Rad, Martingano, and Ginges showed that nearly a decade after Henrich et al.'s paper, over 80% of the samples used in studies published in the journal Psychological Science employed WEIRD samples Moreover, their analysis showed that several studies did not fully disclose the origin of their samples; the authors offered a set of recommendations to editors and reviewers to reduce WEIRD bias [312]\n\n\nSTRANGE bias\nSimilar to the WEIRD bias, starting in 2020, researchers of non-human behavior have started to emphasize the need to document the possibility of the STRANGE (Social background, Trappability and self-selection, Rearing history, Acclimation and habituation, Natural changes in responsiveness, Genetic makeup, and Experience) bias in study conclusions [313]\n\n\nUnscientific mental health training\nSome observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application—in particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices [314] Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence [315] Practices such as \"facilitated communication for infantile autism\"; memory-recovery techniques including body work; and other therapies, such as rebirthing and reparenting, may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity [316] These practices, however, are outside the mainstream practices taught in clinical psychology doctoral programs.\n\n\nEthics\nEthical standards in the discipline have changed over time Some famous past studies are today considered unethical and in violation of established codes (the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the Belmont Report) The American Psychological Association has advanced a set of ethical principles and a code of conduct for the profession [317]\n\n\nHumans\nUniversities have ethics committees dedicated to protecting the rights (e.g., voluntary nature of participation in the research, privacy) and well-being (e.g., minimizing distress) of research participants University ethics committees evaluate proposed research to ensure that researchers protect the rights and well-being of participants; an investigator's research project cannot be conducted unless approved by such an ethics committee [318]\n\n\nOther animals\nResearch on other animals is governed by university ethics committees Research on nonhuman animals cannot proceed without permission of the ethics committee, of the researcher's home institution Ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research [320] Psychologists can use certain research techniques on animals that could not be used on humans.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "DC_Extended_Universe", "content": "\nEtymology\nUpon announcement of the film series, the universe was commonly called the \"DC Cinematic Universe\" (DCCU) by fans and the media, in keeping with the naming convention of the already established Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) [1] [2] [3] Keith Staskiewicz, writing for Entertainment Weekly, jokingly coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\" (DCEU) in an article about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice on July 1, 2015 [4] [5] This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans who took it as the official name of the franchise over the following years [6] [7] According to Vulture writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term was not used internally and they did not consider it official [5]\n\n\nDevelopment and history\nIn 2002, Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a Batman vs Superman film from a script by Akiva Goldsman, [14] but the project was shelved by Warner Bros to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects [15] [16] In 2008, a planned Justice League film directed by George Miller and titled Justice League: Mortal was placed on indefinite hold after it failed to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia [17] [18] Man of Steel, a reboot of the Superman film series released in 2013, [19] was intended to launch a shared universe if successful [20] [21] Following the film's release, Warner Bros announced a follow-up entitled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), establishing the DCEU [22] [23] A slate of 11 DCEU films were then announced in 2014 [24]\n\n\nFilms\nIn January 2023, Gunn and Safran announced the initial ten installments for the DC Universe, which make up a portion of the slate subtitled \"Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters\" They included the films Superman (2025), The Authority, The Brave and the Bold, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow and Swamp Thing, as well as the television series Waller, Creature Commandos, Lanterns, Paradise Lost, and Booster Gold The duo were open to DCEU actors such as Miller, Gadot, Momoa and Levi reprising their respective roles, [32] though Gunn clarified that Superman would serve as the start of the new continuity, with the DCU being able to change events from the DCEU, with the DCEU properties serving \"like a rough memory of what happens in the DCU\" [689] The Flash film would be used to reset some aspects of the universe heading into the DCU [245] In October 2023, Variety reported that no cast members from Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, or Justice League would reprise their roles in the DCU [343]\n\n\nMan of Steel (2013)\nKal-El / Clark Kent, who arrived on Earth years ago as an infant from Krypton, struggles with why he was sent to Earth Raised by his adoptive

leaving directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Whedon, led to a fan-driven campaign for a \"Snyder Cut\" of the film Arguments were made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films [99] In March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it was up to Warner Bros to release it [100] Warner Bros remained silent regarding the matter, though Variety reported in November that Warner Bros was unlikely to release Snyder's version of Justice League, with one studio insider describing it as \"a pipe dream\" [101] Snyder announced in May 2020 that HBO Max would be releasing his cut of Justice League on their service on March 18, 2021 [102] Initially conceived as a four-part miniseries, it was ultimately released as a four-hour film, [103] twice the length of the theatrical version [104] Snyder stated this version is intended to not affect the future of the DCEU continuity, but that it takes place in a slightly alternate universe [105] The new cut cost an estimated $70 million to complete, primarily for visual effects and additional photography [106] Some actors returned to their roles for the additional

in development have been shelved though they may be repurposed for the new continuity:\n\n\nExpanded setting\nIn October 2014, Geoff Johns explained that DC's approach to their films and television series would be different from Marvel Studios' cinematic universe, stating that their film universe and TV universes would be kept separate within a multiverse to allow \"everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world\" [491] This divide lasted until January 2020, when the DCEU was retroactively established to have connections to The CW's Arrowverse continuity via an expansion of the multiverse concept, during Part 4 of the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossover Ezra Miller reprised their role as Barry Allen in a cameo appearance alongside Grant Gustin's version of the character During their conversation, Miller's Barry gets the idea to call himself \"The Flash\" from his alternate self and mentions \"Victor\" [492] Despite their cameo, the

The phrase has become a cultural reference point, symbolizing the vast and diverse nature of adult content on the Internet.\n\n**History**\n\nThe phrase Rule 34 was coined from an August 13, 2003, webcomic captioned, \"Rule #34 There is porn of it No exceptions.\" The comic was drawn by TangoStari (Peter Morley-Souter) to depict his shock at seeing Calvin and Hobbes parody porn. Although the comic faded into obscurity, the caption instantly became popular on the Internet. Since then, the phrase has been adapted into different syntactic versions and has even been used as a verb.\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, the concept of Rule 34 was often seen as a humorous commentary on the seemingly endless variety of adult content available online. However, as the years went by, the phrase took on a more serious connotation, reflecting the reality of the Internet's vast and unregulated nature.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAccording to researchers, the maxim resonated with so many people because of its apparent truth to anyone who has browsed the Internet. The sheer volume and diversity of adult content online have led many to believe that Rule 34 is more than just a humorous phrase – it's a reflection of the Internet's true nature. However, some researchers have questioned the validity of Rule 34, suggesting that it may no longer hold true in the modern era of online content regulation.\n\nThe rise of large market share video aggregators has led to a shift in the way adult content is consumed online. These platforms favor mainstream content directly by steering users towards it and indirectly by disadvantaging small producers who cannot afford strong anti-piracy measures. This has brought into doubt the ability of Rule 34 to keep up with the rapidly changing online landscape.\n\n**Variations**\n\nThe original rule was rephrased and reiterated as it went viral on the Web. Some common permutations omit the original \"No exceptions.\" For example, \"Rule 34 states that there is a pornographic representation of everything\" or \"For every subject, there exists a pornographic depiction of it.\" These variations have become an integral part of online culture, often used to express humor or irony.\n\n**Corollaries**\n\nRule 34 has inspired a range of corollaries and variations, each attempting to capture the essence of the original phrase. Some of these corollaries include:\n\n* Rule 63: \"For every character, there is a version of them as the opposite sex\" (e.g., a male version of a female character)\n* Rule 42: \"For every situation, there is a video game that simulates it\"\n* Rule 27: \"For every topic, there is a subreddit dedicated to it\"\n\nThese corollaries have become a staple of online culture, reflecting the ever-changing nature of the Internet and the vast array of subjects and topics that are explored online.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Internet culture\n* Adult content\n* Online regulation\n* Video aggregators\n* Subreddits\n\n**External links**\n\n* Rule 34: A Guide to the Internet's Favorite Maxim\n* The History of Rule 34\n* Rule 34: The Ultimate Guide to Adult Content Online", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rule_34\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe phrase Rule 34 was coined from an August 13, 2003, webcomic captioned, \"Rule #34 There is porn of it No exceptions.\" The comic was drawn by TangoStari (Peter Morley-Souter) to depict his shock at seeing Calvin and Hobbes parody porn [1] [2] Although the comic faded into obscurity, the caption instantly became popular on the Internet Since then, the phrase has been adapted into different syntactic versions and has even been used as a verb [3] A list of \"rules of the Internet\", created on the website 4chan, includes Rule 34 within a list of similar tongue-in-cheek maxims, such as Rule 63 [4]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAccording to researchers Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam, the maxim resonated with so many people because of its apparent truth to anyone who has browsed the Internet [2] Ogas said that following the 2009–2010 study, the consolidation of the porn industry onto large market share video aggregators has reduced the visibility of the niche market videos The sites favor mainstream content directly by steering users towards it and indirectly by disadvantaging small producers who cannot afford strong anti-piracy measures, bringing into doubt the ability of the rule being able to keep up with market [1]\n\n\nVariations\nThe original rule was rephrased and reiterated as it went viral on the Web Some common permutations omit the original \"No exceptions.\"\n\n\nCorollaries\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Arsenal_F.C.", "content": "\nHistory\nIn October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex Each member contributed sixpence, and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club [12] [note 1] Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against the Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0 The club had been renamed Royal Arsenal by January 1887, [15] [16] and its first home was Plumstead Common, [15] though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London [17] [18] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional [19]\n\n\n1886–1912: Dial Square to Royal Arsenal\nIn October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex Each member contributed sixpence, and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club [12] [note 1] Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against the Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0 The club had been renamed Royal Arsenal by January 1887, [15] [16] and its first home was Plumstead Common, [15] though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London [17] [18] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional [19]\n\n\n1912–1925: Bank of England club\n\nIn 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury [24] [25] [26] In 1919, the Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15 Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping \"The\" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today [27]\n\n1925–1934: Herbert Chapman's legendary Gunners\nArsenal's location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925 [32] [33] Over the next five years, Chapman built a revolutionary new Arsenal Firstly, he appointed an enduring new trainer, Tom Whittaker who would one day rise to become a fabled Arsenal manager himself [34] With the help of player Charlie Buchan, implemented the nascent WM formation which would serve as a stable bedrock to his outfit [35] [36] He also captured generational young talents such as Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, whilst also lavishing Highbury's high income on stars such as David Jack and Alex James.\n\n\n1934–1947: Shaw, Allison and the Second World War\nChapman's death meant work was left to his colleagues Joe Shaw and George Allison, with both proving to be shrewd and consummate custodians of Chapman's excellent Arsenal team, seeing out a hat-trick of league wins with the 1933–34, 1934–35, and 1937–38 titles, and then furthermore winning the 1936 FA Cup [44] [45]\n\n\n1947–1962: Tom Whittaker's meteoric Gunners\nDespite this period of turbulence & churn, Arsenal returned to win the league in the second post-war season of 1947–48 This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, and meant the club equalled the champions of England record [48] Tom Whittaker, despite his disarming humble & modest disposition, was oft-referred to as the \"brains\" behind charismatic Chapman's legendary Arsenal side [49] [50] He gathered a successful & highly skilled Arsenal side in spite of greatly limited resources, with a fiery and expansive style that drove great fanfare at the time [51]\n\n\n1962–1984: Billy Wright, Bertie Mee and Neill's cohorts\nArsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years The '53 Champions squad had aged, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements [54] Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in mid-table mediocrity [55] Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966 [56]\n\n\n1984–1996: George Graham's Arsenal\nOne of Mee's double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986, with Arsenal winning their first League Cup in 1987, Graham's first season in charge New signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club by 1988 to complete the \"famous Back Four\", led by homegrown player Tony Adams [63] [note 3] Graham's credo of prioritising defensive excellence seemingly clashed with the club's traditional expansive motif and with the young player demographic at the club at the time; however, it quickly gained a cult following after initial successes [64]\n\n\n1996–2018: Wenger years\nThe club metamorphosed during the tenure of French manager Arsène Wenger, who was appointed in 1996 Attacking football, [69] an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices, [note 4] and elite scouting [note 5] defined his reign Accumulating key players from Wenger's homeland, such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02 In addition, the club reached the final of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cup finals, and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname \"The Invincibles\" [78] This feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a national record [79]\n\n\n2018–2020: post-Wenger revolution\nAfter conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018 He became the club's first ever 'head coach' and second manager from outside the United Kingdom [89] [90] In Emery's first season, Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and as runner-up in the Europa League [91] [92] On 29 November 2019, Emery was dismissed as manager and former player and assistant first team coach Freddie Ljungberg was appointed as interim head coach [93] [94] [95]\n\n\n2020–: Arteta era\nOn 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain Mikel Arteta as the new head coach [96] [97] Arsenal finished the 2019–20 Arsenal F.C season in eighth, their lowest finish since 1994–95, but beat Chelsea 2–1 to earn a record-extending 14th FA Cup win [98] After the season, Arteta's title was changed from head coach to manager [99] On 18 April 2021, Arsenal were announced as a founding club of the breakaway European competition The Super League; [100] they withdrew from the competition two days later amid near-universal condemnation [101] Arsenal finished the 2020–21 season in eighth place once again, not qualifying for a European competition for the first time in 26 years [102] The season after (2021–22), Arteta had assembled the youngest outfit in the Premier League with an average starting age of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year younger than the next team [103] [104] They finished in fifth in the Premier League that year, and qualified for next season's UEFA Europa League [105]\n\n\nCrest\nUnveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first crest featured three cannons viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich) These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons [108] This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, The Gunners, inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down [108]\n\n\nColours\nFor much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886 Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball [118] The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops [119] [120]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nBefore joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913 [134] [135]\n\n\nStadiums\nBefore joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913 [134] [135]\n\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nArsenal's fanbase are referred to as \"Gooners\" – the name derived from the club's nickname \"The Gunners\" Virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity), [153] and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance [154] Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Schalke 04 [155] [156] [157] [158] The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from Wembley Park, North West of the capital There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the surrounding Islington and particularly the nearby Archway area having a large community of residents with Irish heritage But Irish migration to North London is recently much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.\n\n\nAnthem\nThe team's anthem is The Angel (North London Forever) by Louis Dunford [162] [163] [164] The song is typically played at Arsenal home games before a match.\n\n\nOther songs\nIn addition to the usual English football chants, Arsenal's supporters sing \"One-Nil to the Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Go West\") and also regularly sing \"Who's that team they call the Arsenal\", \"Good Old Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Rule, Britannia!\") and \"We're the North Bank/Clock End Highbury\" The fans also chant \"Boring, Boring Arsenal\" in self-deprecating reference to Arsenal's reputation during the 1970s and 1980s as an overly defensive, cautious team [165]\n\n\nRivalries\nArsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbour, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as the North London derby [166] There also exists a rivalry between Arsenal and Chelsea In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in the early 2000s when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nMascot\nThe club mascot is Gunnersaurus Rex, a smiling, 7-foot-tall green dinosaur, who first appeared at a home match against Manchester City in August 1994 (or 1993) He is based on a drawing by then-11-year-old Peter Lovell, whose design and another similar idea won a Junior Gunners contest; his official backstory is that he hatched from an egg found during renovations at Highbury [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nThe largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke [182] Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007, [183] and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares from David Dein in August 2007 [184] Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based Iranian financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016 [185] Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%) [186] [187] In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89% [188] [189] In May 2017, Kroenke owned 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities owned 18,695 shares (30.04%) [182] In January 2018, Kroenke expanded his ownership by buying twenty-two more shares, taking his total ownership to 67.09% [190] In August 2018, Kroenke bought out Usmanov for £550m Now owning more than 90% of the shares, he had the required stake to complete the buyout of the remaining shares and become the sole owner [191] There has been criticism of Arsenal's poor performance since Kroenke took over, which has been attributed to his ownership [192] Ivan Gazidis was the club's Chief executive from 2009 to 2018 [182] [193]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nPartly due to their proximity to the Alexandra Palace transmitter, Arsenal have appeared in a number of media \"firsts\" On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio [201] [202] A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal's first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live [201] [203] Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBC's Match of the Day, which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at Anfield on 22 August 1964 [201] [204] Sky's coverage of Arsenal's January 2010 match against Manchester United was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3D television [201] [205]\n\n\nIn the community\nIn 1985, Arsenal founded a community scheme, \"Arsenal in the Community\", which offered sporting, social inclusion, educational and charitable projects The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2 million for local causes [217] An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches [218] The club launched the Arsenal for Everyone initiative in 2008 as an annual celebration of the diversity of the Arsenal family [219] In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity The original target was £500,000 [220] In 2022, Arsenal and Adidas partnered up to launch the \"No More Red\" campaign to support the long-standing work being done by Arsenal in the Community to help keep young people safe from knife crime and youth violence To promote the event, the club launched an exclusive all white kit that was not commercially available and only awarded to individuals who are making a positive difference in the community [221]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA

F.C.**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nArsenal Football Club, commonly referred to as the Gunners, is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England. The club was founded in 1886 and has a rich history of success, with 13 League Championships, 14 FA Cups, and 2 League Cups. Arsenal is one of the most successful and beloved football clubs in England, with a massive following worldwide.\n\n**History**\n\n**1886–1912: Dial Square to Royal Arsenal**\n\nIn October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member contributed sixpence, and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club. Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against the Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0. The club had been renamed Royal Arsenal by January 1887, and its first home was Plumstead Common. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.\n\n**1912–1925: Bank of England club**\n\nIn 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In 1919, the Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly enlarged First Division. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping \"The\" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.\n\n**1925–1934: Herbert Chapman's legendary Gunners**\n\nArsenal's location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a revolutionary new Arsenal. He appointed an enduring new trainer, Tom Whittaker, who would one day rise to become a fabled Arsenal manager himself. With the help of player Charlie Buchan, implemented the nascent WM formation which would serve as a stable bedrock to his outfit. He also captured generational young talents such as Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, whilst also lavishing Highbury's high income on stars such as David Jack and Alex James.\n\n**1934–1947: Shaw, Allison and the Second World War**\n\nChapman's death meant work was left to his colleagues Joe Shaw and George Allison, with both proving to be shrewd and consummate custodians of Chapman's excellent Arsenal team, seeing out a hat-trick of league wins with the 1933–34, 1934–35, and 1937–38 titles, and then furthermore winning the 1936 FA Cup.\n\n**1947–1962: Tom Whittaker's meteoric Gunners**\n\nDespite this period of turbulence & churn, Arsenal returned to win the league in the second post-war season of 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, and meant the club equalled the champions of England record. Whittaker, despite his disarming humble & modest disposition, was oft-referred to as the \"brains\" behind charismatic Chapman's legendary Arsenal side.\n\n**1962–1984: Billy Wright, Bertie Mee and Neill's cohorts**\n\nArsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad had aged, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in mid-table mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.\n\n**1984–1996: George Graham's Arsenal**\n\nOne of Mee's double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986, with Arsenal winning their first League Cup in 1987, Graham's first season in charge. New signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon, and Steve Bould had joined the club by 1988 to complete the \"famous Back Four\", led by homegrown player Tony Adams.\n\n**1996–2018: Wenger years**\n\nThe club metamorphosed during the tenure of French manager Arsène Wenger, who was appointed in 1996. Attacking football, an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices, and elite scouting defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wenger's homeland, such as Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997–98 and a third in 2001–02. In addition, the club reached the final of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup, were victorious in the 2003 and 2005 FA Cup finals, and won the Premier League in 2003–04 without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname \"The Invincibles\".\n\n**2018–2020: post-Wenger revolution**\n\nAfter conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard Unai Emery was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He became the club's first ever 'head coach' and second manager from outside the United Kingdom. In Emery's first season, Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and as runner-up in the Europa League.\n\n**2020–: Arteta era**\n\nOn 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain Mikel Arteta as the new head coach. Arsenal finished the 2019–20 season in eighth, their lowest finish since 1994–95, but beat Chelsea 2–1 to earn a record-extending 14th FA Cup win.\n\n**Crest**\n\nUnveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first crest featured three cannons viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich (nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons. This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, The Gunners, inscribed alongside it.\n\n**Colours**\n\nFor much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886.\n\n**Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors**\n\nBefore joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on Plumstead Common, then at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby Invicta Ground. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and terracing, upgrading it from just a field.\n\n**Supporters and rivalries**\n\nArsenal's fanbase are referred to as \"Gooners\" – the name derived from the club's nickname \"The Gunners\". Virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity), and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance.\n\n**Mascot**\n\nThe club mascot is Gunnersaurus Rex, a smiling, 7-foot-tall green dinosaur, who first appeared at a home match against Manchester City in August 1994 (or 1993).

working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from Wembley Park, North West of the capital There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the surrounding Islington and particularly the nearby Archway area having a large community of residents with Irish heritage But Irish migration to North London is recently much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.\n\n\nAnthem\nThe team's anthem is The Angel (North London Forever) by Louis Dunford [162] [163] [164] The song is typically played at Arsenal home games before a match.\n\n\nOther songs\nIn addition to the usual English football chants, Arsenal's supporters sing \"One-Nil to the Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Go West\") and also regularly sing \"Who's that team they call the Arsenal\", \"Good Old Arsenal\" (to the tune of \"Rule, Britannia!\") and \"We're the North Bank/Clock End Highbury\" The fans also chant \"Boring, Boring Arsenal\" in self-deprecating reference to Arsenal's reputation during the 1970s and 1980s as an overly defensive, cautious team [165]\n\n\nRivalries\nArsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbour, Tottenham Hotspur; matches between the two are referred to as the North London derby [166] There also exists a rivalry between Arsenal and Chelsea In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in the early 2000s when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title [167] [168] [169]\n\n\nMascot\nThe club mascot is Gunnersaurus Rex, a smiling, 7-foot-tall green dinosaur, who first appeared at a home match against Manchester City in August 1994 (or 1993) He is based on a drawing by then-11-year-old Peter Lovell, whose design and another similar idea won a Junior Gunners contest; his official backstory is that he hatched from an egg found during renovations at Highbury [170] [171] [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nOwnership and finances\nThe largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke [182] Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007, [183] and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares from David Dein in August 2007 [184] Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and London-based Iranian financier Farhad Moshiri, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016 [185] Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%) [186] [187] In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of Nina Bracewell-Smith and Danny Fiszman, taking his shareholding to 62.89% [188] [189] In May 2017, Kroenke owned 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities owned 18,695 shares (30.04%) [182] In January 2018, Kroenke expanded his ownership by buying twenty-two more shares, taking his total ownership to 67.09% [190] In August 2018, Kroenke bought out Usmanov for £550m Now owning more than 90% of the shares, he had the required stake to complete the buyout of the remaining shares and become the sole owner [191] There has been criticism of Arsenal's poor performance since Kroenke took over, which has been attributed to his ownership [192] Ivan Gazidis was the club's Chief executive from 2009 to 2018 [182] [193]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nPartly due to their proximity to the Alexandra Palace transmitter, Arsenal have appeared in a number of media \"firsts\" On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against Sheffield United was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio [201] [202] A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal's first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live [201] [203] Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the BBC's Match of the Day, which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at Anfield on 22 August 1964 [201] [204] Sky's coverage of Arsenal's January 2010 match against Manchester United was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on 3D television [201] [205]\n\n\nIn the community\nIn 1985, Arsenal founded a community scheme, \"Arsenal in the Community\", which offered sporting, social inclusion, educational and charitable projects The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2 million for local causes [217] An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches [218] The club launched the Arsenal for Everyone initiative in 2008 as an annual celebration of the diversity of the Arsenal family [219] In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity The original target was £500,000 [220] In 2022, Arsenal and Adidas partnered up to launch the \"No More Red\" campaign to support the long-standing work being done by Arsenal in the Community to help keep young people safe from knife crime and youth violence To promote the event, the club launched an exclusive all white kit that was not commercially available and only awarded to individuals who are making a positive difference in the community [221]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA

silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890 The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup [270] [271] Their first national senior honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup [272] The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles [51] [273] Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93 [274] The 2003–04 season was the only 38-match league season unbeaten in English football history A special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season [275]\n\n\nOther\nWhen the FA Cup was the only national football association competition available to Arsenal, the other football association competitions were County Cups, and they made up many of the matches the club played during a season [271] Arsenal's first first-team trophy was a County Cup, the inaugural Kent Senior Cup [17] Arsenal became ineligible for the London Cups when the club turned professional in 1891, and rarely participated in County Cups after this [19] [276] Due to the club's original location within the borders of both the London and Kent Football Associations, [277] Arsenal competed in and won trophies organised by each [17]

The index incorporates three dimensions of human development:\n\n*   **A long and healthy life**: This dimension is measured by life expectancy at birth.\n*   **Knowledge**: This dimension is measured by expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults.\n*   **Decent living standards**: This dimension is measured by gross national income per capita.\n\nVarious indicators are used to quantify how countries perform on each dimension. The indicators used in the 2022 report were life expectancy at birth; expected years of schooling for children; mean years of schooling for adults; and gross national income per capita.\n\nThe indicators are used to create a health index, an education index, and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. The geometric mean of the three indices—that is, the cube root of the product of the indices—is the human development index.

seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the Dark Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard \nThe Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.\n\n\nThe Two Towers\nA party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer The Hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards They ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan Gandalf frees King Théoden from the influence of Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep;

Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night It is a palantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances Gandalf rides for Minas Tirith, chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.\n\n\nThe Return of the King\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid Minas Tirith is besieged;

however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work [11] As the story progressed, he brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology [13]\n\n\nPoetry\nUnusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy) [15] Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry [15] Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds [16] [17] The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien's prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil's speech in metre [18]\n\n\nIllustrations\nTolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space [T 5] He prepared a variety of types of illustration – maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul – but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of Durin were included in the first edition [19] [T 6]\n\n\nInfluences\nTolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, [T 7] Christianity, [T 8] mythology and Germanic heroic legend including the Norse Völsunga saga, [22] archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, [23] ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-century epic poetry The Kalevala by Elias Lönnrot, [24] and personal experience He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; [T 9] his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings [21]\nHe was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic, [25] [22] Finnish, [26] Slavic, [27] and Greek language and mythology [28]\nCommentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard [29] [30] [31] The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence, [T 10] and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home [32]\nTolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, [T 11] and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War [33] Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry [34]\n\n\nThemes\nScholars and critics have identified many themes in the book with its complex interlaced narrative, including a reversed quest, [35] [36] the struggle of good and evil, [37] death and immortality, [38] fate and free will, [39] the addictive danger of power, [40] and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering [41] [42] [43] [44]\nThere is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape [45] Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality [T 12] To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred \"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.\"\n\n\nPublication history\nA dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950 Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin were unwilling to do this After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \"urgently wanted cutting\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952 [49] Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, \"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff\", fearing his work would never see the light of day [11]\n\n\nEditions and revisions\n\n\n\nPosthumous publication of drafts\nFrom 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of the Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6–9 of his History of Middle-earth series The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated [73]\n\n\nTranslations\nThe work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38, [d] and reportedly at least 70, languages [74] Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by Åke Ohlmarks, [T 20] Tolkien wrote a \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967) Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, using the English language to represent the Westron of the \"original\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance [75] [76]\n\n\nReception\nEarly reviews of the work were mixed The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\" [77] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\" [77] The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\" [78] W H Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost [79] Kenneth F Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \".. if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\" [80] [81] On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked The Return of the King, writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes .. and will never come to puberty .. Hardly one of them knows anything about women\", causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher [82] In 1956, the literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote a review entitled \"Oo, Those Awful Orcs!\", calling Tolkien's work \"juvenile trash\", and saying \"Dr Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.\" [83]\n\n\n1950s\nEarly reviews of the work were mixed The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\" [77] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\" [77] The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\" [78] W H Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost [79] Kenneth F Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \".. if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\" [80] [81] On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked The Return of the King, writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes .. and will never come to puberty ..

Tolkien. It is set in Middle-earth, a fictional world created by Tolkien, and follows the quest of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, to destroy the One Ring, a powerful and corrupting ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\n**Frame Story**\n\nTolkien presents The Lord of the Rings within a fictional frame story where he is not the original author, but merely the translator of part of an ancient document, the Red Book of Westmarch. This frame story is modelled on the real Red Book of Hergest, which similarly presents an older mythology.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story begins with the arrival of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, who has found the One Ring and is returning to his home in the Shire. Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew, Frodo, who inherits it on his 33rd birthday. The Ring is revealed to be the source of Sauron's power, and the only way to destroy it is to take it to the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally forged.\n\nFrodo sets out on foot with his cousin, Pippin Took, and his gardener, Sam Gamgee, to take the Ring to Mordor. They are pursued by Black Riders, servants of Sauron, and meet various characters who aid them on their quest, including the wizard Gandalf, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli.\n\nThe hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest, but are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow. They are rescued by Tom Bombadil, a mysterious character who lives in the forest.\n\nThe hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell.\n\nAt Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas. They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.\n\n**The Two Towers**\n\nA party of Orcs sent by Saruman and Sauron attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer.\n\nThe hobbits escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by the Ent Treebeard. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf. Gandalf explains that he killed the Balrog and was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards.\n\nGandalf frees King Théoden from the influence of Saruman's spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress of Helm's Deep. Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents destroy Isengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc.\n\nGandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm's Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed.\n\n**The Return of the King**\n\nSauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack. Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city's gates.\n\nDenethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre. Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor.\n\nAragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs' ships up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Éowyn, Théoden's niece, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry. Both are wounded.\n\nGondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but Théoden is killed. Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.\n\n**Themes**\n\nScholars and critics have identified many themes in the book, including a reversed quest, the struggle of good and evil, death and immortality, fate and free will, the addictive danger of power, and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering.\n\n**Influence on Popular Culture**\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga. Its impact is such that the words \"Tolkienian\" and \"Tolkienesque\" have entered the Oxford English Dictionary, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as \"Orc\" and \"Warg\", have become widespread in that domain.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has been adapted into various media, including radio, stage, motion pictures, and videogames. It has also inspired numerous parodies, especially Harvard Lampoon's Bored of the Rings, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has also had a significant impact on the fantasy genre, inspiring countless authors, artists, and game designers. Its influence can be seen in works such as The Sword of Shannara, The Legend of Zelda, Dungeons & Dragons, and many others.\n\nIn conclusion, The Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece of fantasy literature that has had a profound impact on popular culture and the fantasy genre. Its themes of good and evil, hope and redemption, and the struggle between fate and free will continue to resonate with readers and audiences around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Lord_of_the_Rings\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\n\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\nBilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power;

however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work [11] As the story progressed, he brought in elements from The Silmarillion mythology [13]\n\n\nPoetry\nUnusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout by over 60 pieces of poetry These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering, marching to war, drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths, riddles, prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy) [15] Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found in Old English poetry [15] Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds [16] [17] The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien's prose; for instance, he wrote much of Tom Bombadil's speech in metre [18]\n\n\nIllustrations\nTolkien worked on the text using his maps of Middle-earth as a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space [T 5] He prepared a variety of types of illustration – maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of the Book of Mazarbul – but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of the Doors of Durin were included in the first edition [19] [T 6]\n\n\nInfluences\nTolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, [T 7] Christianity, [T 8] mythology and Germanic heroic legend including the Norse Völsunga saga, [22] archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, [23] ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-century epic poetry The Kalevala by Elias Lönnrot, [24] and personal experience He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; [T 9] his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings [21]\nHe was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic, [25] [22] Finnish, [26] Slavic, [27] and Greek language and mythology [28]\nCommentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such as John Buchan and Rider Haggard [29] [30] [31] The Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris was a major influence, [T 10] and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home [32]\nTolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside of Worcestershire near Sarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, [T 11] and his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War [33] Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry [34]\n\n\nThemes\nScholars and critics have identified many themes in the book with its complex interlaced narrative, including a reversed quest, [35] [36] the struggle of good and evil, [37] death and immortality, [38] fate and free will, [39] the addictive danger of power, [40] and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, for prophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope and redemptive suffering [41] [42] [43] [44]\nThere is a common theme throughout the work of language, its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints of providence in descriptions of weather and landscape [45] Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality [T 12] To those who supposed that the book was an allegory of events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred \"history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.\"\n\n\nPublication history\nA dispute with his publisher, George Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work to William Collins in 1950 Tolkien intended The Silmarillion (itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along with The Lord of the Rings, but Allen & Unwin were unwilling to do this After Milton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief that The Lord of the Rings itself \"urgently wanted cutting\", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952 [49] Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote to Allen and Unwin, saying, \"I would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff\", fearing his work would never see the light of day [11]\n\n\nEditions and revisions\n\n\n\nPosthumous publication of drafts\nFrom 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts of The Lord of the Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6–9 of his History of Middle-earth series The four volumes carry the titles The Return of the Shadow, The Treason of Isengard, The War of the Ring, and Sauron Defeated [73]\n\n\nTranslations\nThe work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38, [d] and reportedly at least 70, languages [74] Tolkien, an expert in philology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as the Swedish translation by Åke Ohlmarks, [T 20] Tolkien wrote a \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967) Because The Lord of the Rings purports to be a translation of the fictitious Red Book of Westmarch, using the English language to represent the Westron of the \"original\", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance [75] [76]\n\n\nReception\nEarly reviews of the work were mixed The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\" [77] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\" [77] The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\" [78] W H Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost [79] Kenneth F Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \".. if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\" [80] [81] On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked The Return of the King, writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes .. and will never come to puberty .. Hardly one of them knows anything about women\", causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher [82] In 1956, the literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote a review entitled \"Oo, Those Awful Orcs!\", calling Tolkien's work \"juvenile trash\", and saying \"Dr Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.\" [83]\n\n\n1950s\nEarly reviews of the work were mixed The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as \"among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century\" [77] The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that \"the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those who are going to read them.\" [77] The New York Herald Tribune appeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were \"destined to outlast our time\" [78] W H Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a \"masterpiece\", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost [79] Kenneth F Slater wrote in Nebula Science Fiction, April 1955, \".. if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear\" [80] [81] On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir attacked The Return of the King, writing that \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes .. and will never come to puberty ..

it was a commercial failure [122]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day [129] The opus has spawned many imitations, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,\" [130] as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such as The Last Ringbearer.\nThe Legend of Zelda, which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by The Lord of the Rings among other fantasy books [131] [132] Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from The Lord of the Rings, including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons However, Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game [133]\nBecause Dungeons & Dragons has gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them, with titles such as Dragon Quest, [134] [135] EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and The Elder Scrolls series of games [136] as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.\n\n\nInfluence on fantasy\nThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day [129] The opus has spawned many imitations, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called \"the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,\" [130] as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such as The Last Ringbearer.\nThe Legend of Zelda, which popularized the action-adventure game genre in the 1980s, was inspired by The Lord of the Rings among other fantasy books [131] [132] Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized the role-playing game genre in the 1970s, features several races from The Lord of the Rings, including halflings (hobbits), elves, dwarves, half-elves, orcs, and dragons However, Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game [133]\nBecause Dungeons & Dragons has gone on to influence many popular games, especially role-playing video games, the influence of The Lord of the Rings extends to many of them, with titles such as Dragon Quest, [134] [135] EverQuest, the Warcraft series, and The Elder Scrolls series of games [136] as well as video games set in Middle-earth itself.\n\n\nMusic\nIn 1965, the composer and songwriter Donald Swann, best known for his collaboration with Michael Flanders as Flanders & Swann, set six poems from The Lord of the Rings and one from The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (\"Errantry\") to music When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for \"Namárië\" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent of plain chant, which Swann accepted [137] The songs were published in 1967 as The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle, [138] and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year by Caedmon Records as Poems and Songs of Middle Earth [139]\n\n\nImpact on popular culture\nThe Lord of the Rings has had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as a countercultural saga [144] \"Frodo Lives!\" and \"Gandalf for President\" were two phrases popular among United States Tolkien fans during this time [145] Its impact is such that the words \"Tolkienian\" and \"Tolkienesque\" have entered the Oxford English Dictionary, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as \"Orc\" and \"Warg\", have become widespread in that domain [146]\nAmong its effects are numerous parodies, especially Harvard Lampoon's Bored of the Rings, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages [147]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nPrimary\n\n\nSecondary\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The competition was first proposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in September 2016, and was officially launched in April 2017. The tournament is a new format of limited overs cricket, played by two teams each playing a single innings made up of 100 balls.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of a new city-based cricket competition was first proposed by the ECB in September 2016. Following early discussions between the 18 first-class counties, the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA), and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the proposal was voted on by the 18 counties. The proposal was met with a 16-3 vote in favor of developing the competition. On April 26, 2017, members of the ECB voted 38-3 to push ahead with the new competition.\n\n**Format**\n\nOne-hundred-ball cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played by two teams each playing a single innings made up of 100 balls. Games typically last approximately two and a half hours. The format is designed to provide a condensed version of the traditional 20-over game, with a faster-paced and more exciting experience for spectators.\n\n**Tournament Structure**\n\nThe tournament features eight city-based teams, with all men's and women's matches held on the same day at the same grounds. The league stage of the tournament consists of 32 matches, with each team playing four matches at home and four matches away. This includes one match against every other side, as well as a second bonus match against their nearest regional rivals.\n\n**Reaction**\n\nThe decision to create an entirely new format of cricket, with teams based in just seven major cities, has split opinion amongst cricket fans. Some have praised the innovation and excitement of the new format, while others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on traditional county cricket.\n\n**Teams**\n\nBefore the eight teams were confirmed, it was reported that they would carry a different identity from the long-established county teams and would not be named after cities, counties, or venues.

Players are signed using a draft system common in other franchise leagues. At least one England international player is allocated to each franchise in both the women's and men's competitions. The salary cap for each team for the 2022 season was £1,000,000, rising from £800,000 in 2021.\n\n**Finals**\n\nAll games are televised by Sky Sports, with the BBC also showing 10 men's and 8 women's games free-to-air.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nThe tournament is broadcast on Sky Sports, with live coverage of all games. The BBC also shows a selection of games free-to-air, including 10 men's and 8 women's matches.\n\n**Records and Statistics**\n\nThe Hundred has its own set of records and statistics, including team records, highest totals, and lowest totals. These totals only include completed innings and exclude innings where the number of balls to be bowled is reduced, usually because of rain.\n\n**Team Records**\n\nThe highest team total in The Hundred is 187/2, achieved by the Southern Brave against the Oval Invincibles.

The series follows the story of Yorick Brown, a young amateur escape artist, and his companion, a Capuchin monkey named Ampersand. As they navigate a world without men, they must confront the consequences of their new reality and the potential extinction of humanity.\n\n# Plot Summary\n\nThe story begins on July 17, 2002, when a mysterious plague, known only as the \"Great Culling,\" wipes out every living mammal with a Y chromosome. The only exceptions are Yorick Brown, Ampersand, and Dr. Alison Mann, a geneticist who had been working on a cure for the plague. The world is thrown into chaos as societies collapse, and women struggle to cope with the loss of men.\n\nYorick and Ampersand embark on a journey to find a cure for the plague, encountering a diverse cast of characters along the way. They meet a group of women who have formed a community in a small town, where they have adapted to a new way of life without men. However, their community is threatened by a group of women who seek to dominate the remaining resources and establish a new order.\n\nAs Yorick and his companions navigate this new world, they must confront the consequences of the plague and the potential extinction of humanity. They also discover that the plague may not be a natural occurrence, but rather a result of human actions gone wrong.\n\n# Main Characters\n\nThe main characters in Y: The Last Man include:\n\n* Yorick Brown: The protagonist of the series, Yorick is a young amateur escape artist who is one of the few remaining males in the world. He is resourceful and determined to find a cure for the plague.\n* Ampersand: Yorick's companion, a Capuchin monkey who is intelligent and loyal. Ampersand is a symbol of hope in a world without men.\n* Dr. Alison Mann: A geneticist who had been working on a cure for the plague. She is one of the few remaining women who have a deep understanding of the science behind the plague.\n* 355: A secret agent who is tasked with finding Yorick and Ampersand. She is a complex and intriguing character who is driven by her own motivations.\n\n# The Plague\n\nThe source of the plague is never fully explained in the series. However, several theories are presented throughout the story. Some believe that the plague is a natural occurrence, while others think it is the result of human actions gone wrong.\n\nOne theory is that the plague is caused by a genetic mutation that was triggered by the widespread use of pesticides. Another theory is that the plague is a result of a viral infection that was spread through a combination of factors, including pollution and climate change.\n\nUltimately, the cause of the plague is left for the reader to decide. The series presents multiple possibilities and leaves the reader to draw their own conclusions.\n\n# Explanations\n\nSeveral explanations for the plague are presented in the series, including:\n\n* The genetic mutation theory: This theory suggests that the plague is caused by a genetic mutation that was triggered by the widespread use of pesticides.\n* The viral infection theory: This theory suggests that the plague is caused by a viral infection that was spread through a combination of factors, including pollution and climate change.\n* The artificial origin theory: This theory suggests that the plague was created artificially, possibly as a result of human experimentation gone wrong.\n\n# In Other Media\n\nThe film rights to the series were acquired by New Line Cinema in 2007, with screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director D.J. Caruso attached to the project. However, the film adaptation was ultimately cancelled.\n\nIn 2011, a loose adaptation of the graphic novel was made in Portugal as an independent short feature and school film produced by Universidade Lusófona.\n\nIn 2015, FX announced that they were developing a TV series based on the comic book series, with Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson set to produce. However, the project has been in development limbo ever since.\n\n# Reception\n\nY: The Last Man has received widespread critical acclaim since its publication. Comic Book Resources praised the series as \"a series that transcends the normal restrictions of most comic books.\" Publishers Weekly called the series \"entirely convincing—and addictive.\" The Atlantic praised the series as \"this wonderful, affecting, intelligent, humane story.\"\n\nThe series has also won several awards, including the 2003 National Comics Award for Best New Comic.\n\n# Collected Editions\n\nThe series is collected in trade paperbacks by Vertigo.\n\n# Awards and Honors\n\nY: The Last Man won the 2003 National Comics Award for Best New Comic.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Y: The Last Man (TV series)\n* Post-apocalyptic fiction\n* Comic book series\n* Vertigo Comics\n\n# External Links\n\n* Official website\n* Y: The Last Man on Wikipedia\n* Y: The Last Man on Comic Book Database\n* Y: The Last Man on Goodreads", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Y:_The_Last_Man\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot summary\nOn July 17, 2002, all living mammals with a Y chromosome—including embryos and sperm—simultaneously die, with the exception of a young amateur escape artist named Yorick Brown and his Capuchin monkey, Ampersand Many women die as a secondary effect of male deaths, such as plane crashes Society is plunged into chaos as infrastructures collapse, and the surviving women everywhere try to cope with the loss of men, and the belief that, barring a rapid, major scientific breakthrough or other extraordinary event, humanity is doomed to extinction.\n\n\nMain characters\nThe source of the plague that wiped out every living mammal with a Y chromosome except Yorick Brown, Ampersand, and Doctor Matsumori is never fully explained A number of possible explanations are provided throughout the course of the series, but a definitive answer is left for the reader to decide Discussing the cause of the plague, Vaughan is quoted as saying:\n\n\nThe plague\nThe source of the plague that wiped out every living mammal with a Y chromosome except Yorick Brown, Ampersand, and Doctor Matsumori is never fully explained A number of possible explanations are provided throughout the course of the series, but a definitive answer is left for the reader to decide Discussing the cause of the plague, Vaughan is quoted as saying:\n\n\nExplanations\nThree explanations are considered by the protagonists:\n\n\nIn other media\nThe film rights to the series were acquired by New Line Cinema (a sister company to Vertigo), and in July 2007 screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director D J Caruso were attached to the project with David S Goyer as a producer [5]\n\n\nCancelled film adaptation\nThe film rights to the series were acquired by New Line Cinema (a sister company to Vertigo), and in July 2007 screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director D J Caruso were attached to the project with David S Goyer as a producer [5]\n\n\nPortuguese adaptation\nIn 2011, a loose adaptation of the graphic novel was made in Portugal by Luís Lobo and Bruno Telésforo as an independent short feature and school film produced by Universidade Lusófona, which was premiered in the Fantasporto film festival on contest [19]\n\n\nTelevision adaptation\nIn November 2010 French director Louis Leterrier expressed interest in adapting the series for television [20] In October 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that FX was developing a TV series of Y: The Last Man produced by Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson alongside Brian K Vaughan, who would also be a writer for the show [21] In an interview with Vulture in July 2016, Vaughan commented the FX series was, \"very slowly coming to life No news I can share, other than that it’s all chugging along happily.\" [22] In November 2016, it was reported that Michael Green would be the showrunner for Y: The Last Man [23] [24]\n\n\nReception\nThe comic series attracted wide-spread acclaim during its publication with Comic Book Resources praising it as \"a series that transcends the normal restrictions of most comic books\" [36]  and Publishers Weekly claiming that it was \"entirely convincing—and addictive.\" [37] The Atlantic called it \"this wonderful, affecting, intelligent, humane story.\" [38] Dan Phillips of IGN felt that \"the conclusion of Y: The Last Man is as close to a perfect ending as you're likely to see anywhere in the history of comics.\" [39]\n\n\nCollected editions\nThe series is collected in trade paperbacks.\n\n\nAwards and honors\nY: The Last Man won the 2003 National Comics Award for Best New Comic [43]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States", "content": "\nDefinitions\nThere is no fixed definition of a mass shooting in the United States, [3] [15] and different researchers define \"mass shootings\" in different ways [16] Of the 7 following definitions, most use a minimum of 4 victims as a threshold Among the various definitions are those that are:\n\n\nFrequency and locations\nAs of 2017, studies indicated that the rate at which public mass shootings occur has tripled since 2011 Between 1982 and 2011, a mass shooting occurred roughly once every 200 days However, between 2011 and 2014, that rate has accelerated greatly with at least one mass shooting occurring every 64 days in the United States [37]\n\n\nGeographical distribution\nThe 2023 JAMA report showed mass shootings were most frequent around the southeastern U.S and Illinois This was true for mass shootings that were crime-, social-, and domestic violence-related However mass shootings that did not fit any of these categories were geographically distributed more evenly across the U.S The highest rate was found in the District of Columbia (10.4 shootings per one million people), followed by much lower rates in Louisiana (4.2 mass shootings per million) and Illinois (3.6 mass shootings per million) [7]\n\n\nPerpetrator demographics\nAccording to The New York Times, there is no common profile of people who carry out mass shootings in the United States, except that they are mostly men [49] By race, according to a study, the proportion of mass shooters in the United States who are white is about equal to the overall proportion of white people in the general population of the US [50] [51] The proportion of male mass shooters is considerably larger than the proportion of males in the general population [51] According to the Associated Press, white men comprise nearly 50% of all mass shooters in the US [52] According to the National Institute of Justice/The Violence project study, the demographics of shooters were 97.7% male, with an average age of 34.1 years, 52.3% white, 20.9% black, 8.1% Latino, 6.4% Asian, 4.2% middle eastern, and 1.8% native American [30]\n\n\nContributing factors\nHigher accessibility and ownership of guns has been cited as a reason for the U.S.'s high rate of mass shootings [4] [11] [61] The U.S has the highest per-capita gun ownership in the world with 120.5 firearms per 100 people; the second highest is Yemen with 52.8 firearms per 100 people [61] In a Gallup survey conducted in September and October 2020 of 1,035 randomly selected U.S adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 30% reported personally owning a firearm and 44% reported living in a household that owned at least one firearm, [62] while the 2020 United States census enumerated the U.S adult population to be approximately 258.3 million persons in 126.8 million households and the Gun Violence Archive recorded 610 mass shootings in the United States in the same year [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nHigh gun accessibility\nHigher accessibility and ownership of guns has been cited as a reason for the U.S.'s high rate of mass shootings [4] [11] [61] The U.S has the highest per-capita gun ownership in the world with 120.5 firearms per 100 people; the second highest is Yemen with 52.8 firearms per 100 people [61] In a Gallup survey conducted in September and October 2020 of 1,035 randomly selected U.S adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 30% reported personally owning a firearm and 44% reported living in a household that owned at least one firearm, [62] while the 2020 United States census enumerated the U.S adult population to be approximately 258.3 million persons in 126.8 million households and the Gun Violence Archive recorded 610 mass shootings in the United States in the same year [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nPerpetrator suicidality\nA panel of mental health and law enforcement experts has estimated that roughly one-third of acts of mass violence—defined as crimes in which four or more people were killed—since the 1990s were committed by people with a \"serious mental illness\" (SMI) However, the study emphasized that people with an SMI are responsible for less than 4% of all the violent acts committed in the United States [85] The American Psychiatric Association (APA) states that gun violence is a public health crisis and has repeatedly noted that the overwhelming majority of people with mental illness are not violent and \"are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators of violence.\" [86] [87]\n\n\nSociocultural factors and perpetrator life histories\nIn 2015, psychiatrists James L Knoll and George D Annas noted that considering that mass shootings committed by perpetrators with SMIs amount to less than 1% of all gun-related homicides (and that most gun deaths in the United States are suicides rather than homicides), [105] the tendency of most media attention following mass shootings on mental health leads to sociocultural factors being comparatively overlooked [106] Instead, Knoll and Annas cite research by social psychologists Jean Twenge and W Keith Campbell on narcissism and social rejection in the personal histories of mass shooters, as well as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker's suggestion in The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011) that further reductions in human violence may be dependent upon reducing human narcissism [107] [108] Conversely, psychologist Peter F Langman has argued that while mass shooters follow similar patterns, mass shooters do not fit a single psychological profile and the characterization of mass shooters as \"friendless loners\" is a stereotype [109] [93] Psychiatrist Paul S Appelbaum argued that the data from the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University Irving Medical Center database of mass shootings show that \"legal problems, substance and alcohol use, and difficulty coping with life events seem more useful foci for prevention  [of mass shootings] and policy than an emphasis on serious mental illness.\" [110]\n\n\nEffects\nA British Journal of Political Science study first published in 2017 (and in print in 2019) found that increase in proximity to mass public shootings in the U.S was associated with statistically significant and \"substantively meaningful\" increases in support for stricter gun control laws [124] The study also found that repeated events, magnitude, and recency of mass shootings play a role with \"proximity to repeated events, more horrific events and more recent events\" increasing \"the salience of gun violence, and thus .. support for gun control.\" [124] However, the study found that the \"most powerful effects\" in support or opposition to gun control \"are driven by variables related to local culture, with pronounced but expected differences emerging between respondents in rural, conservative, and gun-heavy areas and those residing in urban, liberal areas with few firearm stores.\" [124] A separate 2019 replication study, extending the earlier panel analysis, found no evidence that mass shootings caused a \"significant or substantively meaningful main effect\" on attitudes toward gun control [125] However, the study did find evidence that mass shootings \"have polarizing effects conditional on partisanship\": \"That is, Democrats who live near a mass shooting even tend to become more supportive of gun control restrictions, while Republican attitudes shift in the opposite direction.\" [125] The study authors concluded, \"To the extent that mass shootings may affect public opinion, the result is polarizing rather than consensus building.\" [125]\n\n\nPolitical\nA British Journal of Political Science study

The study authors concluded, \"To the extent that mass shootings may affect public opinion, the result is polarizing rather than consensus building.\" [125]\n\n\nPublic health\nA review article first published online in 2015 and then printed in January 2017 in the journal Trauma, Violence, & Abuse concluded that \"mass shootings are associated with a variety of adverse psychological outcomes in survivors and members of affected communities\" It says that, while \"the psychological effects of mass shootings on indirectly exposed populations\" is less well-understood, \"there is evidence that such events lead to at least short-term increases in fears and declines in perceived safety.\" [132] Identified risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes have included, among others, demographics, greater proximity to the attack, acquaintance with victims, and less access to psychosocial resources [132]\n\n\nDeadliest mass shootings since 1949\nThe following mass shootings are the deadliest to have occurred in modern U.S history Only incidents with ten or more fatalities by gunshots, excluding those of the perpetrators, are included This list starts in 1949, the year in which Howard Unruh committed his shooting, which was the first in modern U.S history to incur ten or more fatalities [135]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

The definition of a mass shooting is not fixed, and different researchers define it in various ways, but most use a minimum of 4 victims as a threshold. The frequency and locations of mass shootings have changed over time, with a significant increase in the rate of public mass shootings since 2011. Geographical distribution of mass shootings varies, with the southeastern United States and Illinois being among the most affected regions. Perpetrators of mass shootings are mostly men, with a disproportionate number of white males. Higher accessibility and ownership of guns are cited as contributing factors to the high rate of mass shootings in the United States.\n\n# Frequency and locations\n\nAs of 2017, studies indicated that the rate at which public mass shootings occur has tripled since 2011.

Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker has suggested that further reductions in human violence may be dependent upon reducing human narcissism. However, psychologist Peter F Langman has argued that while mass shooters follow similar patterns, mass shooters do not fit a single psychological profile, and the characterization of mass shooters as \"friendless loners\" is a stereotype.\n\n# Effects\n\nA British Journal of Political Science study found that increase in proximity to mass public shootings in the U.S was associated with statistically significant and \"substantively meaningful\" increases in support for stricter gun control laws. However, a separate 2019 replication study found no evidence that mass shootings caused a \"significant or substantively meaningful main effect\" on attitudes toward gun control. The study did find evidence that mass shootings have polarizing effects conditional on partisanship, with Democrats becoming more supportive of gun control restrictions and Republicans shifting in the opposite direction.\n\n# Public health\n\nA review article concluded that mass shootings are associated with a variety of adverse psychological outcomes in survivors and members of affected communities. Identified risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes include demographics, greater proximity to the attack, acquaintance with victims, and less access to psychosocial resources.\n\n# Deadliest mass shootings since 1949\n\nThe following list includes the deadliest mass shootings to have occurred in modern U.S history, with incidents involving ten or more fatalities by gunshots, excluding those of the perpetrators.\n\n1. El Paso Walmart shooting (2019) - 22 fatalities\n2. Las Vegas shooting (2017) - 58 fatalities\n3. Orlando nightclub shooting (2016) - 49 fatalities\n4.

\"Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinitions\nThere is no fixed definition of a mass shooting in the United States, [3] [15] and different researchers define \"mass shootings\" in different ways [16] Of the 7 following definitions, most use a minimum of 4 victims as a threshold Among the various definitions are those that are:\n\n\nFrequency and locations\nAs of 2017, studies indicated that the rate at which public mass shootings occur has tripled since 2011 Between 1982 and 2011, a mass shooting occurred roughly once every 200 days However, between 2011 and 2014, that rate has accelerated greatly with at least one mass shooting occurring every 64 days in the United States [37]\n\n\nGeographical distribution\nThe 2023 JAMA report showed mass shootings were most frequent around the southeastern U.S and Illinois This was true for mass shootings that were crime-, social-, and domestic violence-related However mass shootings that did not fit any of these categories were geographically distributed more evenly across the U.S The highest rate was found in the District of Columbia (10.4 shootings per one million people), followed by much lower rates in Louisiana (4.2 mass shootings per million) and Illinois (3.6 mass shootings per million) [7]\n\n\nPerpetrator demographics\nAccording to The New York Times, there is no common profile of people who carry out mass shootings in the United States, except that they are mostly men [49] By race, according to a study, the proportion of mass shooters in the United States who are white is about equal to the overall proportion of white people in the general population of the US [50] [51] The proportion of male mass shooters is considerably larger than the proportion of males in the general population [51] According to the Associated Press, white men comprise nearly 50% of all mass shooters in the US [52] According to the National Institute of Justice/The Violence project study, the demographics of shooters were 97.7% male, with an average age of 34.1 years, 52.3% white, 20.9% black, 8.1% Latino, 6.4% Asian, 4.2% middle eastern, and 1.8% native American [30]\n\n\nContributing factors\nHigher accessibility and ownership of guns has been cited as a reason for the U.S.'s high rate of mass shootings [4] [11] [61] The U.S has the highest per-capita gun ownership in the world with 120.5 firearms per 100 people; the second highest is Yemen with 52.8 firearms per 100 people [61] In a Gallup survey conducted in September and October 2020 of 1,035 randomly selected U.S adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 30% reported personally owning a firearm and 44% reported living in a household that owned at least one firearm, [62] while the 2020 United States census enumerated the U.S adult population to be approximately 258.3 million persons in 126.8 million households and the Gun Violence Archive recorded 610 mass shootings in the United States in the same year [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nHigh gun accessibility\nHigher accessibility and ownership of guns has been cited as a reason for the U.S.'s high rate of mass shootings [4] [11] [61] The U.S has the highest per-capita gun ownership in the world with 120.5 firearms per 100 people; the second highest is Yemen with 52.8 firearms per 100 people [61] In a Gallup survey conducted in September and October 2020 of 1,035 randomly selected U.S adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, 30% reported personally owning a firearm and 44% reported living in a household that owned at least one firearm, [62] while the 2020 United States census enumerated the U.S adult population to be approximately 258.3 million persons in 126.8 million households and the Gun Violence Archive recorded 610 mass shootings in the United States in the same year [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nPerpetrator suicidality\nA panel of mental health and law enforcement experts has estimated that roughly one-third of acts of mass violence—defined as crimes in which four or more people were killed—since the 1990s were committed by people with a \"serious mental illness\" (SMI) However, the study emphasized that people with an SMI are responsible for less than 4% of all the violent acts committed in the United States [85] The American Psychiatric Association (APA) states that gun violence is a public health crisis and has repeatedly noted that the overwhelming majority of people with mental illness are not violent and \"are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators of violence.\" [86] [87]\n\n\nSociocultural factors and perpetrator life histories\nIn 2015, psychiatrists James L Knoll and George D Annas noted that considering that mass shootings committed by perpetrators with SMIs amount to less than 1% of all gun-related homicides (and that most gun deaths in the United States are suicides rather than homicides), [105] the tendency of most media attention following mass shootings on mental health leads to sociocultural factors being comparatively overlooked [106] Instead, Knoll and Annas cite research by social psychologists Jean Twenge and W Keith Campbell on narcissism and social rejection in the personal histories of mass shooters, as well as cognitive scientist Steven Pinker's suggestion in The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011) that further reductions in human violence may be dependent upon reducing human narcissism [107] [108] Conversely, psychologist Peter F Langman has argued that while mass shooters follow similar patterns, mass shooters do not fit a single psychological profile and the characterization of mass shooters as \"friendless loners\" is a stereotype [109] [93] Psychiatrist Paul S Appelbaum argued that the data from the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University Irving Medical Center database of mass shootings show that \"legal problems, substance and alcohol use, and difficulty coping with life events seem more useful foci for prevention  [of mass shootings] and policy than an emphasis on serious mental illness.\" [110]\n\n\nEffects\nA British Journal of Political Science study first published in 2017 (and in print in 2019) found that increase in proximity to mass public shootings in the U.S was associated with statistically significant and \"substantively meaningful\" increases in support for stricter gun control laws [124] The study also found that repeated events, magnitude, and recency of mass shootings play a role with \"proximity to repeated events, more horrific events and more recent events\" increasing \"the salience of gun violence, and thus .. support for gun control.\" [124] However, the study found that the \"most powerful effects\" in support or opposition to gun control \"are driven by variables related to local culture, with pronounced but expected differences emerging between respondents in rural, conservative, and gun-heavy areas and those residing in urban, liberal areas with few firearm stores.\" [124] A separate 2019 replication study, extending the earlier panel analysis, found no evidence that mass shootings caused a \"significant or substantively meaningful main effect\" on attitudes toward gun control [125] However, the study did find evidence that mass shootings \"have polarizing effects conditional on partisanship\": \"That is, Democrats who live near a mass shooting even tend to become more supportive of gun control restrictions, while Republican attitudes shift in the opposite direction.\" [125] The study authors concluded, \"To the extent that mass shootings may affect public opinion, the result is polarizing rather than consensus building.\" [125]\n\n\nPolitical\nA British Journal of Political Science study

published online in 2015 and then printed in January 2017 in the journal Trauma, Violence, & Abuse concluded that \"mass shootings are associated with a variety of adverse psychological outcomes in survivors and members of affected communities\" It says that, while \"the psychological effects of mass shootings on indirectly exposed populations\" is less well-understood, \"there is evidence that such events lead to at least short-term increases in fears and declines in perceived safety.\" [132] Identified risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes have included, among others, demographics, greater proximity to the attack, acquaintance with victims, and less access to psychosocial resources [132]\n\n\nDeadliest mass shootings since 1949\nThe following mass shootings are the deadliest to have occurred in modern U.S history Only incidents with ten or more fatalities by gunshots, excluding those of the perpetrators, are included This list starts in 1949, the year in which Howard Unruh committed his shooting, which was the first in modern U.S history to incur ten or more fatalities [135]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

Fetterman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the U.S Senate seat held by Pat Toomey in the 2016 election [80] His campaign was considered a long shot against two better-known candidates, Katie McGinty and Joe Sestak, the 2010 Democratic nominee for Senate [81] Fetterman was endorsed by former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, [82] former Pennsylvania treasurer Barbara Hafer, [83] and the PennLive editorial board [84]\n\n\nTenure\nFetterman took office on January 3, 2023 [127] At 6 feet 8 inches tall, he is the tallest currently serving senator [128]\n\n\nShotgun incident\nFetterman was criticized for an incident in North Braddock in January 2013 when he heard a sound he thought was gunfire and followed an unarmed jogger, whom he detained with a shotgun [54] The jogger, Chris Miyares, a Black American, said that what Fetterman thought were gunshots were kids shooting bottle rockets Fetterman said no debris had been found [55] Miyares claimed that Fetterman pointed the shotgun at his chest while he loaded the gun and then aimed the gun at his face [54] Fetterman denies that he pointed the gun at Miyares and said he only pointed the gun in a way to show that he was armed and that he \"didn't even have a round chambered or the safety off.\" [54] He said he believed he \"did the right thing\" and has not apologized [56] [54] No charges were brought against either in connection with the incident, [55] and Miyares never filed a formal complaint [54]\n\n\nMedia coverage and criticism\nFetterman's efforts to create youth-oriented programs, revitalize his town, and attract artists and other \"creatives\" to his community were featured in The New York Times [44] A 2009 article in The Guardian called him \"America's coolest mayor\" [59]\n\n\nLieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania (2019–2023)\nOn November 14, 2017, Fetterman announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, challenging, among others, incumbent lieutenant governor Mike Stack [62] Stack was seen as a vulnerable incumbent after the Pennsylvania inspector general launched an investigation into Stack regarding allegations that he mistreated his staff and Pennsylvania state troopers [63] Fetterman was endorsed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto and former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell [43] [62] [64]\n\n\nElections\nOn September 14, 2015, Fetterman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the U.S Senate seat held by Pat

[127] At 6 feet 8 inches tall, he is the tallest currently serving senator [128]\n\n\nBoard of Pardons\nThe lieutenant governor has very little actual power, but does oversee the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons In this position, Fetterman worked to increase commutations and pardons for those serving jail time in Pennsylvania [72] The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Fetterman ran the Board of Pardons \"with the heart of an activist and, at times, the force of a bully\" [72] The Inquirer also reported that he threatened to run against Attorney General Josh Shapiro (who, at the time, was planning a run for governor) unless Shapiro supported more pardons [72]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nIn November 2020, Fetterman said Donald Trump was \"no different than any other random internet troll\" [74] and that he \"can sue a ham sandwich\" in response to Trump threatening to file lawsuits in Pennsylvania alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election [75]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (2023–present)\nOn September 14, 2015, Fetterman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the U.S Senate seat held by Pat Toomey in the 2016 election [80] His campaign was considered a long shot against two better-known candidates, Katie McGinty and Joe Sestak, the 2010 Democratic nominee for Senate [81] Fetterman was endorsed by former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, [82] former Pennsylvania

the PennLive editorial board [84]\n\n\n2022\nIn January 2021, Fetterman announced he was launching an exploratory committee for the 2022 U.S Senate election in Pennsylvania [91] [92] On February 4, 2021, Fetterman filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission declaring his intention to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Toomey [93] [94] On February 8, 2021, he officially entered the race [95]\n\n\nDemocratic primary\nFetterman's main opponent in the Democratic primary was U.S representative Conor Lamb [96] A political action committee supporting Lamb ran ads attacking Fetterman as \"a self-described democratic socialist\" [96] While the ad cited an NPR article that called Fetterman a socialist, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \"Fetterman has never actually described himself that way.\" [96] Both Lamb and another candidate, Malcolm Kenyatta, criticized Fetterman for an incident where he pulled a loaded shotgun on a black jogger whom he believed had fired a gun [96]\n\n\nGeneral election\nIn the general election, Fetterman faced Republican nominee Mehmet Oz, a celebrity television doctor According to The Philadelphia Citizen, Fetterman employed a social media campaign strategy consisting of shitposting and internet memes [100] The Daily Beast reported that Oz's New Jersey residency, net worth, and connections to Donald Trump were the focus of many of the memes [101] Criticizing Oz's previous residency in New Jersey became a particular hallmark of Fetterman's campaign, seeking to label Oz a carpetbagger Efforts by the campaign to highlight Oz's New Jersey ties included enlisting New Jersey celebrities Snooki and Steven Van Zandt to record video messages aimed at Oz, [102] [103] and having a plane banner fly over the Jersey Shore reading \"Hey Dr Oz: Welcome home to N.J.! ❤️ John.\" [104]\n\n\nTenure\nFetterman took office on January 3, 2023 [127] At 6 feet 8 inches tall, he is the tallest currently serving senator [128]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nBefore running for the U.S Senate, Fetterman was described as a social and fiscal progressive, including by himself [14] [142] When running for Senate in 2022, Fetterman said he was not a progressive, \"just a Democrat\", explaining that many parts of his platform that were once considered progressive are now mainstream beliefs of the party [143] In 2022, The New York Times characterized Fetterman as \"left-leaning\" [6] Fordham University political science professor Christina Greer described Fetterman, alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams, as \"simultaneously progressive, moderate and conservative\" [144] After Fetterman rejected the progressive label again in 2023, NBC News called his ideology an \"unorthodox brand of blue-collar liberalism, with a dash of outsider populism.\" [145]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nBefore running for the U.S Senate, Fetterman was described as a social and fiscal progressive, including by himself [14] [142] When running for Senate in 2022, Fetterman said he was not a progressive, \"just a Democrat\", explaining that many parts of his platform that were once considered progressive are now mainstream

\"unorthodox brand of blue-collar liberalism, with a dash of outsider populism.\" [145]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn a Democratic primary debate in May 2022, Fetterman said regarding abortion: \"That is between a woman and her physician\" To the question if any exceptions exist, he said: \"It's certainly not between me or any politician We settled this decades ago, and the fact that these states are trying to repeal it.. we have to push back on that.\" [146] Later that month, Fetterman reiterated his position opposing any legal restrictions on abortion, including in the third trimester [147]\n\n\nCongressional stock ownership\nFetterman supports barring members of Congress and their immediate families from trading or holding stocks [148]\n\n\nCriminal justice reform\nPrison reform is one of Fetterman's signature issues, advocating for more rehabilitation action as well as clemency for model prisoners As part of his role as lieutenant governor, he served as the chair of Pennsylvania's Board of Pardons, which processes clemency requests and forwards them to the governor Fetterman urged the board to process requests more quickly [149]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues\nFetterman has called for a balance between decarbonization efforts and creating fossil fuel industry jobs He has a mixed record on fracking He once called the practice \"an environmental abomination.\" [155] While running for lieutenant governor, Fetterman both supported establishing two new fracking wells [43] and said he did not support fracking and never would [156] He later said that he supports permitting fracking but advocates stricter environmental regulations [149] In 2021, Fetterman said that he supports moving towards a \"de facto moratorium  [on fracking] because the transition is going to be toward green and renewable energy\" [157]\n\n\nFilibuster\nFetterman supports ending the filibuster in the United States Senate [159] He has also said that Democrats need to be more ruthless, like Republicans, in order to pass legislative priorities [160]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2015, The Patriot-News described Fetterman as a \"skeptic of free trade\", given his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and a non-interventionist Fetterman has said that the United States should not \"be considered the world's police officers\" [17]\n\n\nIsrael\nFetterman strongly supports the Israel–United States relationship During his campaign, he said that as a U.S senator he would \"lean in\" on the \"relationship between the United States and Israel\" [161] He added that the U.S.–Israel relationship \"is a special one that needs to be safeguarded, protected, supported and nurtured through legislation and all available diplomatic efforts in the region\" [161] He supports United States foreign aid to Israel, including Iron Dome funding [161] Fetterman criticized congressional Democrats who voted against Iron Dome funding, calling them \"fringe\" and \"extreme\" [161] He has said he supports Israel's right to defend itself and is \"passionate\" in his opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement [161] He supported a law signed by Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf that barred Pennsylvania from entering into contracts with companies that boycott Israel [161] He supports a two-state solution and the expansion of the Abraham Accords, the Arab-Israeli agreements brokered under the Trump administration [161]\n\n\nChina\nWhen asked what the greatest foreign threat to the U.S is, Fetterman responded, \"I believe China is not our friend.\" [168] He has also said that the Chinese government should not be allowed to own agricultural land in the U.S [169]\n\n\nUkraine\nFetterman supports military aid to Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War He has said, \"If you can't support Ukraine right now, that's un-American and you're not standing up for democracy.\" [170]\n\n\nNATO\nIn 2023, Fetterman voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have clarified that Article 5 of the NATO treaty does not obviate the need for Congress to declare war [171] [172]\n\n\nGun policy\nFetterman supports greater restrictions on gun purchases [175]\n\n\nHealthcare\nFetterman has described himself as a supporter of Medicare for All, saying that healthcare is a \"fundamental human need and right\" [142] Fetterman's website states that \"Healthcare is a fundamental human right,\" [176] and that he would \"support whatever path\" is necessary to expand healthcare accessibility including the expansion of Obamacare [177] In debate, he reaffirmed he would vote for Medicare for All [178]\n\n\nImmigration\nFetterman has called himself \"perhaps the most pro-immigration member of the Senate\" and has criticized the House Republican majority of the 118th United States Congress for what he perceives as unwillingness to compromise on border policy [179] He has called the issue \"very personal\" and important to him, connecting his views to his wife's status as a \"DREAMer\" [180] But Fetterman has repeatedly expressed concern about the Mexico–United States border crisis, viewing the scale as unsustainable and calling for a bipartisan \"reset\" on border policy This comment earned him criticism from progressives, causing many commentators to characterize it as an ideological break from his party [181] [182]\n\n\nLab-grown meat\nFetterman opposes lab-grown meat and has supported governors signing state bans, saying he \"stands with our American ranchers and farmers\" [183] [184]\n\n\nMarijuana\nFetterman is a proponent of legalizing marijuana, calling the issue a \"political bazooka\" and that leaving the issue alone is giving an opportunity for another party to gain political support for a pro–marijuana legalization agenda He argued that if conservative South Dakota voters were willing to approve a ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana, Pennsylvania should legalize it too [185] He also supports expunging criminal convictions related to marijuana [186]\n\n\nMinimum wage\nFetterman supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour [142]\n\n\nPolicing\nFetterman has described himself as \"pro-policing\", including pro-community policing He opposes defunding the police, calling the movement \"absurd\", [155] but supports the Black Lives Matter movement [187] [188] After Derek Chauvin, a police officer who murdered an unarmed black man, George Floyd, was convicted of second-degree murder, Fetterman tweeted his support for

{"title": "2024_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony", "content": "\nPreparations\nAs with the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony was directed by Thomas Jolly; he stated that the ceremony would be a \"visual, very choreographic, very acrobatic show with an operatic dimension\", with a storyline \"in which the Olympic Games disappear once again, and someone from far comes along and finds them\" [2] In the wake of the opening ceremony controversies, executive director Thierry Reboul stated that the team had been asked to review and revise the closing ceremony a number of times in order to ensure that no scene could be misinterpreted in an offensive manner [3]\n\n\nProceedings\nThe closing ceremony took place at the Stade de France and, as per tradition, involved a parade of flags and athletes and the handover ceremony [9] It was officially titled \"Records\" and paid tribute to Greek antiquity as the birthplace of the \"Olympic spirit\" as well as portraying the revival of the Olympics by the French baron Pierre de Coubertin [10] It featured over 100 performers, acrobats, dancers and circus artists;

The event marked the culmination of the Games, which had begun on July 26, 2024, with the opening ceremony.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nThe closing ceremony was directed by Thomas Jolly, who had also overseen the opening ceremony. Jolly stated that the ceremony would be a \"visual, very choreographic, very acrobatic show with an operatic dimension,\" with a storyline that would see the Olympic Games disappear once again, and someone from far come along and find them. In light of controversies surrounding the opening ceremony, the executive director, Thierry Reboul, announced that the team had been asked to review and revise the closing ceremony multiple times to ensure that no scene could be misinterpreted in an offensive manner.\n\n**Proceedings**\n\nThe closing ceremony began at the Tuileries Garden with Zaho de Sagazan and the Haendel-Hendrix Academy Choir singing \"Sous le ciel de Paris,\" a popular song originally sung by Jean Bretonnière and made famous by Édith Piaf. The Olympic cauldron, a light and water display simulating the Olympic flame, was turned off, and the actual flame, which had been kept nearby in the lantern used to transport it to France aboard the Belem, was taken by French swimmer Léon Marchand to the stadium.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nThe ceremony was accompanied by the Orchestre Divertimento, conducted by Zahia Ziouani, and was set against the backdrop of a planisphere design on the stadium surface. IOC President Thomas Bach and President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron were welcomed, and the orchestra played the French national anthem, arranged by Victor Le Masne. The same arrangement had been used during the 2020 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.\n\n**Marathon Medal Ceremony**\n\nThe presentation included the medal ceremony for the women's marathon, which had finished earlier in the day. The top three, Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, Tigst Assefa of Ethiopia, and Hellen Obiri of Kenya, were awarded their medals by IOC President Thomas Bach and World Athletics President Sebastian Coe. The national anthem of the Netherlands was played for Dutch gold medalist Sifan Hassan, and the newest inductees to the IOC Athletes' Commission thanked the volunteers.\n\n**Records**\n\nThe cultural segments of the ceremony began, depicting a world where the Olympic Games were lost, and paying homage to the French baron and Parisian Pierre de Coubertin, who had been instrumental in reviving the Olympics for modern times. The stadium went dark, and a golden-winged humanoid alien, the Golden Voyager, portrayed by dancer Arthur Cadre, descended from its roof onto a white stage shaped like a stylized world map. The Golden Voyager encountered and interacted with the masked torchbearer and the masked horsewoman, the two main characters from the opening ceremony, who presented the flag of Greece.\n\n**Concert Segments**\n\nFollowing the Golden Voyager's appearance, Swiss musician and daredevil Alain Roche appeared in a suit made from recycled magnetic tapes, playing the first two stanzas from the Delphic Hymns on a grand piano suspended in midair. Tenor Benjamin Bernheim sang the hymns' lyrics while standing in one of the rings, which were then attached to wires and lifted up to form the Olympic rings.\n\n**Protocolar Segments**\n\nHead of COJOP Tony Estanguet and President of the IOC Thomas Bach made their speeches, escorted by six Olympic medalists. During the first part of Thomas Bach's speech, Estanguet retrieved the Olympic flag and handed it to the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo. After Bach concluded his speech, the \"Antwerp Ceremony\" began, with Hidalgo handing the flag over to Bach, who then handed it to the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass. This was the second consecutive Olympics in which the Olympic flag was passed between two female mayors.\n\n**Extinguishing the Olympic Flame**\n\nThe ceremony's penultimate section started with Marchand entering the stadium with the lantern containing the Olympic flame. Bach declared the games officially closed as the two, along with the athletes who escorted him representing the continents and refugees, blew out the flame. The section ended with a French flag handover, from Antoine Dupont, closing ceremony flagbearer, to part of the French Paralympic team, symbolizing the 16 days of transition from the Olympic Games to the Paralympic Games.\n\n**Finale**\n\nThe ceremony closed with Yseult performing the Frank Sinatra song \"My Way,\" which was adapted to English by Paul Anka from the French song \"Comme d'habitude\" by Claude François. Afterward, a spectacular fireworks display was set off from the Stade de France roof.\n\n**Victory Ceremony**\n\nThe victory ceremony marked the culmination of the games, with the gold medalists from each sport taking to the stage to celebrate their achievements. The ceremony was a fitting end to an unforgettable week of competition, with athletes from around the world coming together to showcase their skills and dedication.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics closing ceremony was a fitting conclusion to the games, with a unique and memorable storyline that left a lasting impression on the athletes and spectators alike.

trailing the league-leading New York Giants by 15 games after losing a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Robins on July 4 [26] However, the team rebounded with an incredible hot streak, going 41–12 from July 6 to September 5 [27] On August 3, Joseph Lannin the president of the Red Sox, offered Fenway Park to the Braves free of charge for the remainder of the season since their usual home, the South

Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base [58] WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: America's Team\", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South [63] [58] The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on

in 2012 and returned to the postseason in Chipper Jones' final season [93] The Braves won 94 games in 2012, but that wasn't enough to win the NL East, so they faced the St Louis Cardinals in the inaugural Wild Card Game [94] Chipper Jones last game was a memorable one: the Braves lost the one game playoff 6–3, but the game would be remembered for a controversial infield fly call that helped end a Braves rally in the 8th inning [94]\n\n\nTruist Park and return to the World Series\nIn 2017, the Atlanta Braves began playing at Truist Park, replacing Turner Field as their home stadium [95]

Georgia, the Braves are often referred to as \"America's Team\" in reference to the team's games being broadcast nationally on TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base [124]\n\n\nTomahawk chop\nIn 1991, fans of the Atlanta Braves popularized the \"tomahawk chop\" during games [127]  The use of foam tomahawks drew criticism from Native American groups, deeming it demeaning [128] Despite protests, the Braves' public relations director defended it as a \"proud expression of unification and family.\" [128] The controversy resurfaced in 2019 when Cherokee Nation member and St Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley found the chop insulting, prompting the Braves to modify their in-game experience [129] During the off-season, discussions ensued with Native American representatives, and amid pressure in 2020 to change their name, the Braves announced ongoing talks about the chop but insisted the team name would remain unchanged

team based in Atlanta, Georgia. The team is a member of the National League East division in Major League Baseball (MLB). The Braves have a rich history, dating back to 1871, when they were known as the Boston Red Stockings. Over the years, the team has undergone several name changes, including the Boston Beaneaters, the Boston Doves, and the Boston Rustlers.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings, formed in 1869, were the first openly all-professional baseball team but disbanded after the 1870 season. Manager Harry Wright and players moved to Boston, forming the Boston Red Stockings, a charter team in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). Led by the Wright brothers, Ross Barnes, and Al Spalding, they dominated the National Association, winning four of five championships. The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing franchise in American professional sports.\n\n**Boston (1871–1952)**\n\nThe Boston Red Stockings, formed in 1871, were the first professional baseball team in Boston. The team was a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) and won four of five championships in the National Association. The team was led by the Wright brothers, Ross Barnes, and Al Spalding, who were instrumental in the team's success. The Boston Red Stockings were a dominant force in the National Association, winning championships in 1872, 1873, 1874, and 1875.\n\n**1871–1913**\n\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings, formed in 1869, were the first openly all-professional baseball team but disbanded after the 1870 season. Manager Harry Wright and players moved to Boston, forming the Boston Red Stockings, a charter team in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). Led by the Wright brothers, Ross Barnes, and Al Spalding, they dominated the National Association, winning four of five championships. The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing franchise in American professional sports.\n\n**1914: Miracle**\n\nIn 1914, the Boston Braves experienced a remarkable turnaround in what would become one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. Starting with a dismal 4–18 record, the Braves found themselves in last place, trailing the league-leading New York Giants by 15 games after losing a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Robins on July 4. However, the team rebounded with an incredible hot streak, going 41–12 from July 6 to September 5. On August 3, Joseph Lannin, the president of the Red Sox, offered Fenway Park to the Braves free of charge for the remainder of the season since their usual home, the South End Grounds, was too small. On September 7 and 8, they defeated the Giants in two out of three games, propelling them into first place. Despite being in last place as late as July 18, the Braves secured the pennant, becoming the only team under the old eight-team league format to achieve this after being in last place on the Fourth of July.\n\n**1915–1953**\n\nFrom 1917 to 1933, the Boston Braves struggled. After a series of different owners, Emil Fuchs bought the team in 1923. Fuchs brought his longtime friend, pitching great Christy Mathewson, as part of the syndicate that bought the club. However, the death of pitching legend in 1925 left Fuchs in control. Despite Fuchs' commitment to success, the team faced challenges overcoming the damage from previous years. It wasn't until 1933 and 1934, under manager Bill McKechnie, that the Braves became competitive, but it did little to help the club's finances.\n\n**Milwaukee (1953–1965)**\n\nThe Milwaukee Braves' move to Wisconsin for the 1953 season was an immediate success, as they drew a National League-record 1.8 million fans and finished the season second in the league. Manager Charlie Grimm was named NL Manager of the Year.\n\n**Atlanta (1966–present)**\n\nAfter arriving in Atlanta in 1966, the Braves found success in 1969, with the onset of divisional play by winning the first National League West Division title. In the National League Championship Series, the Braves were swept by the \"Miracle Mets.\" They would post only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981. Fans in Atlanta had to be satisfied with the achievements of Hank Aaron, who by the end of the 1973 season, had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. On April 4, opening day of the next season, he hit No 714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n**Ted Turner era**\n\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: America's Team,\" a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).\n\n**1978–1990**\n\nThe Braves didn't enjoy much success between 1978 and 1990, however, in the 1982 season, led by manager Joe Torre, the Braves secured their first divisional title since 1969. The team was led by standout performances from key players like Dale Murphy, Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, Phil Niekro, and Gene Garber. The Braves were swept in the NLCS in three games by the Cardinals. Murphy won the Most Valuable Player award for the National League in 1982 and 1983.\n\n**1991–2005: 14 consecutive division titles**\n\nFrom 1991 to 2005, the Atlanta Braves enjoyed a remarkable era of success in baseball, marked by a record-setting 14 consecutive division titles, five National League pennants, and a World Series championship in 1995. Bobby Cox returned as manager in 1990, leading the team's turnaround after finishing the previous season with the worst record in baseball. Notable developments included the drafting of Chipper Jones in 1990 and the hiring of general manager John Schuerholz from the Kansas City Royals.\n\n**Liberty Media era**\n\nIn December 2005, Time Warner, put the club up for sale, leading to negotiations with Liberty Media. After over a year of talks, a deal was reached in February 2007 for Liberty Media to acquire the Braves for $450 million, a magazine publishing company, and $980 million in cash. The sale, valued at approximately $1.48 billion, was contingent on approval from 75 percent of MLB owners and Commissioner Bud Selig.\n\n**Bobby Cox and Chipper Jones retire**\n\nBobby Cox's final year as manager in 2010 saw the Braves return to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The team secured the NL Wild Card but fell to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four closely contested games, marking the conclusion of Bobby Cox's managerial career. The following season the Braves suffered a historic September collapse to miss the postseason. The club bounced back in 2012 and returned to the postseason in Chipper Jones' final season. The Braves won 94 games in 2012, but that wasn't enough to win the NL East, so they faced the St Louis Cardinals in the inaugural Wild Card Game. Chipper Jones last game was a memorable one: the Braves lost the one game playoff 6–3, but the game would be remembered for a controversial infield fly call that helped end a Braves rally in the 8th inning.\n\n**Truist Park and return to the World Series**\n\nIn 2017, the Atlanta Braves began playing at Truist Park, replacing Turner Field as their home stadium. Following an MLB investigation into international signing rule violations, general manager John Coppolella resigned and faced a baseball ban. Alex Anthopoulos took over as the new general manager. The team's chairman, Terry McGuirk, apologized for the scandal and expressed confidence in Anthopoulos' integrity. A new on-field mascot named Blooper was introduced at a fan event before the 2017 season. Under Anthopoulos, the Braves made the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons. In 2020 the Braves reach the National League Championship Series, but ultimately lost to the Dodgers after leading 3–1.\n\n**Logos and uniforms**\n\nThe Braves have had several logos and uniforms throughout their history. The team's current logo features a cursive \"Braves\" with a tomahawk below it. The team's uniforms have also undergone several changes, with the current uniforms featuring a classic white home uniform and a gray road uniform. The team has also introduced several alternate uniforms, including a red Friday night uniform and a City Connect uniform worn on Saturdays.\n\n**World Series championships**\n\nThe Braves have won four World Series championships in their history: 1914, 1957, 1995, and 2021. The team's 1914 championship was their first World Series title, and it was also the team's first time in the World Series. The team's 1957 championship was their second World Series title, and it was also the team's first championship since moving to Milwaukee. The team's 1995 championship was their third World Series title, and it was also the team's first championship since moving to Atlanta. The team's 2021 championship was their fourth World Series title.\n\n**Ballparks**\n\nThe Braves have played in several ballparks throughout their history, including:\n\n* Boston Park (1871-1883)\n* South End Grounds (1884-1894)\n* Congress Street Grounds (1895-1907)\n* Huntington Avenue Grounds (1908-1914)\n* Fenway Park (1915-1952)\n* Braves Field (1915-1953)\n* Milwaukee County Stadium (1953-1965)\n* Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (1966-1996)\n* Turner Field (1997-2016)\n* Truist Park (2017-present)\n\nThe Braves' current ballpark, Truist Park, is located in the suburb of Cumberland, Georgia, just north of downtown Atlanta. The ballpark features a seating capacity of 41,000 and has been in operation since 2017.\n\n**Radio and television**\n\nThe Braves' games are broadcast on several radio and television stations, including:\n\n* Bally Sports Southeast (regional TV broadcasts)\n* WZGC-FM ( radio broadcasts)\n* WQXI-AM (radio broadcasts)\n* Braves Radio Network (radio broadcasts in Georgia and the surrounding areas)\n\nThe Braves' broadcasts are also available on various streaming services, including:\n\n* MLB.TV (live and on-demand streaming)\n* Apple TV (live and on-demand streaming)\n* Hulu (live and on-demand streaming)\n* Sling TV (live and on-demand streaming)\n\nThe Braves have also had several notable announcers throughout their history, including:\n\n* Skip Caray (play-by-play announcer, 1966-2006)\n* Pete Van Wieren (play-by-play announcer, 1976-2005)\n* Don Sutton (color commentator, 2006-2016)\n* Ron Darowski (color commentator, 2006-2016)\n* Brandon Gaudin (play-by-play announcer, 2017-present)\n* C.J.

brought his longtime friend, pitching great Christy Mathewson, as part of the syndicate that bought the club [39] However, the death of pitching legend in 1925 left Fuchs in control [40] Despite Fuchs' commitment to success, the team faced challenges overcoming the damage from previous years It wasn't until 1933 and 1934, under manager Bill McKechnie, that the Braves became competitive, but it did little to help the club's finances [41]\n\n\nMilwaukee (1953–1965)\nThe Milwaukee Braves' move to Wisconsin for the 1953 season was an immediate success, as they drew a National League-record 1.8 million fans and finished the season second in the league [52] Manager Charlie Grimm was named NL Manager of the Year [53]\n\n\nAtlanta (1966–present)\nAfter arriving in Atlanta in 1966, the Braves found success in 1969, with the onset of divisional play by winning the first National League West Division title [56] In the National League Championship Series the Braves were swept by the \"Miracle Mets.\" [57] They would post only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 [58] Fans in Atlanta had to be satisfied with the achievements of Hank Aaron, who by the end of the 1973 season, had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record [59] On April 4, opening day of the next season, he hit No 714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers [60] [61] Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on November 2, 1974 [62]\n\n\n1966–1974\nAfter arriving in Atlanta in 1966, the Braves found success in 1969, with the onset of divisional play by

[62]\n\n\nTed Turner era\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta [58] Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base [58] WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: America's Team\", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South [63] [58] The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2–1 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games) [64] [65]\n\n\n1976–1977: Ted Turner buys the team\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and

led by manager Joe Torre, the Braves secured their first divisional title since 1969 [66] The team was led by standout performances from key players like Dale Murphy, Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, Phil Niekro, and Gene Garber [67] The Braves were swept in the NLCS in three games by the Cardinals [68] Murphy won the Most Valuable Player award for the National League in 1982 and 1983 [69]\n\n\n1991–2005: 14 consecutive division titles\nFrom 1991 to 2005, the Atlanta Braves enjoyed a remarkable era of success in baseball, marked by a record-setting 14 consecutive division titles, five National League pennants, and a World Series championship in 1995 [70] Bobby Cox returned as manager in 1990, leading the team's turnaround after finishing the previous season with the worst record in baseball Notable developments included the drafting of Chipper Jones in 1990 and the hiring of general manager John Schuerholz from the Kansas City Royals [71] [72]\n\n\nLiberty Media

return to the postseason for the first time since 2005 [90] The team secured the NL Wild Card but fell to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four closely contested games, marking the conclusion of Bobby Cox's managerial career [91] The following season the Braves suffered a historic September collapse to miss the postseason [92] The club bounced back in 2012 and returned to the postseason in Chipper Jones' final season [93] The Braves won 94 games in 2012, but that wasn't enough to win the NL East, so they faced the St Louis Cardinals in the inaugural Wild Card Game [94] Chipper Jones last game was a memorable one: the Braves lost the one game playoff 6–3, but the game would be remembered for a controversial infield fly call that helped end a Braves rally in the 8th inning [94]\n\n\nTruist Park and return to the World Series\nIn 2017, the Atlanta Braves began playing at Truist Park, replacing Turner Field as their home stadium [95] Following an MLB investigation into international signing rule violations, general manager John Coppolella resigned and faced a baseball ban [96] Alex Anthopoulos took over as the new general manager [97] The team's chairman, Terry McGuirk, apologized for the scandal and expressed confidence in Anthopoulos' integrity [97] A new on field mascot named Blooper was introduced at a fan event before the 2017 season [98] Under Anthopoulos, the Braves made the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons [99] In 2020 the Braves reach the National League Championship Series, but ultimately lost to the Dodgers after leading 3–1 [100]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe Braves logos have evolved over the years, featuring a Native American warrior from 1945 to 1955, followed by a laughing Native American with a mohawk and a feather from 1956 to 1965 [103] [104] The modern logo, introduced in 1987, includes the cursive word \"Braves\" with a tomahawk below it [105]\nUniform changes occurred in 1987, with the team adopting uniforms reminiscent of their 1950s classic look [106] For the 2023 season, the Braves had four uniform combinations, including the classic white home and gray road uniforms, a navy blue road jersey for alternate games, and two alternate uniforms for home games - a Friday night red uniform and a City Connect uniform worn on Saturdays, paying tribute to Hank Aaron [107]  The City

Georgia, the Braves are often referred to as \"America's Team\" in reference to the team's games being broadcast nationally on TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base [124]\n\n\nTomahawk chop\nIn 1991, fans of the Atlanta Braves popularized the \"tomahawk chop\" during games [127]  The use of foam tomahawks drew criticism from Native American groups, deeming it demeaning [128] Despite protests, the Braves' public relations director defended it as a \"proud expression of unification and family.\" [128] The controversy resurfaced in 2019 when Cherokee Nation member and St Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley found the chop insulting, prompting the Braves to modify their in-game experience [129] During the off-season, discussions ensued with Native American representatives, and amid pressure in 2020 to change their name, the Braves announced ongoing talks about the chop but insisted the team name would remain unchanged

vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name [40] He was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas [40] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony, [41] his performance was poorly received According to the Dallas Observer, \"Brad Pitt  [...] is a large part of the problem  [in the film] When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side  [...] he's a joy to watch But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.\" [42]\n\n\nRise to prominence (1999–2003)\nIn 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club, [66] [67] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher [68] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling [69] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended [70] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to \"have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.\" [71] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival [72] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, [73] [74] Pitt's performance was widely praised Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, [75] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be \"cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than  [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise\" [76] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000 [77]\n\n\nWorldwide recognition (2004–2008)\nPitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad [94] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks [95] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role [96] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures [97] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide, [32] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as \"the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\" [98] In 2005, Pitt starred as John Smith in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr & Mrs Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith The Star Tribune noted that \"while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry\" [99] Mr & Mrs Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005 [100]\n\n\nEstablished actor (2009–present)\nPitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival [118] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France [119] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide, [32] and garnered generally favorable reviews [120] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt [121] [122] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind [123] Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick's experimental drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival

Michael Lewis [125] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt [126]\n\n\nActing credits and accolades\nOver his career Pitt has received numerous awards including two Academy Awards (as a producer and actor), two BAFTA Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\n\nPhilanthropy and activism\nPitt visited the University of Missouri campus in October 2004 to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S presidential election, [163] in which he supported John Kerry [163] [164] Later in October, he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research \"We have to make sure that we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find\", he said [165] In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research [166]\n\n\nPersonal life\nFrom the late 1980s to early 1990s, Pitt was romantically involved with several of his co-stars, including Robin Givens (Head of the Class), [200] Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class), [200] and Juliette Lewis (Too Young to Die? and Kalifornia) [35] Pitt was 27 and Lewis was 17 at the time of their relationship [201] [202] Subsequently, Pitt had a much-publicized

Her father was working as a banker for the United Nations at the time. When Fisher was six years old, her family moved to their hometown of Bathgate, Scotland, before eventually settling in Perth, Australia.

She took on the role of the seemingly sexually aggressive and precocious younger daughter of a politician falling in love with an irresponsible wedding crasher. Fisher remarked on her character, saying, \"It was an interesting character to play, because she was so crazy and lacking in any kind of social etiquette.\" For one particular scene, involving sexual content, she used a body double, stating, \"I negotiated that from the beginning, trying to analyse why I find pornographic violence, just gratuitous and unnecessary than nudity, because there's nothing more peaceful and beautiful.\" The film was favourably received by critics and made US$285.1 million worldwide.

representation and ended up getting a job, almost straight away So, I was fortunate, in that I didn't have to come out to L.A and join a queue of however many people, and try to get work I came in on

centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan [6] [11] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar [6]\n\n\nParents\nKhan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance

life\nKhan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi [17] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s [18] [19] [e] Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\" [21]\n\n\nActing career\nKhan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead [40] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai [41] [42] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992) [43] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90), [43] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989) [44] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, [45] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough [43] [46]\n\n\n1988–1992: Television and film debut\nKhan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead [40] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai [41] [42] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series

interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough [43] [46]\n\n\n1993–1994: Negative characters\nAmong his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr [55] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula [56] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\" [57] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor [58] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\" [58] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences [59] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\" [60] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir [61] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification [62] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles [63]\n\n\n1995–1998: Romantic roles\nKhan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India [65] His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\" [66] Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India, [65] [67] with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide [68] [69] It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015 [70] [71] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards [58] The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the  [audience] The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\" [72]\n\n\n1999–2003: Career fluctuations\nKhan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna Although the film underperformed at the box office, [88] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi [61] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited [89] The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure [90] It was released one week after Kaho Naa.. Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan [91] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little.\" [92] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan [93] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan [94] [95] On Khan's performance, T Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\" [93]\n\n\n2004–2009: Comeback\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer [116] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain [117] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise [118] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million) [109] [119]\n\n\n2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol [146] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood [147] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition [148] [149] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, [109] [104] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, [52] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar [150] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps,  [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval\" [151]\n\n\n2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015) The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million) [180] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired [181] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action thriller Fan (2016) Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer [182] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula [183] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi [184]\n\n\n2023–present: Resurgence\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India [200] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star [201] [202] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom [203] [204] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers [205] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\" [206] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan [207] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide, [208] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion [209]\n\n\nOther work\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited [89] After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, [116] which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising [215] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films [216] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011) Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters [217] [218] Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\" He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012) [219] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition

Born on November 2, 1965, in New Delhi, Khan is one of the most successful and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nKhan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India. Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan. According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan. However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.\n\nParents\n\nKhan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.

However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.\n\nEarly Life\n\nKhan was born on November 2, 1965, into a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\".\n\nActing Career\n\nKhan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor-directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992). Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90), and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.\n\n1988–1992: Television and Film Debut\n\nKhan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor-directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992).

His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.\n\n1993–1994: Negative Characters\n\nAmong his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr. The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\". His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\". Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences. Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\". For Darr, he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir. Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.\n\n1995–1998: Romantic Roles\n\nKhan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest-grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all-time blockbuster\" by Box Office India, with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards. The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the audience. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting\".\n\n1999–2003: Career Fluctuations\n\nKhan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi. Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure. It was released one week after Kaho Naa.. Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan. Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little\". Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan. He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan. On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance\".\n\n2004–2009: Comeback\n\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer. In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India-Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain. Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise. It was the highest-earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).\n\n2010–2014: Expansion to Action and Comedy\n\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol. The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos, and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar. Jay Weissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, and stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval\".\n\n2015–2022: Career Setbacks and Hiatus\n\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan, and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million). Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer. The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula. Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.\n\n2023–present: Resurgence\n\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India. Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma, and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star. Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom. Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\". Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan. Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide, making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.\n\nOther Work\n\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited. After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters. Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000), he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012). For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.\n\nFilm Production and Television Hosting\n\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited.

Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal, and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150 years of India-South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.\n\nOwnership of Kolkata Knight Riders\n\nIn 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). As of 2009, KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1 million. The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012 and repeated the feat in 2014. The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14). They won their third IPL title in the 2024 edition.\n\nIn the Media\n\nKhan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as \"King Khan\", \"The Baadshah of Bollywood\", or \"The King of Bollywood\". Anupama Chopra cites him as an \"ever-present celebrity\", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities. He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him \"the world's biggest movie star\".

Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure [90] It was released one week after Kaho Naa.. Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan [91] Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little.\" [92] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan [93] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan [94] [95] On Khan's performance, T Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\" [93]\n\n\n2004–2009: Comeback\n2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer [116] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain [117] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise [118] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million) [109] [119]\n\n\n2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy\nAfter refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol [146] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood [147] To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition [148] [149] Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, [109] [104] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, [52] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar [150] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps,  [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval\" [151]\n\n\n2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus\nKhan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015) The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million) [180] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired [181] He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action thriller Fan (2016) Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer [182] The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula [183] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi [184]\n\n\n2023–present: Resurgence\nIn 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India [200] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star [201] [202] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom [203] [204] Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers [205] Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\" [206] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan [207] Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide, [208] making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion [209]\n\n\nOther work\nKhan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited [89] After the partnership was dissolved, he

into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the 1920–21 season [16] 11 new players were signed and the Bees' first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at Exeter City's St James Park, [17] which resulted in a 3–0 defeat [18] Despite 18 goals from Harry King, a lack of goals from elsewhere in the side led Brentford to a 21st-place finish, [19] but the club were re-elected into the league without going to a poll [17]\n\n\n1954–1986: Decline and financial difficulties\nRelegation to the Third Division South at the end of the 1953–54 season meant that 1954–55 would be Brentford's first in the bottom-tier for 21 years [38] After three consecutive top-six finishes, [38] the rot set in during the 1960–61 season, with the poor form on the field mirrored by the news from the boardroom of debts of £50,000 (equivalent to £1,405,800 in 2024) [39]\n\n\n1986–2014\nIn 1991–92, six wins from the six final matches saw Brentford recover to win the Third Division championship on the final day and secure second-tier football for the first time since the 1953–54 season [29] [52] However, Brentford returned immediately to the third tier [53] In 1996–97, Brentford missed out on promotion, losing the play-off final against Crewe Alexandra [54] In the 1997–98 season, Brentford were relegated to the Third Division on the final day of the season

Dean Smith, Brentford became an established Championship side [77] Smith's successor, Thomas Frank, took Brentford to the 2020 Championship play-off final after finishing third in the league, but lost 2–1 to West London rivals Fulham [78] During the 2020 off-season, the club moved out of Griffin Park (its home ground for 116 years) and into the Brentford Community Stadium, a 17,250-capacity all-seater stadium [74] [79] Brentford repeated their third-place finish during the 2020–21 regular season and went one better in the play-offs, securing promotion to the Premier League with a 2–0 victory over Swansea City in the 2021 Championship play-off final [80] Brentford played in the top division of English football for the first time in 74 years [66] Frank guided his side to 13th, 9th

The club's first match was played in 1889 against a team from the nearby town of Hounslow. Brentford won the match 2-1, but the club's early years were marked by financial difficulties and a lack of success on the pitch. In 1893, the club joined the Western League, a semi-professional league that was formed in 1893. Brentford played in the Western League for several years, but the club's finances continued to struggle.\n\n**1920–1954: Establishment in the Football League and Glory Years**\n\nIn May 1920, Brentford and 20 other Southern League First Division clubs were elected into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the 1920-21 season. 11 new players were signed and the Bees' first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at Exeter City's St James Park, which resulted in a 3-0 defeat.

Griffin Park was the club's home for over 100 years before the club moved to the Brentford Community Stadium in 2020.\n\n**Players**\n\nBrentford's nickname is \"The Bees\". The nickname was unintentionally created by students of Borough Road College in the 1890s, when they attended a match and shouted the college's chant \"buck up Bs\" in support of their friend and then-Brentford player Joseph Gettins.

Brentford Rowing Club and Boston Park Cricket Club [2] Attempts to form football and rugby clubs in the town fell by the wayside until a new recreation ground was opened on 17 October 1889 [2] Seven days earlier, a meeting had taken place at the Oxford & Cambridge pub near Kew Bridge, during which it had been endeavoured between the rowing and cricket club members to decide how best to use the recreation ground [2] On 16 October 1889, the rowing club members again met at the Oxford & Cambridge pub and it was voted that the new club would play association football, be named \"Brentford Football Club\" [2]\n\n\n1889–1920: Formation and early years\nIn 1889, the town of Brentford, Middlesex was home to the Brentford Rowing Club and Boston Park Cricket Club [2] Attempts to form

glory years\nIn May 1920, Brentford and 20 other Southern League First Division clubs were elected into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the 1920–21 season [16] 11 new players were signed and the Bees' first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at Exeter City's St James Park, [17] which resulted in a 3–0 defeat [18] Despite 18 goals from Harry King, a lack of goals from elsewhere in the side led Brentford to a 21st-place finish, [19] but the club were re-elected into the league without going to a poll [17]\n\n\n1954–1986: Decline and financial difficulties\nRelegation to the Third Division South at the end of the 1953–54 season meant that 1954–55 would be Brentford's first in the bottom-tier for 21 years [38] After three consecutive top-six finishes, [38] the rot set in during the 1960–61 season, with the poor form on the field mirrored by the news from the boardroom of debts of £50,000 (equivalent to £1,405,800 in 2024) [39]\n\n\n1986–2014\nIn 1991–92, six wins from the six final matches saw Brentford recover to win the Third Division championship on the final day and secure second-tier football for the first time since the 1953–54 season [29] [52] However, Brentford returned immediately to the third tier [53] In 1996–97, Brentford missed out on promotion, losing the play-off final against Crewe Alexandra

since 1993, Brentford finished 5th but lost to Middlesbrough in the play-off semi-finals [75] [76] Under Dean Smith, Brentford became an established Championship side [77] Smith's successor, Thomas Frank, took Brentford to the 2020 Championship play-off final after finishing third in the league, but lost 2–1 to West London rivals Fulham [78] During the 2020 off-season, the club moved out of Griffin Park (its home ground for 116 years) and into the Brentford Community Stadium, a 17,250-capacity all-seater stadium [74] [79] Brentford repeated their third-place finish during the 2020–21 regular season and went one better in the play-offs, securing promotion to the Premier League with a 2–0 victory over Swansea City in the 2021 Championship play-off final [80] Brentford played in the top division of English football for the first time in 74 years [66] Frank guided his side to 13th, 9th and 16th-placed finishes in Brentford's first three Premier League campaigns [29]\n\n\nCurrent

She first appeared in Ms. Marvel #1 (May 2014) and was created by writer G. Willow Wilson and artist Adrian Alphona.\n\n**Creative Origins**\n\nMarvel Comics announced in November 2013 that Kamala Khan, a teenage American Muslim from Jersey City, New Jersey, would take over the comic-book series Ms Marvel in February 2014. The series, written by G Willow Wilson and drawn by Adrian Alphona, marked the first time a Muslim character headlined a Marvel Comics book. Noelene Clark of the Los Angeles Times noted that Kamala is not the first Muslim character in comic books; other Muslim characters include Simon Baz, Dust, and M. The character was conceived during a conversation between Marvel editors Sana Amanat and Stephen Wacker. Amanat said, \"I was telling him some crazy anecdote about my childhood, growing up as a Muslim American. He found it hilarious.\" They then told Wilson about the concept, and Wilson was eager to join it. Amanat said that the series came from a \"desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective.\"\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nKamala develops her superpowers after Marvel's Infinity storyline, when the Terrigen Mists are released. Her dormant Inhuman abilities are activated by the mists on a rare night when she rebelliously decides to sneak out after her parents forbid her from attending a school party. Amanat said in 2022 that when she and Wilson were creating Kamala, the character was originally going to be a mutant before they changed her to an Inhuman. Screen Rant noted that Kamala is a \"polymorph,\" with moves which \"are basically Ant-Man and Mister Fantastic's combined.\" According to academic Sarah Gibbons, Kamala's body-morphing is paralleled by the flexibility required of the characters who live in Jersey City; her unusual, superpowered body shape conveys a non-conforming message.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nKamala is the daughter of Yusuf and Muneeba Khan and the younger sister of Aamir Khan. She takes the name Ms Marvel from Carol Danvers, who is now known as Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel writer Kelly Sue DeConnick said that Kamala made a brief appearance in Captain Marvel #14 (August 2013): \"Kamala is in the background of a scene in Captain Marvel 14... She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from Yon-Rogg.\" Kamala has a second cameo appearance in Captain Marvel #17 (November 2013). According to co-creator G Willow Wilson, Kamala idolizes Carol and emulates her when she acquires superhuman abilities: \"Captain Marvel represents an ideal that Kamala pines for. She's strong, beautiful, and doesn't have any of the baggage of being Pakistani and 'different'.\"\n\n**Volume One (2013-2015)**\n\nKamala initially appears in \"Garden State of Mind\" in the anthology All-New Marvel Now! Point One #1 (January 2014) before debuting in the solo series Ms Marvel with the first issue released in February 2014. Kamala is one of several characters who discover that they have Inhuman heritage after the \"Inhumanity\" storyline, in which the Terrigen Mists are released worldwide and activate dormant Inhuman cells.\n\n**Volume Two (2015-2018)**\n\nMarvel announced in March 2015 that Kamala would join the Avengers in All-New All-Different Avengers FCBD (May 2015) by writer Mark Waid and artists Adam Kubert and Mahmud Asrar. A second volume of Ms Marvel, starring Kamala, by Wilson, Alphona, and Takeshi Miyazawa also debuted after \"Secret Wars\" as part of Marvel's All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative. Amanat said, \"Since the events of 'Civil War II,' there's been friction between Kamala and her mentor, Captain Marvel. In this arc, we're exploring how complicated legacies can be when they're passed from generation to generation... She's questioning a lot about herself and her mission. Her friends end up stepping into some very important—and unexpected—roles. So in a sense, the arc is really about a bunch of chronically under-estimated teenagers who pull together to fight evil.\"\n\n**Death in 2019**\n\nKamala's death and subsequent resurrection via Miles Morales' agreement with the devil Mephisto in Champions vol 3 #1-2 (January-February 2019) was criticized by Bam Smack Pow for the lack of intended follow-up in Kamala's solo series The Magnificent Ms Marvel, calling out \"learning that one of her best friends accidentally traded an innocent life for hers via a deal with the devil... as the sort of trauma which really should be followed up upon,\" while overall praising the \"emotional gut-wrenching conversation\" between Kamala and Miles about life and death.\n\n**Beyond the Limit**\n\nAvery Kaplan, in her review of Ms Marvel: Beyond the Limit for The Beat, wrote: \"Beyond the Limit was a fun and interesting story that went to some unexpected places, all while allowing Kamala plenty of time to shine (and to make a lot of funny food jokes).\" Kaplan added, \"Issue five brings the main conflict to a satisfactory enough close while promising further explanation in a sequel series... which I guess is an alternative to an ongoing series, probably based on the idea that marketing five-issue arcs which are subsequently collected into graphic novel-style TPB collections is easier than getting new readers to jump on at issue #546 – whatever, just give me more Kamala.\"\n\n**2023-Present**\n\nKamala's death in The Amazing Spider-Man vol 5 #26 (May 2023) was criticized after several low-resolution pages leaked before the issue's publication. Both Joe Grunenwald of The Beat and James Whitbrook of Io9 commented on the character's increased popularity following her onscreen appearance in the television show Ms Marvel and that Kamala's death was occurring in another headliner's book at time when the character doesn't have her own series. Whitbrook wrote, \"killing off such a prominent and influentially representative character at all, even temporarily—let alone not as part of a publisher-wide event or even in her own comic, but instead a book where she is an infrequent supporting guest character—is a move that is just as likely going to have fans reacting in anger as it is going to draw attention through shock.\"\n\n**Other Media**\n\nKamala Khan appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by Iman Vellani. In the Disney+ series Ms. Marvel, she is a teenage superheroine from Jersey City, New Jersey, who gains powers after being exposed to the Terrigen Mists.

1949) [a] Khan, who belonged to the Yusufzai tribe of Pashtuns from Peshawar valley, originating from Swabi District, North-West Frontier Province [10] was an employee at the Imperial Tobacco Company [10] [11] Unknown to her family members, Madhubala was born with a ventricular septal defect, a congenital heart disorder which had no treatment at the time [12] [13]\n\n\nActing career\nIn the summer of 1941, Khan along with Madhubala and other family members relocated to Bombay and settled down in a cowshed present in the Malad suburbs of Bombay [21] Following an approval from the studio executives, Chunnilal signed Madhubala to a juvenile role in Bombay Talkies' production, Basant (1942), at a salary of ₹150 [22] Released in July 1942, Basant became a major success commercially, [19] [23] but although Madhubala's work garnered appreciation, the studio dropped her contract as it did not require a child actor at that time [24] Disappointed, Khan had to once again return his family to Delhi He subsequently found low-paid temporary jobs in the city, [25] but continued to struggle financially [26]\n\n\nEarly work and switch to adult roles (1942–1947)\nIn the summer of 1941, Khan along with Madhubala and other family members relocated to Bombay and settled down in a cowshed present in the Malad suburbs of Bombay [21] Following an approval from the studio executives, Chunnilal signed Madhubala to a juvenile role in Bombay Talkies' production, Basant (1942), at a salary of ₹150 [22] Released in July 1942, Basant became a major success commercially, [19] [23] but although Madhubala's work garnered appreciation, the studio dropped her contract as it did not require a child actor at that time [24] Disappointed, Khan had to once again return his family to Delhi He subsequently found low-paid temporary jobs in the city, [25] but continued to struggle financially [26]\n\n\nRise to prominence and stardom (1948–1957)\nMadhubala found her first critical and commercial success in the drama Lal Dupatta, which The Indian Express mentioned as a breakthrough for her [17] [31] Baburao Patel described the film as \"the first milestone of her maturity in screen acting.\" [45] She received further positive reviews for her supporting parts in Parai Aag (1948), Paras and Singaar (both 1949) [46] In 1949, Madhubala played a femme fatale in Kamal Amrohi's Mahal—the first horror film of Indian cinema [47] Several actresses including Suraiya were considered for the role but Amrohi insisted on casting Madhubala [48] [49] Her character was that of Kamini, a servant girl in an ancient mansion, whose pretensions of an apparition lead to disastrous consequences The film was produced on a modest budget due to financial constraints, with trade analysts predicting it to be a failure owing to its unconventional subject [49] Mahal was released in October 1949 and proved to be an immensely popular film among audience [49] In Beyond the Boundaries of Bollywood, Rachel Dwyer noted that Madhubala's ignorance among audience added to the mysterious nature of her character [47] The film, which would be Madhubala's first of many collaborations with actor and brother-in-law Ashok Kumar, [50] emerged as the third biggest box-office success of the year, resulting in her signing a string of starring roles opposite the leading actors of the time [51] [52]\n\n\nMughal-e-Azam and continued commercial success (1958–1962)\nMadhubala began the year 1958 with Raj Khosla's Kala Pani, in which she co-starred with Dev Anand and Nalini Jaywant, playing an intrepid journalist investigating a 15-year-old murder [90] She was then cast as Edna opposite Ashok Kumar in Howrah Bridge (1958), her first collaboration with director Shakti Samanta Madhubala waived her fees to play the role of an Anglo-Indian cabaret dancer, which marked a departure from her previous portrayals of sophisticated characters [91] Both Howrah Bridge and Kala Pani begot positive reviews for her and became two of the year's top-grossing films [92] [74] She followed this success with the box office hit Phagun (1958) [93] In her final release of 1958, Madhubala portrayed a wealthy city woman involved in a love affair with Kishore Kumar in Satyen Bose's comedy Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi [94]—one of the biggest money-making films of the 1950s [95] Dinesh Raheja of Rediff.com referred to it as the \"fifties jest-setter\", adding that Madhubala \"exudes oodles of charisma and her giggles are infectious.\" [96] Writing for the same portral in 2012, columnist Rinki Roy mentioned Madhubala's character in Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi as \"a top favourite\": \"Her breezy performance stands out as that rare example of an independent, urban woman  [...] For me, Madhubala is the face of the original celluloid diva.\" [97]\n\n\nSabbaticals and final work (1964–1969)\nFollowing a sabbatical of two years, Madhubala completed Sharabi in 1964; the film would go on to become her final release in her lifetime [133] Baburao Patel, writing for Mother India, praised Madhubala's performance for \"reviv [ing] the old heartache\" [134] An editor for Rediff.com called Sharabi a \"fitting finale to a luminous career, showing the actress at her most beautiful and her most effective, a heroine destined not to age in any of our eyes.\" [135]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in an orthodox Muslim family, Madhubala was deeply religious and practiced Islam since her childhood [11] After securing her family financially in the late 1940s, she rented a bungalow on Peddar Road in Bombay and named it \"Arabian Villa\" It became her permanent residence until death [137] She learnt driving at the age of 12 and by adulthood was the owner of five cars: Buick, Chevrolet, Station wagon, Hillman, and Town & Country (which was owned by only two people in India at that time, the other one being the Maharaja of Gwalior) [138] As a native speaker of three Hindustani languages, she began learning English in 1950 from former actress Sushila Rani Patel and grew fluent in the language in three months [139] She also kept eighteen Alsatian dogs as pets at Arabian Villa [140] [141]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nShe performed actively in charity, which led editor Baburao Patel to call her the \"queen of charity\" [143] [144] In 1950, she donated ₹5,000 each to children suffering from polio myelitis and to the Jammu and Kashmir relief fund, and ₹50,000 for the refugees from East Bengal [145] [146] Madhubala's donation sparked off a major controversy due to her religious beliefs and received wide coverage in the media at that time [144] [147] Subsequently, she kept her charity work guarded and donated anonymously [144] In 1954, it was revealed that Madhubala had been regularly giving monthly bonuses to the lower staff of her studios [143] She also gifted a camera crane to the Film and Television Institute of India in 1962, which is operational even today [148]\n\n\nFriendships\nWhen she was a minor and in Delhi, Madhubala had a close friend named Latif, to whom she left a rose before her family relocated to Bombay [25] While working as a child artist in the mid-1940s, Madhubala befriended Baby Mahjabeen, another child actor of that time, who later grew up as actress Meena Kumari [149] Despite their professional rivalry, Madhubala shared a cordial relationship with Kumari as well as other female stars, such as Nargis, Nimmi, Begum Para, Geeta Bali, Nirupa Roy and Nadira [150] In 1951, following a major conflict with the press, Madhubala established a friendship with journalist B K Karanjia, who became one of the few people of his profession to be allowed inside Arabian Villa [151] Sarla Bhushan, the wife of Bharat Bhushan, with whom Madhubala had a special bond, died of labour complications in 1957, much to her distress [101] Madhubala was also close to three of her earliest directors—Kidar Sharma, Mohan Sinha, and Kamal Amrohi—and while there have been rumours regarding her being emotionally involved with them, her younger sister Madhur Bhushan has refuted such claims [152] On the sets of Mughal-e-Azam (1960), Madhubala often ate lunch with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, a Pakistani barrister who later served as the country's Prime Minister He used to visit the sets especially for Madhubala, [153] and according to Sushila Kumari was Madhubala's one-sided lover [154]\n\n\nRelationships and marriage\nMadhubala's first relationship was with her Badal co-star Prem Nath, in early 1951 [155] They dated for six months before differences figured out due to religion—Nath was a Hindu [15] Although the relationship fizzled out soon, Nath nevertheless remained close to Madhubala and her father Ataullah Khan for the rest of their lives [156] Also in 1951, Madhubala began a romance with actor Dilip Kumar, whom she had earlier met working on Jwar Bhata (1944) [157] Their affair went on to receive wide media attention throughout the decade [158] It had a positive impact on Madhubala and her friends have recalled the following few years as the happiest of her life [159]\n\n\nHealth deterioration and final years\n\" [I] brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a congenital heart problem For 9 long years, I nursed her I watched her die before my own eyes You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully She would rave and rant and scream in frustration How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time That's what the doctor asked me to That's what I did till her very last breath I would laugh with her I would cry with her.\" [175]\n\n\nDeath\nBy early 1969, Madhubala's health was in serious and major decline: she had just contracted jaundice and on urinalysis was diagnosed as having hematuria [190] Madhubala suffered a heart attack in the midnight of 22 February [191] After struggling for few hours amongst her family members and Kishore, she died at 9:30 a.m of 23 February, [9] only nine days after turning 36 [192] Madhubala was buried at Juhu Muslim Cemetery in Santacruz, Bombay along with her personal diary [193] [194] Her tomb was built with marbles and inscriptions include aayats from Quran and verse dedications [193]\n\n\nPublic image\nMadhubala was one of the most celebrated film stars in India from the late 1940s to early 1960s [126] [202] In 1951, James Burke photographed her for a feature in the American magazine Life, which described her as the biggest star in the Indian film industry at that time [203] [204] Her fame reached beyond India as well: director Frank Capra offered her a break in Hollywood (which her father declined) [202] and in August 1952, David Cort of Theatre Arts Magazine wrote of her as \"the biggest star in the world—and she's not in the Beverley Hills.\" [205] [2] Cort estimated Madhubala's Indian and Pakistani fan base equal to the combined population of the contemporary United States and western Europe, and also reported her popularity in countries such as Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and East Africa [1] Along with Nargis, she also had large fan following in Greece [206]\n\n\nArtistry and legacy\nIn a 22-year-long career, Madhubala acted in almost every film

as \"the first milestone of her maturity in screen acting.\" [45] She received further positive reviews for her supporting parts in Parai Aag (1948), Paras and Singaar (both 1949) [46] In 1949, Madhubala played a femme fatale in Kamal Amrohi's Mahal—the first horror film of Indian cinema [47] Several actresses including Suraiya were considered for the role but Amrohi insisted on casting Madhubala [48] [49] Her character was that of Kamini, a servant girl in an ancient mansion, whose pretensions of an apparition lead to disastrous consequences The film was produced on a modest budget due to financial constraints, with trade analysts predicting it to be a failure owing to its unconventional subject [49] Mahal was released in October 1949 and proved to be an immensely popular film among audience [49] In Beyond the Boundaries of Bollywood, Rachel Dwyer noted that Madhubala's ignorance among audience added to the mysterious nature of her character [47] The film, which would be Madhubala's first of many collaborations with actor and brother-in-law Ashok Kumar, [50] emerged as the third biggest box-office success of the year, resulting in her signing a string of starring roles opposite the leading actors of the time [51] [52]\n\n\nMughal-e-Azam and continued commercial success (1958–1962)\nMadhubala began the year 1958 with Raj Khosla's Kala Pani, in which she co-starred with Dev Anand and Nalini Jaywant, playing an intrepid journalist investigating a 15-year-old murder [90] She was then cast as Edna opposite Ashok Kumar in Howrah Bridge (1958), her first collaboration with director Shakti Samanta Madhubala waived her fees to play the role of an Anglo-Indian cabaret dancer, which marked a departure from her previous portrayals of sophisticated characters [91] Both Howrah Bridge and Kala Pani begot positive reviews for her and became two of the year's top-grossing films [92] [74] She followed this success with the box office hit Phagun (1958) [93] In her final release of 1958, Madhubala portrayed a wealthy city woman involved in a love affair with Kishore Kumar in Satyen Bose's comedy Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi [94]—one of the biggest money-making films of the 1950s [95] Dinesh Raheja of Rediff.com referred to it as the \"fifties jest-setter\", adding that Madhubala \"exudes oodles of charisma and her giggles are infectious.\" [96] Writing for the same portral in 2012, columnist Rinki Roy mentioned Madhubala's character in Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi as \"a top favourite\": \"Her breezy performance stands out as that rare example of an independent, urban woman  [...] For me, Madhubala is the face of the original celluloid diva.\" [97]\n\n\nSabbaticals and final work (1964–1969)\nFollowing a sabbatical of two years, Madhubala completed Sharabi in 1964; the film would go on to become her final release in her lifetime [133] Baburao Patel, writing for Mother India, praised Madhubala's performance for \"reviv [ing] the old heartache\" [134] An editor for Rediff.com called Sharabi a \"fitting finale to a luminous career, showing the actress at her most beautiful and her most effective, a heroine destined not to age in any of our eyes.\" [135]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in an orthodox Muslim family, Madhubala was deeply religious and practiced Islam since her childhood [11] After securing her family financially in the late 1940s, she rented a bungalow on Peddar Road in Bombay and named it \"Arabian Villa\" It became her permanent residence until death [137] She learnt driving at the age of 12 and by adulthood was the owner of five cars: Buick, Chevrolet, Station wagon, Hillman, and Town & Country (which was owned by only two people in India at that time, the other one being the Maharaja of Gwalior) [138] As a native speaker of three Hindustani languages, she began learning English in 1950 from former actress Sushila Rani Patel and grew fluent in the language in three months [139] She also kept eighteen Alsatian dogs as pets at Arabian Villa [140] [141]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nShe performed actively in charity, which led editor Baburao Patel to call her the \"queen of charity\" [143] [144] In 1950, she donated ₹5,000 each to children suffering from polio myelitis and to the Jammu and Kashmir relief fund, and ₹50,000 for the refugees from East Bengal [145] [146] Madhubala's donation sparked off a major controversy due to her religious beliefs and received wide coverage in the media at that time [144] [147] Subsequently, she kept her charity work guarded and donated anonymously [144] In 1954, it was revealed that Madhubala had been regularly giving monthly bonuses to the lower staff of her studios [143] She also gifted a camera crane to the Film and Television Institute of India in 1962, which is operational even today [148]\n\n\nFriendships\nWhen she was a minor and in Delhi, Madhubala had a close friend named Latif, to whom she left a rose before her family relocated to Bombay [25] While working as a child artist in the mid-1940s, Madhubala befriended Baby Mahjabeen, another child actor of that time, who later grew up as actress Meena Kumari [149] Despite their professional rivalry, Madhubala shared a cordial relationship with Kumari as well as other female stars, such as Nargis, Nimmi, Begum Para, Geeta Bali, Nirupa Roy and Nadira [150] In 1951, following a major conflict with the press, Madhubala established a friendship with journalist B K Karanjia, who became one of the few people of his profession to be allowed inside Arabian Villa [151] Sarla Bhushan, the wife of Bharat Bhushan, with whom Madhubala had a special bond, died of labour complications in 1957, much to her distress [101] Madhubala was also close to three of her earliest directors—Kidar Sharma, Mohan Sinha, and Kamal Amrohi—and while there have been rumours regarding her being emotionally involved with them, her younger sister Madhur Bhushan has refuted such claims [152] On the sets of Mughal-e-Azam (1960), Madhubala often ate lunch with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, a Pakistani barrister who later served as the country's Prime Minister He used to visit the sets especially for Madhubala, [153] and according to Sushila Kumari was Madhubala's one-sided lover [154]\n\n\nRelationships and marriage\nMadhubala's first relationship was with her Badal co-star Prem Nath, in early 1951 [155] They dated for six months before differences figured out due to religion—Nath was a Hindu [15] Although the relationship fizzled out soon, Nath nevertheless remained close to Madhubala and her father Ataullah Khan for the rest of their lives [156] Also in 1951, Madhubala began a romance with actor Dilip Kumar, whom she had earlier met working on Jwar Bhata (1944) [157] Their affair went on to receive wide media attention throughout the decade [158] It had a positive impact on Madhubala and her friends have recalled the following few years as the happiest of her life [159]\n\n\nHealth deterioration and final years\n\" [I] brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a congenital heart problem For 9 long years, I nursed her I watched her die before my own eyes You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully She would rave and rant and scream in frustration How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time That's what the doctor asked me to That's what I did till her very last breath I would laugh with her I would cry with her.\" [175]\n\n\nDeath\nBy early 1969, Madhubala's health was in serious and major decline: she had just contracted jaundice and on urinalysis was diagnosed as having hematuria [190] Madhubala suffered a heart attack in the midnight of 22 February [191] After struggling for few hours amongst her family members and Kishore, she died at 9:30 a.m of 23 February, [9] only nine days after turning 36 [192] Madhubala was buried at Juhu Muslim Cemetery in Santacruz, Bombay along with her personal diary [193] [194] Her tomb was built with marbles and inscriptions include aayats from Quran and verse dedications [193]\n\n\nPublic image\nMadhubala was one of the most celebrated film stars in India from the late 1940s to early 1960s [126] [202] In 1951, James Burke photographed her for a feature in the American magazine Life, which described her as the biggest star in the Indian film industry at that time [203] [204] Her fame reached beyond India as well: director Frank Capra offered her a break in Hollywood (which her father declined) [202] and in August 1952, David Cort of Theatre Arts Magazine wrote of her as \"the biggest star in the world—and she's not in the Beverley Hills.\" [205] [2] Cort estimated Madhubala's Indian and Pakistani fan base equal to the combined population of the contemporary United States and western Europe, and also reported her popularity in countries such as Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and East Africa [1] Along with Nargis, she also had large fan following in Greece [206]\n\n\nArtistry and legacy\nIn a 22-year-long career, Madhubala acted in almost every film genre, ranging from romantic musicals to slapstick comedies, and crime thrillers to historical dramas [244] [245] The author of Celebrities: A Comprehensive Biographical Thesaurus of Important Men and Women in India (1952), Jagdish Bhatia noted that Madhubala turned her disadvantages into advantage and despite her non-filmy background \"rose to be one of the most talented female stars of the industry.\" [27] Baburao Patel, writing for Filmindia, called her \"easily our most talented, most versatile and best-looking artiste.\" [246] A number of her directors including Sharma, Shakti Samanta and Raj Khosla spoke highly of her acting talents on different occasions [247] Ashok Kumar described her as the finest actress he ever worked with, [248] while Dilip Kumar wrote in his autobiography that she was \"a vivacious artiste .. so instantaneous in her responses that the scenes became riveting even when they were being filmed .. she was an artiste who could keep pace and meet the level of involvement demanded by the script.\" [249]\n\n\nActing style and reception\nIn a 22-year-long career, Madhubala acted in almost every film genre, ranging from romantic musicals to slapstick comedies, and crime thrillers to historical dramas [244] [245] The author of Celebrities: A Comprehensive Biographical Thesaurus of Important Men and Women in India (1952), Jagdish Bhatia

instantaneous in her responses that the scenes became riveting even when they were being filmed .. she was an artiste who could keep pace and meet the level of involvement demanded by the script.\" [249]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn recent years, Madhubala's legacy has maintained fans of all different ages, both younger and older She is recognized even by those who are unfamiliar with vintage cinema and has dozens of fan sites dedicated to her on the social media [284] Modern magazines continue to publish stories on her personal life and career, often promoting her name heavily on the covers to attract sales [284] Her legacy has extended to fashion also: she has been acknowledged as the creator of many iconic fashion styles, such as wavy hairstyle and strapless dresses, which are widely followed by many celebrities [257] In accordance with her enduring popularity, News 18 wrote, \"the cult of Madhubala is a difficult thing to match up to.\" [285] Several modern-day celebrities, including Aamir Khan, Hrithik Roshan, [286] Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, [287] Rishi Kapoor [288] and Naseeruddin Shah rank Madhubala among their favorite artistes of Indian cinema [289] Research analyst Rohit Sharma has studied narratives about Madhubala and surmised the reason behind her continued relevancy among new generation: \n\n\nWorks and accolades\nMadhubala appeared in 72 films between 1942 and 1964, including Basant (1942), Neel Kamal (1947), Mahal (1949), Badal (1951), Tarana (1951), Amar (1954), Mr & Mrs '55 (1955), Kala Pani (1958), Howrah Bridge (1958), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Mughal-e-Azam (1960), Barsaat Ki Raat (1960), Half Ticket (1962) and Sharabi (1964) Her seventy-third and last film was the posthumously released Jwala (1971) She was credited as a producer in Naata (1955), Mehlon Ke Khwab (1960) and Pathan (1962) [302] For her work in Mughal-e-Azam, Madhubala was nominated for Filmfare Award for Best Actress; it was the only nomination she ever received [117]\n\n\nTributes and honours\nAs a tribute to Madhubala, Mandoubala, a Greek song dedicated to her, was performed at the closing ceremony of the 2004 Athens Olympics [303] Digitally-colorized versions of two of Madhubala's films—Mughal-e-Azam (in 2004) and Half Ticket (in 2012)—have been released theatrically [304] [305] In March 2008, Indian Post issued a commemorative postage stamp featuring Madhubala, that was launched by her surviving family members and co-stars; [306] the only other Indian actress that was honoured in this manner was Nargis, at that point of time [307]\n\n\nPopular culture references\nIn July 2018, Madhubala's sister Madhur Bhushan, announced that she was planning to make a biopic on her sister [327] Bhushan wants Kareena Kapoor to play Madhubala, but as of 2018, the project remains in its initial stages [327] [328] In November 2019, filmmaker Imtiaz Ali was considering a biopic of Madhubala, but later dropped the idea after her family denied permission [329] Actresses including Kriti Sanon, [330] Kangana Ranaut, [331] Kiara Advani, [332] and Janhvi Kapoor, [333] and Yami Gautam have expressed their wish to play Madhubala in

{"title": "Prehistoric_religion", "content": "\nBackground\nPrehistory is the period in human history before written records The lack of written evidence demands the use of archaeological evidence, [1] which makes it difficult to extrapolate conclusive statements about religious belief [2] Much of the study of prehistoric religion is based on inferences from historic (textual) and ethnographic evidence, for example analogies between the religion of Palaeolithic and modern hunter-gatherer societies [3] The usefulness of analogy in archaeological reasoning is theoretically complex and contested, but in the context of prehistoric religion can be strengthened by circumstantial evidence; for instance, it has been observed that red ochre was significant to many prehistoric societies and to modern hunter-gatherers [4]\n\n\nHuman evolution\nThe question of when religion emerged in the evolving  psyche has sparked the curiosity of paleontologists for decades [10] [11] On the whole, neither the archaeological record nor the current understanding of how human intelligence evolved suggests early hominins [note 1] had the cognitive capacity for spiritual belief Religion was certainly present during the Upper Paleolithic period, dating to about 50,000 through 12,000 years ago, while religion in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic \"belongs to the realm of legend\" [13]\n\n\nLower and Middle Paleolithic: precursors to religion\nThe Paleolithic, sometimes called the Old Stone Age, makes up over 99% of humanity's history Lasting from approximately 2.5 million years ago through to 10,000 BC, the Paleolithic comprises the emergence of the Homo genus, the evolution of mankind, and the emergence of art, technology, and culture [26] The Paleolithic is broadly divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper periods The Lower Paleolithic (2.5 mya–300,000 BC) sees the emergence of stone tools, the evolution of Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus, and the first dispersal of humanity from Africa; the Middle Paleolithic (300,000 BC–50,000 BC) the apparent beginnings of culture and art alongside the emergence of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans; the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 BC–10,000 BC) a sharp flourishing of culture, the emergence of sophisticated and elaborate art, jewellery, and clothing, and the worldwide dispersal of Homo sapiens sapiens [27] [28] [note 2]\n\n\nLower Paleolithic\nReligion prior to the Upper Paleolithic is speculative, [13] and the Lower Paleolithic in particular has no clear evidence of religious practice [27] Not even the loosest evidence for ritual exists prior to 500,000 years before the present, though archaeologist Gregory J Wightman notes the limits of the archaeological record means their practice cannot be thoroughly ruled out [31] The early hominins of the Lower Paleolithic—an era well before the emergence of H s sapiens—slowly gained, as they began to collaborate and work in groups, the ability to control and mediate their emotional responses Their rudimentary sense of collaborative identity laid the groundwork for the later social aspects of religion [32]\n\n\nMiddle Paleolithic\nThe Middle Paleolithic was the era of coterminous Neanderthal and H s sapiens (anatomically modern human) habitation H s sapiens originated in Africa and Neanderthals in Eurasia; over the course of the period, H s sapiens range expanded to areas formerly dominated by Neanderthals, eventually supplanting them and ushering in the Upper Paleolithic [45] Much is unknown about Neanderthal cognition, particularly the capacities that would give rise to religion [11] Religious interpretations of Neanderthals have discussed their possibly-ritual use of caves, [46] their burial practices, [47] and religious practices amongst H s sapiens hunter-gatherer tribes in recorded history considered to have similar lifestyles to Neanderthals [3] [22] Pre-religious interpretations of Neanderthals argue their archaeological record suggests a lack of creativity or supernatural comprehension, [11] that Neanderthal-associated archaeological findings are too quickly ascribed religious motive, [13] and that the genetic and neurological remnants of Neanderthal skeletons do not permit the cognitive complexity required for religion [16]\n\n\nNeanderthals\nNeanderthals were the earliest hominins [note 5] to bury their dead, [23] although not the chronologically first burials, as earlier burials (such as those of the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins) are recorded amongst early H s sapiens [52] Though relatively few Neanderthal burials are known, spaced thousands of years apart over broad geographical ranges, Hayden argues them undeniable hallmarks of spiritual recognition and \"clear indications of concepts of the afterlife\" [23] Though Pettitt is more cautious about the significance of Neanderthal burial, he deems it a sophisticated and \"more than prosaic\" practice Pettitt deems the Neanderthals of at least southwest France, Germany, and the Levant possessive of clear mortuary rites he presumes linked to an underlying belief system He calls particular attention to potential grave markers found around Neanderthal burials, particularly those of children, at La Ferrassie in Dordogne [53]\n\n\nHomo sapiens sapiens\nH s sapiens emerged in Africa as early as 300,000 years ago [60] In the Middle Paleolithic, particularly its first couple hundred thousand years, the archaeological record of H s sapiens is barely distinguishable from their Neanderthal and H heidelbergensis contemporaries Though these first H s sapiens demonstrated some ability to construct shelter, use pigments, and collect artifacts, they yet lacked the behavioural sophistication associated with humans today [49] The process through which H s sapiens became cognitively and culturally sophisticated is known as behavioural modernity The emergence of behavioural modernity is unclear; traditionally conceptualised as a sudden shock around the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, modern accounts more often understand it as a slow process throughout the late Middle Paleolithic [61]\n\n\nUpper Paleolithic\nThe emergence of the Upper Paleolithic c 40,000–50,000 years ago was a time of explosive development The Upper Paleolithic saw the worldwide emergence of H s sapiens as the sole species of humanity, displacing their Neanderthal contemporaries across Eurasia and travelling to previously human-uninhabited territories such as Australia The complexity of stone tools grew, and the production of complex art, sculpture, and decoration began Long-distance trade networks emerged to connect communities that had complex house-like habitations and food storage networks [65]\n\n\nArt\nUpper Paleolithic humans produced complex paintings, sculptures, and other artforms, much of which held apparent ritual significance [67] Religious interpretations of such objects, especially \"portable art\" such as figurines, varies Some writers understand virtually all such art as spiritual, [67] while others read only a minority as such, preferring more mundane functions for the majority [68]\n\n\nBurial\nThe Upper Paleolithic saw the advent of complex burials with lavish grave goods Burials seem to have been relatively uncommon in these societies, perhaps reserved for people of high social or religious status [84] Many of these burials seem to have been accompanied by large quantities of red ochre, but the matter of decomposition makes it difficult to discern whether such pigments were applied to flesh or bone One remarkable case of a pigmented burial is that of Lake Mungo 3 in inland New South Wales, Australia; the ochre in which the body was found covered must have been transported for hundreds of kilometres, considering the distance between the burial and the nearest sources [85]\n\n\nBeliefs and practices\nUpper Paleolithic religions were presumably polytheist, venerating multiple deities, as this form of religion predates monotheism in recorded history [94] As well as polytheism, religions of the ancient world—that is, those in recorded history closest chronologically to prehistoric religion—focused on orthopraxy, or a focus on correct practice and ritual, rather than orthodoxy, or a focus on correct faith and belief [95] This is in contrast to many mainstream modern faiths, such as Christianity, that move the focus to orthodoxy [3] [96]\n\n\nMesolithic\nThe Mesolithic was the transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic In European archaeology, it traditionally refers to hunter-gatherers living after the end of the Pleistocene ice age [101] [note 9] Traditional archaeology takes a quotidian view of Mesolithic life, perceiving it as an era of cultural \"impoverishment\" without great cultural, artistic, or societal advances [103] The lack of enthusiasm to study the Mesolithic, and the lack of encouragement to do so by way of an absence of interesting archaeological findings, tied into one another; for instance, no Mesolithic cemeteries were unearthed until 1975 [101] Serious study of Mesolithic religion would not emerge until the 21st century, reinvigorating the field and reinterpreting prior assumptions of the Mesolithic as a bleak age [103]\n\n\nNeolithic\nThe Neolithic was the dawn of agriculture Originating around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture spread across Eurasia and North Africa in the following millennia and ushered in a new era of prehistory [107] Despite prior assumptions of immediate radical change, [107] the encroachment of agriculture was a slow process, and early agriculturalists do not seem to have sharp cultural distinctions from their hunter-gatherer peers [108] In archaeological terms, the Neolithic is marked by megaliths, ceremonial structures, complex tombs, and elaborate artifacts with apparent spiritual significance [109] Sociologically speaking, the Neolithic saw the transition from nomadic bands to sedentary villages This decreased the egalitarianism of those societies that transitioned; instead of more loosely collected confederates, they were now led by individuals with increasing power over those people within their domain This \"big man\" framework centralised religion and elevated the status of religious leaders [110]\n\n\nArt, sculpture, and monuments\nParticularly in its heartland of the Near East, the Neolithic was an artistically and technologically rich era [115] The rock art culturally associated with the Paleolithic did not disappear in the Neolithic, and in regions like south India it indeed flourished well into the era [116] As well as continuing old forms, the Neolithic permitted the emergence of new kinds of art and design As people moved from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, they built houses that represented units united through physical structures, \"subsum [ing] individuals into new corporate identities\" [117] They also built megaliths, huge stone monuments with widely speculated theological and cultural implications [118] Though a few hunter-gatherers, such as the Jōmon people of Japan, made pottery, pottery overall is another art form that emerged only in the Neolithic [119]\n\n\nBurial and funerary rites\nBurial appears more widespread in the Neolithic than the Upper Paleolithic In a wide area from the Levant through central Europe, Neolithic burials are frequently found in the houses their denizens lived in; in particular, women and children dominate amongst those buried inside the home [134] For children in particular, this may have represented the continued inclusion of these children in the family unit and a reincarnation cycle where those children were reborn as living members of the family [135] As in the Paleolithic, some Neolithic burials may represent sacrificial victims; a group burial in modern-day Henan, containing four skeletons, may have been the death of an important figure heralded by three sacrifices [136]\n\n\nLifestyle\nMuch of what is understood about Neolithic life comes from individual settlements with particularly preserved archaeological records, such as Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia Çatalhöyük was settled for a particularly long period of time, from around 7100 BC to 6000 BC, and provides a snapshot of a changing era Residents of Çatalhöyük lived in shared houses with non-relatives, drawing their closest connections to \"practical kin\" rather than \"official kin\"; they seem to have been divided into two sub-communities going by different dental patterns in their skeletal remains, and were possibly patrilocal, with men staying in the community of their birth and women moving away Nonetheless, Çatalhöyük is not in all ways representative of Neolithic communities; most such communities demonstrated poor nutrition and stunted growth, but the people of Çatalhöyük appeared to have adequate nutrition and indeed were able to support substantial population growth [143]\n\n\nRitual and theology\nPeople in the Neolithic possibly engaged in ancestor worship It is possible that inegalitarian Neolithic societies practised two separate ancestor cults: one based around everyday worship of the ancestors of individual families, and one based around ancestors of entire tribes, settlements, or cities, which the rulers of those people deemed themselves descended from In bids to gain spiritual and earthly power, these rulers would posit themselves the heirs of gods [148] [149] In some regions, evidence also exists for solar worship and lunar worship; for instance, British and Irish stone circles are generally aligned with the movement of the sun, which plausibly played a role in their ritual significance [150]\n\n\nChalcolithic\nThe Chalcolithic, or Copper Age, [note 11] was the transitional period between the Neolithic and Bronze Age In the Copper Age, an early understanding of metallurgy permitted the formation of simple copper tools to supplement stone, but without the deliberate production of its improved alloy bronze [161] In the Levant, the Copper Age is typified by social, agricultural, and artistic innovation Horticulture of plants such as olives became a major complement to grain agriculture, while the animal products available to farmers diversified Settlements expanded and came to inhabit broader geographical ranges, while the art and textiles of the area made great strides in both ornamental capacities and symbolic representation This contrasts to their peers in Egypt and Mesopotamia, who remained somewhat more inhibited throughout the era [162] Further west and especially north, the concept of the Copper Age grows controversial;

The study of prehistoric religion is a complex and challenging field, relying on analogies between prehistoric and modern societies, as well as circumstantial evidence. While the question of when religion emerged in the evolving human psyche has sparked curiosity for decades, the archaeological record and current understanding of human intelligence evolution suggest that early hominins did not have the cognitive capacity for spiritual belief.\n\n**Human Evolution**\n\nThe question of when religion emerged in the evolving human psyche has sparked curiosity for decades. On the whole, neither the archaeological record nor the current understanding of human intelligence evolution suggests that early hominins had the cognitive capacity for spiritual belief. However, the Upper Paleolithic period, dating to about 50,000 through 12,000 years ago, saw the emergence of complex societies with apparent ritual practices. The Paleolithic, sometimes called the Old Stone Age, makes up over 99% of humanity's history, lasting from approximately 2.5 million years ago through to 10,000 BC.\n\n**Lower and Middle Paleolithic: Precursors to Religion**\n\nThe Lower Paleolithic (2.5 mya–300,000 BC) saw the emergence of stone tools, the evolution of Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus, and the first dispersal of humanity from Africa. The Middle Paleolithic (300,000 BC–50,000 BC) saw the apparent beginnings of culture and art alongside the emergence of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. While the Lower Paleolithic has no clear evidence of religious practice, the early hominins of this era began to collaborate and work in groups, gaining the ability to control and mediate their emotional responses.\n\n**Lower Paleolithic**\n\nReligion prior to the Upper Paleolithic is speculative, and the Lower Paleolithic in particular has no clear evidence of religious practice. Not even the loosest evidence for ritual exists prior to 500,000 years before the present. However, archaeologist Gregory J. Wightman notes that the limits of the archaeological record mean that their practice cannot be thoroughly ruled out. The early hominins of the Lower Paleolithic began to collaborate and work in groups, gaining the ability to control and mediate their emotional responses.\n\n**Middle Paleolithic**\n\nThe Middle Paleolithic was the era of coterminous Neanderthal and Homo sapiens (anatomically modern human) habitation. Homo sapiens originated in Africa and Neanderthals in Eurasia; over the course of the period, Homo sapiens range expanded to areas formerly dominated by Neanderthals, eventually supplanting them and ushering in the Upper Paleolithic. Much is unknown about Neanderthal cognition, particularly the capacities that would give rise to religion. However, interpretations of Neanderthal behavior suggest that they may have had some form of spiritual recognition.\n\n**Neanderthals**\n\nNeanderthals were the earliest hominins to bury their dead, although not the chronologically first burials, as earlier burials are recorded amongst early Homo sapiens. While relatively few Neanderthal burials are known, Hayden argues that they are undeniable hallmarks of spiritual recognition and \"clear indications of concepts of the afterlife.\" Pettitt is more cautious about the significance of Neanderthal burial, but deems it a sophisticated and \"more than prosaic\" practice.\n\n**Homo Sapiens Sapiens**\n\nHomo sapiens sapiens emerged in Africa as early as 300,000 years ago. In the Middle Paleolithic, particularly its first couple hundred thousand years, the archaeological record of Homo sapiens is barely distinguishable from their Neanderthal and Homo heidelbergensis contemporaries. However, Homo sapiens demonstrated some ability to construct shelter, use pigments, and collect artifacts, laying the groundwork for the emergence of behavioral modernity.\n\n**Upper Paleolithic**\n\nThe Upper Paleolithic c. 40,000–50,000 years ago saw the emergence of complex societies with apparent ritual practices. The Upper Paleolithic saw the worldwide emergence of Homo sapiens as the sole species of humanity, displacing their Neanderthal contemporaries across Eurasia and traveling to previously human-uninhabited territories such as Australia. The complexity of stone tools grew, and the production of complex art, sculpture, and decoration began. Long-distance trade networks emerged to connect communities that had complex house-like habitations and food storage networks.\n\n**Art**\n\nUpper Paleolithic humans produced complex paintings, sculptures, and other artforms, much of which held apparent ritual significance. Religious interpretations of such objects, especially \"portable art\" such as figurines, vary. Some writers understand virtually all such art as spiritual, while others read only a minority as such, preferring more mundane functions for the majority.\n\n**Burial**\n\nThe Upper Paleolithic saw the advent of complex burials with lavish grave goods. Burials seem to have been relatively uncommon in these societies, perhaps reserved for people of high social or religious status. Many of these burials seem to have been accompanied by large quantities of red ochre, but the matter of decomposition makes it difficult to discern whether such pigments were applied to flesh or bone.\n\n**Beliefs and Practices**\n\nUpper Paleolithic religions were presumably polytheist, venerating multiple deities, as this form of religion predates monotheism in recorded history. As well as polytheism, religions of the ancient world focused on orthopraxy, or a focus on correct practice and ritual, rather than orthodoxy, or a focus on correct faith and belief.\n\n**Mesolithic**\n\nThe Mesolithic was the transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. In European archaeology, it traditionally refers to hunter-gatherers living after the end of the Pleistocene ice age. Traditional archaeology takes a quotidian view of Mesolithic life, perceiving it as an era of cultural \"impoverishment\" without great cultural, artistic, or societal advances.\n\n**Neolithic**\n\nThe Neolithic was the dawn of agriculture. Originating around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture spread across Eurasia and North Africa in the following millennia and ushered in a new era of prehistory. Despite prior assumptions of immediate radical change, the encroachment of agriculture was a slow process, and early agriculturalists do not seem to have sharp cultural distinctions from their hunter-gatherer peers.\n\n**Art, Sculpture, and Monuments**\n\nParticularly in its heartland of the Near East, the Neolithic was an artistically and technologically rich era. The rock art culturally associated with the Paleolithic did not disappear in the Neolithic, and in regions like south India it indeed flourished well into the era. As well as continuing old forms, the Neolithic permitted the emergence of new kinds of art and design. People moved from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, building houses that represented units united through physical structures, \"subsum [ing] individuals into new corporate identities.\"\n\n**Burial and Funerary Rites**\n\nBurial appears more widespread in the Neolithic than the Upper Paleolithic. In a wide area from the Levant through central Europe, Neolithic burials are frequently found in the houses their denizens lived in; in particular, women and children dominate amongst those buried inside the home. For children in particular, this may have represented the continued inclusion of these children in the family unit and a reincarnation cycle where those children were reborn as living members of the family.\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\nMuch of what is understood about Neolithic life comes from individual settlements with particularly preserved archaeological records, such as Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia. Çatalhöyük was settled for a particularly long period of time, from around 7100 BC to 6000 BC, and provides a snapshot of a changing era. Residents of Çatalhöyük lived in shared houses with non-relatives, drawing their closest connections to \"practical kin\" rather than \"official kin.\"\n\n**Ritual and Theology**\n\nPeople in the Neolithic possibly engaged in ancestor worship. It is possible that inegalitarian Neolithic societies practised two separate ancestor cults: one based around everyday worship of the ancestors of individual families, and one based around ancestors of entire tribes, settlements, or cities, which the rulers of those people deemed themselves descended from. In bids to gain spiritual and earthly power, these rulers would posit themselves the heirs of gods.\n\n**Chalcolithic**\n\nThe Chalcolithic, or Copper Age, was the transitional period between the Neolithic and Bronze Age. In the Copper Age, an early understanding of metallurgy permitted the formation of simple copper tools to supplement stone, but without the deliberate production of its improved alloy bronze. In the Levant, the Copper Age is typified by social, agricultural, and artistic innovation.\n\n**Proto-Indo-Europeans**\n\nOne of the major hypothesised cultures of the Copper Age were the Proto-Indo-Europeans, from whom all Indo-European language and mythology may have evolved. The Proto-Indo-Europeans are speculatively known through the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language, which bears traces of religion.\n\n**Bronze and Iron Ages**\n\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages, prehistory shades into protohistory. The earliest forms of true writing emerge in Bronze Age China, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, and it is with writing that societies leave their prehistories.\n\n**In Modern Culture**\n\nNew religious movements such as neopaganism take theological, spiritual, and cultural positions unlike those of the mainstream religions which dominate world discourse. One major stream of neopaganism is reconstructionism, where practitioners attempt to reconstruct the beliefs and practices of long-lost faiths.\n\n**Reconstruction**\n\nNew religious movements such as neopaganism take theological, spiritual, and cultural positions unlike those of the mainstream religions which dominate world discourse. One major stream of neopaganism is reconstructionism, where practitioners attempt to reconstruct the beliefs and practices of long-lost faiths.\n\n**In Fiction**\n\nPrehistoric fiction emerged as a genre in the 19th century. A subgenre of speculative fiction, Nicholas Ruddick compares the genre to science fiction proper, noting that—although the genre lacks the future orientation most readers think synonymous with science fiction—it is more closely related to the genre than anything else.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prehistoric_religion\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nPrehistory is the period in human history before written records The lack of written evidence demands the use of archaeological evidence, [1] which makes it difficult to extrapolate conclusive statements about religious belief [2] Much of the study of prehistoric religion is based on inferences from historic (textual) and ethnographic evidence, for example analogies between the religion of Palaeolithic and modern hunter-gatherer societies [3] The usefulness of analogy in archaeological reasoning is theoretically complex and contested, but in the context of prehistoric religion can be strengthened by circumstantial evidence; for instance, it has been observed that red ochre was significant to many prehistoric societies and to modern hunter-gatherers [4]\n\n\nHuman evolution\nThe question of when religion emerged in the evolving  psyche has sparked the curiosity of paleontologists for decades [10] [11] On the whole, neither the archaeological record nor the current understanding of how human intelligence evolved suggests early hominins [note 1] had the cognitive capacity for spiritual belief Religion was certainly present during the Upper Paleolithic period, dating to about 50,000 through 12,000 years ago, while religion in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic \"belongs to the realm of legend\" [13]\n\n\nLower and Middle Paleolithic: precursors to religion\nThe Paleolithic, sometimes called the Old Stone Age, makes up over 99% of humanity's history Lasting from approximately 2.5 million years ago through to 10,000 BC, the Paleolithic comprises the emergence of the Homo genus, the evolution of mankind, and the emergence of art, technology, and culture [26] The Paleolithic is broadly divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper periods The Lower Paleolithic (2.5 mya–300,000 BC) sees the emergence of stone tools, the evolution of Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus, and the first dispersal of humanity from Africa; the Middle Paleolithic (300,000 BC–50,000 BC) the apparent beginnings of culture and art alongside the emergence of Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans; the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 BC–10,000 BC) a sharp flourishing of culture, the emergence of sophisticated and elaborate art, jewellery, and clothing, and the worldwide dispersal of Homo sapiens sapiens [27] [28] [note 2]\n\n\nLower Paleolithic\nReligion prior to the Upper Paleolithic is speculative, [13] and the Lower Paleolithic in particular has no clear evidence of religious practice [27] Not even the loosest evidence for ritual exists prior to 500,000 years before the present, though archaeologist Gregory J Wightman notes the limits of the archaeological record means their practice cannot be thoroughly ruled out [31] The early hominins of the Lower Paleolithic—an era well before the emergence of H s sapiens—slowly gained, as they began to collaborate and work in groups, the ability to control and mediate their emotional responses Their rudimentary sense of collaborative identity laid the groundwork for the later social aspects of religion [32]\n\n\nMiddle Paleolithic\nThe Middle Paleolithic was the era of coterminous Neanderthal and H s sapiens (anatomically modern human) habitation H s sapiens originated in Africa and Neanderthals in Eurasia; over the course of the period, H s sapiens range expanded to areas formerly dominated by Neanderthals, eventually supplanting them and ushering in the Upper Paleolithic [45] Much is unknown about Neanderthal cognition, particularly the capacities that would give rise to religion [11] Religious interpretations of Neanderthals have discussed their possibly-ritual use of caves, [46] their burial practices, [47] and religious practices amongst H s sapiens hunter-gatherer tribes in recorded history considered to have similar lifestyles to Neanderthals [3] [22] Pre-religious interpretations of Neanderthals argue their archaeological record suggests a lack of creativity or supernatural comprehension, [11] that Neanderthal-associated archaeological findings are too quickly ascribed religious motive, [13] and that the genetic and neurological remnants of Neanderthal skeletons do not permit the cognitive complexity required for religion [16]\n\n\nNeanderthals\nNeanderthals were the earliest hominins [note 5] to bury their dead, [23] although not the chronologically first burials, as earlier burials (such as those of the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins) are recorded amongst early H s sapiens [52] Though relatively few Neanderthal burials are known, spaced thousands of years apart over broad geographical ranges, Hayden argues them undeniable hallmarks of spiritual recognition and \"clear indications of concepts of the afterlife\" [23] Though Pettitt is more cautious about the significance of Neanderthal burial, he deems it a sophisticated and \"more than prosaic\" practice Pettitt deems the Neanderthals of at least southwest France, Germany, and the Levant possessive of clear mortuary rites he presumes linked to an underlying belief system He calls particular attention to potential grave markers found around Neanderthal burials, particularly those of children, at La Ferrassie in Dordogne [53]\n\n\nHomo sapiens sapiens\nH s sapiens emerged in Africa as early as 300,000 years ago [60] In the Middle Paleolithic, particularly its first couple hundred thousand years, the archaeological record of H s sapiens is barely distinguishable from their Neanderthal and H heidelbergensis contemporaries Though these first H s sapiens demonstrated some ability to construct shelter, use pigments, and collect artifacts, they yet lacked the behavioural sophistication associated with humans today [49] The process through which H s sapiens became cognitively and culturally sophisticated is known as behavioural modernity The emergence of behavioural modernity is unclear; traditionally conceptualised as a sudden shock around the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, modern accounts more often understand it as a slow process throughout the late Middle Paleolithic [61]\n\n\nUpper Paleolithic\nThe emergence of the Upper Paleolithic c 40,000–50,000 years ago was a time of explosive development The Upper Paleolithic saw the worldwide emergence of H s sapiens as the sole species of humanity, displacing their Neanderthal contemporaries across Eurasia and travelling to previously human-uninhabited territories such as Australia The complexity of stone tools grew, and the production of complex art, sculpture, and decoration began Long-distance trade networks emerged to connect communities that had complex house-like habitations and food storage networks [65]\n\n\nArt\nUpper Paleolithic humans produced complex paintings, sculptures, and other artforms, much of which held apparent ritual significance [67] Religious interpretations of such objects, especially \"portable art\" such as figurines, varies Some writers understand virtually all such art as spiritual, [67] while others read only a minority as such, preferring more mundane functions for the majority [68]\n\n\nBurial\nThe Upper Paleolithic saw the advent of complex burials with lavish grave goods Burials seem to have been relatively uncommon in these societies, perhaps reserved for people of high social or religious status [84] Many of these burials seem to have been accompanied by large quantities of red ochre, but the matter of decomposition makes it difficult to discern whether such pigments were applied to flesh or bone One remarkable case of a pigmented burial is that of Lake Mungo 3 in inland New South Wales, Australia; the ochre in which the body was found covered must have been transported for hundreds of kilometres, considering the distance between the burial and the nearest sources [85]\n\n\nBeliefs and practices\nUpper Paleolithic religions were presumably polytheist, venerating multiple deities, as this form of religion predates monotheism in recorded history [94] As well as polytheism, religions of the ancient world—that is, those in recorded history closest chronologically to prehistoric religion—focused on orthopraxy, or a focus on correct practice and ritual, rather than orthodoxy, or a focus on correct faith and belief [95] This is in contrast to many mainstream modern faiths, such as Christianity, that move the focus to orthodoxy [3] [96]\n\n\nMesolithic\nThe Mesolithic was the transitional period between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic In European archaeology, it traditionally refers to hunter-gatherers living after the end of the Pleistocene ice age [101] [note 9] Traditional archaeology takes a quotidian view of Mesolithic life, perceiving it as an era of cultural \"impoverishment\" without great cultural, artistic, or societal advances [103] The lack of enthusiasm to study the Mesolithic, and the lack of encouragement to do so by way of an absence of interesting archaeological findings, tied into one another; for instance, no Mesolithic cemeteries were unearthed until 1975 [101] Serious study of Mesolithic religion would not emerge until the 21st century, reinvigorating the field and reinterpreting prior assumptions of the Mesolithic as a bleak age [103]\n\n\nNeolithic\nThe Neolithic was the dawn of agriculture Originating around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture spread across Eurasia and North Africa in the following millennia and ushered in a new era of prehistory [107] Despite prior assumptions of immediate radical change, [107] the encroachment of agriculture was a slow process, and early agriculturalists do not seem to have sharp cultural distinctions from their hunter-gatherer peers [108] In archaeological terms, the Neolithic is marked by megaliths, ceremonial structures, complex tombs, and elaborate artifacts with apparent spiritual significance [109] Sociologically speaking, the Neolithic saw the transition from nomadic bands to sedentary villages This decreased the egalitarianism of those societies that transitioned; instead of more loosely collected confederates, they were now led by individuals with increasing power over those people within their domain This \"big man\" framework centralised religion and elevated the status of religious leaders [110]\n\n\nArt, sculpture, and monuments\nParticularly in its heartland of the Near East, the Neolithic was an artistically and technologically rich era [115] The rock art culturally associated with the Paleolithic did not disappear in the Neolithic, and in regions like south India it indeed flourished well into the era [116] As well as continuing old forms, the Neolithic permitted the emergence of new kinds of art and design As people moved from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, they built houses that represented units united through physical structures, \"subsum [ing] individuals into new corporate identities\" [117] They also built megaliths, huge stone monuments with widely speculated theological and cultural implications [118] Though a few hunter-gatherers, such as the Jōmon people of Japan, made pottery, pottery overall is another art form that emerged only in the Neolithic [119]\n\n\nBurial and funerary rites\nBurial appears more widespread in the Neolithic than the Upper Paleolithic In a wide area from the Levant through central Europe, Neolithic burials are frequently found in the houses their denizens lived in; in particular, women and children dominate amongst those buried inside the home [134] For children in particular, this may have represented the continued inclusion of these children in the family unit and a reincarnation cycle where those children were reborn as living members of the family [135] As in the Paleolithic, some Neolithic burials may represent sacrificial victims; a group burial in modern-day Henan, containing four skeletons, may have been the death of an important figure heralded by three sacrifices [136]\n\n\nLifestyle\nMuch of what is understood about Neolithic life comes from individual settlements with particularly preserved archaeological records, such as Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia Çatalhöyük was settled for a particularly long period of time, from around 7100 BC to 6000 BC, and provides a snapshot of a changing era Residents of Çatalhöyük lived in shared houses with non-relatives, drawing their closest connections to \"practical kin\" rather than \"official kin\"; they seem to have been divided into two sub-communities going by different dental patterns in their skeletal remains, and were possibly patrilocal, with men staying in the community of their birth and women moving away Nonetheless, Çatalhöyük is not in all ways representative of Neolithic communities; most such communities demonstrated poor nutrition and stunted growth, but the people of Çatalhöyük appeared to have adequate nutrition and indeed were able to support substantial population growth [143]\n\n\nRitual and theology\nPeople in the Neolithic possibly engaged in ancestor worship It is possible that inegalitarian Neolithic societies practised two separate ancestor cults: one based around everyday worship of the ancestors of individual families, and one based around ancestors of entire tribes, settlements, or cities, which the rulers of those people deemed themselves descended from In bids to gain spiritual and earthly power, these rulers would posit themselves the heirs of gods [148] [149] In some regions, evidence also exists for solar worship and lunar worship; for instance, British and Irish stone circles are generally aligned with the movement of the sun, which plausibly played a role in their ritual significance [150]\n\n\nChalcolithic\nThe Chalcolithic, or Copper Age, [note 11] was the transitional period between the Neolithic and Bronze Age In the Copper Age, an early understanding of metallurgy permitted the formation of simple copper tools to supplement stone, but without the deliberate production of its improved alloy bronze [161] In the Levant, the Copper Age is typified by social, agricultural, and artistic innovation Horticulture of plants such as olives became a major complement to grain agriculture, while the animal products available to farmers diversified Settlements expanded and came to inhabit broader geographical ranges, while the art and textiles of the area made great strides in both ornamental capacities and symbolic representation This contrasts to their peers in Egypt and Mesopotamia, who remained somewhat more inhibited throughout the era [162] Further west and especially north, the concept of the Copper Age grows controversial; the \"British Chalcolithic\" is particularly unclear, with both support and opposition for the idea that copper metallurgy heralded a particular era in British prehistory [163]\n\n\nProto-Indo-Europeans\nOne of the major hypothesised cultures of the Copper Age were the Proto-Indo-Europeans, from whom all Indo-European language and mythology may have evolved The Proto-Indo-Europeans are speculatively known through the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language, which bears traces of religion; *Dyḗws, the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European sky god, developed into, for instance, the Greek Zeus and all he begat [164] *Dyḗws was the presumed leader of a pantheon of deities including *Dhuĝhatḗr Diwós (\"sky daughter\"), *Hₐéusōs (\"dawn goddess\"), *Neptonos (\"water grandson\"), and *Perkʷunos (\"thunder god\") There was also *Manu-, humanity's ancestor, who became Mannus of Germanic paganism and Manu of early Hinduism [165] There has been some reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European afterlife, \"a land of green pastures, where age and sickness are unknown\", accessible only via dangerous travels through a watery, hound-guarded maelstrom [166]\n\n\nBronze and Iron Ages\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages, prehistory shades into protohistory The earliest forms of true writing emerge in Bronze Age China, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, and it is with writing that societies leave their prehistories [173] Writing was adopted unevenly, across long chronological periods, and the degree to which the Bronze and Iron Ages constitute history, prehistory, or protohistory depends on the individual society [174] Protohistoric societies have not developed writing, but have been described in written records of societies that have; though this provides more evidence for their cultures and practices than can be gleaned by archaeological records alone, it poses the problem that the only lens these societies are understood through is that of foreigners who may dislike, mischaracterise, or simply misunderstand the people they write about [175]\n\n\nIn modern culture\nNew religious movements such as neopaganism take theological, spiritual, and cultural positions unlike those of the mainstream religions which dominate world discourse One major stream of neopaganism is reconstructionism, where practitioners attempt to reconstruct the beliefs and practices of long-lost faiths This is particularly associated with the prehistoric and protohistoric cultures of the European Bronze and Iron Ages [206] Major groups include Heathenry, which focuses on the reconstruction of Germanic and particularly Norse faiths;

Stine. The series is known for its dark and suspenseful storylines, which often involve murder, mystery, and the supernatural.\n\n**Plot Summary**\n\nThe Fear Street series takes place in the fictionalized town of Shadyside, where a group of teenagers encounter a variety of malignant, sometimes paranormal, adversaries. While some of the Fear Street novels have paranormal elements, such as ghosts, others are simply murder mysteries. In contrast to the tamed deaths depicted in other young adult horror series, such as Goosebumps, the deaths presented in Fear Street are often more gruesome, with more blood and gore.\n\nThe series typically features a group of teenagers who are investigating a mystery or a series of murders that are happening in their town. As they dig deeper, they often uncover dark secrets and supernatural forces that are at work in Shadyside. The books are known for their fast-paced and suspenseful plots, which often keep readers guessing until the very end.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe Fear Street series takes place in a town called Shadyside, which is located in a fictionalized version of the United States. The exact location of Shadyside is not specified in the books, but contextual clues suggest that it may be located in southern New England or a northern Mid-Atlantic state. For example, in book #3, The Overnight, a character mentions that he goes to Boston University, which is located in Boston, Massachusetts. This suggests that Shadyside is located somewhere near Boston, but south of it.\n\nThroughout the series, the town of Shadyside is portrayed as a dark and foreboding place, with a rich history of murder and supernatural activity. The town is surrounded by woods and a lake, which serve as a backdrop for many of the series' most suspenseful and frightening moments.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe first Fear Street book, The New Girl, was published in 1989. The series quickly became a bestseller, and over the years, more than 80 million Fear Street books have been sold worldwide. The books have appeared on numerous bestseller lists, including the USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists.\n\nThe success of the Fear Street series led to the creation of several spin-off series, including the Fear Street Sagas and Ghosts of Fear Street. These series feature similar storylines and characters, but with a focus on specific themes or subplots.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Viacom Productions signed a development deal with Parachute Entertainment to produce a primetime TV series based on the Fear Street books. However, the project was ultimately cancelled, and a pilot episode for the series, titled Ghosts of Fear Street, aired on ABC Television in 1998. The pilot episode was a commercial failure, but it remains a notable example of the Fear Street franchise's attempts to branch out into other media.\n\n**Film**\n\nIn 1997, Hollywood Pictures struck a deal to acquire the Fear Street series of books, which were set to be developed as a Scream-like feature franchise. However, the project was ultimately cancelled, and no Fear Street films were produced.\n\nDespite the lack of a film franchise, the Fear Street series remains one of the most popular and influential horror series of all time. Its success has inspired countless other young adult horror series, and its impact can still be seen in the horror genre today.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Fear Street series has had a lasting impact on the horror genre, and its influence can still be seen in many modern horror series and films. The series' focus on suspense and the supernatural has helped to shape the horror genre into what it is today, and its popularity has spawned countless imitators and spin-offs.\n\nIn addition to its impact on the horror genre, the Fear Street series has also been praised for its ability to tackle complex themes and issues, such as teenage angst, peer pressure, and the struggle for identity. The series' portrayal of these themes has helped to make it a beloved and relatable part of many readers' lives.\n\nOverall, the Fear Street series is a classic horror series that continues to captivate readers and inspire new generations of horror fans. Its legacy is a testament to the power of horror to entertain, suspense, and inspire, and its influence will be felt for years to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fear_Street\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot summary\nThe Fear Street books take place in the fictionalized town of Shadyside and feature average teenagers older than the typical Goosebumps preteens, who encounter malignant, sometimes paranormal, adversaries While some of the Fear Street novels have paranormal elements, such as ghosts, others are simply murder mysteries Whereas the Goosebumps books have a few tamed deaths, the deaths presented in Fear Street, particularly the sagas, are far more gruesome, with more blood and gore.\n\n\nSetting\nThe Fear Street series takes place in a town called Shadyside Much of the paranormal activity, the murders and other unexplained happenings occur either directly on Fear Street, in the woods surrounding the street or on Fear Island which sits in the middle of Fear Lake Contextual clues in the text suggest Shadyside is either in southern New England or a northern Mid-Atlantic state of the US For example, in book #3, The Overnight, a character mentions that he goes to BU \"up in Boston\", suggesting Shadyside is somewhere near Boston, but south of it [3]\n\n\nRelease\nThe first Fear Street book, The New Girl was published in 1989 Various spin-off series were written, including the Fear Street Sagas and Ghosts of Fear Street As of 2003 [update], more than 80 million Fear Street books have been sold [2] Individual books appeared in many bestseller lists, including the USA Today [11] and Publishers Weekly bestseller list [12]\n\n\nAdaptations\nAt some point before October 1997, Viacom Productions had signed a development deal with Parachute Entertainment to produce a primetime TV series based on the Fear Street books [18] Soon after Disney-owned ABC bought a Fear Street pilot The pilot episode for the unproduced Fear Street television series, titled Ghosts of Fear Street, aired on ABC Television on July 31, 1998 [19] [20] The pilot's airing  held 89% of its men 18–34 lead-in but just 55% of its women 18–34 lead-in The result was ABC's worst rating on record in that slot and a third-place finish for the night in homes and adults 18–49 [21]\n\n\nTelevision\nAt some point before October 1997, Viacom Productions had signed a development deal with Parachute Entertainment to produce a primetime TV series based on the Fear Street books [18] Soon after Disney-owned ABC bought a Fear Street pilot The pilot episode for the unproduced Fear Street television series, titled Ghosts of Fear Street, aired on ABC Television on July 31, 1998 [19] [20] The pilot's airing  held 89% of its men 18–34 lead-in but just 55% of its women 18–34 lead-in The result was ABC's worst rating on record in that slot and a third-place finish for the night in homes and adults 18–49 [21]\n\n\nFilm\nOn October 30, 1997, Variety reported Hollywood Pictures struck a deal to acquire the Fear Street series of books, which were set to be developed with Parachute Entertainment as a Scream-like feature franchise [18]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest sportscasters in baseball history.\n\nIntroduction\n\nVin Scully was born on November 29, 1927, in The Bronx, New York, to Vincent Aloysius Scully and Bridget (née Freehill). He grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where he developed a passion for sports and broadcasting. Scully's early life was marked by tragedy, with his biological father dying of pneumonia when he was just four years old. His mother later married an English merchant sailor named Allan Reeve, whom Scully considered \"my dad.\" Scully had one sibling, a younger sister who died of brain cancer in 2002, aged 67.\n\nEarly life\n\nScully attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx, where he developed his skills as a broadcaster and journalist. He worked delivering beer and mail, pushing garment racks and cleaning silver in the basement of the Pennsylvania Hotel in New York City, to support himself during his teenage years. After serving in the United States Navy for two years, Scully began his career as a student broadcaster and journalist at Fordham University, where he majored in English. While at Fordham, he helped found its FM radio station WFUV, which now presents a Vin Scully Lifetime Achievement Award each year. Scully was assistant sports editor for Volume 28 of The Fordham Ram his senior year, sang in a barbershop quartet, played center field for the Fordham Rams baseball team, called radio broadcasts for Rams baseball, football, and basketball, earned a degree, and sent about 150 letters to stations along the Eastern seaboard.

He received only one response, from CBS Radio affiliate WTOP in Washington, D.C., which hired him as a fill-in.\n\nDodgers (1950–2016)\n\nScully's career with the Dodgers began in 1950, when he replaced Ernie Harwell in the team's radio and television booths. He joined Connie Desmond and Red Barber in the broadcast booth, and quickly became a fan favorite. Scully's distinctive voice and play-by-play style made him a staple of Dodgers broadcasts, and he became known for his iconic opening line: \"It's time for Dodger baseball! Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant good afternoon/evening to you, wherever you may be.\"\n\nBrooklyn (1950–1957)\n\nScully's time with the Dodgers in Brooklyn was marked by some of the most memorable moments in baseball history. He called games at Ebbets Field, where the Dodgers won four National League pennants and one World Series championship. Scully's broadcasts were often accompanied by the sounds of the crowd, which made him a natural fit for the team's iconic radio broadcasts.\n\nLos Angeles (1958–2016)\n\nWhen the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, Scully was right behind them. He quickly became a fan favorite in Southern California, and his broadcasts were often accompanied by the sounds of the crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Even after the team moved to Dodger Stadium in 1962, Scully's broadcasts remained a staple of Dodgers baseball.\n\nCBS Sports (1975–1982)\n\nIn 1975, Scully joined CBS Sports, where he worked as a play-by-play announcer for the National Football League. He worked alongside several different color analysts, including Sonny Jurgensen, Paul Hornung, Alex Hawkins, George Allen, Jim Brown, John Madden, and Hank Stram. Scully called some of the most memorable games in NFL history, including Dwight Clark's touchdown catch in the NFC Championship Game on January 10, 1982.\n\nDeparture from CBS\n\nScully decided to leave CBS in favor of a job calling baseball games for NBC, following a dispute over assignment prominence. CBS decided to promote John Madden as the star color commentator of their NFL television coverage, but had trouble figuring out who was going to be his play-by-play partner. Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, and was calling games alongside Hank Stram, but was in a battle with Pat Summerall for the position.\n\nNBC Sports (1983–1989)\n\nScully joined NBC Sports in 1983, where he became the lead play-by-play announcer for their Major League Baseball coverage. He worked Saturday Game of the Week telecasts for NBC, and called three World Series, four National League Championship Series, and four All-Star Games. Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting the team's home games on radio and road games on television, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC.\n\nAfter NBC (1990–2016)\n\nAfter the National League Championship Series in 1989, Scully's NBC contract was up, and he left to focus primarily on his duties with the Dodgers. Scully also returned to being the national radio announcer for the World Series, teaming with Johnny Bench for the first four years and Jeff Torborg for the final three. Scully worked the event from 1990 through 1997.\n\nRetirement\n\nOn January 31, 2016, Scully announced that he planned to retire from broadcasting after the conclusion of the 2016 season. His final game was the team's October 2 finale at San Francisco. Scully left open the possibility of calling postseason games, but ultimately decided not to, stating that he did not want to \"say goodbye 12 different times.\"\n\nOther appearances\n\nScully was offered a chance to call play-by-play for the then-new Monday Night Football games in 1970, but his commitment to the Dodgers forced him to reject the offer.\n\nImpersonators\n\nHarry Shearer impersonated Scully in a sketch for Saturday Night Live, and has used the voice for The Simpsons when the storyline includes the fictional team the Springfield Isotopes.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nScully received the Ford Frick Award from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. He was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award for sportscasting, and was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995. The National Sports Media Association (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association) named Scully as National Sportscaster of the Year four times, and California Sportscaster of the Year 33 times.

He previously ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2017 and the U.S. Senate in 2020.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nJon Ossoff was born on February 16, 1987, in Atlanta, Georgia. His mother, Heather Fenton, is an Australian immigrant who was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. She immigrated to the United States at the age of 23 and co-founded NewPower PAC, an organization that works to elect women to local office across Georgia. His father, Richard Ossoff, is an attorney who owns Strafford Publications, a specialist publishing company, and who was active in the 1980s fight against the Presidential Parkway planned for intown Atlanta. Ossoff was raised Jewish and, due to his mother being a gentile, formally converted to the religion prior to his bar mitzvah. His ancestors fled pogroms in the early 20th century, and he noted in an interview that he grew up among Holocaust survivor relatives and detailed how this greatly influenced him and his worldviews. He previously held dual Australian citizenship through his mother.\n\n**Early career**\n\nAfter receiving a recommendation from John Lewis, Ossoff worked as a national security staffer and legislative assistant for foreign affairs and defense policy for U.S. representative Hank Johnson from 2007 to 2012. From 2013 to 2021, Ossoff was the managing director and chief executive officer of Insight: The World Investigates (TWI), a London-based investigative television production company that works with reporters to create documentaries about corruption in foreign countries. The firm produced BBC investigations about ISIS war crimes and death squads in East Africa. Ossoff was involved in producing a documentary about the staging of a play in Sierra Leone. Ossoff had previously received an inheritance of an unknown amount from his grandfather, a former co-owner of a Massachusetts leather factory, of which he used $250,000 to co-fund Insight: TWI alongside company founder and former BBC reporter Ron McCullagh, who first met Ossoff when he was 16 years old during a family vacation to France and with whom he kept in contact afterward.\n\n**2017 U.S. House campaign**\n\nAfter learning that Republican Tom Price of Georgia's 6th congressional district had been appointed secretary of health and human services by president-elect Donald Trump, Ossoff announced his candidacy for the special election on January 5, 2017. Ossoff quickly emerged as the most viable Democratic candidate out of a large field of candidates. He was endorsed by congressmen Hank Johnson and John Lewis, and state House Democratic leader Stacey Abrams.

(\"Cordeburg\", \"Cordesburwe\", \"Quordborough\", \"Cordborgh\", \"Corburg\", \"Coresburgh\" and \"Corber\") have the same meaning: Corda's fortified place The personal name \"Corda\" is uncertain, as there are several plausible origins for this name [13]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nApart from shrubs such as guelder rose and mezereon, primrose, lily of the valley, cowslip and dog's mercury characterize this habitat.\nA great number of birds such as dippers, robins, blackbirds, herons, pheasants, sparrows and great tit can be found there Birds of prey, for example, barn owl, buzzard, kestrel, little owl are among the components of the biological food chain \nOn land other animals such as highland cattle or grouse define this area [14]\n\n\nDeer rutting season\nThe rutting season for deer is between the middle of September and the middle of November These months are the most favorable to see the horned animal The area to watch the deer rut is between Curbar Edge and White Edge  For viewing or photographing deer in the area, it is mandatory to pay attention, and a distance of 196 ft (60 m) is suggested to not interfere with the normal rutting behavior of the animal

training location [16] Curbar Edge is located in Derbyshire which was within the delta of a vast stream that deposited sand and dust across southern Britain Because of currents and tides, muds deposited in deeper water became shales, and sands became gritstone [17]\n\n\nHistory\nSome of the earliest known climbing activity was by Peak District pioneer, Jim Puttrell and the Kyndwr Club They are known to have attempted a very early climb on Curbar in the 1900s, finally ascended by Chapman and Thomsett of the Polaris Mountaineering club in 1948 and now called PMC/1 [28]\n\n\nPrehistory\nA range of prehistoric remains is located in the area around Curbar Edge Ancient cairns exist to the east near Froggatt Edge and to the west in Stoke Flat West The East Moors in Derbyshire also has one of the largest preserved prehistoric field systems, settlement sites, and ceremonial stone circles These remains allowed archaeologists to be able to determine an occupation date from the Bronze Age [20]\n\n\nPost Roman\nThe Romans are believed to be the first to exploit the natural gritstone resources of Curbar Edge Curbar Gap at the southern end of the edge is crossed by a Roman road, providing easy access for quarrying the local stone [24] The Curbar Edge quarries are one of 4 areas in Derbyshire where millstone was produced The millstones from Derbyshire were used to produce grey flour which is the reason that they only were used to produce animal feeds The diameter of the milestone was usually 5.9 ft (1.8 m), and its weight was around 2.4 t (2.6 tons) There are many assumed quarries around Derbyshire and Curbar Edge Exact quarry locations are often unknown, as marks on the stones indicate that many were moved from the excavation sites and subsequently worked on nearby A large number of these quarries occur near old routes for the transportation of millstones The millstone production on Curbar Edge came to an end around the year 1811 [25] Stone extraction from rocks was performed on a small scale and would lead to the manual perforation of the rock, then used to grind grain [26]\n\n\nRock climbing\nSome of the earliest known climbing activity was by Peak District

climbing in the Peak District for the practice of both traditional rock climbing and Bouldering  There are no sport climbing routes on the edge, because of local ethics and policies defined by bodies such as the British Mountaineering Council and the Peak District National Park By 1999 there were over 150 different named rock climbing routes on Curbar Edge, in addition to a wide range of bouldering problem routes on the edge and adjacent boulders [28] The length of the routes range from 20 to 79 ft (6.1 to 24.1 m) The difficulty of routes range in traditional UK Grade (climbing) from Easy (E) to Extreme (E1 - E10), and include routes with some of the hardest technical traditional and bouldering grades in the world (including Doctor Dolittle, graded E10 7a, and Detox, graded V11) [31] In July 2015, three routes at Curbar (Dr Dolittle, The Zone, and Knockin' on Heavens Door) were ranked in the top 20 hardest traditional climbs in the UK [32]\nSome examples of indicative climbs are (from the easiest to the hardest): [33]\n\n\nGuides\nThe rock climbing on Curbar Edge has been widely documented in journals, magazines, books, dedicated guidebooks, and websites The Edge was omitted from the earliest Gritstone rock climbing guides, Laycock's Some Gritstone Climbs, published in 1913, and Fergus Graham's Recent Developments on Gritstone, [34] published in 1924, because of access restrictions related to the neighboring grouse moors Early climbs were originally published privately in the pages of climbing club journals  These were collated in the Climbs on Gritstone series of regional guides, starting in the 1950s, notably in sections by Wilf White in 1951 in Climbs on Gritstone: Sheffield Area, [35] and by White and Sorrell in 1957 in Further Developments in the Peak District [36]\n\n\nOther activities\nThe Eastern Moors are unsettled partly because of the setting aside of this region in the 19th century, by giant estates, for grouse shooting [40] Grouse hunting has been practised in the area for centuries, but can now only take place in some areas not owned by the National Park Authority Since 1981 sports shooting has not been allowed on its properties, which correspond to 4–5% of the land.\n\n\nGrouse shooting\nThe Eastern Moors are unsettled partly because of the setting aside of this region in the 19th century, by giant estates, for

The edge is part of a long series of west-facing gritstone escarpments, collectively known as the Eastern Grit. The area is characterized by peat moorland and gritstone rock, and is known for its unique geological and cultural heritage.\n\n**Geography**\n\nCurbar Edge is situated in the Dark Peak, an area characterized by peat moorland and gritstone rock. The edge is one of a long series of west-facing gritstone escarpments, collectively known as the Eastern Grit. The ground is uneven due to the presence of the Big Moor, a large area of peat bog.\n\n**Location**\n\nCurbar Edge is located near the village of Grindleford, which is accessible by public transportation. The edge is also close to other notable locations, including Padley Gorge, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and Linacre Reservoirs, a series of reservoirs built between 1855 and 1904.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Curbar\" and its various derivatives, such as \"Cordeburg\", \"Cordesburwe\", and \"Quordborough\", all have the same meaning: \"Corda's fortified place\". The personal name \"Corda\" is uncertain, with several plausible origins.\n\n**Flora and Fauna**\n\nThe habitat of Curbar Edge is characterized by shrubs such as guelder rose and mezereon, as well as primrose, lily of the valley, cowslip, and dog's mercury. The area is also home to a wide variety of birds, including dippers, robins, blackbirds, herons, pheasants, sparrows, and great tits. Birds of prey, such as barn owls, buzzards, kestrels, and little owls, are also present in the area. On land, animals such as highland cattle and grouse are found in the area.\n\n**Deer Rutting Season**\n\nThe rutting season for deer in the area is between the middle of September and the middle of November. This is the most favorable time to see the horned animals. The area to watch the deer rut is between Curbar Edge and White Edge. When viewing or photographing deer, it is essential to maintain a safe distance of at least 196 feet to avoid interfering with their normal behavior.\n\n**Geology**\n\nExposures of the Chatsworth Grit and the Crawshaw Sandstone, based on the Pennine Lower Coal Measures, can be found on Curbar Edge. The edge has been used as a British Geological Survey (BGS) mapping training location due to its unique geological features.\n\n**History**\n\nSome of the earliest known climbing activity on Curbar Edge was by Peak District pioneer Jim Puttrell and the Kyndwr Club in the 1900s. They attempted a climb on the edge, which was finally completed by Chapman and Thomsett of the Polaris Mountaineering club in 1948 and is now known as PMC/1.\n\n**Prehistory**\n\nA range of prehistoric remains can be found in the area around Curbar Edge. Ancient cairns exist to the east near Froggatt Edge and to the west in Stoke Flat West. The East Moors in Derbyshire also feature one of the largest preserved prehistoric field systems, settlement sites, and ceremonial stone circles. These remains have allowed archaeologists to determine an occupation date from the Bronze Age.\n\n**Post Roman**\n\nThe Romans are believed to have been the first to exploit the natural gritstone resources of Curbar Edge. A Roman road crosses the southern end of the edge, providing easy access for quarrying the local stone. The Curbar Edge quarries are one of four areas in Derbyshire where millstone was produced. The millstones from Derbyshire were used to produce grey flour, which was only used to make animal feed. The diameter of the milestone was usually 5.9 feet, and its weight was around 2.4 tons. Millstone production on Curbar Edge ceased around 1811.\n\n**Rock Climbing**\n\nCurbar Edge is a major location for rock climbing in the Peak District. It is known for its traditional rock climbing and bouldering routes. There are over 150 named rock climbing routes on the edge, as well as a wide range of bouldering problem routes on the edge and adjacent boulders.

The edge was omitted from early Gritstone rock climbing guides due to access restrictions related to neighboring grouse moors. Early climbs were originally published privately in the pages of climbing club journals, which were later collated in the Climbs on Gritstone series of regional guides.\n\n**Other Activities**\n\nThe Eastern Moors are unsettled partly due to the setting aside of this region in the 19th century for grouse shooting. Grouse hunting has been practiced in the area for centuries, but can now only take place in some areas not owned by the National Park Authority. Since 1981, sports shooting has not been allowed on National Park properties, which correspond to 4-5% of the land.\n\n**Walking**\n\nThe path along Curbar Edge is part of several long-distance walks, including the 25-mile Eastern Edges of the Peak District. The path reaches Froggatt Edge, White Edge, and Curbar Edge, and passes through the villages of Curbar, Froggatt, Calver, and Grindleford.\n\n**Cycling**\n\nCurbar Edge is also a popular location for cycling. The average gradient of this route is 10%, while the peak gradient is 15.2%. The difference in elevation from the starting point to the end is 597.1 feet.

[20]\n\n\nPost Roman\nThe Romans are believed to be the first to exploit the natural gritstone resources of Curbar Edge Curbar Gap at the southern end of the edge is crossed by a Roman road, providing easy access for quarrying the local stone [24] The Curbar Edge quarries are one of 4 areas in Derbyshire where millstone was produced The millstones from Derbyshire were used to produce grey flour which is the reason that they only were used to produce animal feeds The diameter of the milestone was usually 5.9 ft (1.8 m), and its weight was around 2.4 t (2.6 tons) There are many assumed quarries around Derbyshire and Curbar Edge Exact quarry locations are often unknown, as marks on the stones indicate that many were moved from the excavation sites and subsequently worked on nearby A large number of these quarries occur near old routes for the transportation of millstones The millstone production on Curbar Edge came to an end around the year 1811 [25] Stone extraction from rocks was performed on a small scale and would lead to the manual perforation of the rock, then used to grind grain [26]\n\n\nRock climbing\nSome of the earliest known climbing activity was by Peak District pioneer, Jim Puttrell and the Kyndwr Club They are known to have attempted a very early climb on Curbar in the 1900s, finally ascended by Chapman and Thomsett of the Polaris Mountaineering club in 1948 and now called PMC/1 [28]\n\n\nHistory\nSome of the earliest known climbing activity was by Peak District pioneer, Jim Puttrell and the Kyndwr Club They are known to have attempted a very early

climbing in the Peak District for the practice of both traditional rock climbing and Bouldering  There are no sport climbing routes on the edge, because of local ethics and policies defined by bodies such as the British Mountaineering Council and the Peak District National Park By 1999 there were over 150 different named rock climbing routes on Curbar Edge, in addition to a wide range of bouldering problem routes on the edge and adjacent boulders [28] The length of the routes range from 20 to 79 ft (6.1 to 24.1 m) The difficulty of routes range in traditional UK Grade (climbing) from Easy (E) to Extreme (E1 - E10), and include routes with some of the hardest technical traditional and bouldering grades in the world (including Doctor Dolittle, graded E10 7a, and Detox, graded V11) [31] In July 2015, three routes at Curbar (Dr Dolittle, The Zone, and Knockin' on Heavens Door) were ranked in the top 20 hardest traditional climbs in the UK [32]\nSome examples of indicative climbs are (from the easiest to the hardest): [33]\n\n\nGuides\nThe rock climbing on Curbar Edge has been widely documented in journals, magazines, books, dedicated guidebooks, and websites The Edge was omitted from the earliest Gritstone rock climbing guides, Laycock's Some Gritstone Climbs, published in 1913, and Fergus Graham's Recent Developments on Gritstone, [34] published in 1924, because of access restrictions related to the neighboring grouse moors Early climbs were originally published privately in the pages of climbing club journals  These were collated in the Climbs on Gritstone series of regional guides, starting in the 1950s, notably in sections by Wilf White in 1951 in Climbs on Gritstone: Sheffield Area, [35] and by White and Sorrell in 1957 in Further Developments in the Peak District [36]\n\n\nOther activities\nThe Eastern Moors are unsettled partly because of the setting aside of this region in the 19th century, by giant estates, for grouse shooting [40] Grouse hunting has been practised in the area for centuries, but can now only take place in some areas not owned by the National Park Authority Since 1981 sports shooting has not been allowed on its properties, which correspond to 4–5% of the land.\n\n\nGrouse shooting\nThe Eastern Moors are unsettled partly because of the setting aside of this region in the 19th century, by giant estates, for

{"title": "2021_German_federal_election", "content": "\nBackground\nThe 2017 federal election was held after a four-year grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD Though the CDU/CSU remained the biggest parliamentary group, both it and the SPD suffered significant losses The SPD leadership, recognising the party's unsatisfactory performance after four years in government, announced that it would go into opposition [2] With the CDU/CSU having pledged not to work with either the AfD or The Left before the federal election, the only remaining option for a majority government was a Jamaica coalition consisting of the CDU/CSU, FDP, and the Greens [3] [4] Exploratory talks between the parties were held over the next six weeks, though the FDP withdrew from the negotiations on 20 November, citing irreconcilable differences between the parties on migration and energy policies [5] [6] Chancellor Angela Merkel consulted with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who implored all parties to reconsider in order to avoid fresh elections [7] [8]\n\n\n2017 federal election and government formation\nThe 2017 federal election was held after a four-year grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD Though the CDU/CSU remained the biggest parliamentary group, both it and the SPD suffered significant losses The SPD leadership, recognising the party's unsatisfactory performance after four years in government, announced that it would go into opposition [2] With the CDU/CSU having pledged not to work with either the AfD or The Left before the federal election, the only remaining option for a majority government was a Jamaica coalition consisting of the CDU/CSU, FDP, and the Greens [3] [4] Exploratory talks between the parties were held over the next six weeks, though the FDP withdrew from the negotiations on 20 November, citing irreconcilable differences between the parties on migration and energy policies [5] [6] Chancellor Angela Merkel consulted with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who implored all parties to reconsider in order to avoid fresh elections [7] [8]\n\n\nParty leadership changes and political instability\nMerkel's final government was subject to intense instability The 2018 German government crisis saw the longstanding alliance between the CDU and CSU threaten to split over asylum seeker policy Interior Minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to undercut Merkel's authority by closing German borders for asylum seekers registered in another European Union (EU) country The split, eventually repaired following a summit with EU countries, threatened to bring down the government [20] Following his party's historically low result in the 2018 Bavarian state election, Seehofer was replaced as CSU leader by new Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder at a party conference in January 2019, while he retained his position as Interior Minister in the Fourth Merkel cabinet [21]\n\n\nElectoral system\nGermany uses the mixed-member proportional representation system, a system of proportional representation combined with elements of first-past-the-post voting The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term; these seats are distributed between the sixteen German states in proportion to the states' number of eligible voters [34]\n\n\nDate assignment process\nThe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Election Act provides that federal elections must be held on a Sunday or on a federal holiday [f] no earlier than 46 and no later than 48 months after the first sitting of the preceding session, unless a snap election is called or a state of defence is declared [36] Under this rule, the 2021 federal election had to take place on a Sunday between 29 August and 24 October (inclusive), as the previous 19th Bundestag had held its first sitting on 24 October 2017 [37] The President of Germany sets the exact date for the election [38] On 9 December 2020, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier ordered the election to be held on 26 September 2021 [39]\n\n\nObservers and false claims of voter fraud\nFor the fourth time since 2009, the 2021 federal election was observed by OSCE, [40] providing four experts from three OSCE states [41]\n\n\nPolitical parties and candidates\nThe table below lists the parliamentary groups of the 19th Bundestag.\n\n\nLead candidates\nAfter the election of Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet as federal CDU chairman in January 2021, he became the presumptive CDU nominee for the Union's joint chancellor candidacy Laschet was challenged by Minister-President of Bavaria Markus Söder of the CSU, who consistently polled well among voters and had been discussed as a potential candidate since mid-2020 [43] As the contest intensified in March/April 2021, Söder was backed by the CSU as well as some state and local CDU associations, while Laschet received the support of most of the CDU The two men failed to come to an agreement by the given deadline of 19 April, [44] leading the federal CDU board to hold an impromptu meeting to break the deadlock The board voted 31 to 9 in favour of Laschet [45] After the vote, Söder announced his support for Laschet as chancellor candidate [46]\n\n\nCompeting parties\nA total of 47 parties and lists were approved to run in the 2021 federal election, including the seven which won seats in the 19th Bundestag Of these, 40 ran party lists in at least one state, while 7 ran only direct candidates In addition, 196 independent candidates ran in the various direct constituencies [57]\n\n\nRegistration of candidates\nIn July 2021, the respective state electoral committees rejected the lists of the AfD in Bremen and the Greens in Saarland The AfD list was rejected for formal reasons, while the Green list in Saarland was declared invalid due to a controversial nomination process, in which one third of the state delegates were excluded from the nomination convention Both state parties filed motions against the rulings The federal electoral committee dismissed the motion of the Saarland Greens, while the AfD list in Bremen was permitted to run in the elections The Green Party will thus not be eligible for the proportional vote in Saarland for the first time in the party's history [58]\n\n\nCampaign\nThe federal election was impacted by incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to run again, [59] and candidates to present themselves as the natural successor to Merkel [60]\n\n\nMajor issues\nThe federal election was impacted by incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to run again, [59] and candidates to present themselves as the natural successor to Merkel [60]\n\n\nRed–red–green coalition\nDuring the campaign, Scholz rejected tax cuts for the rich as immoral, [66] pledged to \"increase taxes on the wealthy, spend on cleaner technology and expand social programs\", [67] and a minimum wage increase to 12 euros [68] In general, there was broad agreement among left-leaning parties on issues such as climate change, education, finance, health, and higher taxes for the rich, and The Left being more pro-European than similar left-wing parties like La France Insoumise, [69] while issues of disagreement were foreign policy and security [70] Writing for The Guardian, Philip Oltermann commented: \"Paradoxically, some Social Democrats see such commonalities as an obstacle rather than a boon for an effective power-sharing deal: since all three parties already call for a wealth tax, for example, it's unclear what policy Die Linke could sell its supporters as a win even if were to get its hands on the coveted labour ministry.\" [69] Both the SPD and the Greens did not speak much on the subject but did not rule it out in public, although in private they were more sceptics One SPD delegate was quoted as saying: \"To prepare the ground for a robust and functioning coalition, you need to make sure that no one walks out of talks looking like a loser That's difficult enough with two, but it becomes even more difficult when you have three partners.\" [69] Oltermann posited that The Left could see entering federal government as \"a final chance to reverse the party's decline, even if it means moving some of its red lines of old.\" [69]\n\n\nDebates\nFor the first time since 2002, the four major television broadcasters (public services ZDF and ARD with its regional networks, and commercial networks RTL and ProSieben/Sat.1) did not hold a joint television debate of the major candidates from CDU/CSU and SPD Separate debates were previously prevented by incumbent chancellor Merkel, who in 2021 did not run for re-election \n\n\nMembers of Parliament standing down\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling:\n\n\nAfD\nThe AfD lost seats and went from the third largest party and Leader of the Opposition to the fifth largest party in the Bundestag; however, they performed strongly in former East Germany, where they won 16 single-member constituency seats in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia [243] [244] While the AfD lost vote share in Saxony, the stronger losses of the CDU still allowed them to place ahead of the CDU, becoming the most voted party in Saxony They also won the most party list votes in Thuringia, though only by 0.6%.\n\n\nCDU/CSU\nThe CDU/CSU had their worst result ever by far, eclipsing the previous worst of 31% in 1949 Many prominent politicians were defeated in their single-member constituency seats, including ministers Altmaier, Helge Braun, Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Julia Klöckner as well as Hans-Georg Maaßen and Philipp Amthor, though all of them except Maaßen were still elected to the Bundestag via their respective state party lists [214] [i] There was speculation that chancellor candidate Armin Laschet would lose election to the Bundestag; [215] he was placed first on the North Rhine-Westphalia party list, and if the CDU gained overhang seats, that list would not be used Due to the CDU's bad performance in terms of single-member constituency seats, Laschet was elected to the Bundestag [216] The first time since 2005 that they did not win all single-member constituency seats in Bavaria, the CSU also had their worst result in history [217]\n\n\nSPD\nThe SPD had their best result since 2005 at 25%; it was also the first time since 2002 that they emerged as the largest party in the Bundestag For the first time since 2002, the SPD swept all single-member constituency seats in the states of Brandenburg and Saarland, where they defeated cabinet ministers Peter Altmaier and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer [200] They also won all constituencies in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern for the first time, including Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I, the seat of outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel [201] It was also the first time they won any single-member constituency seats in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia since 2005 [202] [203] [204]\n\n\nFDP\nThe FDP had their second best showing since German reunification, gaining a few seats to maintain its fourth-place position [240] This was enough to make it a kingmaker alongside the Greens in coalition talks [241]\n\n\nGreens\nThe Greens got their best result in history, nearly doubling from 2017 This was also the first federal election in which they won single-member constituency seats outside of Berlin-Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg – Prenzlauer Berg East; however, expectations for them were a lot higher, with them polling at over 20% in the summer and peaking at around 25%, having briefly overtaken the CDU in April and May [234] [235] Their slump in the polls was largely attributed to a number of gaffes from and the personal unpopularity of Annalena Baerbock, [236] though polls show that a lot of Green voters migrated to the SPD in the final weeks of the campaign to ensure the CDU would not form government [237]\n\n\nThe Left\nThe Left had their worst showing since 2002, when it was the Party of Democratic Socialism, slumping from 69 seats in 2017 to just 39, or 4.9% While they fell just short of the 5% election threshold they won three dozen extras seats as they had won three single-member constituency seats (two in their stronghold in the former East Berlin, down from four, and one in Saxony), entitling them to proportional representation in the Bundestag according to their second votes [247] Under a longstanding electoral law intended to benefit parties with regional appeal (as is the case with the Left in the old East Germany), any party that wins at least three constituency seats is entitled to its share of proportionally-elected seats, regardless of vote share [248]\n\n\nIndependents\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling:\n\n\nOpinion polls\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling:\n\n\nPoll trackers\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling:\n\n\nResults\nAlthough the vote share of the South Schleswig Voters' Association (0.12%) was well below the 5% electoral threshold, due to its status of being representative of a recognised minority group (Danes and Frisians), an exception in federal law allowed the party to win one party-list seat.\n\n\nResults by

referendum The Federal Returning Officer felt compelled to request a report from the State Returning Officer Petra Michaelis [192]\n\n\nAnalysis and aftermath\nThe SPD had their best result since 2005 at 25%; it was also the first time since 2002 that they emerged as the largest party in the Bundestag For the first time since 2002, the SPD swept all single-member constituency seats in the states of

Germany), any party that wins at least three constituency seats is entitled to its share of proportionally-elected seats, regardless of vote share [248]\n\n\nEthnic minorities\nIn terms of representation of ethnic minorities, one source suggested that the Bundestag would have 24 new MPs with \"Balkan\" ancestry Its list included, however, largely people of Turkish ancestry who mostly have roots in Anatolia [261] The South Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW), a regionalist party only contesting Schleswig-Holstein representing the Danish and Frisian minorities in Southern Schleswig, won their first seat, becoming the first regionalist party to win seats since 1953 [262] Recognized minority parties are exempt from the threshold of 5%, which is how the SSW won a seat with 0.1% of the vote nationwide [j] The SSW last contested in 1961 and last won a seat in 1949 [263] They named a felt discrimination of Northern Germany as reason for them contesting the election [264] Stefan Seidler was seated as their Member of the German Bundestag [265] Seidler was offered to sit in the SPD parliamentary group as a guest by their leader Rolf Mützenich, but declined [266]\n\n\nMinor parties\nMinor parties did exceptionally well in the 2021 election The left-wing satire party Die PARTEI had their best result ever, as did the Animal Protection Party and the regionalist Free Voters, which doubled their result and received 7.5% in Bavaria, where they take part in the state government A few new minor parties emerged in the 2021 election, the most notable being the Anti-lockdown and Anti-vaccination dieBasis party, which received between 1 and 1.9% Team Todenhöfer, founded in 2020 by notorious former CDU Member of the German Bundestag Jürgen Todenhöfer, also first contested the 2021 election, running on Anti-militarism and receiving support from pro-Palestinian groups, but only garnered 0.5% of the vote The 2021 election also accelerated the decline of the far-right National Democratic Party, which only got 0.1% of the vote The NPD was at a time the most successful minor/fringe party, getting 1.6% in 2005 and entering various state parliaments in former East Germany.\n\n\nGovernment formation\nA three-party governing coalition, with the FDP and the Greens joining either the SPD or CDU/CSU, was discussed as a likely outcome [267] [268] While the grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD could have been renewed, numerous representatives of both the CDU/CSU and the SPD ruled out this option before the federal election, [269] during the campaign, [270] [271] and after [272] [273] On election night, SPD leader Scholz reiterated his goal to form a government, citing the fact that his party emerged as the largest in parliament [274] He expressed his intention to become chancellor and his preference for a traffic light coalition with the FDP and the Greens [275] Leading figures in the CDU/CSU such as Michael Kretschmer stated that since the CDU/CSU was knocked down to second place, it should not form the government [276] The FDP and the Greens, having won 210 seats between them, announced that they would talk separately before deciding on whom to support as a senior coalition partner [277] The Greens and the FDP held discussions for two days after the election [278] On 7 October, the two parties met with the SPD for the first round of exploratory talks, [279] with a second round on 11 October [280] On 15 October, the SPD agreed to more ambitious climate targets, as pledged by the Greens [281] On 17 October, the Greens voted to enter formal coalition talks with the SPD and FDP [282] The next day, the FDP voted to do the same [283] The 20th Bundestag was officially sworn in on 26 October [284]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The 2021 German federal election was held on 26 September 2021. It was the 20th federal election in Germany since the end of World War II and the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic. The election was contested by 47 parties and lists, with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), forming the largest party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Alliance '90/The Greens.\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2017 federal election was held after a four-year grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. The CDU/CSU remained the biggest parliamentary group, but both parties suffered significant losses. The SPD leadership, recognising the party's unsatisfactory performance after four years in government, announced that it would go into opposition. With the CDU/CSU having pledged not to work with either the Alternative for Germany (AfD) or The Left before the federal election, the only remaining option for a majority government was a Jamaica coalition consisting of the CDU/CSU, FDP, and the Greens. Exploratory talks between the parties were held over the next six weeks, but the FDP withdrew from the negotiations on 20 November, citing irreconcilable differences between the parties on migration and energy policies.\n\n## Party leadership changes and political instability\n\nMerkel's final government was subject to intense instability. The 2018 German government crisis saw the longstanding alliance between the CDU and CSU threaten to split over asylum seeker policy.

Separate debates were previously prevented by incumbent chancellor Merkel, who in 2021 did not run for re-election.\n\n## Members of Parliament standing down\n\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling.\n\n## AfD\n\nThe AfD lost seats and went from the third-largest party and Leader of the Opposition to the fifth-largest party in the Bundestag; however, they performed strongly in former East Germany, where they won 16 single-member constituency seats in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia.\n\n## CDU/CSU\n\nThe CDU/CSU had their worst result ever by far, eclipsing the previous worst of 31% in 1949. Many prominent politicians were defeated in their single-member constituency seats, including ministers Altmaier, Helge Braun, Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Julia Klöckner as well as Hans-Georg Maaßen and Philipp Amthor, though all of them except Maaßen were still elected to the Bundestag via their respective state party lists.\n\n## SPD\n\nThe SPD had their best result since 2005 at 25%; it was also the first time since 2002 that they emerged as the largest party in the Bundestag. For the first time since 2002, the SPD swept all single-member constituency seats in the states of Brandenburg and Saarland, where they defeated cabinet ministers Peter Altmaier and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.\n\n## FDP\n\nThe FDP had their second-best showing since German reunification, gaining a few seats to maintain its fourth-place position. This was enough to make it a kingmaker alongside the Greens in coalition talks.\n\n## Greens\n\nThe Greens got their best result in history, nearly doubling from 2017. This was also the first federal election in which they won single-member constituency seats outside of Berlin-Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg – Prenzlauer Berg East; however, expectations for them were a lot higher, with them polling at over 20% in the summer and peaking at around 25%, having briefly overtaken the CDU in April and May.\n\n## The Left\n\nThe Left had their worst showing since 2002, when it was the Party of Democratic Socialism, slumping from 69 seats in 2017 to just 39, or 4.9%. While they fell just short of the 5% election threshold, they won three dozen extras seats as they had won three single-member constituency seats (two in their stronghold in the former East Berlin, down from four, and one in Saxony), entitling them to proportional representation in the Bundestag according to their second votes.\n\n## Ethnic minorities\n\nIn terms of representation of ethnic minorities, one source suggested that the Bundestag would have 24 new MPs with \"Balkan\" ancestry. Its list included, however, largely people of Turkish ancestry who mostly have roots in Anatolia. The South Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW), a regionalist party only contesting Schleswig-Holstein representing the Danish and Frisian minorities in Southern Schleswig, won their first seat, becoming the first regionalist party to win seats since 1953. Recognized minority parties are exempt from the threshold of 5%, which is how the SSW won a seat with 0.1% of the vote nationwide. The SSW last contested in 1961 and last won a seat in 1949. They named a felt discrimination of Northern Germany as reason for them contesting the election. Stefan Seidler was seated as their Member of the German Bundestag.\n\n## Minor parties\n\nMinor parties did exceptionally well in the 2021 election. The left-wing satire party Die PARTEI had their best result ever, as did the Animal Protection Party and the regionalist Free Voters, which doubled their result and received 7.5% in Bavaria, where they take part in the state government. A few new minor parties emerged in the 2021 election, the most notable being the Anti-lockdown and Anti-vaccination dieBasis party, which received between 1 and 1.9%. Team Todenhöfer, founded in 2020 by notorious former CDU Member of the German Bundestag Jürgen Todenhöfer, also first contested the 2021 election, running on Anti-militarism and receiving support from pro-Palestinian groups, but only garnered 0.5% of the vote. The 2021 election also accelerated the decline of the far-right National Democratic Party, which only got 0.1% of the vote. The NPD was at a time the most successful minor/fringe party, getting 1.6% in 2005 and entering various state parliaments in former East Germany.\n\n## Government formation\n\nA three-party governing coalition, with the FDP and the Greens joining either the SPD or CDU/CSU, was discussed as a likely outcome. While the grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD could have been renewed, numerous representatives of both the CDU/CSU and the SPD ruled out this option before the federal election, during the campaign, and after. On election night, SPD leader Scholz reiterated his goal to form a government, citing the fact that his party emerged as the largest in parliament. He expressed his intention to become chancellor and his preference for a traffic light coalition with the FDP and the Greens. Leading figures in the CDU/CSU such as Michael Kretschmer stated that since the CDU/CSU was knocked down to second place, it should not form the government. The FDP and the Greens, having won 210 seats between them, announced that they would talk separately before deciding on whom to support as a senior coalition partner. The Greens and the FDP held discussions for two days after the election. On 7 October, the two parties met with the SPD for the first round of exploratory talks, with a second round on 11 October. On 15 October, the SPD agreed to more ambitious climate targets, as pledged by the Greens. On 17 October, the Greens voted to enter formal coalition talks with the SPD and FDP. The next day, the FDP voted to do the same. The 20th Bundestag was officially sworn in on 26 October.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_German_federal_election\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe 2017 federal election was held after a four-year grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD Though the CDU/CSU remained the biggest parliamentary group, both it and the SPD suffered significant losses The SPD leadership, recognising the party's unsatisfactory performance after four years in government, announced that it would go into opposition [2] With the CDU/CSU having pledged not to work with either the AfD or The Left before the federal election, the only remaining option for a majority government was a Jamaica coalition consisting of the CDU/CSU, FDP, and the Greens [3] [4] Exploratory talks between the parties were held over the next six weeks, though the FDP withdrew from the negotiations on 20 November, citing irreconcilable differences between the parties on migration and energy policies [5] [6] Chancellor Angela Merkel consulted with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who implored all parties to reconsider in order to avoid fresh elections [7] [8]\n\n\n2017 federal election and government formation\nThe 2017 federal election was held after a four-year grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD Though the CDU/CSU remained the biggest parliamentary group, both it and the SPD suffered significant losses The SPD leadership, recognising the party's unsatisfactory performance after four years in government, announced that it would go into opposition [2] With the CDU/CSU having pledged not to work with either the AfD or The Left before the federal election, the only remaining option for a majority government was a

November, citing irreconcilable differences between the parties on migration and energy policies [5] [6] Chancellor Angela Merkel consulted with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who implored all parties to reconsider in order to avoid fresh elections [7] [8]\n\n\nParty leadership changes and political instability\nMerkel's final government was subject to intense instability The 2018 German government crisis saw the longstanding alliance between the CDU and CSU threaten to split over asylum seeker policy Interior Minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to undercut Merkel's authority by closing German borders for asylum seekers registered in another European Union (EU) country The split, eventually repaired following a summit with EU countries, threatened to bring down the government [20] Following his party's historically low result in the 2018 Bavarian state election, Seehofer was replaced as CSU leader by new Bavarian Minister-President Markus Söder at a party conference in January 2019, while he retained his position as Interior Minister in the Fourth Merkel cabinet [21]\n\n\nElectoral system\nGermany uses the mixed-member proportional representation system, a system of proportional representation combined with elements of first-past-the-post voting The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term; these seats are distributed between the sixteen German states in proportion to the states' number of eligible voters [34]\n\n\nDate assignment process\nThe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and the Federal Election Act provides that federal elections must be held on a Sunday or on a federal holiday [f] no earlier than 46 and no later than 48 months after the first sitting of the preceding session, unless a snap election is called or a state of defence is declared [36] Under this rule, the 2021 federal election had to take place on a Sunday between 29 August and 24 October (inclusive), as the previous 19th Bundestag had held its first sitting on 24 October 2017 [37] The President of Germany sets the exact date for the election [38] On 9 December 2020, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier ordered the election to be held on 26 September 2021 [39]\n\n\nObservers and false claims of voter fraud\nFor the fourth time since 2009, the 2021 federal election was observed by OSCE, [40] providing four experts from three OSCE states [41]\n\n\nPolitical parties and candidates\nThe table below lists the parliamentary groups of the 19th Bundestag.\n\n\nLead candidates\nAfter the election of Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet as federal CDU chairman in January 2021, he became the presumptive CDU nominee for the Union's joint chancellor candidacy Laschet was challenged by Minister-President of Bavaria Markus Söder of the CSU, who consistently polled well among voters and had been discussed as a potential candidate since mid-2020 [43] As the contest intensified in March/April 2021, Söder was backed by the CSU as well as some state and local CDU associations, while Laschet received the support of most of the CDU The two men failed to come to an agreement by the given deadline of 19 April, [44] leading the federal CDU board to hold an impromptu meeting to break the deadlock The board voted 31 to 9 in favour of Laschet [45] After the vote, Söder announced his support for Laschet as chancellor candidate [46]\n\n\nCompeting parties\nA total of 47 parties and lists were approved to run in the 2021 federal election, including the seven which won seats in the 19th Bundestag Of these, 40 ran party lists in at least one state, while 7 ran only direct candidates In addition, 196 independent candidates ran in the various direct constituencies [57]\n\n\nRegistration of candidates\nIn July 2021, the respective state electoral committees rejected the lists of the AfD in Bremen and the Greens in Saarland The AfD list was rejected for formal reasons, while the Green list in Saarland was declared invalid due to a controversial nomination process, in which one third of the state delegates were excluded from the nomination convention Both state parties filed motions against the rulings The federal electoral committee dismissed the motion of the Saarland Greens, while the AfD list in Bremen was permitted to run in the elections The Green Party will thus not be eligible for the proportional vote in Saarland for the first time in the party's history [58]\n\n\nCampaign\nThe federal election was impacted by incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to run again, [59] and candidates to present themselves as the natural successor to Merkel [60]\n\n\nMajor issues\nThe federal election was impacted by incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to run again, [59] and candidates to present themselves as the natural successor to Merkel [60]\n\n\nRed–red–green coalition\nDuring the campaign, Scholz rejected tax cuts for the rich as immoral, [66] pledged to \"increase taxes on the wealthy, spend on cleaner technology and expand social programs\", [67] and a minimum wage increase to 12 euros [68] In general, there was broad agreement among left-leaning parties on issues such as climate change, education, finance, health, and higher taxes for the rich, and The Left being more pro-European than similar left-wing parties like La France Insoumise, [69] while issues of disagreement were foreign policy and security [70] Writing for The Guardian, Philip Oltermann commented: \"Paradoxically, some Social Democrats see such commonalities as an obstacle rather than a boon for an effective power-sharing deal: since all three parties already call for a wealth tax, for example, it's unclear what policy Die Linke could sell its supporters as a win even if were to get its hands on the coveted labour ministry.\" [69] Both the SPD and the Greens did not speak much on the subject but did not rule it out in public, although in private they were more sceptics One SPD delegate was quoted as saying: \"To prepare the ground for a robust and functioning coalition, you need to make sure that no one walks out of talks looking like a loser That's difficult enough with two, but it becomes even more difficult when you have three partners.\" [69] Oltermann posited that The Left could see entering federal government as \"a final chance to reverse the party's decline, even if it means moving some of its red lines of old.\" [69]\n\n\nDebates\nFor the first time since 2002, the four major television broadcasters (public services ZDF and ARD with its regional networks, and commercial networks RTL and ProSieben/Sat.1) did not hold a joint television debate of the major candidates from CDU/CSU and SPD Separate debates were previously prevented by incumbent chancellor Merkel, who in 2021 did not run for re-election \n\n\nMembers of Parliament standing down\nTrackers of voting intentions and other election-related polling:\n\n\nAfD\nThe AfD lost seats and went from the third largest party and Leader of the Opposition to the fifth largest party in the Bundestag; however, they performed strongly in former East Germany, where they won 16 single-member constituency seats in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia [243] [244] While the AfD lost vote share in Saxony, the stronger losses of the CDU still allowed them to place ahead of the CDU, becoming the most voted party in Saxony They also won the most party list votes in Thuringia, though only by 0.6%.\n\n\nCDU/CSU\nThe CDU/CSU had their worst result ever by far, eclipsing the previous worst of 31% in 1949 Many prominent politicians were defeated in their single-member constituency seats, including ministers Altmaier, Helge Braun, Kramp-Karrenbauer, and Julia Klöckner as well as Hans-Georg Maaßen and Philipp Amthor, though all of them except Maaßen were still elected to the Bundestag via their respective state party lists [214] [i] There was speculation that chancellor candidate Armin Laschet would lose election to the Bundestag; [215] he was placed first on the North Rhine-Westphalia party list, and if the CDU gained overhang seats, that list would not be used Due to the CDU's bad performance in terms of single-member constituency seats, Laschet was elected to the Bundestag [216] The first time since 2005 that they did not win all single-member constituency seats in Bavaria, the CSU also had their worst result in history [217]\n\n\nSPD\nThe SPD had their best result since 2005 at 25%; it was also the first time since 2002 that they emerged as the largest party in the Bundestag For the first time since 2002, the SPD swept all single-member constituency

for the first time, including Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I, the seat of outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel [201] It was also the first time they won any single-member constituency seats in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia since 2005 [202] [203] [204]\n\n\nFDP\nThe FDP had their second best showing since German reunification, gaining a few seats to maintain its fourth-place position [240]

over 20% in the summer and peaking at around 25%, having briefly overtaken the CDU in April and May [234] [235] Their slump in the polls was largely attributed to a number of gaffes from and the personal unpopularity of Annalena Baerbock, [236] though polls show that a lot of Green voters migrated to the SPD in the final weeks of the campaign to ensure the CDU would not form government [237]\n\n\nThe Left\nThe Left had their worst showing since 2002, when it was the Party of Democratic Socialism, slumping from 69 seats in 2017 to just 39, or 4.9% While they fell just short of the 5%

{"title": "Anglo-Saxons", "content": "\nEthnonym\nIn modern times, the term \"Anglo-Saxons\" is used by scholars to refer collectively to the Old English speaking groups in Britain As a compound term it has the advantage of covering the various English-speaking groups on the one hand, and to avoid possible misunderstandings from using the terms \"Saxons\" or \"Angles\" (English), both of which terms could be used either as collectives referring to all the Old English speakers, or to specific tribal groups Although the term \"Anglo Saxon\" was not used as a common term until modern times, it is not a modern invention because it was also used in some specific contexts already between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon origins (4th–6th centuries)\nAlthough it involved immigrant communities from northern Europe, the culture of the Anglo-Saxons was not transplanted from there, but rather developed in Britain [9] In 400, the Roman province of Britannia had long been part of the Roman Empire Although the empire had been dismembered several times during the previous centuries, often because of usurpations beginning in Britain such as those of Magnus Maximus, and Constantine \"III\" there was an overall continuity and interconnectedness Already before 400 Roman sources used the term Saxons to refer to coastal raiders who had been causing problems especially on the coasts of the North Sea In what is now south-eastern England the Romans established a military commander who was assigned to oversee a chain of coastal forts which they called the Saxon shore [10] The homeland of these Saxon raiders was not clearly described in surviving sources but they were apparently the northerly neighbours of the Franks on the Lower Rhine [11] At the same time, the Roman administration in Britain (and other parts of the empire) was recruiting foederati soldiers from the same general regions in what is now Germany, and these are likely to have become more important after the withdrawal of field armies during internal Roman power struggles [12]\n\n\nChristianity and the early kingdoms\nFrom the time of the Christian conversions the first well-attested English kings and kingdoms appear in the written record This situation with a small number of kingdoms competing for dominance is traditionally called the Heptarchy, which indicates a period of seven kingdoms There were however more than seven kingdoms, and their interactions were quite complex \n\n\nMiddle Anglo-Saxon history (660–899)\nBy 660, the political map of Lowland Britain had developed with smaller territories coalescing into kingdoms, and from this time larger kingdoms started dominating the smaller kingdoms The development of kingdoms, with a particular king being recognised as an overlord, developed out of an early loose structure that, Higham believes, is linked back to the original feodus [28] The traditional name for this period is the Heptarchy, which has not been used by scholars since the early 20th century [29] as it gives the impression of a single political structure and does not afford the \"opportunity to treat the history of any one kingdom as a whole\" [30] Simon Keynes suggests that the 8th and 9th century was a period of economic and social flourishing which created stability both below the Thames and above the Humber [30]\n\n\nMercian supremacy (626–821)\nMiddle-lowland Britain was known as the place of the Mierce, the border or frontier folk, in Latin Mercia Mercia was a diverse area of tribal groups, as shown by the Tribal Hidage; the peoples were a mixture of Brittonic speaking peoples and \"Anglo-Saxon\" pioneers and their early leaders had Brittonic names, such as Penda [31] Although Penda does not appear in Bede's list of great overlords, it would appear from what Bede says elsewhere that he was dominant over the southern kingdoms At the time of the battle of the river Winwæd, thirty duces regii (royal generals) fought on his behalf Although there are many gaps in the evidence, it is clear that the seventh-century Mercian kings were formidable rulers who were able to exercise a wide-ranging overlordship from their Midland base.\n\n\nLearning and monasticism (660–793)\nMichael Drout calls this period the \"Golden Age\", when learning flourished with a renaissance in classical knowledge The growth and popularity of monasticism was not an entirely internal development, with influence from the continent shaping Anglo-Saxon monastic life [37] In 669 Theodore, a Greek-speaking monk originally from Tarsus in Asia Minor, arrived in Britain to become the eighth Archbishop of Canterbury He was joined the following year by his colleague Hadrian, a Latin-speaking African by origin and former abbot of a monastery in Campania (near Naples) [38] One of their first tasks at Canterbury was the establishment of a school; and according to Bede (writing some sixty years later), they soon \"attracted a crowd of students into whose minds they daily poured the streams of wholesome learning\" [39] As evidence of their teaching, Bede reports that some of their students, who survived to his own day, were as fluent in Greek and Latin as in their native language Bede does not mention Aldhelm in this connection; but we know from a letter addressed by Aldhelm to Hadrian that he too must be numbered among their students [40]\n\n\nWest Saxon hegemony and the Anglo-Scandinavian Wars (793–878)\nDuring the 9th century, Wessex rose in power, from the foundations laid by King Egbert in the first quarter of the century to the achievements of King Alfred the Great in its closing decades The outlines of the story are told in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, though the annals represent a West Saxon point of view [44] On the day of Egbert's succession to the kingdom of Wessex, in 802, a Mercian ealdorman from the province of the Hwicce had crossed the border at Kempsford, with the intention of mounting a raid into northern Wiltshire; the Mercian force was met by the local ealdorman, \"and the people of Wiltshire had the victory\" [45] In 829, Egbert went on, the chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\" [46] It was at this point that the chronicler chooses to attach Egbert's name to Bede's list of seven overlords, adding that \"he was the eighth king who was Bretwalda\" [47] Simon Keynes suggests Egbert's foundation of a 'bipartite' kingdom is crucial as it stretched across southern England, and it created a working alliance between the West Saxon dynasty and the rulers of the Mercians [48] In 860, the eastern and western parts of the southern kingdom were united by agreement between the surviving sons of King Æthelwulf, though the union was not maintained without some opposition from within the dynasty; and in the late 870s King Alfred gained the submission of the Mercians under their ruler Æthelred, who in other circumstances might have been styled a king, but who under the Alfredian regime was regarded as the 'ealdorman' of his people.\n\n\nKing Alfred and the rebuilding (878–899)\nMore important to Alfred than his military and political victories were his religion, his love of learning, and his spread of writing throughout England Keynes suggests Alfred's work laid the foundations for what really made England unique in all of medieval Europe from around 800 until 1066 [52]\n\n\nLate Anglo-Saxon history (899–1066)\nA framework for the momentous events of the 10th and 11th centuries is provided by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle However charters, law-codes and coins supply detailed information on various aspects of royal government, and the surviving works of Anglo-Latin and vernacular literature, as well as the numerous manuscripts written in the 10th century, testify in their different ways to the vitality of ecclesiastical culture Yet as Keynes suggests \"it does not follow that the 10th century is better understood than more sparsely documented periods\" [56]\n\n\nReform and formation of England (899–978)\nDuring the course of the 10th century, the West Saxon kings extended their power first over Mercia, then into the southern Danelaw, and finally over Northumbria, thereby imposing a semblance of political unity on peoples, who nonetheless would remain conscious of their respective customs and their separate pasts The prestige, and indeed the pretensions, of the monarchy increased, the institutions of government strengthened, and kings and their agents sought in various ways to establish social order [57] This process started with Edward the Elder – who with his sister, Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, initially, charters reveal, encouraged people to purchase estates from the Danes, thereby to reassert some degree of English influence in territory which had fallen under Danish control David Dumville suggests that Edward may have extended this policy by rewarding his supporters with grants of land in the territories newly conquered from the Danes and that any charters issued in respect of such grants have not survived [58] When Athelflæd died, Mercia was absorbed by Wessex From that point on there was no contest for the throne, so the house of Wessex became the ruling house of England [57]\n\n\nÆthelred and the return of the Scandinavians (978–1016)\nThe reign of King Æthelred the Unready witnessed the resumption of Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009–12, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013–14, and (after Æthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015–16 The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right, [65] and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Æthelred's reign [66] It is this evidence which is the basis for Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state, and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Æthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered [67]\n\n\nConquest of England: Danes, Norwegians and Normans (1016–1066)\nIn the 11th century, there were three conquests: one by Cnut on October 18, 1016; the second was an unsuccessful attempt of Battle of Stamford Bridge in September, 1066; and the third was conducted by William of Normandy in October, 1066 at Hastings The consequences of each conquest changed the Anglo-Saxon culture Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not Anglo-Saxon; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other official written languages of the period) moved away from the late West Saxon standard that is called \"Old English\" Yet neither are they \"Middle English\"; moreover, as Treharne explains, for around three-quarters of this period, \"there is barely any 'original' writing in English at all\" These factors have led to a gap in scholarship, implying a discontinuity either side of the Norman Conquest, however this assumption is being challenged [72]\n\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest\nFollowing the Norman conquest, many of the Anglo-Saxon nobility were either exiled or had joined the ranks of the peasantry [78] It has been estimated that only about 8% of the land was under Anglo-Saxon control by 1087 [79] In 1086, only four major Anglo-Saxon landholders still held their lands However, the survival of Anglo-Saxon heiresses was significantly greater Many of the next generation of the nobility had English mothers and learned to speak English at home [80] Some Anglo-Saxon nobles fled to Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia [81] [82] The Byzantine Empire became a popular destination for many Anglo-Saxon soldiers, as it was in need of mercenaries [83] The Anglo-Saxons became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, hitherto a largely North Germanic unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn and continued to serve the empire until the early 15th century [84] However, the population of England at home remained largely Anglo-Saxon; for them, little changed immediately except that their Anglo-Saxon lord was replaced by a Norman lord [85]\n\n\nLife and society\nThe larger narrative, seen in the history of Anglo-Saxon England, is the continued mixing and integration of various disparate elements into one Anglo-Saxon people [citation needed] The outcome of this mixing and integration was a continuous re-interpretation by the Anglo-Saxons of their society and worldview, which Heinreich Härke calls a \"complex and ethnically mixed society\" [93]\n\n\nKingship and kingdoms\nThe development of Anglo-Saxon kingship is little understood before the 7th century Royal dynasties often claimed descent from Woden or another deity to justify their rule, but the true basis of their power was as warleaders Kings were buried as warriors, and war helmets instead of crowns were used in coronations until the 10th century A king's relationship with his warband (Latin: comitatus) involved mutual obligations His warriors fought for the king in return for food, shelter, and gifts such as weapons The people supported their king and his warriors with food rent [94] Kings extracted surplus by raiding and collecting food rent and \"prestige goods\" [95]\n\n\nReligion\nAlthough Christianity dominates the religious history of the Anglo-Saxons, life in the 5th and 6th centuries was dominated by pagan religious beliefs with a Scandinavian-Germanic heritage.\n\n\nFighting and warfare\nSoldiers throughout the country were summoned, for both offensive and defensive war; early armies consisted essentially of household bands, while later on men were recruited on a territorial basis The mustering of an army, annually at times, occupied an important place in Frankish history, both military and constitutional The English kingdoms appear to have known no institution similar to this The earliest reference is Bede's account of the overthrow of the Northumbrian Æthelfrith by Rædwald overlord of the southern English Rædwald raised a large army, presumably from among the kings who accepted his overlordship, and \"not giving him time to summon and assemble his whole army, Rædwald met him with a much greater force and slew him on the Mercian border on the east bank of the river Idle.\" [119] At the Battle of Edington in 878, when the Danes made a surprise attack on Alfred at Chippenham after Twelfth Night, Alfred retreated to Athelney after Easter and then seven weeks after Easter mustered an army at \"Egbert's stone\" [120] It is not difficult to imagine that Alfred sent out word to the ealdormen to call his men to arms This may explain the delay, and it is probably no more than coincidence that the army mustered at the beginning of May, a time when there would have been sufficient grass for the horses There is also information about the mustering of fleets in the eleventh century From 992 to 1066 fleets were assembled at London, or returned to the city at the end of their service, on several occasions Where they took up station depended on the quarter from which a threat was expected: Sandwich if invasion was expected from the north, or the Isle of Wight if it was from Normandy [121]\n\n\nSettlements and working life\nHelena Hamerow suggests that the prevailing model of working life and settlement, particularly for the early period, was one of shifting settlement and building tribal kinship The mid-Saxon period saw diversification, the development of enclosures, the beginning of the toft system, closer management of livestock, the gradual spread of the mould-board plough, 'informally regular plots' and a greater permanence, with further settlement consolidation thereafter foreshadowing post-Norman Conquest villages The later periods saw a proliferation of service features including barns, mills and latrines, most markedly on high-status sites Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period as Hamerow suggests, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production\" This is very noticeable in the early period However, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, the rise of the manor and its significance in terms of both settlement and the management of land, which becomes very evident in the Domesday Book of 1086 [129]\n\n\nWomen, children and slaves\nAlfred's reference to 'praying men, fighting men and working men' is far from a complete description of his society Women in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms appear to have enjoyed considerable independence, whether as abbesses of the great 'double monasteries' of monks and nuns founded during the seventh and eighth centuries, as major land-holders recorded in Domesday Book (1086), or as ordinary members of society They could act as principals in legal transactions, were entitled to the same weregild as men of the same class, and were considered 'oath-worthy', with the right to defend themselves on oath against false accusations or claims Sexual and other offences against them were penalised heavily There is evidence that even married women could own property independently, and some surviving wills are in the joint names of husband and wife [137]\n\n\nCulture\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with thatch roofing [145] Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, [146] the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers, or near natural ports In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth [e]\n\n\nArchitecture\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with thatch roofing [145] Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, [146] the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers, or near natural ports In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth [e]\n\n\nArt\nEarly Anglo-Saxon art is seen mostly in decorated jewellery, like brooches, buckles, beads and wrist-clasps, some of outstanding quality Characteristic of the 5th century is the quoit brooch with motifs based on crouching animals, as seen on the silver quoit brooch from Sarre, Kent While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman, Frankish, or Jutish art One style flourished from the late 5th century and continued throughout the 6th and is on many square-headed brooches, it is characterised by chip-carved patterns based on animals and masks A different style, which gradually superseded it, is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies [153]\n\n\nLanguage\nOld English (Ænglisċ, Anglisċ, Englisċ) is the earliest form of the English language It was brought to Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers, and was spoken and written in parts of what are now England and southeastern Scotland until the mid-12th century, by which time it had evolved into Middle English Old English was a West Germanic language, closely related to Old Frisian and Old Saxon (Old Low German) The language was fully inflected, with five grammatical cases, three grammatical numbers and three grammatical genders Over time, Old English developed into four major dialects: Northumbrian, spoken north of the Humber; Mercian, spoken in the Midlands; Kentish, spoken in Kent; and West Saxon, spoken across the south and southwest All of these dialects have direct descendants in modern England Standard English developed from the Mercian dialect, as it was predominant in London [172]\n\n\nKinship\nLocal and extended kin groups were a key aspect of Anglo-Saxon culture Kinship fueled societal advantages, freedom and the relationships to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish [5] The ties of loyalty to a lord were to the person of a lord and not to his station; there was no real concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause This explains why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, since a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime of a leader An example of this was the leadership of Rædwald of East Anglia and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death [184] Kings could not make new laws barring exceptional circumstances Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not in any sense so powerful or invested with authority as it was to become One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church, through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were then joined in peoples' minds [185]\n\n\nLaw\nThe most noticeable feature of the Anglo-Saxon legal system is the apparent prevalence of legislation in the form of law codes The early Anglo-Saxons were organised in various small kingdoms often corresponding to later shires or counties The kings of these small kingdoms issued written laws, one of the earliest of which is attributed to Ethelbert, king of Kent, ca.560–616 [189] The Anglo-Saxon law codes follow a pattern found in mainland Europe where other groups of the former Roman Empire encountered government dependent upon written sources of law and hastened to display the claims of their own native traditions by reducing them to writing These legal systems should not be thought of as operating like modern legislation, rather they are educational and political tools designed to demonstrate standards of good conduct rather than act as criteria for subsequent legal judgment [190]\n\n\nLiterature\nOld English literary works include genres such as epic poetry, hagiography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles and others In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, a significant corpus of both popular interest and specialist research The manuscripts use a modified Roman alphabet, but Anglo-Saxon runes or futhorc are used in under 200 inscriptions on objects, sometimes mixed with Roman letters.\n\n\nSymbolism\nSymbolism was an essential element in Anglo-Saxon culture Julian D Richards suggests that in societies with strong oral traditions, material culture is used to store and pass on information and stand instead of literature in those cultures This symbolism is less logical than literature and more difficult to read Anglo-Saxons used symbolism to communicate as well as to aid their thinking about the world Anglo-Saxons used symbols to differentiate between groups and people, status and role in society [155]\n\n\nFood\nThe food eaten by Anglo-Saxons was long presumed to differ between elites and commoners However, a 2022 study by the University of Cambridge found that Anglo-Saxon elites and royalty both ate a primarily vegetarian diet based on cereal grains as did peasants The discovery came after bioarchaeologist Sam Leggett analysed chemical dietary signatures from the bones of 2,023 people buried in England between the 5th to 11th Centuries and cross referenced the analysis with markers of social status Rather than elites eating regular banquets with huge quantities of meat, the researchers concluded these were occasional grand feasts hosted by the peasants for their rulers rather than regular occurrences [217] [218]\n\n\nLegacy\nAnglo-Saxon is still used as a term for the original Old English-derived vocabulary within the modern English language, in contrast to vocabulary derived from Old Norse and French In the 19th century, the term Anglo-Saxon was broadly used in philology, and is sometimes so used at present, though the term 'Old English' is more commonly used for the language \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nModern concepts\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Anglo-Saxons**\n\nThe term \"Anglo-Saxons\" is used by scholars to refer collectively to the Old English speaking groups in Britain. As a compound term, it has the advantage of covering the various English-speaking groups on the one hand, and to avoid possible misunderstandings from using the terms \"Saxons\" or \"Angles\" which could be used either as collectives referring to all the Old English speakers, or to specific tribal groups.\n\n**Anglo-Saxon origins (4th–6th centuries)**\n\nAlthough it involved immigrant communities from northern Europe, the culture of the Anglo-Saxons was not transplanted from there, but rather developed in Britain. In 400, the Roman province of Britannia had long been part of the Roman Empire. The empire had been dismembered several times during the previous centuries, often because of usurpations beginning in Britain such as those of Magnus Maximus, and Constantine \"III\". Already before 400 Roman sources used the term Saxons to refer to coastal raiders who had been causing problems especially on the coasts of the North Sea. The Romans established a military commander who was assigned to oversee a chain of coastal forts which they called the Saxon shore. The homeland of these Saxon raiders was not clearly described in surviving sources but they were apparently the northerly neighbours of the Franks on the Lower Rhine.\n\n**Christianity and the early kingdoms**\n\nFrom the time of the Christian conversions the first well-attested English kings and kingdoms appear in the written record. This situation with a small number of kingdoms competing for dominance is traditionally called the Heptarchy, which indicates a period of seven kingdoms. However, there were more than seven kingdoms, and their interactions were quite complex. The Christian conversions also marked the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire in Britain.\n\n**Middle Anglo-Saxon history (660–899)**\n\nBy 660, the political map of Lowland Britain had developed with smaller territories coalescing into kingdoms, and from this time larger kingdoms started dominating the smaller kingdoms. The development of kingdoms, with a particular king being recognised as an overlord, developed out of an early loose structure that, Higham believes, is linked back to the original feodus. The traditional name for this period is the Heptarchy, which has not been used by scholars since the early 20th century as it gives the impression of a single political structure and does not afford the opportunity to treat the history of any one kingdom as a whole. Simon Keynes suggests that the 8th and 9th century was a period of economic and social flourishing which created stability both below the Thames and above the Humber.\n\n**Mercian supremacy (626–821)**\n\nMiddle-lowland Britain was known as the place of the Mierce, the border or frontier folk, in Latin Mercia. Mercia was a diverse area of tribal groups, as shown by the Tribal Hidage; the peoples were a mixture of Brittonic speaking peoples and \"Anglo-Saxon\" pioneers and their early leaders had Brittonic names, such as Penda. Although Penda does not appear in Bede's list of great overlords, it would appear from what Bede says elsewhere that he was dominant over the southern kingdoms. The seventh-century Mercian kings were formidable rulers who were able to exercise a wide-ranging overlordship from their Midland base.\n\n**Learning and monasticism (660–793)**\n\nMichael Drout calls this period the \"Golden Age\", when learning flourished with a renaissance in classical knowledge. The growth and popularity of monasticism was not an entirely internal development, with influence from the continent shaping Anglo-Saxon monastic life. In 669 Theodore, a Greek-speaking monk originally from Tarsus in Asia Minor, arrived in Britain to become the eighth Archbishop of Canterbury. He was joined the following year by his colleague Hadrian, a Latin-speaking African by origin and former abbot of a monastery in Campania (near Naples). One of their first tasks at Canterbury was the establishment of a school; and according to Bede (writing some sixty years later), they soon \"attracted a crowd of students into whose minds they daily poured the streams of wholesome learning\".\n\n**West Saxon hegemony and the Anglo-Scandinavian Wars (793–878)**\n\nDuring the 9th century, Wessex rose in power, from the foundations laid by King Egbert in the first quarter of the century to the achievements of King Alfred the Great in its closing decades. The outlines of the story are told in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, though the annals represent a West Saxon point of view. On the day of Egbert's succession to the kingdom of Wessex, in 802, a Mercian ealdorman from the province of the Hwicce had crossed the border at Kempsford, with the intention of mounting a raid into northern Wiltshire; the Mercian force was met by the local ealdorman, \"and the people of Wiltshire had the victory\". In 829, Egbert went on, the chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\".\n\n**King Alfred and the rebuilding (878–899)**\n\nMore important to Alfred than his military and political victories were his religion, his love of learning, and his spread of writing throughout England. Keynes suggests Alfred's work laid the foundations for what really made England unique in all of medieval Europe from around 800 until 1066.\n\n**Late Anglo-Saxon history (899–1066)**\n\nA framework for the momentous events of the 10th and 11th centuries is provided by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. However, charters, law-codes and coins supply detailed information on various aspects of royal government, and the surviving works of Anglo-Latin and vernacular literature, as well as the numerous manuscripts written in the 10th century, testify in their different ways to the vitality of ecclesiastical culture.\n\n**Reform and formation of England (899–978)**\n\nDuring the course of the 10th century, the West Saxon kings extended their power first over Mercia, then into the southern Danelaw, and finally over Northumbria, thereby imposing a semblance of political unity on peoples who nonetheless would remain conscious of their respective customs and their separate pasts.

Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009–12, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall.\n\n**Conquest of England: Danes, Norwegians and Normans (1016–1066)**\n\nIn the 11th century, there were three conquests: one by Cnut on October 18, 1016; the second was an unsuccessful attempt of Battle of Stamford Bridge in September, 1066; and the third was conducted by William of Normandy in October, 1066 at Hastings. The consequences of each conquest changed the Anglo-Saxon culture. Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not Anglo-Saxon; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other official written languages of the period) moved away from the late West Saxon standard that is called \"Old English\".\n\n**After the Norman Conquest**\n\nFollowing the Norman conquest, many of the Anglo-Saxon nobility were either exiled or had joined the ranks of the peasantry. It has been estimated that only about 8% of the land was under Anglo-Saxon control by 1087. In 1086, only four major Anglo-Saxon landholders still held their lands. However, the survival of Anglo-Saxon heiresses was significantly greater. Many of the next generation of the nobility had English mothers and learned to speak English at home. Some Anglo-Saxon nobles fled to Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia. The Byzantine Empire became a popular destination for many Anglo-Saxon soldiers, as it was in need of mercenaries. The Anglo-Saxons became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, hitherto a largely North Germanic unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn and continued to serve the empire until the early 15th century.\n\n**Life and society**\n\nThe larger narrative, seen in the history of Anglo-Saxon England, is the continued mixing and integration of various disparate elements into one Anglo-Saxon people.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anglo-Saxons\" following this outline:\n\n\nEthnonym\nIn modern times, the term \"Anglo-Saxons\" is used by scholars to refer collectively to the Old English speaking groups in Britain As a compound term it has the advantage of covering the various English-speaking groups on the one hand, and to avoid possible misunderstandings from using the terms \"Saxons\" or \"Angles\" (English), both of which terms could be used either as collectives referring to all the Old English speakers, or to specific tribal groups Although the term \"Anglo Saxon\" was not used as a common term until modern times, it is not a modern invention because it was also used in some specific contexts already between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon origins (4th–6th centuries)\nAlthough it involved immigrant communities from northern Europe, the culture of the Anglo-Saxons was not transplanted from there, but rather developed in Britain [9] In 400, the Roman province of Britannia had long been part of the Roman Empire Although the empire had been dismembered several times during the previous centuries, often because of usurpations beginning in Britain such as those of Magnus Maximus, and Constantine \"III\" there was an overall continuity and interconnectedness Already before 400 Roman sources used the term Saxons to refer to coastal raiders who had been causing problems especially on the coasts of the North Sea In what is now south-eastern England the Romans established a military commander who was assigned to oversee a chain of coastal forts which they called the Saxon shore [10] The homeland of these Saxon raiders was not clearly described in surviving sources but they were apparently the northerly neighbours of the Franks on the Lower Rhine [11] At the same time, the Roman administration in Britain (and other parts of the empire) was recruiting foederati soldiers from the same general regions in what is now Germany, and these are likely to have become more important after the withdrawal of field armies during internal Roman power struggles [12]\n\n\nChristianity and the early kingdoms\nFrom the time of the Christian conversions the first well-attested English kings and kingdoms appear in the written record This situation with a small number of kingdoms competing for dominance is traditionally called the Heptarchy, which indicates a period of seven kingdoms There were however more than seven kingdoms, and their interactions were quite complex \n\n\nMiddle Anglo-Saxon history (660–899)\nBy 660, the political map of Lowland Britain had developed with smaller territories coalescing into kingdoms, and from this time larger kingdoms started dominating the smaller kingdoms The development of kingdoms, with a particular king being recognised as an overlord, developed out of an early loose structure that, Higham believes, is linked back to the original feodus [28] The traditional name for this period is the Heptarchy, which has not been used by scholars since the early 20th century [29] as it gives the impression of a single political structure and does not afford the \"opportunity to treat the history of any one kingdom as a whole\" [30] Simon Keynes suggests that the 8th and 9th century was a period of economic and social flourishing which created stability both below the Thames and above the Humber [30]\n\n\nMercian supremacy (626–821)\nMiddle-lowland Britain was known as the place of the Mierce, the border or frontier folk, in Latin Mercia Mercia was a diverse area of tribal groups, as shown by the Tribal Hidage; the peoples were a mixture of Brittonic speaking peoples and \"Anglo-Saxon\" pioneers and their early leaders had Brittonic names, such as Penda [31] Although Penda does not appear in Bede's list of great overlords, it would appear from what Bede says elsewhere that he was dominant over the southern kingdoms At the time of the battle of the river Winwæd, thirty duces regii (royal generals) fought on his behalf Although there are many gaps in the evidence, it is clear that the seventh-century Mercian kings were formidable rulers who were able to exercise a wide-ranging overlordship from their Midland base.\n\n\nLearning and monasticism (660–793)\nMichael Drout calls this period the \"Golden Age\", when learning flourished with a renaissance in classical knowledge The growth and popularity of monasticism was not an entirely internal development, with influence from the continent shaping Anglo-Saxon monastic life [37] In 669 Theodore, a Greek-speaking monk originally from Tarsus in Asia Minor, arrived in Britain to become the eighth Archbishop of Canterbury He was joined the following year by his colleague Hadrian, a Latin-speaking African by origin and former abbot of a monastery in Campania (near Naples) [38] One of their first tasks at Canterbury was the establishment of a school; and according to Bede (writing some sixty years later), they soon \"attracted a crowd of students into whose minds they daily poured the streams of wholesome learning\" [39] As evidence of their teaching, Bede reports that some of their students, who survived to his own day, were as fluent in Greek and Latin as in their native language Bede does not mention Aldhelm in this connection; but we know from a letter addressed by Aldhelm to Hadrian that he too must be numbered among their students [40]\n\n\nWest Saxon hegemony and the Anglo-Scandinavian Wars (793–878)\nDuring the 9th century, Wessex rose in power, from the foundations laid by King Egbert in the first quarter of the century to the achievements of King Alfred the Great in its closing decades The outlines of the story are told in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, though the annals represent a West Saxon point of view [44] On the day of Egbert's succession to the kingdom of Wessex, in 802, a Mercian ealdorman from the province of the Hwicce had crossed the border at Kempsford, with the intention of mounting a raid into northern Wiltshire; the Mercian force was met by the local ealdorman, \"and the people of Wiltshire had the victory\" [45] In 829, Egbert went on, the chronicler reports, to conquer \"the kingdom of the Mercians and everything south of the Humber\" [46] It was at this point that the chronicler chooses to attach Egbert's name to Bede's list of seven overlords, adding that \"he was the eighth king who was Bretwalda\" [47] Simon Keynes suggests Egbert's foundation of a 'bipartite' kingdom is crucial as it stretched across southern England, and it created a working alliance between the West Saxon dynasty and the rulers of the Mercians [48] In 860, the eastern and western parts of the southern kingdom were united by agreement between the surviving sons of King Æthelwulf, though the union was not maintained without some opposition from within the dynasty; and in the late 870s King Alfred gained the submission of the Mercians under their ruler Æthelred, who in other circumstances might have been styled a king, but who under the Alfredian regime was regarded as the 'ealdorman' of his people.\n\n\nKing Alfred and the rebuilding (878–899)\nMore important to Alfred than his military and political victories were his religion, his love of learning, and his spread of writing throughout England Keynes suggests Alfred's work laid the foundations for what really made England unique in all of medieval Europe from around 800 until 1066 [52]\n\n\nLate Anglo-Saxon history (899–1066)\nA framework for the momentous events of the 10th and 11th centuries is provided by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle However charters, law-codes and coins supply detailed information on various aspects of royal government, and the surviving works of Anglo-Latin and vernacular literature, as well as the numerous manuscripts written in the 10th century, testify in their different ways to the vitality of ecclesiastical culture Yet as Keynes suggests \"it does not follow that the 10th century is better understood than more sparsely documented periods\" [56]\n\n\nReform and formation of England (899–978)\nDuring the course of the 10th century, the West Saxon kings extended their power first over Mercia, then into the southern Danelaw, and finally over Northumbria, thereby imposing a semblance of political unity on peoples, who nonetheless would remain conscious of their respective customs and their separate pasts The prestige, and indeed the pretensions, of the monarchy increased, the institutions of government strengthened, and kings and their agents sought in various ways to establish social order [57] This process started with Edward the Elder – who with his sister, Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, initially, charters reveal, encouraged people to purchase estates from the Danes, thereby to reassert some degree of English influence in territory which had fallen under Danish control David Dumville suggests that Edward may have extended this policy by rewarding his supporters with grants of land in the territories newly conquered from the Danes and that any charters issued in respect of such grants have not survived [58] When Athelflæd died, Mercia was absorbed by Wessex From that point on there was no contest for the throne, so the house of Wessex became the ruling house of England [57]\n\n\nÆthelred and the return of the Scandinavians (978–1016)\nThe reign of King Æthelred the Unready witnessed the resumption of Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009–12, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013–14, and (after Æthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015–16 The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right, [65] and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Æthelred's reign [66] It is this evidence which is the basis for Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state, and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Æthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered [67]\n\n\nConquest of England: Danes, Norwegians and Normans (1016–1066)\nIn the 11th century, there were three conquests: one by Cnut on October 18, 1016; the second was an unsuccessful attempt of Battle of Stamford Bridge in September, 1066; and the third was conducted by William of Normandy in October, 1066 at Hastings The consequences of each conquest changed the Anglo-Saxon culture Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not Anglo-Saxon; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other official written languages of the period) moved away from the late West Saxon standard that is called \"Old English\" Yet neither are they \"Middle English\"; moreover, as Treharne explains, for around three-quarters of this period, \"there is barely any 'original' writing in English at all\" These factors have led to a gap in scholarship, implying a discontinuity either side of the Norman Conquest, however this assumption is being challenged [72]\n\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest\nFollowing the Norman conquest, many of the Anglo-Saxon nobility were either exiled or had joined the ranks of the peasantry [78] It has been estimated that only about 8% of the land was under Anglo-Saxon control by 1087 [79] In 1086, only four major Anglo-Saxon landholders still held their lands However, the survival of Anglo-Saxon heiresses was significantly greater Many of the next generation of the nobility had English mothers and learned to speak English at home [80] Some Anglo-Saxon nobles fled to Scotland, Ireland, and Scandinavia [81] [82] The Byzantine Empire became a popular destination for many Anglo-Saxon soldiers, as it was in need of mercenaries [83] The Anglo-Saxons became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, hitherto a largely North Germanic unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn and continued to serve the empire until the early 15th century [84] However, the population of England at home remained largely Anglo-Saxon; for them, little changed immediately except that their Anglo-Saxon lord was replaced by a Norman lord [85]\n\n\nLife and society\nThe larger narrative, seen in the history of Anglo-Saxon England, is the continued mixing and integration of various disparate elements into one Anglo-Saxon people [citation needed] The outcome of this mixing and integration was a continuous re-interpretation by the Anglo-Saxons of their society and worldview, which Heinreich Härke calls a \"complex and ethnically mixed society\" [93]\n\n\nKingship and kingdoms\nThe development of Anglo-Saxon kingship is little understood before the 7th century Royal dynasties often claimed descent from Woden or another deity to justify their rule, but the true basis of their power was as warleaders Kings were buried as warriors, and war helmets instead of crowns were used in coronations until the 10th century A king's relationship with his warband (Latin: comitatus) involved mutual obligations His warriors fought for the king in return for food, shelter, and gifts such as weapons The people supported their king and his warriors with food rent [94] Kings extracted surplus by raiding and collecting food rent and \"prestige goods\" [95]\n\n\nReligion\nAlthough Christianity dominates the religious history of the Anglo-Saxons, life in the 5th and 6th centuries was dominated by pagan religious beliefs with a Scandinavian-Germanic heritage.\n\n\nFighting and warfare\nSoldiers throughout the country were summoned, for both offensive and defensive war; early armies consisted essentially of household bands, while later on men were recruited on a territorial basis The mustering of an army, annually at times, occupied an important place in Frankish history, both military and constitutional The English kingdoms appear to have known no institution similar to this The earliest reference is Bede's account of the overthrow of the Northumbrian Æthelfrith by Rædwald overlord of the southern English Rædwald raised a large army, presumably from among the kings who accepted his overlordship, and \"not giving him time to summon and assemble his whole army, Rædwald met him with a much greater force and slew him on the Mercian border on the east bank of the river Idle.\" [119] At the Battle of Edington in 878, when the Danes made a surprise attack on Alfred at Chippenham after Twelfth Night, Alfred retreated to Athelney after Easter and then seven weeks after Easter mustered an army at \"Egbert's stone\" [120] It is not difficult to imagine that Alfred sent out word to the ealdormen to call his men to arms This may explain the delay, and it is probably no more than coincidence that the army mustered at the beginning of May, a time when there would have been sufficient grass for the horses There is also information about the mustering of fleets in the eleventh century From 992 to 1066 fleets were assembled at London, or returned to the city at the end of their service, on several occasions Where they took up station depended on the quarter from which a threat was expected: Sandwich if invasion was expected from the north, or the Isle of Wight if it was from Normandy [121]\n\n\nSettlements and working life\nHelena Hamerow suggests that the prevailing model of working life and settlement, particularly for the early period, was one of shifting settlement and building tribal kinship The mid-Saxon period saw diversification, the development of enclosures, the beginning of the toft system, closer management of livestock, the gradual spread of the mould-board plough, 'informally regular plots' and a greater permanence, with further settlement consolidation thereafter foreshadowing post-Norman Conquest villages The later periods saw a proliferation of service features including barns, mills and latrines, most markedly on high-status sites Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period as Hamerow suggests, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production\" This is very noticeable in the early period However, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, the rise of the manor and its significance in terms of both settlement and the management of land, which becomes very evident in the Domesday Book of 1086 [129]\n\n\nWomen, children and slaves\nAlfred's reference to 'praying men, fighting men and working men' is far from a complete description of his society Women in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms appear to have enjoyed considerable independence, whether as abbesses of the great 'double monasteries' of monks and nuns founded during the seventh and eighth centuries, as major land-holders recorded in Domesday Book (1086), or as ordinary members of society They could act as principals in legal transactions, were entitled to the same weregild as men of the same class, and were considered 'oath-worthy', with the right to defend themselves on oath against false accusations or claims Sexual and other offences against them were penalised heavily There is evidence that even married women could own property independently, and some surviving wills are in the joint names of husband and wife [137]\n\n\nCulture\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with thatch roofing [145] Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, [146] the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers, or near natural ports In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth [e]\n\n\nArchitecture\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly

or near natural ports In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth [e]\n\n\nArt\nEarly Anglo-Saxon art is seen mostly in decorated jewellery, like brooches, buckles, beads and wrist-clasps, some of outstanding quality Characteristic of the 5th century is the quoit brooch with motifs based on crouching animals, as seen on the silver quoit brooch from Sarre, Kent While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman, Frankish, or Jutish art One style flourished from the late 5th century and continued throughout the 6th and is on many square-headed brooches, it is characterised by chip-carved patterns based on animals and masks A different style, which gradually superseded it, is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies [153]\n\n\nLanguage\nOld English (Ænglisċ, Anglisċ, Englisċ) is the earliest form of the English language It was brought to Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers, and was spoken and written in parts of what are now England and southeastern Scotland until the mid-12th century, by which time it had evolved into Middle English Old English was a West Germanic language, closely related to Old Frisian and Old Saxon (Old Low German) The language was fully inflected, with five grammatical cases, three grammatical numbers and three grammatical genders Over time, Old English developed into four major dialects: Northumbrian, spoken north of the Humber; Mercian, spoken in the Midlands; Kentish, spoken in Kent; and West Saxon, spoken across the south and southwest All of these dialects have direct descendants in modern England Standard English developed from the Mercian dialect, as it was predominant in London [172]\n\n\nKinship\nLocal and extended kin groups were a key aspect of Anglo-Saxon culture Kinship fueled societal advantages, freedom and the relationships to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish [5] The ties of loyalty to a lord were to the person of a lord and not to his station; there was no real concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause This explains why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, since a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime of a leader An example of this was the leadership of Rædwald of East Anglia and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death [184] Kings could not make new laws barring exceptional circumstances Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not in any sense so powerful or invested with authority as it was to become One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church, through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were then joined in peoples' minds [185]\n\n\nLaw\nThe most noticeable feature of the Anglo-Saxon legal system is the apparent prevalence of legislation in the form of law codes The early Anglo-Saxons were organised in various small kingdoms often corresponding to later shires or counties The kings of these small kingdoms issued written laws, one of the earliest of which is attributed to Ethelbert, king of Kent, ca.560–616 [189] The Anglo-Saxon law codes follow a pattern found in mainland Europe where other groups of the former Roman Empire encountered government dependent upon written sources of law and hastened to display the claims of their own native traditions by reducing them to writing These legal systems should not be thought of as operating like modern legislation, rather they are educational and political tools designed to demonstrate standards of good conduct rather than act as criteria for subsequent legal judgment [190]\n\n\nLiterature\nOld English literary works include genres such as epic poetry, hagiography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles and others In all there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period, a significant corpus of both popular interest and specialist research The manuscripts use a modified Roman alphabet, but Anglo-Saxon runes or futhorc are used in under 200 inscriptions on objects, sometimes mixed with Roman letters.\n\n\nSymbolism\nSymbolism was an essential element in Anglo-Saxon culture Julian D Richards suggests that in societies with strong oral traditions, material culture is used to store and pass on information and stand instead of literature in those cultures This symbolism is less logical than literature and more difficult to read Anglo-Saxons used symbolism to communicate as well as to aid their thinking about the world Anglo-Saxons used symbols to differentiate between groups and people, status and role in society [155]\n\n\nFood\nThe food eaten by Anglo-Saxons was long presumed to differ between elites and commoners However, a 2022 study by the University of Cambridge found that Anglo-Saxon elites and royalty both ate a primarily vegetarian diet based on cereal grains as did peasants The discovery came after bioarchaeologist Sam Leggett analysed chemical dietary signatures from the bones of 2,023 people buried in England between the 5th to 11th Centuries and cross referenced the analysis with markers of social status Rather than elites eating regular banquets with huge quantities of meat, the researchers concluded these were occasional grand feasts hosted by the peasants for their rulers rather than regular occurrences [217] [218]\n\n\nLegacy\nAnglo-Saxon is still used as a term for the original Old English-derived vocabulary within the modern English language, in contrast to vocabulary derived from Old Norse and French In the 19th century, the term Anglo-Saxon was broadly used in philology, and is sometimes so used at present, though the term 'Old English' is more commonly used for the language \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nModern

{"title": "Thomas_Jefferson", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nJefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, Old Style, Julian calendar), at the family's Shadwell Plantation in the British Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children [8] He was of English and possibly Welsh descent, and was born a British subject [9] His father, Peter Jefferson, was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was Jane Randolph [c] Peter Jefferson moved his family to Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 on the death of William Randolph III, the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph's children The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell before October 1753 [11]\n\n\nEducation and early family life\nJefferson began his education together with the Randolph children at Tuckahoe under tutors [15] Thomas' father Peter, who was self-taught and regretted not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school at age five In 1752, at age nine, he attended a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love At this time he began studying Latin, Greek, and French, while learning to ride horses as well Thomas also read books from his father's modest library [16] He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville, Virginia, where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family [16] [17] Jefferson came to know various American Indians, including the Cherokee chief Ostenaco, who often stopped at Shadwell to visit on their way to Williamsburg to trade [18] [19] In Williamsburg, the young Jefferson met and came to admire Patrick Henry, eight years his senior, and shared a common interest in the playing of the violin [20]\n\n\nLawyer and House of Burgesses\nJefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767, and lived with his mother at Shadwell [35] He represented Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1769 until 1775 [36] He pursued reforms to slavery, including writing and sponsoring legislation in 1769 to strip power from the royal governor and courts, instead providing masters of slaves with the discretion to emancipate them Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's passage, but it faced strong opposition in a state whose economy was largely agrarian [37]\n\n\nMonticello, marriage, and family\nIn 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence, Monticello, whose name in Italian means \"Little Mountain\", on a hilltop overlooking his 5,000-acre (20 km2; 7.8 sq mi) plantation [d] He spent most of his adult life designing Monticello as an architect and was quoted as saying, \"Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.\" [44] Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's slaves [45] He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770 Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project [46]\n\n\nRevolutionary War\nJefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence [61] At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored [62] Jefferson was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu [63]\n\n\nDeclaration of Independence\nJefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence [61] At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second

by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu [63]\n\n\nVirginia state legislator and governor\nAt the start of the Revolution, Colonel Jefferson was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775 [73] He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing the state constitution was a priority [74] [75]\nFor nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which prohibited state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine [76] The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican Church, but both were later revived by James Madison [77]\n\n\nNotes on the State of Virginia\nIn 1780, Jefferson received from French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois a letter of inquiry into the geography, history, and government of Virginia, as part of a study of the United States Jefferson organized his responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) [91] He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography [92] The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery and miscegenation; he articulated his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved [93] He also wrote of his views on the American Indians, equating them to European settlers [94] [95]\n\n\nMember of Congress\nJefferson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the Congress of the Confederation organized following the peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783 He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and recommended an American currency based on the decimal system that was adopted [99] He advised the formation of the Committee of the States to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess [100] The committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional [101]\n\n\nMinister to France\nOn May 7, 1784, Jefferson was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation [i] to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with Great Britain and other countries [104] [j] With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month [106] [107] Jefferson had Patsy educated at the Pentemont Abbey Less than a year later he was assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to France French foreign minister Count de Vergennes commented, \"You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear.\" Jefferson replied, \"I succeed No man can replace him.\" [108] During his five years in Paris, Jefferson played a leading role in shaping U.S foreign policy [109]\n\n\nSecretary of State\nSoon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted President Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State [121] Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital He opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of states' debts by the federal government [122] Hamilton also had bold plans to establish national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from the cabinet He later left the cabinet voluntarily [123]\n\n\nElection of 1796 and vice presidency\nIn the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams 71–68 and was thus elected vice president As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an \"honorable and easy\" role [136] Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him quite qualified to serve as presiding officer In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as A Manual of Parliamentary Practice [137] He cast only three tie-breaking votes in the Senate.\n\n\nElection of 1800\nJefferson contended for president once more against John Adams in 1800 Adams' campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War [149] Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the French [150] Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was \"one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\" [151]\n\n\nPresidency (1801–1809)\nJefferson was sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1801 His inauguration was not attended by outgoing President Adams In contrast to his two predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette Plainly dressed, he chose to walk alongside friends to the Capitol from his nearby boardinghouse that day instead of arriving by carriage [158] His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation and commitment to democratic ideology, declaring, \"We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\" [159] [160] Ideologically, he stressed \"equal and exact justice to all men\", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press [161] He said that a free and republican government was \"the strongest government on earth.\" [161] He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state, Henry Dearborn as secretary of war, Levi Lincoln as attorney general, and Robert Smith as secretary of the navy [160]\n\n\nFinancial affairs\nJefferson's first challenge as president was shrinking the $83 million national debt [163] He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury, Albert Gallatin [160] Gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes [164] The administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing \"unnecessary offices\" and cutting \"useless establishments and expenses\" [165] [166]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nJefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts [170] Congressional Republicans repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams's \"midnight judges\" A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Marbury v Madison, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions [171] Jefferson appointed three Supreme Court justices: William Johnson (1804), Henry Brockholst Livingston (1807), and Thomas Todd (1807) [172]\n\n\nForeign affairs (1801–1805)\nAmerican merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies [176] After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785 In 1801, he authorized a U.S Navy fleet under Commodore Richard Dale to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic [177] Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war [177] The \"First Barbary War\" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S [178]\n\n\nFirst Barbary War\nAmerican merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies [176] After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom

American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic [177] Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war [177] The \"First Barbary War\" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S [178]\n\n\nLouisiana Purchase\nSpain ceded ownership of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to France Jefferson was concerned that Napoleon's interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and Mississippi River shipping He wrote that the cession \"works most sorely on the U.S It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S.\" [182] In 1802, he instructed James Monroe and Robert R Livingston to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas [183] In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10 million for 40,000 square miles (100,000 square kilometres) of tropical territory [184]\n\n\nExpeditions\nJefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory He sought to establish a U.S claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored Northwest Passage [193] Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana (1763) and James Cook in the Pacific (1784), [194] and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean [195]\n\n\nNative American affairs\nJefferson refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were inferior and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent, [201] although he believed them to be inferior in terms of culture and technology [202] As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada [203] [204] In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to \"advance compactly as we multiply\" [205]\n\n\nRe-election in 1804 and second term\nJefferson was nominated for reelection by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr as his running mate [209] The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams's vice-presidential candidate in the 1800 election The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase [209]\n\n\nControversies\nFollowing the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic George Clinton.\n\n\nBurr conspiracy and trial\nFollowing the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic George Clinton.\n\n\nWilkinson's misconduct\nCommanding General James Wilkinson was a holdover of the Washington and Adams administrations In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000 pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans [231] Wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn This damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson and appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson's work ethic.\n\n\nForeign affairs (1805–1809)\nIn the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations [235] [236] A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two-million-dollar expenditure to purchase Florida Floor leader John Randolph opposed annexation and was upset over Jefferson's secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would land in the coffers of Napoleon [237] [236] The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with Barnabas Bidwell as floor leader [237] [236] This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806 Six weeks later the law was made public The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States France, however, refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control [238] [236] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters [239] [236]\n\n\nAttempted annexation of Florida\nIn the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain In his

payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States France, however, refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control [238] [236] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters [239] [236]\n\n\nChesapeake–Leopard affair\nThe British conducted seizures of American shipping to search for British deserters from 1806 to 1807; American citizens were thus impressed into the British naval service In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate an end to the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations The Monroe–Pinkney Treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions to end the British policies, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification [240]\n\n\nEmbargo (1807–1809)\nIn December 1807, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree, globally banning British imports In Britain, King George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors But Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S for war Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces Meacham said that the Embargo Act was a projection of power that surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R B Bernstein said that Jefferson \"was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution\" [243]\n\n\nCabinet\nAfter his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823 [250] [251]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1809–1826)\nAfter his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823 [250] [251]\n\n\nUniversity of Virginia\nJefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in new areas not offered at other colleges He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible based solely on ability [252] He initially proposed his university in a letter to Joseph Priestley in 1800 [253] and, in 1819, founded the University of Virginia He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of Edmund Bacon, purchased the location He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825 [254]\n\n\nReconciliation with Adams\nJefferson and John Adams became good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender Jefferson was angered by Adams' appointment of \"midnight judges\" [260] The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president [261] A brief correspondence took place between Abigail Adams and Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter Polly died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson [260]\n\n\nAutobiography\nIn 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1790, in which he said he sought to \"state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself\" [267] He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short [268] He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a \"strong mind and sound judgement\" He also addressed his enrollment in the College of William and Mary and his election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775 [267]\n\n\nGreek War of Independence\nThomas Jefferson was a philhellene, lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the Greek War of Independence [270] [271] He has been described as the most influential of the Founding Fathers who supported the Greek cause, [271] [272] viewing it as similar to the American Revolution [273] By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar Adamantios Korais [271] Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of Greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S state [274] He also suggested the application of a classical education system for the newly founded First Hellenic Republic [275] Jefferson's philosophical instructions were welcomed by the Greek people [275] Korais became one of the designers of the Greek constitution and urged his associates to study Jefferson's works and other literature from the American Revolution [275]\n\n\nLafayette's visit\nIn the summer of 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the country Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789 After visits to New York, New England, and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4 [254]\n\n\nFinal days, death, and burial\nJefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months, [citation needed] as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fundraiser [278] His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, and intestinal and urinary disorders [254] By June 1826, he was confined to bed [278] On July 3, overcome by fever, Jefferson declined an invitation to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration in Washington [279]\n\n\nPolitical, social, and religious views\nJefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived [294] [295] He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire [296] Jefferson thought that the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies He supported efforts to disestablish the Church of England, [297] wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state [298] The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British Whig Party, which believed in limited government [299] His Democratic-Republican Party became dominant in early American politics, and his views became known as Jeffersonian democracy [300] [301]\n\n\nPhilosophy, society, and government\nJefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically; these show him to be well-read in the philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity Nevertheless, some scholars do not take Jefferson seriously as a philosopher mainly because he did not produce a formal work on philosophy However, he has been described as one of the most outstanding philosophical figures of his time because his work provided the theoretical background to, and the substance of, the social and political events of the revolutionary years and the development of the American Constitution in the 1770s and 1780s [302] Jefferson continued to attend to more theoretical questions of natural philosophy and subsequently left behind a rich philosophical legacy in the form of presidential messages, letters, and public papers [303]\n\n\nDemocracy\nJefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth [320] He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation [321]\n\n\nReligion\nBaptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters [332] Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity [333] Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings [334] [335] Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation [336] Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, \"I am Christian, in the only sense in which  [Jesus] wished any one to be\" [213]\n\n\nBanks\nJefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor [352] In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations [353]\n\n\nSlavery\nScholars give radically differing interpretations on Jefferson's views and relationship with slavery [7] Opinions range from \"emancipationists\" who view him as an early proto-abolitionist, who subsequently made pragmatic compromises with the slave power to preserve the union; to \"revisionists\", who argue that he in fact entrenched the institution in American society; with people also having more nuanced opinions, who either argue that Jefferson held inconsistent views on the institution throughout his lifetime or that both interpretations are too overly simplistic [7]\n\n\nJefferson–Hemings controversy\nClaims that Jefferson fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings after his wife's death have been debated since 1802 In that year James T Callender, after being denied a position as postmaster, alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her [388] In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Hemings's son, Eston Hemings The results showed a match with the male Jefferson line [389] [390] Subsequently, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) formed a nine-member research team of historians to assess the matter [390] The TJF report concluded that \"the DNA study .. indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings\" [390] [391] [t] The TJF also concluded that Jefferson likely fathered all of Hemings's children listed at Monticello [390] [u]\n\n\nInterests and activities\nJefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means [401] and was always in debt [402] Jefferson also planted two vineyards at Monticello and hoped to grow Vitis vinifera, the European wine grape species, to make wine, but the crop failed His efforts were nonetheless an important contribution to the development of American viticulture [403]\n\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society\nJefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780 Through the society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom [410] His Notes on the State of Virginia was written in part as a contribution to the society [411] He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States [411] [412] In accepting, Jefferson stated: \"I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings.\" [410]\n\n\nLinguistics\nJefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics, and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German In his early years, he excelled in classical languages [418] [419] Jefferson later came to regard Greek as the \"perfect language\" as expressed in its laws and philosophy [420] While attending the College of William & Mary, he taught himself Italian [421] Here Jefferson first became familiar with the Anglo-Saxon language, studying it in a linguistic and philosophical capacity He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language [418] Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of Don Quixote [422]\n\n\nInventions\nJefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a \"Great Clock\" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing), [428] and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity [429] Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the swivel chair, the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence [430] He first opposed patents but later supported them In 1790–1793, as Secretary of State, he was the ex officio head of the three-person patent review board He drafted reforms of US patent law which led to him being relieved of this duty in 1793, and also drastically changed the patent system [431]\n\n\nLegacy\nJefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship [433] The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations [434] Meacham opined that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren [435] The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S presidents, [436] and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president [437]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nJefferson is

the 1920s, Jefferson, together with George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, was chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in a stone national memorial at Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota [438]\n\n\nWritings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nScholarly studies\n\n\nThomas Jefferson Foundation sources\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nWeb site sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Thomas Jefferson\n\nThomas Jefferson was a leading figure in the American Enlightenment and the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. He was a skilled politician, architect, and writer who served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at the family's Shadwell Plantation in the British Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children. He was of English and possibly Welsh descent, and was born a British subject. His father, Peter Jefferson, was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen.\n\n## Early Life and Career\n\nJefferson began his education together with the Randolph children at Tuckahoe under tutors. He attended an English school at age five, and later enrolled in a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister, where he studied Latin, Greek, and French. He also began to study the natural world, which he grew to love. At this time, he learned to ride horses and developed an interest in books from his father's modest library. He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville, Virginia, where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family.\n\n## Lawyer and House of Burgesses\n\nJefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767, and lived with his mother at Shadwell. He represented Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1769 until 1775. He pursued reforms to slavery, including writing and sponsoring legislation in 1769 to strip power from the royal governor and courts, instead providing masters of slaves with the discretion to emancipate them. Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's passage, but it faced strong opposition in a state whose economy was largely agrarian.\n\n## Monticello, Marriage, and Family\n\nIn 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence, Monticello, whose name in Italian means \"Little Mountain\", on a hilltop overlooking his 5,000-acre (20 km2; 7.8 sq mi) plantation. He spent most of his adult life designing Monticello as an architect and was quoted as saying, \"Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.\" Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's slaves. He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770 Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project.\n\n## Revolutionary War\n\nJefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored. Jefferson was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.\n\n## Virginia State Legislator and Governor\n\nAt the start of the Revolution, Colonel Jefferson was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775. He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing the state constitution was a priority. He assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which prohibited state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine.\n\n## Notes on the State of Virginia\n\nIn 1780, Jefferson received from French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois a letter of inquiry into the geography, history, and government of Virginia, as part of a study of the United States. He organized his responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785). He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography. The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar.\n\n## Member of Congress\n\nJefferson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the Congress of the Confederation organized following the peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783. He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and recommended an American currency based on the decimal system that was adopted. He advised the formation of the Committee of the States to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess.\n\n## Minister to France\n\nOn May 7, 1784, Jefferson was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with Great Britain and other countries. With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month. He played a leading role in shaping U.S foreign policy.\n\n## Secretary of State\n\nSoon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted President Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State. Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. He opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of states' debts by the federal government.\n\n## Election of 1796 and Vice Presidency\n\nIn the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams 71–68 and was thus elected vice president. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams.\n\n## Election of 1800\n\nJefferson contended for president once more against John Adams in 1800. Adams' campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War. Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the French.\n\n## Presidency (1801–1809)\n\nJefferson was sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1801. His inauguration was not attended by outgoing President Adams. In contrast to his two predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette. Plainly dressed, he chose to walk alongside friends to the Capitol from his nearby boardinghouse that day instead of arriving by carriage.\n\n## Financial Affairs\n\nJefferson's first challenge as president was shrinking the $83 million national debt. He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury, Albert Gallatin. Gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes.\n\n## Domestic Affairs\n\nJefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Congressional Republicans repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams's \"midnight judges.\" A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Marbury v. Madison, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions.\n\n## Foreign Affairs (1801–1805)\n\nIn the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain. He secretly requested a two-million-dollar expenditure to purchase Florida, which was passed only after he successfully maneuvered to replace the floor leader. The law was later made public, but France refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control.\n\n## Embargo (1807–1809)\n\nIn December 1807, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree, globally banning British imports. King George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors. Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces.\n\n## Cabinet\n\nAfter his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders, including his two protégés, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president. The Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823.\n\n## University of Virginia\n\nJefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in new areas not offered at other colleges. He initially proposed his university in a letter to Joseph Priestley in 1800 and, in 1819, founded the University of Virginia. He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of Edmund Bacon, purchased the location.\n\n## Reconciliation with Adams\n\nJefferson and John Adams became good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks. An exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson.\n\n## Autobiography\n\nIn 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1790, in which he said he sought to \"state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself.\" He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights.\n\n## Greek War of Independence\n\nThomas Jefferson was a philhellene, lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the Greek War of Independence. He has been described as the most influential of the Founding Fathers who supported the Greek cause, viewing it as similar to the American Revolution. By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar Adamantios Korais. Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of Greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system.\n\n## Inventions\n\nJefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a \"Great Clock\" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing), and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity. Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the swivel chair.\n\n## Legacy\n\nJefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship. The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations.\n\n## Historical Reputation\n\nJefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship.

In the 1920s, Jefferson, together with George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, was chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in a stone national memorial at Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\n\n## Writings\n\nJefferson's writings include his Autobiography, Notes on the State of Virginia, and numerous letters and essays on politics, philosophy, and science. His writings provide valuable insights into the life and thought of one of America's founding fathers.\n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was a complex and multifaceted individual who played a significant role in shaping American history. From his early days as a young lawyer and politician to his later years as president and statesman, Jefferson's life was marked by his commitment to the principles of liberty, democracy, and individual rights. His legacy continues to be felt today, and his writings and ideas remain an important part of American cultural heritage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Thomas_Jefferson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and career\nJefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, Old Style, Julian calendar), at the family's Shadwell Plantation in the British Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children [8] He was of English and possibly Welsh descent, and was born a British subject [9] His father, Peter Jefferson, was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was Jane Randolph [c] Peter Jefferson moved his family to Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 on the death of William Randolph III, the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph's children The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell before October 1753 [11]\n\n\nEducation and early family life\nJefferson began his education together with the Randolph children at Tuckahoe under tutors [15] Thomas' father Peter, who was self-taught and regretted not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school at age five In 1752, at age nine, he attended a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love At this time he began studying Latin, Greek, and French, while learning to ride horses as well Thomas also read books from his father's modest library [16] He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend James Maury near Gordonsville, Virginia, where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family [16] [17] Jefferson came to know various American Indians, including the Cherokee chief Ostenaco, who often stopped at Shadwell to visit on their way to Williamsburg to trade [18] [19] In Williamsburg, the young Jefferson met and came to admire Patrick Henry, eight years his senior, and shared a common interest in the playing of the violin [20]\n\n\nLawyer and House of Burgesses\nJefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767, and lived with his mother at Shadwell [35] He represented Albemarle County in the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1769 until 1775 [36] He pursued reforms to slavery, including writing and sponsoring legislation in 1769 to strip power from the royal governor and courts, instead providing masters of slaves with the discretion to emancipate them Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's passage, but it faced strong opposition in a state whose economy was largely agrarian [37]\n\n\nMonticello, marriage, and family\nIn 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence, Monticello, whose name in Italian means \"Little Mountain\", on a hilltop overlooking his 5,000-acre (20 km2; 7.8 sq mi) plantation [d] He spent most of his adult life designing Monticello as an architect and was quoted as saying, \"Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favorite amusements.\" [44] Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's slaves [45] He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770 Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the Palladian style was his perennial project [46]\n\n\nRevolutionary War\nJefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence [61] At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored [62] Jefferson was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu [63]\n\n\nDeclaration of Independence\nJefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence [61] At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored [62] Jefferson was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, and the writings of Locke and Montesquieu [63]\n\n\nVirginia state legislator and governor\nAt the start of the Revolution, Colonel Jefferson was named commander of the Albemarle County Militia on September 26, 1775 [73] He was then elected to the Virginia House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing the state constitution was a priority [74] [75]\nFor nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which prohibited state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine [76] The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican Church, but both were later revived by James Madison [77]\n\n\nNotes on the State of Virginia\nIn 1780, Jefferson received from French diplomat François Barbé-Marbois a letter of inquiry into the geography, history, and government of Virginia, as part of a study of the United States Jefferson organized his responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) [91] He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography [92] The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery and miscegenation; he articulated his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved [93] He also wrote of his views on the American Indians, equating them to European settlers [94] [95]\n\n\nMember of Congress\nJefferson was appointed a Virginia delegate to the Congress of the Confederation organized following the peace treaty with Great Britain in 1783 He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and recommended an American currency based on the decimal system that was adopted [99] He advised the formation of the Committee of the States to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess [100] The committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional [101]\n\n\nMinister to France\nOn May 7, 1784, Jefferson was appointed by the Congress of the Confederation [i] to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with Great Britain and other countries [104] [j] With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month [106] [107] Jefferson had Patsy educated at the Pentemont Abbey Less than a year later he was assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to France French foreign minister Count de Vergennes commented, \"You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear.\" Jefferson replied, \"I succeed No man can replace him.\" [108] During his five years in Paris, Jefferson played a leading role in shaping U.S foreign policy [109]\n\n\nSecretary of State\nSoon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted President Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State [121] Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital He opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of states' debts by the federal government [122] Hamilton also had bold plans to establish national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from the cabinet He later left the cabinet voluntarily [123]\n\n\nElection of 1796 and vice presidency\nIn the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams 71–68 and was thus elected vice president As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an \"honorable and easy\" role [136] Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him quite qualified to serve as presiding officer In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as A Manual of Parliamentary Practice [137] He cast only three tie-breaking votes in the Senate.\n\n\nElection of 1800\nJefferson contended for president once more against John Adams in 1800 Adams' campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War [149] Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the French [150] Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was \"one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history\" [151]\n\n\nPresidency (1801–1809)\nJefferson was sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1801 His inauguration was not attended by outgoing President Adams In contrast to his two predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette Plainly dressed, he chose to walk alongside friends to the Capitol from his nearby boardinghouse that day instead of arriving by carriage [158] His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation and commitment to democratic ideology, declaring, \"We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.\" [159] [160] Ideologically, he stressed \"equal and exact justice to all men\", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press [161] He said that a free and republican government was \"the strongest government on earth.\" [161] He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state, Henry Dearborn as secretary of war, Levi Lincoln as attorney general, and Robert Smith as secretary of the navy [160]\n\n\nFinancial affairs\nJefferson's first challenge as president was shrinking the $83 million national debt [163] He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury, Albert Gallatin [160] Gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes [164] The administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing \"unnecessary offices\" and cutting \"useless establishments and expenses\" [165] [166]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nJefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts [170] Congressional Republicans repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams's \"midnight judges\" A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Marbury v Madison, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions [171] Jefferson appointed three Supreme Court justices: William Johnson (1804), Henry Brockholst Livingston (1807), and Thomas Todd (1807) [172]\n\n\nForeign affairs (1801–1805)\nAmerican merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies [176] After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785 In 1801, he authorized a U.S Navy fleet under Commodore Richard Dale to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic [177] Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war [177] The \"First Barbary War\" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S [178]\n\n\nFirst Barbary War\nAmerican merchant ships had been protected from Barbary Coast pirates by the Royal Navy when the states were British colonies [176] After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785 In 1801, he authorized a U.S Navy fleet under Commodore Richard Dale to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic [177] Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war [177] The \"First Barbary War\" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S [178]\n\n\nLouisiana Purchase\nSpain ceded ownership of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to France Jefferson was concerned that Napoleon's interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and Mississippi River shipping He wrote that the cession \"works most sorely on the U.S It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S.\" [182] In 1802, he instructed James Monroe and Robert R Livingston to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas [183] In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10 million for 40,000 square miles (100,000 square kilometres) of tropical territory [184]\n\n\nExpeditions\nJefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory He sought to establish a U.S claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored Northwest Passage [193] Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana (1763) and James Cook in the Pacific (1784), [194] and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean [195]\n\n\nNative American affairs\nJefferson refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were inferior and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent, [201] although he believed them to be inferior in terms of culture and technology [202] As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the Cherokee and Shawnee tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada [203] [204] In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to \"advance compactly as we multiply\" [205]\n\n\nRe-election in 1804 and second term\nJefferson was nominated for reelection by the Republican party, with George Clinton replacing Burr as his running mate [209] The Federalist party ran Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams's vice-presidential candidate in the 1800 election The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase [209]\n\n\nControversies\nFollowing the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic George Clinton.\n\n\nBurr conspiracy and trial\nFollowing the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his vice president, Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office Burr was dropped from the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1804 in favor of charismatic George Clinton.\n\n\nWilkinson's misconduct\nCommanding General James Wilkinson was a holdover of the Washington and Adams administrations In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000 pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans [231] Wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn This damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson and appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson's work ethic.\n\n\nForeign affairs (1805–1809)\nIn the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations [235] [236] A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two-million-dollar expenditure to purchase Florida Floor leader John Randolph opposed annexation and was upset over Jefferson's secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would land in the coffers of Napoleon [237] [236] The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with Barnabas Bidwell as floor leader [237] [236] This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over Congress Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806 Six weeks later the law was made public The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States France, however, refused the offer and Florida remained under Spanish control [238] [236] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters [239] [236]\n\n\nAttempted annexation of Florida\nIn the aftermath of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex West Florida from Spain In his annual message to Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations [235] [236] A few days

remained under Spanish control [238] [236] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters [239] [236]\n\n\nChesapeake–Leopard affair\nThe British conducted seizures of American shipping to search for British deserters from 1806 to 1807; American citizens were thus impressed into the British naval service In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and William Pinkney to negotiate an end to the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations The Monroe–Pinkney Treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions to end the British policies, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification [240]\n\n\nEmbargo (1807–1809)\nIn December 1807, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the Berlin Decree, globally banning British imports In Britain, King George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors But Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S for war Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces Meacham said that the Embargo Act was a projection of power that surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R B Bernstein said that Jefferson \"was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution\" [243]\n\n\nCabinet\nAfter his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823 [250] [251]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1809–1826)\nAfter his presidency, Jefferson remained influential and continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées, Madison and Monroe, who succeeded him as president); the Monroe Doctrine strongly resembles solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823 [250] [251]\n\n\nUniversity of Virginia\nJefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in new areas not offered at other colleges He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible based solely on ability [252] He initially proposed his university in a letter to Joseph Priestley in 1800 [253] and, in 1819, founded the University of Virginia He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of Edmund Bacon, purchased the location He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825 [254]\n\n\nReconciliation with Adams\nJefferson and John Adams became good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender Jefferson was angered by Adams' appointment of \"midnight judges\" [260] The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president [261] A brief correspondence took place between Abigail Adams and Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter Polly died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson [260]\n\n\nAutobiography\nIn 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1790, in which he said he sought to \"state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself\" [267] He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short [268] He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a \"strong mind and sound judgement\" He also addressed his enrollment in the College of William and Mary and his election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775 [267]\n\n\nGreek War of Independence\nThomas Jefferson was a philhellene, lover of Greek culture, who sympathized with the Greek War of Independence [270] [271] He has been described as the most influential of the Founding Fathers who supported the Greek cause, [271] [272] viewing it as similar to the American Revolution [273] By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging ideas with Greek scholar Adamantios Korais [271] Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system of Greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S state [274] He also suggested the application of a classical education system for the newly founded First Hellenic Republic [275] Jefferson's philosophical instructions were welcomed by the Greek people [275] Korais became one of the designers of the Greek constitution and urged his associates to study Jefferson's works and other literature from the American Revolution [275]\n\n\nLafayette's visit\nIn the summer of 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the country Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789 After visits to New York, New England, and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4 [254]\n\n\nFinal days, death, and burial\nJefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months, [citation needed] as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fundraiser [278] His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, and intestinal and urinary disorders [254] By June 1826, he was confined to bed [278] On July 3, overcome by fever, Jefferson declined an invitation to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration in Washington [279]\n\n\nPolitical, social, and religious views\nJefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton, whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived [294] [295] He was also influenced by the writings of Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire [296] Jefferson thought that the independent yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of republican virtues He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies He supported efforts to disestablish the Church of England, [297] wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and he pressed for a wall of separation between church and state [298] The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British Whig Party, which believed in limited government [299] His Democratic-Republican Party became dominant in early American politics, and his views became known as Jeffersonian democracy [300] [301]\n\n\nPhilosophy, society, and government\nJefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically; these show him to be well-read in the philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity Nevertheless, some scholars do not take Jefferson seriously as a philosopher mainly because he did not produce a formal work on philosophy However, he has been described as one of the most outstanding philosophical figures of his time because his work provided the theoretical background to, and the substance of, the social and political events of the revolutionary years and the development of the American Constitution in the 1770s and 1780s [302] Jefferson continued to attend to more theoretical questions of natural philosophy and subsequently left behind a rich philosophical legacy in the form of presidential messages, letters, and public papers [303]\n\n\nDemocracy\nJefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth [320] He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation [321]\n\n\nReligion\nBaptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters [332] Jefferson, however, spurned Biblical views of Christianity [333] Influenced by Deist authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned orthodox Christianity after his review of New Testament teachings [334] [335] Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a follower of the liberal religious strand of Deism that values reason over revelation [336] Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson asserted, \"I am Christian, in the only sense in which  [Jesus] wished any one to be\" [213]\n\n\nBanks\nJefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor [352] In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations [353]\n\n\nSlavery\nScholars give radically differing interpretations on Jefferson's views and relationship with slavery [7] Opinions range from \"emancipationists\" who view him as an early proto-abolitionist, who subsequently made pragmatic compromises with the slave power to preserve the union; to \"revisionists\", who argue that he in fact entrenched the institution in American society; with people also having more nuanced opinions, who either argue that Jefferson held inconsistent views on the institution throughout his lifetime or that both interpretations are too overly simplistic [7]\n\n\nJefferson–Hemings controversy\nClaims that Jefferson fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings after his wife's death have been debated since 1802 In that year James T Callender, after being denied a position as postmaster, alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her [388] In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a Y-DNA study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Hemings's son, Eston Hemings The results showed a match with the male Jefferson line [389] [390] Subsequently, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) formed a nine-member research team of historians to assess the matter [390] The TJF report concluded that \"the DNA study .. indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings\" [390] [391] [t] The TJF also concluded that Jefferson likely fathered all of Hemings's children listed at Monticello [390] [u]\n\n\nInterests and activities\nJefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means [401] and was always in debt [402] Jefferson also planted two vineyards at Monticello and hoped to grow Vitis vinifera, the European wine grape species, to make wine, but the crop failed His efforts were nonetheless an important contribution to the development of American viticulture [403]\n\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society\nJefferson was a member of the American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780 Through the society he advanced the sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom [410] His Notes on the State of Virginia was written in part as a contribution to the society [411] He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States [411] [412] In accepting, Jefferson stated: \"I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings.\" [410]\n\n\nLinguistics\nJefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics, and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German In his early years, he excelled in classical languages [418] [419] Jefferson later came to regard Greek as the \"perfect language\" as expressed in its laws and philosophy [420] While attending the College of William & Mary, he taught himself Italian [421] Here Jefferson first became familiar with the Anglo-Saxon language, studying it in a linguistic and philosophical capacity He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language [418] Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of Don Quixote [422]\n\n\nInventions\nJefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a \"Great Clock\" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing), [428] and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity [429] Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the swivel chair, the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence [430] He first opposed patents but later supported them In 1790–1793, as Secretary of State, he was the ex officio head of the three-person patent review board He drafted reforms of US patent law which led to him being relieved of this duty in 1793, and also drastically changed the patent system [431]\n\n\nLegacy\nJefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship [433] The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations [434] Meacham opined that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential adherents James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren [435] The Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S presidents, [436] and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president [437]\n\n\nHistorical reputation\nJefferson is seen as an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the

sword\nAfter giving up the Ebony Blade, Whitman designed and constructed a neural sword The neural sword appears to be made of a laser beam and cuts through non-living matter Its \"laser\" blade is a neural disruptor when used against living beings; when Whitman cuts someone with the sword, it delivers a massive jolt to the being's central nervous system This jolt is usually enough to incapacitate someone within just a few hits Alternately, Whitman can reverse the neural sword's energy stream so that it encases its hilt and, by extension, Whitman's fist in a high-energy field Using the sword in this fashion enables Whitman to punch with some unspecified degree of enhanced strength The neural sword also creates a refraction field used to defend against energy-based attacks The blade also

being controlled by the Ego gem and captured him and Ultraforce for Loki Black Knight and the rest of the team escaped [55] In a dispute between Loki and the Grandmaster for the possession of the Infinity Gems, the heroes of Ultraforce were put against his counterparts of Earth-616: the Avengers The Black Knight was left as a wild card in the competition Loki won but when the six original gems were reunited, the combined sentient power of the Gems was revealed as the entity Nemesis [56] The entity began to create a mixed reality when she combined elements of Ultraverse and Marvel Both teams joined forces against Nemesis and The Black Knight struck a blow to Nemesis with a Nazi Ebony Sword that scattered the Infinity gems [57] Because of this, the Ultraverse was affected by a reality-warping event called Black September, after which Dane Whitman become the leader of Ultraforce [58] As leader, Dane Whitman brought Ultraforce in line, adopting new methods, bringing new

energy projectile [63]\n\n\nNew Excalibur\nWhitman reappears in New Excalibur in the mid-2000s He has opened up a museum in England chronicling the Black Knights that have existed throughout history Whitman learns that Sir Percy was not the original Black Knight, but that eight men had held the Ebony Blade prior to him The Ebony Blade, however, corrupted these men, and Sir Percy was deemed the only one who was noble enough to wield the Blade Also at this time, Merlin told Whitman that he must not destroy the Blade as he had previously been told to do It is not clear whether he has access to his Avalonian equipment at present In New Excalibur, Whitman is invited to join the team, but after the second adventure with them he refuses, as he believes that his Ebony Blade is not the real one

attacked and nearly killed a new version of Savage Steel due to the influence of the Ebony Blade Rebecca pleads with him to turn over the sword to S.H.I.E.L.D or the Avengers, reasoning that its bloodlust is driving him mad, but Whitman refuses Despite his assurance that he is fine, his home is seen covered in slash marks, with Whitman himself curled up on the floor in a mentally unhinged state He is also seen threatening to slay Rebecca with the Blade, but she remains unaware of the danger [74]\n\n\nJourney to Weirdworld\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, the Black

Zaltin Tar to establish New Avalon and builds an army with the help of two warriors named Shield and Spear [77] Black Knight has the army built in anticipation of the arrival of the Avengers Unity Division, who are seeking to bring him to justice [78] After struggling to maintain his sanity, Whitman is forced to battle the Uncanny Avengers, led by the aged Steve Rogers, who wish to arrest him for killing a criminal when he was still part of the Avengers team [79] It is revealed that Whitman accidentally entered Weirdworld, along with a HYDRA submarine, from 1945 The members of Hydra on board the submarine became the group known as the Fangs of the Serpent to the inhabitants of Weirdworld [80] As the Uncanny Avengers arrive to arrest Whitman, he unites the armies of the land to fight against them Eventually, he is defeated and a truce is made: Rogers will take the Ebony Blade back to Earth and Whitman will be free to rule New Avalon However, Rogers is possessed by the Blade and attacks his teammates [81] Meanwhile, the son of the king that Whitman overthrew to become the new lord gathers the Fangs of the Serpent to attack Whitman After their defeat, Rogers and Doctor Voodoo agree that the only person who can bear the toll of the Ebony Blade is Whitman, and the Blade also shows this by not allowing any harm to come to Whitman As the Avengers leave, leaving behind an expert on the Black Knight who came with them to look after Whitman, it is concluded that Whitman had been maintaining his sanity better than everyone had thought Whitman concludes that for now ruling New Avalon is good, and the story ends on a light tone, Whitman not being persecuted as he has suffered enough under the Blade's spell [80]\n\n\nReturn to heroic activity\nDuring \"Secret Empire\",

fighters as Captain America and Wolverine [93] He is an expert horseman as well \n\n\nWeapons and equipment\nDane Whitman eventually gained the Ebony Blade, [96] a weapon that had been passed down

for most of that interval (24 January 1915 to 15 July 1917), it was merged with Iorga's Drum Drept [3] During this stage of its existence, it became mocked by the post-Symbolist poet and journalist Ion Vinea, who took Ramuri and Sămănătorul as icons of incompetence As Vinea put it, his and Aderca's new poetry could not by understood by such critics, since \"they're so uncultured that they think the end of a line is where they're supposed to breathe out.\" [18] This period saw Romania entry into World War I Ramuri lost two members of its staff during the subsequent campaigns of September 1916: Volovici died in the Battle of Transylvania, and administrative director Tiberiu Constantinescu was killed at Turtucaia [19] The magazine was printed at Bucharest throughout that year, at Iași in 1917 (during The Romanian Debacle), and not published at all in 1918 [3]\n\n\n1930s and '40s\nIn a 1927 article for Sburătorul, which spoke of Sămănătorism as being soundly defeated, Aderca also noted that Făgețel was no longer interested in editorial work, and was mainly a printer, as well as a perennial candidate for the office of Craiova Mayor [31] This account is partly supported by Iorga According to him, Făgețel had run the Ramuri enterprise into debt, and as a result had tried to win favors from the political establishment, joining the National Liberal Party [32] Aderca also noted that the defense of aesthetic traditionalism fell exclusively on Tomescu, whose long topical essay was hosted by Ramuri To the rise of modernist culture, Tomescu was opposing the poetry of apparent neo-Sămănătorists, including Voiculescu and Radu Gyr [31] With Iorga no longer in charge, in mid-1929 Arghezi published in Ramuri a tribute to Aderca himself, described therein as one of the most accomplished aesthetes in modern Romania [33] As remarked by journalist A P Samson, Ramuri had \"discarded N Iorga's directional flashes in favor of being nudged into potholes by Tudor Arghezi, who is strong as a poet, but a scatographer in his prose\" [34]\n\n\n1964–1978\nThe magazine was revived as a monthly publication appearing at Craiova from August 1964 That date was selected to coincide with the 20th Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day—marked as a national holiday in the Romanian People's Republic [58] The issue opened with an account by Arghezi, describing his feelings about the Oltenian town of Târgu Cărbunești; also included were included lyrics by Marin Sorescu and Nicolae Dragoș  [ro] [58] Much of the issue was Brâncuși-themed, with a portrait of him as a symbol of the magazine itself, done by Benedict Gănescu, [59] alongside the summary of a round-table on the life and times of Brâncuși (with participants such as André Frénaud) [58] [60] Beginning with the second issue, Ramuri had contributions from an old collaborator, Vianu, as well as from Vianu's colleague George Călinescu [60] The staff chronicler at Luceafărul was more impressed by the third issue, which established Ramuri as \"one of the most interesting profiles in our press, both in what it publishes and in its graphic format.\" Returning with a historical essay on Constantin Brâncoveanu, contributed by Paul Anghel, this issue also had critical takes on new Romanian poetry (one by Alexandru A Philippide, the other by Carlo Salinari), and an analysis of the standard Romanian literary schoolbook, by George Muntean [61] Arghezi returned in 1965 with quasi-sociological musings about Oltenia, describing Oltenian migrations to other areas of Romania as not unlike the seasonal migration of swallows, and expressing his verdict that Romanians and Bukovinans formed the best two specimens of the Romanian people [22]\n\n\nPurcaru and Paraschivescu\nThe magazine was revived as a monthly publication appearing at Craiova from August 1964 That date was selected to coincide with the 20th Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day—marked as a national holiday in the Romanian People's Republic [58] The issue opened with an account by Arghezi, describing his feelings about the Oltenian town of Târgu Cărbunești;

their activities focused on recovering contributions by other old-regime figures, including Brâncuși and novelist Gib Mihăescu [75] Ramuri's enduring interest in reconnecting with old-regime literature was another topic of interest for observers in the diaspora, but also a source of irritation for the regime at home As early as 1961, Securitate spies heard reports that Paraschivescu was supporting the rehabilitation of Nae Ionescu—officially still reviled as an ideologue of the Iron Guard—, on grounds that Ionescu was primarily a \"man of talent\" [76] In February 1968, Mircea Eliade, the self-exiled philosopher and culture critic, reported his astonishment that Ramuri had been allowed to host a retrospective on Ionescu, who had been his own intellectual master Eliade feared that \"such 'excesses' might be used by the Stalinists (or whatever they're called) to turn the screws back on them.\" [77] In April, as leader of the Communist-Party cell in Craiova, Ștefan Voitec both praised and chided Ramuri: the magazine had a \"luminous tradition\", but had allowed itself to publish promote a \"distorted image of  [Ionescu], glossing over his reactionary ideas.\" [78] A case file in the Securitate archive, compiled shortly after, spoke of Ramuri as reviving fascism This source focused its report on Purcaru's editorial praise of Ionescu, and noted that Ramuri had almost succeeded in publishing articles by surviving former members of the Iron Guard and the National Christian Party [79]\n\n\n1978–present\nSorescu's promotion to manager of Ramuri, made official on 15 July 1978, [88] brought in a number of changes, and earned him the respect of other cultural figures According to a September note by poet Nicolae Prelipceanu  [ro], his arrival was a qualitative boost for Ramuri—introducing the public to new talents, such as Dorin Tudoran and Ion Cocora [89] During Sorescu's period as editor, with Diaconescu kept on as the second editor, Ramuri was primarily a poetry magazine, and had a mild regionalist focus [60] The publishing venue had also employed Sîrbu, who was a known dissident and a former political prisoner Reportedly, the Transylvanian Sîrbu, who deeply resented Craiova as his place of exile in the Balkans, also had an ongoing rivalry with Firan; he only enjoyed the company of G T Pop (who was himself of Transylvanian origin) [90] Sîrbu's exact relationship with Sorescu is the topic of dispute: some witnesses argue that they were friends, [91] though Sîrbu denied this in his diaries Also according to Sîrbu: \"When I come up to visit Ramuri's offices (which I only do at solstice), they all stop talking and turn pale: they all act as if one of them—who exactly, I couldn't tell you—has just been castrated on the spot, without anesthesia, but they're not to talk about it.\" [92] Overall, Sîrbu's presence made the magazine a target of constant surveillance by the Securitate, who relied on a growing network of Craiova informants Building on documents provided by historian Clara Mareș in 2012, literary critic Dan C Mihăilescu  [ro] opined that the network must have included Sorescu himself, who \"managed to both inform on Sîrbu and protect him, being, as it turns out, himself the target of surveillance\";

[114] Ramuri never printed issues for November and December 1989 [60] That period also witnessed Sîrbu's death in Craiova The funeral, which had two writers and two Jiu Valley miners as pallbearers, was attended by at least some of Ramuri's editors [115] According to Nedelcea, Sorescu, though mainly active from Bucharest, was still manager of Ramuri during the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, which ended communism As reported by the same source, Sorescu was invited to participate in the revolutionary events, but refrained from such engagements; Nedelcea also argues that foreign powers extended his friend an offer to take over as President of Romania, but that Sorescu again declined, after realizing that he was expected to endorse Transylvanian devolution in exchange for such honors [116]\n\n\nNotes\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Ramuri**\n\nRamuri was a Romanian literary magazine that existed in various forms from 1905 to 1978, with a brief revival in the 1980s. The magazine was known for its cultural and literary contributions, and its history reflects the tumultuous changes that Romania underwent in the 20th century.\n\n**1905-1947**\n\nThe first period of Ramuri was closely tied to the cultural life of the Kingdom of Romania. The magazine was preceded by N Popescu-Gorgota's Noua Revistă Olteană, which appeared at Craiova and had many of the same contributors. Ramuri emerged as a regional satellite of the influential Sămănătorul magazine, which was put out from Bucharest by Nicolae Iorga and Constantin Șaban Făgețel. However, by the time Ramuri was ready for print, Iorga's doctrines were being overshadowed, and the magazine had the misfortune of long-surviving the current that had overseen its birth.\n\nRamuri first appeared on December 5, 1905, and continued until May 1947, with interruptions, changes in publication location, and frequency. Initially, it was a monthly publication, then a bimonthly in 1908-1910, and a weekly in October 1910-May 1911. In 1913, it was subtitled \"Illustrated literary magazine.\" During this period, Ramuri created its own publishing house and printing office, which was formally established in 1915.\n\n**Iorga's tenure**\n\nDuring Iorga's tenure, Ramuri reappeared as a literary weekly in 1915-1916. For most of this interval, it was merged with Iorga's Drum Drept. During this stage, Ramuri became mocked by the post-Symbolist poet and journalist Ion Vinea, who took Ramuri and Sămănătorul as icons of incompetence. This period saw Romania's entry into World War I, and Ramuri lost two members of its staff during the subsequent campaigns.\n\n**1930s and '40s**\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Ramuri continued to be a prominent literary magazine in Romania. However, its fortunes began to decline, and it became a target of criticism from modernist writers and critics. In the 1940s, Ramuri's editor, Nicolae Iorga, was forced to flee Romania, and the magazine was suspended.\n\n**1964-1978**\n\nIn 1964, Ramuri was revived as a monthly publication appearing at Craiova. The first issue was dated August 1964, and it coincided with the 20th Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day, which was marked as a national holiday in the Romanian People's Republic. The issue opened with an account by Arghezi, describing his feelings about the Oltenian town of Târgu Cărbunești.\n\n**Purcaru and Paraschivescu**\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Ramuri was edited by Mircea Purcaru, who was a prominent figure in Romanian literature. During this period, Ramuri became a platform for the rehabilitation of old-regime literature and the promotion of new writers. However, this also made the magazine a target of criticism from the regime, which saw it as a threat to its authority.\n\n**Sorescu's promotion**\n\nIn 1978, Marin Sorescu was promoted to manager of Ramuri, which brought a number of changes to the magazine. Sorescu's arrival was seen as a qualitative boost for Ramuri, introducing the public to new talents and promoting a more regionalist focus.\n\n**Securitate surveillance**\n\nDuring Sorescu's period as editor, Ramuri was subject to constant surveillance by the Securitate, who relied on a network of Craiova informants. Some witnesses argue that Sorescu was friends with Sîrbu, while others deny this. Sîrbu's exact relationship with Sorescu is the topic of dispute, but it is clear that his presence made the magazine a target of constant surveillance.\n\n**1989 Revolution and aftermath**\n\nThe July 1989 issue of Ramuri appeared with significant and unexplained delay. Rumors collected at the time had it that the magazine had not been sufficiently enthusiastic in covering preparations for the 14th Communist Party Congress. This period also witnessed Sîrbu's death in Craiova, and Sorescu's decline in influence.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ramuri\" following this outline:\n\n\n1905–1947\nThe magazine's first period was tied to the cultural life of what was back then the Kingdom of Romania Ramuri was closely preceded by N Popescu-Gorgota's Noua Revistă Olteană, also appearing at Craiova, which had many of the same contributors and is described by scholar Florea Firan  [ro] as a predecessor;

for most of that interval (24 January 1915 to 15 July 1917), it was merged with Iorga's Drum Drept [3] During this stage of its existence, it became mocked by the post-Symbolist poet and journalist Ion Vinea, who took Ramuri and Sămănătorul as icons of incompetence As Vinea put it, his and Aderca's new poetry could not by understood by such critics, since \"they're so uncultured that they think the end of a line is where they're supposed to breathe out.\" [18] This period saw Romania entry into World War I Ramuri lost two members of its staff during the subsequent campaigns of September 1916: Volovici died in the Battle of Transylvania, and administrative director Tiberiu Constantinescu was killed at Turtucaia [19] The magazine was printed at Bucharest throughout that year, at Iași in 1917 (during The Romanian Debacle), and not published at all in 1918 [3]\n\n\n1930s and '40s\nIn a 1927 article for Sburătorul, which spoke of Sămănătorism as being soundly defeated, Aderca also noted that Făgețel was no longer interested in editorial work, and was mainly a printer, as well as a perennial candidate for the office of Craiova Mayor [31] This account is partly supported by Iorga According to him, Făgețel had run the Ramuri enterprise into debt, and as a result had tried to win favors from the political establishment, joining the National Liberal Party [32] Aderca also noted that the defense of aesthetic traditionalism fell exclusively on Tomescu, whose long topical essay was hosted by Ramuri To the rise of modernist culture, Tomescu was opposing the poetry of apparent neo-Sămănătorists, including Voiculescu and Radu Gyr [31] With Iorga no longer in charge, in mid-1929 Arghezi published in Ramuri a tribute to Aderca himself, described therein as one of the most accomplished aesthetes in modern Romania [33] As remarked by journalist A P Samson, Ramuri had \"discarded N Iorga's directional flashes in favor of being nudged into potholes by Tudor Arghezi, who is strong as a poet, but a scatographer in his prose\" [34]\n\n\n1964–1978\nThe magazine was revived as a monthly publication appearing at Craiova from August 1964 That date was selected to coincide with the 20th Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day—marked as a national holiday in the Romanian People's Republic [58] The issue opened with an account by Arghezi, describing his feelings about the Oltenian town of Târgu Cărbunești;

He is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and beloved sports commentators of all time, known for his loud, enthusiastic, and often humorous commentary style.\n\nEarly Life\n\nGraeme Murray Walker was born on 10 October 1923 at 214 Reddings Lane in Hall Green, Birmingham, England. His family is of Scottish descent, and his father, Graham Walker, was a despatch rider and works motorcyclist for the Norton Motorcycle Company. Graham Walker also participated in the Isle of Man TT, one of the most prestigious motorcycle racing events in the world. Murray's mother, Elsie Spratt, was the daughter of Harry Spratt, a businessman from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.\n\nWalker was an only child, and his family moved frequently during his childhood. In 1925, they moved to Wolverhampton, where Graham Walker became the Competition Manager for Sunbeam. Five years later, in 1928, they moved to Coventry, where Graham Walker worked as the Sales and Competition Director for Rudge-Whitworth.\n\nCareer as a Commentator\n\nWalker made his first public broadcast at Shelsley Walsh hillclimb in 1948. He was given a recorded audition for the BBC at the 1949 Easter Monday Goodwood race, and he later commentated on races alongside the tennis commentator Max Robertson. His first radio broadcasting came at the 1949 British Grand Prix for the BBC, where he and Robertson were positioned at Stowe corner.\n\nHis debut television broadcast came in the same year, when he commentated on hill-climbing at the Knatts Valley motorcycle venue in Kent. Walker's first regular broadcasting work was on radio coverage of the Isle of Man annual Tourist Trophy motorcycle race alongside his father. They became the single father and son sports commentary pair within the BBC from 1949 to 1962.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1962, Walker became the BBC's chief motorcycling commentator. He went on to commentate on numerous high-profile motorcycling events, including the Isle of Man TT and the British Grand Prix. Walker's commentary style was characterized by his loud, enthusiastic, and often humorous approach, which endeared him to audiences around the world.\n\nLater Years\n\nWalker was retained by ITV on a part-time role reviewing the 2002 season at various points. He published his autobiography, \"Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken,\" in late 2002. The book was a bestseller, and Walker began to compose it in early 2001. He negotiated payment of the book sales with the publishers HarperCollins and ventured to various worldwide locations to promote it.\n\nIn 2003, Walker competed in Australia's Targa Tasmania tarmac rally road race as navigator to driver Colin Bond in a Toyota Team Racing-entered Toyota Camry Sportivo. They finished second in their class and 44th overall. Walker navigated former Grand Prix competitor Chris Amon in a Toyota Camry Sportivo at the Targa New Zealand that took place five months later, where they finished eighth in their class and 114th outright.\n\nCommentary Style\n\nWalker chose to stand while commentating during races rather than sitting down, allowing him to speak louder due to his lungs being inflated and his shoulders pushed back. He was uncritical of drivers who had made errors, preferring to let that judgement pass to his co-commentators. Walker was articulate in his speech, and he was a good reader of mood after an on-track incident.\n\nWalker sometimes made humorous verbal errors known as \"Murrayisms,\" which ranged from simple misidentifications to labyrinthian, effortlessly complex acrobatic displays of linguistic virtuosity. According to Stephen Moss of The Guardian, they were the hallmark of his commentary over the years and made him the fan who happened to have been given the keys to the commentary box: he couldn't control his enthusiasm and that seemed naturally to lead to catastrophe.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDespite his love of cars, Walker never took a driving test. He was given a tank driving licence in the British Army, and that was considered valid to qualify for a civilian driving licence. Walker married his wife Elizabeth in 1955, and the couple had no children.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Murray Walker Award was established by Motorsport UK in 2023 and is awarded in recognition of outstanding excellence in broadcast journalism. The award is a testament to Walker's enduring legacy as one of the most iconic and beloved sports commentators of all time.\n\nBibliography\n\n* \"Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken\" (2002)\n\nReferences\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Murray_Walker\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGraeme Murray Walker was born at 214 Reddings Lane in Hall Green, Birmingham, England, on 10 October 1923 [4] His family is of Scottish descent [5] His father Graham Walker was a despatch rider and works motorcyclist for the Norton Motorcycle Company who participated in the Isle of Man TT His mother, Elsie Spratt, was the daughter of Harry Spratt, a businessman from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire [4] Walker was an only child [6] In 1925 Walker and his family moved to Wolverhampton when Graham became the Competition Manager for Sunbeam The family later moved to Coventry in 1928, when Graham worked as the Sales and Competition Director for Rudge-Whitworth [4]\n\n\nCareer as a commentator\nWalker made his first public broadcast at Shelsley Walsh hillclimb in 1948 [6] [17] He was given a recorded audition for the BBC at the 1949 Easter Monday Goodwood race Walker later commentated on races alongside the tennis commentator Max Robertson, with his first radio broadcasting coming at the 1949 British Grand Prix for the BBC He and Robertson were positioned at Stowe corner for the event [9] His debut television broadcast came in the same year when he commentated on hill-climbing at the Knatts Valley motorcycle venue in Kent [6] [12] His first regular broadcasting work was on radio coverage of the Isle of Man annual Tourist Trophy motorcycle race alongside his father [4] Walker and his father were the single father and son sports commentary pair within the BBC from 1949 to 1962 After the death of his father in 1962, he became the BBC's chief motorcycling commentator [12]\n\n\nLater years\nHe was retained by ITV on a part-time role reviewing the 2002 season at various points [36] Walker's autobiography, Unless I'm Very Much Mistaken, was published in late 2002 [5] [37] He had eight publishers who wanted to put out the book, [19] and he began to compose it in early 2001 [38] Walker negotiated payment of the book sales with the publishers HarperCollins, [5] and he ventured to various worldwide locations to promote it [a] [40] He competed in Australia's Targa Tasmania tarmac rally road race as navigator to driver Colin Bond in a Toyota Team Racing-entered Toyota Camry Sportivo in May 2003, finishing second in their class and 44th overall [41] Walker navigated former Grand Prix competitor Chris Amon in a Toyota Camry Sportivo at the Targa New Zealand that took place five months later, where they finished eighth in their class and 114th outright [42]\n\n\nCommentary style\nWalker chose to stand while commentating during races rather than sitting down, allowing him to speak louder due to his lungs being inflated and his shoulders pushed back [74] He was uncritical of drivers who had made errors, preferring to let that judgement pass to his co-commentators [75] Walker was articulate in his speech, and he was a good reader of mood after an on-track incident [76] He sometimes made humorous verbal errors known as \"Murrayisms\" that ranged from \"simple misidentifications\" to \"lovely, labyrinthian, effortlessly complex acrobatic displays of linguistic virtuosity.\" [77] According to Stephen Moss of The Guardian, they were \"the hallmark of his commentary over the years\" and noted that they made him \"the fan who happened to have been given the keys to the commentary box: he couldn't control his enthusiasm and that seemed naturally to lead to catastrophe.\" [3] Moss likened Walker's commentary voice to a \"screech and resembles a 500cc engine being revved up\" because he required \"a harsh, aggressive, noisy, fast-moving voice\" to comment on a constantly changing landscape [3]\n\n\nPersonal life\nDespite his love of cars, Walker never took a driving test He was given a tank driving licence in the British Army and that was considered valid to qualify for a civilian driving licence [81] He married his wife Elizabeth in 1955; the couple had no children [4]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe Murray Walker Award was established by Motorsport UK in 2023 and is awarded in recognition of \"outstanding excellence in broadcast journalism.\" [87]\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nAutobiography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term \"oligarch\" was first used in the 1990s to describe a group of powerful business leaders who emerged during the privatization of state-owned enterprises in Russia. These individuals were often associated with the Russian government and played a significant role in shaping the country's economic and political landscape.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe rise of the Russian oligarchs is closely tied to the country's transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a power vacuum that allowed entrepreneurs to seize opportunities and build their fortunes. Many of these individuals had connections to the Soviet government and used their influence to gain control over key industries and assets.\n\n**Yeltsin Era, 1991-1999**\n\nDuring Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika (restructuring) program, many businessmen in Russia imported goods such as personal computers and jeans into the country and sold them for a hefty profit. This created a new class of entrepreneurs who were willing to take risks and invest in the emerging market. As the Soviet economy collapsed, these entrepreneurs saw opportunities to purchase state-owned enterprises at discounted prices and rebuild them into successful businesses.\n\nEconomists Sergei Guriev and Andrei Rachinsky contrast older oligarchs with nomenklatura ties and younger-generation entrepreneurs such as Kakha Bendukidze who built their wealth from scratch. Bendukidze's success was due in part to the co-existence of regulated and quasi-market prices, which created huge opportunities for arbitrage. This period also saw the emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurs who were willing to challenge the established order and take risks to build their businesses.\n\n**Emergence**\n\nThe emergence of the oligarchs was facilitated by the Russian government's policies, which encouraged the privatization of state-owned enterprises. The government offered shares in these companies to the public, but many of these shares were bought up by a small group of wealthy individuals who had connections to the government. These individuals used their influence to gain control over the companies and then sell them off for a profit.\n\nThe Young Reformers, a group of economists led by Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais, played a key role in shaping the country's economic policy. They were responsible for implementing the privatization program and creating a market-based economy. However, their efforts were also criticized for creating a system that was favorable to the wealthy and powerful.\n\n**Political Support**\n\nThe oligarchs received significant support from the Russian government, particularly during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin's government saw the oligarchs as a way to create a new class of entrepreneurs who could help to modernize the country's economy. The government provided the oligarchs with access to capital, land, and other resources, which they used to build their businesses.\n\nThe oligarchs also received significant support from the Russian government in terms of political influence. Many of the oligarchs had close ties to the government and used their influence to shape policy and gain access to valuable resources. This created a system in which the wealthy and powerful had a disproportionate amount of influence over the government.\n\n**Putin Era, 1999-2022 (Prior to the Invasion of Ukraine)**\n\nThe influence of the Yeltsin oligarchs dissipated with the ascent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Some of the oligarchs were imprisoned, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Mikhael Mirilashvili, while others emigrated, sold off their assets, or died under suspicious circumstances. The most prominent oligarch, Vladimir Gusinsky of MediaMost, avoided legal proceedings by leaving Russia.\n\nThe Putin era saw the emergence of a new group of oligarchs who were more closely tied to the government. These individuals were often associated with the Russian military and security services and used their influence to gain control over key industries and assets. The most prominent of these oligarchs included Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska, and Viktor Vekselberg.\n\n**Prominent Putin-Era Oligarchs**\n\nThe ten most-prominent oligarchs of the early Putin era included Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Arkady Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, Andrey Guryev, and Vitaly Malkin. These individuals were known for their close ties to the Russian government and their control over key industries and assets.\n\n**2008 Global Recession and Credit Crisis**\n\nThe global financial crisis of 2008 had a significant impact on the Russian economy and the oligarchs. The country's stock market plummeted, and many of the oligarchs saw their fortunes decline. According to Bloomberg, Russia's wealthiest 25 individuals collectively lost $230 billion since July 2008.\n\nThe fall in the oligarchs' wealth was closely tied to the meltdown in Russia's stock market. The RTS Index had lost 71% of its value by 2008, due to the capital flight after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008. This created a significant decline in the value of many of the oligarchs' assets, including their stocks and other investments.\n\n**Putin Era, 2022 Invasion of Ukraine and International Sanctions**\n\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has had a significant impact on the Russian oligarchs. The international community, led by the United States and European Union, has imposed significant sanctions on Russia and its leaders. These sanctions have targeted the oligarchs directly, freezing their assets and limiting their access to capital.\n\nThe oligarchs have responded to the sanctions by hiding their wealth and attempting to prevent the Western nations from freezing their assets. However, the impact of the sanctions on the war is unknown, due to Putin's power over those that were sanctioned.\n\nNine of the Russian oligarchs' yachts have turned off their navigation transponders since the invasion began, suggesting that they are attempting to avoid detection and seizure. This has raised concerns about the use of luxury goods to facilitate illicit activities and the potential for money laundering.\n\n**Russian Oligarchs in London**\n\nThe British Government has encouraged the flow of foreign capital into the United Kingdom, particularly through the foreign investor visa routes introduced during John Major's premiership in 1994. One-fifth of the recipients of these visas since 2008 are Russian citizens. This has created a significant presence of Russian oligarchs in London, who have invested heavily in the city's real estate and other assets.\n\nThe presence of Russian oligarchs in London has raised concerns about money laundering and the potential for illicit activities. However, the British Government has taken steps to address these concerns, including the introduction of new regulations and increased transparency requirements.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Russian oligarchs have played a significant role in shaping the country's economic and political landscape. From their emergence in the 1990s to their current status as influential business leaders, the oligarchs have used their wealth and power to gain control over key industries and assets. However, their influence has also been criticized for creating a system that is favorable to the wealthy and powerful, and for perpetuating corruption and money laundering.\n\nThe current sanctions imposed on Russia and its leaders have had a significant impact on the oligarchs, but the full extent of their impact is unknown. The future of the Russian oligarchs and their role in the country's economy and politics remains uncertain.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_oligarch\" following this outline:\n\n\nYeltsin era, 1991–1999\nDuring Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika (c. 1985–1991), many businessmen in Russia imported goods such as personal computers and jeans into the country and sold them for a hefty profit.\n\n\nEmergence\nEconomists Sergei Guriev and Andrei Rachinsky contrast older oligarchs with nomenklatura ties and younger-generation entrepreneurs such as Kakha Bendukidze who built their wealth from scratch because Gorbachev's reforms affected a period \"when co-existence of regulated and quasi-market prices created huge opportunities for arbitrage.\" [11]\n\n\nPolitical support\nEconomist Yegor Gaidar worked in a Soviet Academy of Sciences think tank modelled after RAND [17] Gaidar later became the economics editor of the Kommunist journal, the official theoretical organ of the CC of the CPSU He also held various positions, including Prime Minister in the Russian government during 1991–1992 [18] Together with Anatoly Chubais, the two \"Young Reformers\" were chiefly responsible for privatization in the early 1990s [19] [20] [21] According to David Satter, \"what drove the process was not the determination to create a system based on universal values but rather the will to introduce a system of private ownership, which, in the absence of law, opened the way for the criminal pursuit of money and power\" [22] [4]\n\n\nPutin era, 1999–2022 (prior to the invasion of Ukraine)\nWith the ascent of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin the influence of the Yeltsin oligarchs dissipated, as some were imprisoned, such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky (pictured here) and Mikhael Mirilashvili, while others emigrated, sold off their assets or died under suspicious circumstances, such as Vladimir Vinogradov and Boris Berezovsky A number of Yeltsin oligarchs first came under fire for alleged tax evasion [25] [26] Vladimir Gusinsky of MediaMost and Boris Berezovsky both avoided legal proceedings by leaving Russia, and the most prominent, Mikhail Khodorkovsky of Yukos oil, was arrested in October 2003 and sentenced to 9 years This was subsequently extended to 14 years, and after Putin pardoned him, he was released on 20 December 2013 [27]\n\n\nProminent Putin-era oligarchs\nThe ten most-prominent oligarchs of the early Putin era included Roman Abramovich, Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Prokhorov, Alisher Usmanov, Viktor Vekselberg, Leonid Mikhelson, Arkady Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, Andrey Guryev and Vitaly Malkin [37] In 2004, five years after Putin's ascend to power, Forbes listed 36 billionaires of Russian citizenship, with a note: \"this list includes businessmen of Russian citizenship who acquired the major share of their wealth privately, while not holding a governmental position\" In 2005, the number of billionaires dropped to 30, mostly because of the Yukos case, with Khodorkovsky dropping from No 1 (US$15.2 billion) to No 21 (US$2.0 billion) A 2013 report by Credit Suisse found that 35% of the wealth of Russia was owned by the wealthiest 110 individuals [38] [33]\n\n\n2008 global recession and credit crisis\nAccording to the financial news-agency Bloomberg L.P., Russia's wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost US$230 billion (£146 billion) since July 2008 [45] [46] [47] The fall in the oligarchs' wealth relates closely to the meltdown in Russia's stock market, as by 2008 the RTS Index had lost 71% of its value due to the capital flight after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 [48]\n\n\nPutin era, 2022 invasion of Ukraine and international sanctions\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Canada, US, and European leaders with the addition of Japan, took unprecedented steps to sanction Putin and the oligarchs directly [50] In response to the sanctions, the targeted oligarchs started to hide wealth in an attempt to prevent the Western nations from freezing their assets [51] These sanctions intend to directly impact the Russian ruling class as a response for their perceived contribution and acquiescence to the war with Ukraine Although the sanctions miss some of the richest oligarchs, the impact on the war is unknown due to Putin's power over those that were sanctioned [52] Since the invasion began, nine of the Russian oligarchs' yachts have turned their navigation transponders off as they sail to ports where they are less likely to be searched and seized [50]\n\n\nRussian oligarchs in London\nThe British Government policy encouraged the flow of foreign capital into the United Kingdom, for example through the foreign investor visa routes, introduced during John Major's premiership in 1994, one-fifth of whose recipients since 2008 are Russian citizens [99]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

starting with the first season; [11] the production companies Fremulon and 3 Arts Entertainment also became involved with the show starting with the second season [96] The series was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who served as executive producers along with Howard Klein Klein previously worked with Daniels and Schur on The Office, a half-hour NBC comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Schur served as the showrunner of Parks and Recreation, [20] while Amy Poehler and Morgan Sackett worked as producers [11] Dean Holland, an editor on The Office, also worked as an editor on Parks and Recreation [97] Mike Scully, a former executive producer and showrunner for The Simpsons, joined Parks and Recreation as a consulting producer starting in the middle of the first season [98] Allison Jones, who worked as a casting director for The Office, served in the same capacity at the start of Parks and Recreation, [99] along with Nancy Perkins, for whom the character Ann Perkins was named [100] Dorian Frankel became the casting director starting with the second season Alan Yang, Harris Wittels, and Katie Dippold, all of whom were Parks and Recreation screenwriters, also worked as executive story editors [101]\n\n\nWriting\nWhen we were talking about this, we were in the middle of the election The economy hadn't collapsed yet, but we got the general sense that the government was going to be playing a more significant role in years to come We had no idea how right we were.\n\n\nFilming\nLike The Office, Parks and Recreation was filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité style simulating the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track Within the context of the show, the characters are being filmed by a documentary crew, the members of which are never seen or heard from on-screen The actors occasionally look at and directly address the cameras, and in some scenes directly engage the cameras in one-on-one interviews with the documentary crew members [66] The episodes were scripted, but the production encouraged the cast to improvise, and dialogue or performances the actors made up during filming often made the final cut of the episodes [99] [66] Schur said he believes the mockumentary style is particularly fitting for a show about city government because \"It's a device for showing the ways people act and behave differently when they're in public and private  [and] the difference between what goes on behind closed doors and what people present to the public is a huge issue.\" [20]\n\n\nMusic\nThe producers hired BMI as music consultants to find a theme song With less than three weeks until the show first aired, BMI sent out a mass e-mail to a slew of composers, giving them five days to submit an entry According to the terms of the submission request, the only compensated composer would be the winner, who would receive $7,500 in exchange for the release of all rights to NBC [139] The winning entry was written by Gaby Moreno and Vincent Jones [102] Michael Schur said this theme song was chosen because producers wanted something that would immediately make the viewer associate the music with the series and the characters [140] He said Moreno and Jones' song \"does a really good job of explaining what the town is like (The) credits do a really good job of establishing it's just sort of a normal, every-day town in the middle of the country.\" [99] Due to its realistic mockumentary-style cinematography technique, Parks and Recreation does not use composed background music [102]\n\n\nThe Awesome Album\nA Mouse Rat album, The Awesome Album, was released by Dualtone Records and Entertainment 720 (a fictional company within the show, created by Tom Haverford) on vinyl, CD, cassette, and digital download on August 27, 2021 [147] The album was announced with the release of two singles: \"The Pit\" (from the season 1 finale, \"Rock Show\") and \"Two Birds Holding Hands\" (from the season 3 episode, \"Andy and April's Fancy Party\") [148] The album features guest vocals from Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson and Jeff Tweedy as Scott Tanner [147] [149] Pratt stated on Rob Lowe's podcast Parks and Recollection that he was not involved with the project or its promotion [150] On the weekly Billboard charts, The

Schur stated, \"I would never ever say never. The chance to do it again, should it arise, would be incredible, but we would only do it if we all felt like there was something compelling us to do it. If one single person said no, we wouldn't do it.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Parks_and_Recreation\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nThe first season

the original spin-off plan because they \"couldn't find the right fit\" [67] They considered a series about a local government official trying to rebuild a political career following a humiliating public spectacle They eventually abandoned the idea, though it did end up being incorporated into the backstory for Ben Wyatt late in the second season [68] [69] After Amy Poehler agreed to play the lead, they decided the series would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government [66] Production was delayed to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy [70]\n\n\nProduction\nImmediately

delayed to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy [70]\n\n\nCrew\nDeedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios produced Parks and Recreation starting with the first season; [11] the production companies Fremulon and 3 Arts Entertainment also became involved with the show starting with the second season [96] The series was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who served as executive producers along with Howard Klein Klein previously worked with Daniels and Schur on The Office, a half-hour NBC comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant Schur served as the showrunner of Parks and Recreation, [20] while Amy Poehler and Morgan Sackett worked as producers [11] Dean Holland, an editor on The Office, also worked as an editor on Parks and Recreation [97] Mike Scully, a former executive producer and showrunner for The Simpsons, joined Parks and Recreation as a consulting producer starting in the middle of the first season [98] Allison Jones, who worked as a casting director for The Office, served in the same capacity at the start of Parks and Recreation, [99] along with Nancy Perkins, for whom the character Ann Perkins was named [100] Dorian Frankel became the casting director starting with the second season Alan Yang, Harris Wittels, and Katie Dippold, all of whom were Parks and Recreation screenwriters, also worked as executive story editors [101]\n\n\nWriting\nWhen we were talking about this, we were in the middle of the election The economy hadn't collapsed yet, but we got the general sense that the government was going to be playing a more significant role in years to come We had no idea how right we were.\n\n\nFilming\nLike The Office, Parks and Recreation was filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité style simulating the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track Within the context of the show, the characters are being filmed by a documentary crew, the members of which are never seen or heard from on-screen The actors occasionally look at and directly address the cameras, and in some scenes directly engage the cameras in one-on-one interviews with the documentary crew members [66] The episodes were scripted, but the production encouraged the cast to improvise, and dialogue or performances the actors made up during filming often made the final cut of the episodes [99] [66] Schur said he believes the mockumentary style is particularly fitting for a show about city government because \"It's a device for showing the ways people act and behave differently when they're in public and private  [and] the difference between what goes on behind closed doors and what people present to the public is a huge issue.\" [20]\n\n\nMusic\nThe producers hired BMI as music consultants to find a theme song With less than three weeks until the show first aired, BMI sent out a mass e-mail to a slew of composers, giving them five days to submit an entry According to the terms of the submission request, the only compensated composer would be the winner, who would receive $7,500 in exchange for the release of all rights to NBC [139] The winning entry was written by Gaby Moreno and Vincent Jones [102] Michael Schur said this theme song was chosen because producers wanted something that would immediately make the viewer associate the music with the series and the characters [140] He said Moreno and Jones' song \"does a really good job of explaining what the town is like (The) credits do a really good job of establishing it's just sort of a normal, every-day town in the middle of the country.\" [99] Due to its realistic mockumentary-style cinematography technique, Parks and Recreation does not use composed background music [102]\n\n\nThe Awesome Album\nA Mouse Rat album, The Awesome Album, was released by Dualtone Records and Entertainment 720 (a fictional company within the show, created by Tom Haverford) on vinyl, CD, cassette, and digital download on August 27, 2021 [147] The album was announced with the release of two singles: \"The Pit\" (from the season 1 finale, \"Rock Show\") and \"Two Birds Holding Hands\" (from the season 3 episode, \"Andy and April's Fancy Party\") [148] The album features guest vocals from Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson and Jeff Tweedy as Scott Tanner [147] [149] Pratt stated on Rob Lowe's podcast Parks and Recollection that he was not involved with the project or its promotion [150] On the weekly Billboard charts, The Awesome Album debuted at number 2 on Comedy Albums, number 11 on Heatseekers Albums, and number 17 on Top Album Sales [151]\n\n\nBroadcast\nParks and Recreation was broadcast in the 8:30 pm timeslot Thursdays on NBC, in the United

The character is a member of House Harkonnen, a noble family that rules the planet Giedi Prime. Vladimir is known for his cunning, ruthlessness, and sadomasochistic tendencies, making him one of the most iconic and feared villains in science fiction literature.\n\n**Conception**\n\nFrank Herbert, the author of the Dune series, wanted a harsh-sounding name for the antagonistic family opposing House Atreides in Dune. He came across the name \"Härkönen\" in a California telephone book and thought that it sounded \"Soviet,\" though it is in fact Finnish. In earlier drafts of Dune, the character was called \"Valdemar Hoskanner.\"\n\n**Description**\n\nHerbert's \"Appendix IV: The Almanak en-Ashraf (Selected Excerpts of the Noble Houses)\" in Dune says of Harkonnen (in part): \"The Harkonnens of Giedi Prime are an old and noble House, with a rich history and a strong tradition of military prowess. They are known for their cunning and ruthlessness, and are feared throughout the galaxy for their ability to manipulate and control others.\"\n\n**Plotlines**\n\nAs Dune begins, a longstanding feud exists between the Harkonnens of Giedi Prime and the Atreides of Caladan. The Baron's intent to exterminate the Atreides line seems close to fruition, as Duke Leto Atreides is lured to the desert planet Arrakis on the pretense of taking over the valuable melange operation there. The Baron has an agent in the Atreides household: Leto's own physician, the trusted Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Though Suk Imperial Conditioning supposedly makes the subject incapable of inflicting harm, the Baron's twisted Mentat Piter De Vries has managed to break it using the threat of interminable torture on Yueh's captive wife Wanna.\n\n**Dune**\n\nIn Dune, the Baron is a central character, and his machinations drive the plot of the novel. He is determined to destroy the Atreides family and take control of the melange operation on Arrakis. The Baron's agents, including his nephew Feyd-Rautha and his loyalist Rabban, work to undermine the Atreides and gain control of the planet.\n\n**Children of Dune**\n\nIn Children of Dune, Alia, the daughter of Leto and Lady Jessica, becomes embroiled in the Harkonnen family's plans. Alia had been born with her ancestral memories in the womb, a circumstance the Bene Gesserit refer to as Abomination, because in their experience it is inevitable that the individual will become possessed by the personality of one of their ancestors. Alia falls victim to this prediction when she shares control of her body with the ego-memory of the Baron Harkonnen, and eventually falls under his power.\n\n**Prelude to Dune**\n\nIn the Prelude to Dune prequel series by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is established that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is the son and heir of Dmitri Harkonnen and his wife Victoria. Harkonnen's father had been the head of House Harkonnen and ruled the planet Giedi Prime. Trained since youth as a possible successor, Vladimir had been eventually chosen over his half-brother Abulurd, namesake of the original Unhappy with his brother's doings, Abulurd eventually marries Emmi Rabban and renounces the family name and his rights to the title.\n\n**Hunters of Dune**\n\nIn Hunters of Dune (2006), the continuation of the original series by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson, the Baron is resurrected as a ghola (5,029 years after the death of Alia) by the Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal, acting on orders from the Face Dancer Khrone. Khrone intends to use the Baron ghola to manipulate a ghola of Paul Atreides, named Paolo. Khrone tries various torture techniques for three years to awaken the 12-year-old Baron's genetic memories; these methods fail due to the Baron's sadomasochistic nature. Khrone is successful when he imprisons the Baron in a sensory deprivation tank for a prolonged period; the Baron's memories of his former life return. The reincarnated Baron is soon haunted by the voice of Alia in his mind; the source of this inner Alia is never explained.\n\n**In adaptations**\n\nIn 1975, Orson Welles agreed to play the Baron in Alejandro Jodorowsky's ultimately unsuccessful adaptation. The film's concept art by Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud depicts the Baron, as well as Feyd-Rautha and Rabban, in multiple drag appearances. In the documentary Jodorowsky's Dune, the director discussed the casting:\n\nIn the 1984 film adaptation of Dune, directed by David Lynch, the Baron is portrayed by Kenneth McMillan.

[8] The boys were raised in a modest household in suburban Calgary, playing ice hockey and going on camping trips [9] Pierre was raised as a Catholic [12]\n\n\nUniversity and early jobs\nAs a teenager, Poilievre had a job at Telus doing corporate collections by calling businesses [18] He also later worked briefly as a journalist for Alberta Report, a conservative weekly magazine [19] At the University of Calgary, he studied international relations [20] At the age of 19, he staged a protest against a student union that tried to prevent campus Reform Party supporters from campaigning for their candidate in an Alberta Senate election He was one of many Reform members on campus in conflict with the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, which they believed to be unprincipled [9]\n\n\nCanadian Alliance work\nIn 2000, Poilievre was an organizer on a website called Organization to Draft Stockwell Day, seeking to recruit Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day to be the leader of the Canadian Alliance party [25] [26] With Day running in the leadership election, Poilievre and his young colleagues made phone calls to canvas and raise money, dubbing themselves the \"Fight Club\" [9] [27]\n\n\nEarly political career (2004–2022)\nWith preparations being made for the 2004 Canadian federal election, the 24-year old Manordale resident Poilievre won the Conservative nomination in the riding of Nepean—Carleton against Liberal incumbent David Pratt [34] Though Pratt was a two-term incumbent and cabinet minister, the election was projected to be close between the two [35] Poilievre won his riding, and the Conservatives formed the Official Opposition to a Liberal minority government.\n\n\nBackbencher (2004–2006)\nWith preparations being made for the 2004 Canadian federal election, the 24-year old Manordale resident Poilievre won the Conservative nomination in the riding of Nepean—Carleton against Liberal incumbent David Pratt [34] Though Pratt was a two-term incumbent and cabinet minister, the election was projected to be close between the two [35] Poilievre won his riding, and the Conservatives formed the Official Opposition to a Liberal minority government.\n\n\nParliamentary secretary (2006–2013)\nPoilievre won reelection in the 2006 Canadian federal election with over 50% of the vote The Conservative Party formed a minority government Entering the 39th Canadian Parliament at the age of 26, he remained the youngest MP in the House of Commons [49] Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Poilievre to act as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, who was his fellow Nepean-area Conservative MP John Baird Poilievre's parliamentary work included overseeing the drafting and adoption of the Federal Accountability Act [50]\n\n\nCabinet minister (2013–2015)\nHarper shuffled his cabinet, adding several new members, including Poilievre to replace Tim Uppal as minister of state for democratic reform [76] With the 2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal concluding, the Canadian Senate expenses scandal unfolding, and the Senate Reform Act (to allow each province to recommend Senate candidates and impose a maximum 9-year term limit) paused at second reading to hear from the Supreme Court of Canada as to its constitutionality, [77] this position was seen by the media as being one of toughest in the cabinet and consequential to the Conservative Party [78] After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Senate Reform Act would require substantial provincial consent, and Harper ruled out the use of a national referendum, reform efforts were abandoned [79]\n\n\nMinister of State for Democratic Reform\nHarper shuffled his cabinet, adding several new members, including Poilievre to replace Tim Uppal as minister of state for democratic reform [76] With the 2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal concluding, the Canadian Senate expenses scandal unfolding, and the Senate Reform Act (to allow each province to recommend Senate candidates and impose a maximum 9-year term limit) paused at second reading to hear from the Supreme Court of Canada as to its constitutionality, [77] this position was seen by the media as being one of toughest in the cabinet and consequential to the Conservative Party [78] After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Senate Reform Act would require substantial provincial consent, and Harper ruled out the use of a national referendum, reform efforts were abandoned [79]\n\n\nMinister of Employment and Social Development\nIn a small cabinet shuffle, instigated by the decision of Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird to not seek re-election, the prime minister promoted Poilievre, on February 9, 2015, to a ministerial position He replaced Jason Kenney as minister of employment and social development and took on Baird's role as minister responsible for the National Capital Commission while keeping his duties as the minister responsible for democratic reform [89] Also at that time, the National Capital Commission was pursuing the development of the Memorial to the Victims of Communism – Canada, a Land of Refuge and trying to decide where to locate it; Poilievre advocated for the site adjacent to the Supreme Court of Canada building [90]\n\n\nOpposition MP and shadow minister (2015–2022)\nLocally, Nepean was carved out of his riding in the 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, so Poilievre moved from Barrhaven to Greely to seek election in the more rural Carleton riding [citation needed] Poilievre narrowly won the seat in the election for the 42nd Canadian Parliament but the Conservatives only won enough seats to form the Official Opposition to a Liberal majority government [94] Following Harper's resignation as leader, interim party leader Rona Ambrose made Poilievre the Conservative Party critic on issues relating to the Treasury Board until October 2016 when she moved him to critic on issues relating to Employment, Labour and Work Opportunity [citation needed]\n\n\n2022 leadership campaign\nAfter O'Toole was ousted as leader through a leadership review on February 2, 2022, there was speculation of Poilievre entering the leadership election to succeed him [110] On February 5, 2022, Poilievre implicitly declared his intention to run in the leadership election, stating \"I'm running for Prime Minister\" [111] [112] Political commentators and journalists described Poilievre as the frontrunner in the leadership race [113] [114] Poilievre's campaign was described as being centred on freedom and reducing the cost of living [115] He stated his desire to make Canada the \"freest country in the world\" [116]\n\n\nOpposition leader (2022–present)\nOn September 12, Poilievre gave his first speech to his caucus as leader [128] The following day on September 13, he unveiled his House of Commons leadership team with nine members, including new deputy leaders Melissa Lantsman and Tim Uppal [129] On October 12, Poilievre unveiled a 71-member shadow cabinet, including former leadership rivals Leslyn Lewis and Scott Aitchison [130]\n\n\nLeadership appointments and shadow cabinet\nOn September 12, Poilievre gave his first speech to his caucus as leader [128] The following day on September 13, he unveiled his House of Commons leadership team with nine members, including new deputy leaders Melissa Lantsman and Tim Uppal [129] On October 12, Poilievre unveiled a 71-member shadow cabinet, including former leadership rivals Leslyn Lewis and Scott Aitchison [130]\n\n\nParliamentary activities\nIn October 2022, the Conservatives under Poilievre voted in favour of the Liberal government's Bill C-30 (which doubled the goods and services tax rebate) but voted against Bill C-31 (which introduced a public dental care program for children under 12 in low income families and a one-time allowance worth $500 for low-income renters), citing concerns that the level of spending for the latter bill's measures would increase inflation [131] [132]\n\n\nOther events\nOn October 6, 2022, it was reported that between 2018 and 2022, Poilievre's team-managed YouTube channel posted hundreds of videos with a hidden tag labelled \"MGTOW\", referencing the misogynistic online community [147] Poilievre condemned MGTOW, said he was unaware of the tags, and had his team immediately remove the tags [147]\n\n\nBy-elections and opinion polling\nUnder Poilievre's leadership, the Conservatives have won 5 by-elections, with 4 retained seats [b] and 1 gained seat [c] [150] On June 24, 2024, the Conservatives won the previously Liberal-held riding of Toronto—St Paul's in a federal by-election, marking the first time under Poilievre's leadership that the Conservatives won a riding that was previously held by another party This particular by-election victory gained national attention, as the Liberal Party had held the riding since 1993 [151]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nProvincial\n\n\nEconomic policy\nPoilievre argues that large budget deficits are the reason for rising inflation [162] Poilievre proposes implementing a pay-as-you-go law, requiring the government to offset any new spending with a cut elsewhere [163] [164] [165] He referred to the success of pay-as-you-go balancing the budget in the United States under the Clinton administration [166] [167]\n\n\nLabour policy\nPoilievre has supported bringing right-to-work laws to Canada, [183] and voted multiple times against reinstating and increasing the federal minimum wage to $15/hour [184] [185]\n\n\nHousing and infrastructure\nPoilievre stated that a government led by him would permit a runway expansion at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, allowing jets to fly in and out of the airport Poilievre cited increased competition in the aviation industry and travellers being provided with an alternative to Toronto's Pearson International Airport which had dealt with congestion and flight delays surpassing 50% around the month of July 2022 [188]\n\n\nEnvironment and energy\nPoilievre is in favour of addressing climate change by using green technology and placing targets to reduce carbon-related emissions, as opposed to using taxes [193] One of the technologies he plans to incentivize is carbon capture and storage [194] Poilievre also plans to increase the production of electric cars by greenlighting more mining of lithium, cobalt and copper required to produce the cars and batteries [195] [196] [197] When speaking in Quebec, he called for less \"red tape\" and stated that he would permit more construction of hydro-electric dams [196] [198] Poilievre believes Canadian energy is cleaner than that of other countries, and proposes a ban on importing foreign oil and a review of all pipeline projects cancelled by the current government [199]\n\n\nForeign policy\nDuring the spring and summer of 2020, Poilievre was critical of what he perceived as the Trudeau government's misplaced trust in the Chinese government, which had cancelled CanSino's contract with Canada for its COVID vaccine, Convidecia Poilievre insisted that Canada should create its own vaccines supply and make purchase agreements with more trustworthy governments [202] Following the reports of Chinese election interference from Canadian Security Intelligence Service documents reported by the Globe and Mail in 2023, Poilievre called for a public registry for agents of foreign regimes who interfere in Canada's elections [203] According to Global Affairs Canada, Poilievre has been a target of the Chinese government's Spamouflage disinformation operations [204]\n\n\nSocial issues\nPoilievre supports abortion rights and access to abortion in Canada [215] [216] [217] He stated that government led by him would not introduce and would not pass any legislation restricting access to abortion, though he would allow his caucus to have free votes on legislation [218] In 2010, however, he supported a bill that would have criminalized pressuring a person to get an abortion and a motion where Parliament would have studied when a fetus should be considered a human [219] In 2020, he changed his position and said that a government led by him would never introduce a bill on the topic, and no private ones would be adopted [220] In 2021, Poilievre opposed a private member bill prohibiting sex-selective abortion [221]\n\n\nConstitutional issues\nPoilievre stated that he is in favour of freedom of speech and seeks to repeal Bill C-11 (Online Streaming Act) and the successor to Bill C-36 (Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act), describing them as censorship in Canada [235] Poilievre plans to remove the proposed \"digital safety commissioner\" position with the introduction of what he titles as the \"Free Speech Act\" and would leave enforcement of crimes committed online to law enforcement [236] Poilievre stated a government led by him would scrap direct federal research and other grants to universities if they do not commit to section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects freedom of expression Poilievre also stated he would appoint a 'Free Speech Guardian' (on the condition that they are a former judge) that would ensure compliance to section 2(b), investigate claims of academic censorship, report to the federal government on the universities that refuse to uphold the Charter right, and recommend cuts to direct federal grants to universities that do not uphold the right [237]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 2022, Poilievre described himself as pro-immigration and put forward policies aiming to speed up processing times for immigration to reunite families, keep refugees safe, and get jobs filled in Canada [241] Poilievre stated that a government led by him would negotiate agreements with provinces to license qualified professionals within 60 days of receiving applications, provide study loans to aid new immigrants in passing examinations, and permit immigrants to receive licences before moving to Canada [242] [164] Poilievre proposes establishing direct flights to Amritsar, India [243] In June 2023, Poilievre, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, joined protesters in support of students who were facing deportation for being scammed into moving to Canada on fake admission letters to universities [244] [245]\n\n\nHealthcare\nPoilievre supports Canada's public healthcare system, stating \"I believe everybody should be able to get public health care That's the system I've relied on my whole life.\" [257] Poilievre plans to address healthcare shortages in Canada by implementing interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses which he would call the \"Blue Seal\" program and also by ensuring provinces expedite the approval of professional credentials of certified immigrants to increase the number of health care providers [258] [259] Poilievre pledged to uphold Justin Trudeau's healthcare funding set in 2023 for the provinces, but shared provincial premiers' criticisms of the funding being too low and he blamed Trudeau for overspending elsewhere [260]\n\n\nFirearms\nPoilievre opposes re-establishing the long-gun registry, and opposes the May 1, 2020 Order in Council that banned over 1,500 models of firearms [265] Poilievre believes the best civilian firearms policy for Canada is to improve policing of gun smuggling and is opposed to placing further restrictions on licensed firearms owners and sports shooters [266] [267]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAfter moving to Ottawa, Poilievre dated Conservative political advisor Jenni Byrne until 2011 [268]\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\n\nReferences\n2The office of Minister of

With Day running in the leadership election, Poilievre and his young colleagues made phone calls to canvas and raise money, dubbing themselves the \"Fight Club.\"\n\nEarly Political Career (2004-2022)\n---------------------------------\n\nWith preparations being made for the 2004 Canadian federal election, the 24-year-old Poilievre won the Conservative nomination in the riding of Nepean—Carleton against Liberal incumbent David Pratt. Though Pratt was a two-term incumbent and cabinet minister, the election was projected to be close between the two. Poilievre won his riding, and the Conservatives formed the Official Opposition to a Liberal minority government.\n\nParliamentary Secretary (2006-2013)\n-----------------------------------\n\nPoilievre won reelection in the 2006 Canadian federal election with over 50% of the vote. The Conservative Party formed a minority government. Entering the 39th Canadian Parliament at the age of 26, he remained the youngest MP in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Poilievre to act as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, who was his fellow Nepean-area Conservative MP John Baird. Poilievre's parliamentary work included overseeing the drafting and adoption of the Federal Accountability Act.\n\nCabinet Minister (2013-2015)\n---------------------------\n\nHarper shuffled his cabinet, adding several new members, including Poilievre to replace Tim Uppal as minister of state for democratic reform. With the 2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal concluding, the Canadian Senate expenses scandal unfolding, and the Senate Reform Act (to allow each province to recommend Senate candidates and impose a maximum 9-year term limit) paused at second reading to hear from the Supreme Court of Canada as to its constitutionality, this position was seen by the media as being one of the toughest in the cabinet and consequential to the Conservative Party. After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Senate Reform Act would require substantial provincial consent, and Harper ruled out the use of a national referendum, reform efforts were abandoned.\n\nOpposition MP and Shadow Minister (2015-2022)\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLocally, Nepean was carved out of his riding in the 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, so Poilievre moved from Barrhaven to Greely to seek election in the more rural Carleton riding. Poilievre narrowly won the seat in the election for the 42nd Canadian Parliament but the Conservatives only won enough seats to form the Official Opposition to a Liberal majority government. Following Harper's resignation as leader, interim party leader Rona Ambrose made Poilievre the Conservative Party critic on issues relating to the Treasury Board until October 2016 when she moved him to critic on issues relating to Employment, Labour and Work Opportunity.\n\n2022 Leadership Campaign\n-------------------------\n\nAfter O'Toole was ousted as leader through a leadership review on February 2, 2022, there was speculation of Poilievre entering the leadership election to succeed him. On February 5, 2022, Poilievre implicitly declared his intention to run in the leadership election, stating \"I'm running for Prime Minister.\" Political commentators and journalists described Poilievre as the frontrunner in the leadership race.\n\nOpposition Leader (2022-Present)\n---------------------------------\n\nOn September 12, Poilievre gave his first speech to his caucus as leader. The following day on September 13, he unveiled his House of Commons leadership team with nine members, including new deputy leaders Melissa Lantsman and Tim Uppal. On October 12, Poilievre unveiled a 71-member shadow cabinet, including former leadership rivals Leslyn Lewis and Scott Aitchison.\n\nLeadership Appointments and Shadow Cabinet\n---------------------------------------------\n\nOn September 12, Poilievre gave his first speech to his caucus as leader. The following day on September 13, he unveiled his House of Commons leadership team with nine members, including new deputy leaders Melissa Lantsman and Tim Uppal. On October 12, Poilievre unveiled a 71-member shadow cabinet, including former leadership rivals Leslyn Lewis and Scott Aitchison.\n\nParliamentary Activities\n------------------------\n\nIn October 2022, the Conservatives under Poilievre voted in favour of the Liberal government's Bill C-30 (which doubled the goods and services tax rebate) but voted against Bill C-31 (which introduced a public dental care program for children under 12 in low-income families and a one-time allowance worth $500 for low-income renters), citing concerns that the level of spending for the latter bill's measures would increase inflation.\n\nOther Events\n-------------\n\nOn October 6, 2022, it was reported that between 2018 and 2022, Poilievre's team-managed YouTube channel posted hundreds of videos with a hidden tag labelled \"MGTOW,\" referencing the misogynistic online community. Poilievre condemned MGTOW, said he was unaware of the tags, and had his team immediately remove the tags.\n\nBy-elections and Opinion Polling\n---------------------------------\n\nUnder Poilievre's leadership, the Conservatives have won 5 by-elections, with 4 retained seats and 1 gained seat. On June 24, 2024, the Conservatives won the previously Liberal-held riding of Toronto-St Paul's in a federal by-election, marking the first time under Poilievre's leadership that the Conservatives won a riding that was previously held by another party.\n\nPolitical Positions\n-------------------\n\nProvincial\n\nEconomic Policy\n---------------\n\nPoilievre argues that large budget deficits are the reason for rising inflation. Poilievre proposes implementing a pay-as-you-go law, requiring the government to offset any new spending with a cut elsewhere. He referred to the success of pay-as-you-go balancing the budget in the United States under the Clinton administration.\n\nLabour Policy\n--------------\n\nPoilievre has supported bringing right-to-work laws to Canada, and voted multiple times against reinstating and increasing the federal minimum wage to $15/hour.\n\nHousing and Infrastructure\n-------------------------\n\nPoilievre stated that a government led by him would permit a runway expansion at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, allowing jets to fly in and out of the airport. Poilievre cited increased competition in the aviation industry and travellers being provided with an alternative to Toronto's Pearson International Airport which had dealt with congestion and flight delays surpassing 50% around the month of July 2022.\n\nEnvironment and Energy\n----------------------\n\nPoilievre is in favour of addressing climate change by using green technology and placing targets to reduce carbon-related emissions, as opposed to using taxes. One of the technologies he plans to incentivize is carbon capture and storage. Poilievre also plans to increase the production of electric cars by greenlighting more mining of lithium, cobalt, and copper required to produce the cars and batteries.\n\nForeign Policy\n--------------\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2020, Poilievre was critical of what he perceived as the Trudeau government's misplaced trust in the Chinese government, which had cancelled CanSino's contract with Canada for its COVID vaccine, Convidecia. Poilievre insisted that Canada should create its own vaccines supply and make purchase agreements with more trustworthy governments.\n\nSocial Issues\n-------------\n\nPoilievre supports abortion rights and access to abortion in Canada. He stated that government led by him would not introduce and would not pass any legislation restricting access to abortion, though he would allow his caucus to have free votes on legislation.\n\nConstitutional Issues\n-------------------\n\nPoilievre stated that he is in favour of freedom of speech and seeks to repeal Bill C-11 (Online Streaming Act) and the successor to Bill C-36 (Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act), describing them as censorship in Canada. Poilievre plans to remove the proposed \"digital safety commissioner\" position with the introduction of what he titles as the \"Free Speech Act\" and would leave enforcement of crimes committed online to law enforcement.\n\nImmigration\n------------\n\nIn 2022, Poilievre described himself as pro-immigration and put forward policies aiming to speed up processing times for immigration to reunite families, keep refugees safe, and get jobs filled in Canada. Poilievre stated that a government led by him would negotiate agreements with provinces to license qualified professionals within 60 days of receiving applications, provide study loans to aid new immigrants in passing examinations, and permit immigrants to receive licences before moving to Canada.\n\nHealthcare\n----------\n\nPoilievre supports Canada's public healthcare system, stating \"I believe everybody should be able to get public health care That's the system I've relied on my whole life.\" Poilievre plans to address healthcare shortages in Canada by implementing interprovincial standardization for doctors and nurses which he would call the \"Blue Seal\" program and also by ensuring provinces expedite the approval of professional credentials of certified immigrants to increase the number of health care providers.\n\nFirearms\n---------\n\nPoilievre opposes re-establishing the long-gun registry, and opposes the May 1, 2020 Order in Council that banned over 1,500 models of firearms. Poilievre believes the best civilian firearms policy for Canada is to improve policing of gun smuggling and is opposed to placing further restrictions on licensed firearms owners and sports shooters.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nAfter moving to Ottawa, Poilievre dated Conservative political advisor Jenni Byrne until 2011.\n\nElectoral History\n-----------------\n\nPoilievre has been elected as a Member of Parliament in the following elections:\n\n* 2004 Canadian federal election (Nepean—Carleton)\n* 2006 Canadian federal election (Nepean—Carleton)\n* 2008 Canadian federal

arose in the early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an assistant film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman [6] He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness [7] He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film [8] and based elements of the plot on murderer Ed Gein, who committed his crimes in 1950s Wisconsin; [9] Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991) [10] [11] [12] [13] During development,

Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American horror film directed by Tobe Hooper and written by Hooper and Kim Henkel. The film is a low-budget, independent production that has become a cult classic and a significant influence on the horror genre. The film's graphic violence, eerie atmosphere, and themes of exploitation and social commentary have made it a subject of controversy and critical discussion.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre tells the story of a group of friends who travel to rural Texas to visit the grave of Sally's grandfather. The group consists of Sally, her brother Franklin, and their friends Jerry, Pam, and Kirk. As they journey deeper into the woods, they encounter a family of cannibals, including the iconic character of Leatherface, a chainsaw-wielding killer who wears a mask made of human skin.\n\nThe group is stalked and killed by the cannibals, one by one, in a series of brutal and gruesome scenes. The film's climax features a confrontation between Sally and Leatherface, who is eventually killed by Sally's brother.\n\n**Cast**\n\nMany of the cast members at the time were relatively unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage shows, as well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was hot, and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110°F (43°C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, \"It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.\"\n\n**Post-production**\n\nThe production exceeded its original $60,000 budget during editing. Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 and $300,000. A film production group, Pie in the Sky, partially led by future President of the Texas State Bar Joe K Longley, provided $23,532 in exchange for 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper, and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Distributing Company. David Foster, who would later produce the 1982 horror film The Thing, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston's West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre premiered in Austin, Texas, on October 1, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded.

that this mistake stemmed from that date being written erroneously on his passport [19] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters [20] Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family are of Pashtun descent and belong to the Niazi tribe, [21] [22] and one of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, \"was one of Sher Shah Suri's leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab.\" [23] [24] Khan's maternal family has produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented Pakistan, [20] such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan [21] Maternally, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town located in South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [25] His maternal family was based in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar in Punjab, India for about 600 years, and migrated to Lahore after the independence of Pakistan [26] [27]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKhan had numerous relationships during his bachelor life [33] He was then known as a hedonistic bachelor and a playboy who was active on the London nightclub circuit [33] [34] [35] Many girlfriends are unknown and were called \"mysterious blondes\" by British newspaper The Times [36] Some of the women with whom he has been associated include Zeenat Aman, [37] Emma Sergeant, Susie Murray-Philipson, Sita White, Sarah Crawley, [36] Stephanie Beacham, Goldie Hawn, Kristiane Backer, Susannah Constantine, Marie Helvin, Caroline Kellett, [38] Liza Campbell, [21] Anastasia Cooke, Hannah Rothschild, [39] and Lulu Blacker [40] [41]\n\n\nCricket career\nKhan made his debut at the age of 16 in

the remaining 26 were drawn He also played 139 ODIs, winning 77, losing 57 and ending one in a tie [78]\n\n\nPost-retirement from cricket\nAfter retiring, Khan admitted to ball tampering during his early cricketing days when playing domestic cricket.\nKhan had said that, during matches, he \"occasionally scratched the side of the ball and lifted the seam\" Khan defended his actions in the same interview, arguing his conduct was commonplace at the time, even that spin bowlers would lift the seam (i.e mildly ball tamper); further Khan argued that as he did not lift the seam of the ball above the normal level he was not violating the rules and spirit of the game within the rules defined while he was a player Further, Khan argued that umpires in his 21 years of cricket had not complained about his conduct; Khan remarked that \"The sole judge of fair and unfair play on the cricket field is the umpire\" [101] He had also added, \"Only once did I use an object When Sussex was playing Hampshire in 1981 the ball was not deviating at all I got the 12th man to bring out a bottle top and it started to move around a lot.\" [102]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nDuring the 1990s, Khan also served as

2018 after his oath of office ceremony He began an austerity drive on that day, where the nine-course meal traditionally served was replaced with refreshments [233] and he laid out a 100-day plan to rapidly reform the country in a short time span [234]\n\n\nAusterity policy\nKhan reduced the Prime Minister's staff from 524 servants to just two and opted for a minimal security detail He also auctioned off bulletproof vehicles and four helicopters acquired by his predecessors for the Prime Minister's office [235] [236] However, the auction fell short of his government's expectations, with only 61 of the 100 vehicles sold, generating 200 million rupees (1.2 million pounds) [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nHis government undertook major cabinet reshuffles and faced economic challenges, resulting in seeking an IMF bailout, as well as implementing austerity measures [243] By 2020, Pakistan's balance of payments improved, fiscal deficit successfully narrowed to 1% of GDP due to austerity measures, and tax collection reached record highs [244] [245] In June 2020, Bloomberg reported that Imran Khan saw his \"influence and popularity dwindle due to a slowing economy, high consumer prices and corruption investigations involving his close aides.\" The article also stated that the Army's direct influence in civilian government continued to increase, with military officials appointed in government posts and \"begun taking a more active role\" in policy making [246]\n\n\nForeign policy\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Twitter his decision to cut off billions in aid to Pakistan in November 2018, berating the country for not doing \"a damn thing for us.\" Imran lashed out at Trump saying that U.S aid to Pakistan was a \"miniscule\" $20 billion, while the country lost 75,000 people and more than $123 billion fighting the \"US War on Terror.\" He also pointed to the supply routes Pakistan provides to American forces, saying \"Can Mr Trump name another ally that gave such sacrifices?\" [255] [256] Khan later told the US, \"we're not your hired guns anymore.\" [257]\nOn the international stage he emphasised Islamic unity through his efforts against Islamophobia and leadership in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) [258] Khan and his foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi established good relations with Saudi Arabia, though he stated that he sought to

Papers case [273]\n\n\nSocial, domestic and welfare policy\nIn social policy, his administration restored minority religious sites, [275] reformed education and healthcare, and launched the Ehsaas Programme which served 100 million people with financial assistance, while many also benefited from healthcare and welfare assistance through the initiative [276] Ehsaas, which was Khan's flagship initiative, has been viewed as a success by national and international experts [277] It helped bring about positive change and is seen as a global model for poverty reduction [278] [279] The World Bank declared it a role model for other countries [280] [281] The Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme successfully protected the poor and daily wage earners in the country who were affected by lockdowns by providing cash disbursements during the COVID-19 pandemic [282] [283]\n\n\nPlant for Pakistan\nPlant for Pakistan, also known as 10 Billion Tree Tsunami, was a five-year project to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan from 2018 to 2023 [284] Khan initiated the programme on 2 September 2018 with approximately 1.5 million trees planted on the first day [285] [286] Most of the work, which paid between 500 and 800 rupees (US$3–5) a day, took place in rural areas, with people setting up nurseries, planting saplings, and serving as forest protection guards The plan was awarded 7.5 billion rupees ($46m) in funding [287] According to an editorial published in The Nation, in September 2022 the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) found Rs 3.49 billion of \"irregularities\" after a three-year audit of the Plant for Pakistan/Billion trees program Irregularities included \"over-claimed\" areas, \"fictitiously claimed plantation activities\", \"uncertified and ungraded seeds .. from unauthentic sources\", \"fake and excessive reporting by the staff.\" [288]\n\n\nCOVID-19 response\nAt the start of the pandemic, Imran Khan resisted a nationwide lockdown despite criticism from the opposition [289] and others [290] [291] [292] [293] [294]  He explained that while his government considered lockdowns implemented in other countries, they determined such measures would devastate

government where many of his coalition partners left his government resulting in his ousting, being the first prime minister of Pakistan successfully overthrown by a no-confidence motion The motion was controversial as some alleged a foreign conspiracy called Lettergate was behind it, while many alleged that it was due to Imran Khan's worsening relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, which allegedly pushed for Khan's removal following political tensions between Khan and the military [307]\n\n\nPost-premiership\nThe Pakistan Democratic Movement's MNAs brought the Toshakhana case against Khan in August 2022 because he failed to disclose the specifics of gifts from Toshakhana in his yearly report to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) [308] The investigation was started by the

million rupees [5] [6] On 29 August 2023, an appeals court suspended Khan's corruption conviction and three-year prison term, and granted bail [7] [8] [9] Despite the suspended conviction in the

relations with China and Russia, [401] while relations with the United States cooled In 2010, Khan said in an interview: \"I grew up hating India because I grew up in Lahore and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger But as I started touring India, I got such love and friendship there that all this disappeared.\" [402] Khan views the Kashmir issue as a humanitarian issue, as opposed to a territorial dispute between two countries (India and Pakistan) He also proposed secret talks to settle the issue as he thinks the vested interests on both sides will try to subvert them He ruled out a military solution to the conflict and denied the possibility of a fourth war between India and Pakistan over the disputed mountainous region [403]\n\n\nPublic image\nAfter the May 2013 elections, Mohammed Hanif writing for The Guardian, termed Khan's support as appealing \"to the educated middle classes but Pakistan's main problem is that there aren't enough educated urban middle-class citizens in the country\" [425] Pankaj Mishra writing for The New York Times in 2012, characterised Khan as a \"cogent picture out of his—and Pakistan's—clashing identities\" adding that \"his identification with the suffering masses and his attacks on his affluent, English-speaking peers have long been mocked in the living rooms of Lahore and Karachi as the hypocritical ravings of \"Im the Dim\" and \"Taliban Khan\"—the two favored monikers for him.\" Mishra concluded with \"like all populist politicians, Khan appears to offer something to everyone Yet the great differences between his constituencies—socially liberal, upper-middle-class Pakistanis and the deeply conservative residents of Pakistan's tribal areas—seem irreconcilable.\" [426] His critics have often called him \"Fitna Khan\" and \"Zinayi Khan\" [427]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring his cricketing days, Khan featured in many advertisements and television commercials as a celebrity brand endorser These included Pepsi Pakistan, Brooke Bond, [443] Thums Up (along with Sunil Gavaskar), [444] and the Indian soap brand Cinthol, at a time when Bollywood legend Vinod Khanna was also endorsing the same product [445] His popularity in India was such that it was \"unmatched in an era when there were no smartphones to take selfies He was mobbed everywhere he went.\" [445] The late veteran Bollywood actor Dev Anand even offered him a role in his sports action-thriller movie Awwal Number (1990), that of a cricket star in decline opposite an upcoming cricketer essayed by Aamir Khan, and as he refused, citing his lack of acting skills, the role eventually went to Aditya Pancholi [446]\n\n\nViews on the Pashtuns and Afghans\nIn his virtual address at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2021, Khan remarked “Then all along the tribal belt (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, – Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal belt – where no Pakistan army had been there since our independence, they  [the Pashtuns] had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, not because of their religious ideology but because of Pashtun nationalism, which is very strong.\" His comments prompted outrage among many Pashtuns, who called on him to apologise Khan made similar comments also on 11 October, which triggered a protest in Peshawar the next day by the leftist Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP) The Awami National Party (ANP) and the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) also condemned Khan for \"linking the Pashtuns with terrorists.\" [451] [452] [453] [454]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 2017, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that she was sexually harassed by Khan, who was party chairman [458] Gulalai said Khan had sent her \"inappropriate text messages\" Gulalai made the allegations and quit the PTI just prior to the election of a new prime minister, citing \"ill-treatment\" of female party members as the reason for leaving The timing of Gulalai's allegations was met with suspicion, as there were rumours that she had recently met with Amir Muqam, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)) Gulalai denied these rumours, stating that she was not joining the PML (N) [459]\n\n\nAllegation of sexual harassment\nIn 2017, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that she was sexually harassed by Khan, who was party

clothing could lead to an increase in sexual assault During an interview with Axios journalist Jonathan Swan, Khan responded to a question about Pakistan's rape crisis by stating, \"If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the man unless they are robots It's common sense.\" His comments were widely condemned Women's rights groups, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, demanded an apology, arguing that his remarks perpetuate harmful stereotypes by portraying men as \"helpless aggressors\" and women as \"knowing\" victims Critics, such as politician Maryam Nawaz, labelled Khan a \"rape apologist,\" while activist Kanwal Ahmed expressed concerns about the message his words sent to perpetrators [367]\n\n\nMisogynistic remarks\nIn 2022, during his speech, Imran Khan referenced a clip of Maryam Nawaz's speech, in which she mentioned his name multiple times Khan remarked: \"Someone sent me a clip on social media of Maryam's speech, somewhere She took my name so many times and with so much passion, I want to tell her that Maryam, please be careful, your husband might get upset the way you call my name again and again.\" This comment, perceived as inappropriate and misogynistic, sparked significant criticism from both his opponents and some supporters [464]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nKhan has published six works of non-fiction, including an

domestic and welfare policy\nIn social policy, his administration restored minority religious sites, [275] reformed education and healthcare, and launched the Ehsaas Programme which served 100 million people with financial assistance, while many also benefited from healthcare and welfare assistance through the initiative [276] Ehsaas, which was Khan's flagship initiative, has been viewed as a success by national and international experts [277] It helped bring about positive change and is seen as a global model for poverty reduction [278] [279] The World Bank declared it a role model for other countries [280] [281] The Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme successfully protected the poor and daily wage earners in the country who were affected by lockdowns by providing cash disbursements during the COVID-19 pandemic [282] [283]\n\n\nPlant for Pakistan\nPlant for Pakistan, also known as 10 Billion Tree Tsunami, was a five-year project to plant 10 billion trees across Pakistan from 2018 to 2023 [284] Khan initiated the programme on 2 September 2018 with approximately 1.5 million trees planted on the first day [285] [286] Most of the work, which paid between 500 and 800 rupees

and excessive reporting by the staff.\" [288]\n\n\nCOVID-19 response\nAt the start of the pandemic, Imran Khan resisted a nationwide lockdown despite criticism from the opposition [289] and others [290] [291] [292] [293] [294]  He explained that while his government considered lockdowns implemented in other countries, they determined such measures would devastate Pakistan’s struggling economy, where many depend on daily wages [295] [296]\n\n\nAlleged persecution of journalists\nThe International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) released a report in August 2022, of journalists who faced threats and were targeted during his time in office [306]\n\n\nRemoval from office\nHe was removed from office in March 2022, amidst a motion of no-confidence against his government where many of his coalition partners left his government resulting in his ousting, being the first prime minister of Pakistan successfully overthrown by a no-confidence motion The motion was controversial as some alleged a foreign conspiracy called Lettergate was behind it, while many alleged that it was due to Imran Khan's worsening relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, which allegedly pushed for Khan's removal following political tensions between Khan and the military [307]\n\n\nPost-premiership\nThe Pakistan Democratic Movement's MNAs brought the Toshakhana case against Khan in August 2022 because he failed to disclose the specifics of gifts from Toshakhana in his yearly report to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) [308] The investigation was started by the ECP, which made its final determination on 21 October 2022, disqualifying Imran from holding public office for making false statements and incorrect declarations regarding his assets and liabilities for the tax year 2020–21 in

rally in Wazirabad, Punjab, and leading a march to the capital Islamabad to demand snap elections after he was ousted Automatic gunfire was heard in footage aired on local news channels which also showed Khan being carried away and put in a car, with a bandage visible on his leg Khan's conditions were not described as critical [312] [313] A PTI party's supporter was killed during the shooting, and eight other people were also wounded The perpetrator known as Muhammad Naveed was arrested at the scene and claimed that he wanted only to target Khan for \"spreading hatred and misleading the

being found guilty of misusing his premiership from 2018 to 2022 to buy and sell gifts in state possession that were received during visits abroad and worth more than 140 million rupees [5] [6] On 29 August 2023, an appeals court suspended Khan's corruption conviction and three-year prison term, and granted bail [7] [8] [9] Despite the suspended conviction in the corruption case, a special court in Islamabad ordered that he remain incarcerated in connection with the \"cypher case\": Khan has repeatedly alleged that he received a cypher, or diplomatic cable, which contained proof that there was a US led conspiracy with Pakistan's military establishment to oust him from office The Federal Investigation Agency registered a case against Khan for sharing information on the alleged cypher and leaking state secrets, and thereby violating the Official Secrets Act [10] [11]\n\n\nImprisonment\nIn August 2023, the government submitted a report to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, stating that

daily by a designated sanitary worker, and additional security personnel were deployed for his safety The Supreme Court had ordered the government to submit this report following Khan's complaints about the conditions in which he was being held [347]\n\n\nUniversity of Oxford Chancellor candidacy\nDespite his imprisonment, Khan remains politically active, having applied to run in the 2024 University of Oxford Chancellor Election His candidacy has gained attention, with supporters promoting the campaign on social media [365] [366]\n\n\nWealth\nIn 2003, Khan had a house in Zaman Park, Lahore worth Rs. 29 million (US$100,000) He was also an investor, investing more than Rs. 40 million (US$140,000) in various businesses He was owner of agriculture land of 39 kanals (5 acres) at

Charles Le Gai Eaton he came across in his youth, [381] Khan is generally described as a Pakistani nationalist, [382] as well as a populist [383] Khan's proclaimed political platform and declarations include Islamic values, to which he rededicated himself in the 1990s; liberal economics, with the promise of deregulating the economy and creating a welfare state; decreased bureaucracy and the implementation of anti-corruption laws to create and ensure a clean government; the establishment of an independent judiciary; overhaul of the country's police system; and an anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan [384] [108] [385] [386]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nBasing his wider paradigm on the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, the Iranian writer-sociologist Ali Shariati and the British

anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan [384] [108] [385] [386]\n\n\nForeign relations\nIn foreign relations, he dealt with border skirmishes against India, strengthened relations with China and Russia, [401] while relations with the United States cooled In 2010, Khan said in an interview: \"I grew up hating India because I grew up in Lahore and there were massacres of 1947, so much bloodshed and anger But as I started touring India, I got such love and friendship there that all this disappeared.\" [402] Khan views the Kashmir issue as a humanitarian issue, as opposed to a territorial dispute between two countries (India and Pakistan) He also proposed secret talks to settle the issue as he thinks the vested interests on both sides will try to subvert them He ruled out a military solution to the conflict and denied the possibility of a fourth war between India and Pakistan over the disputed mountainous region [403]\n\n\nPublic image\nAfter the May 2013 elections, Mohammed Hanif writing for The Guardian, termed Khan's support as appealing \"to the educated middle classes but Pakistan's main problem is that there aren't enough educated urban middle-class citizens in the country\" [425] Pankaj Mishra writing for The New York Times in 2012, characterised Khan as a \"cogent picture out of his—and Pakistan's—clashing identities\" adding that \"his identification with the suffering masses and his attacks on his affluent, English-speaking peers have long been mocked in the living rooms of Lahore and Karachi as the hypocritical ravings of \"Im the Dim\" and \"Taliban Khan\"—the two favored monikers for him.\" Mishra concluded with \"like all populist politicians, Khan appears to offer something to everyone Yet the great differences between his constituencies—socially liberal, upper-middle-class Pakistanis and the deeply conservative residents of Pakistan's tribal areas—seem irreconcilable.\" [426] His critics have often called him \"Fitna Khan\" and \"Zinayi Khan\" [427]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nDuring his cricketing days, Khan featured in many advertisements and television commercials as a celebrity brand endorser These included Pepsi Pakistan, Brooke Bond, [443] Thums Up (along with Sunil Gavaskar), [444] and the Indian soap brand Cinthol, at a time when Bollywood legend Vinod Khanna was also endorsing the same product [445] His popularity in India was such that it was \"unmatched in an era when there were no smartphones to take selfies He was mobbed everywhere he went.\" [445] The late veteran Bollywood actor Dev Anand even offered him a role in his sports action-thriller movie Awwal Number (1990), that of a cricket star in decline opposite an upcoming cricketer essayed by Aamir Khan, and as he refused, citing his lack of acting skills, the role eventually went to Aditya Pancholi [446]\n\n\nViews on the Pashtuns and Afghans\nIn his virtual address at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2021, Khan remarked “Then all along the tribal belt (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, – Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal belt – where no Pakistan army had been there since our independence, they  [the Pashtuns] had strong sympathies with the Afghan Taliban, not because of their religious ideology but because of Pashtun nationalism, which is very strong.\" His comments prompted outrage among many Pashtuns, who called on him to apologise Khan made similar comments also on 11 October, which triggered a protest in Peshawar the next day by the leftist Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP) The Awami National Party (ANP) and the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) also condemned Khan for \"linking the Pashtuns with terrorists.\" [451] [452] [453] [454]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 2017, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that she was sexually harassed by Khan, who was party chairman [458] Gulalai said Khan had sent her \"inappropriate text messages\" Gulalai made the allegations and quit the PTI just prior to the election of a new prime minister, citing \"ill-treatment\" of female party members as the reason for leaving The timing of Gulalai's allegations was met with suspicion, as there were rumours that she had recently met with Amir Muqam, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)) Gulalai denied these rumours, stating that she was not joining the PML (N) [459]\n\n\nAllegation of sexual harassment\nIn 2017, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Ayesha Gulalai alleged that she was sexually harassed by Khan, who was party chairman [458] Gulalai said Khan had sent her \"inappropriate text messages\" Gulalai made the allegations and quit the PTI just prior to the election of a new prime minister, citing \"ill-treatment\" of female party

(N) (PML (N)) Gulalai denied these rumours, stating that she was not joining the PML (N) [459]\n\n\nAlleged victim-blaming\nIn 2021, Khan faced criticism after suggesting that women's clothing could lead to an increase in sexual assault During an interview with Axios journalist Jonathan Swan, Khan responded to a question about Pakistan's rape crisis by stating, \"If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the man unless they are robots It's common sense.\" His comments were widely condemned Women's rights groups, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, demanded an apology, arguing that his remarks perpetuate harmful stereotypes by portraying men as \"helpless aggressors\" and women as \"knowing\" victims Critics, such as politician Maryam Nawaz, labelled Khan a \"rape apologist,\" while activist Kanwal Ahmed expressed concerns about the message his words sent to perpetrators [367]\n\n\nMisogynistic remarks\nIn 2022, during his speech, Imran Khan referenced a clip of Maryam Nawaz's speech, in which she mentioned his name multiple times Khan remarked: \"Someone sent me a clip on social media of Maryam's speech, somewhere She took my name so many times and with so much passion, I want to tell her that Maryam, please be careful, your husband might get upset the way you call my name again and again.\" This comment, perceived as inappropriate and misogynistic, sparked significant criticism from both his opponents and some supporters [464]\n\n\nAwards and honours\nKhan has published six works of non-fiction, including an autobiography co-written with Patrick Murphy He has also written about the modern history of Pakistan in his book Main Aur Mera Pakistan published in 2014 in Urdu and Hindi [467] The book contains

Kennington Oval, London, and in 1882, Wales faced Ireland for the first time, winning 7–1 in Wrexham.\n\n\n1958 World Cup\nThe 1950s were a golden age for Welsh football with stars such as Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Alf Sherwood, Jack Kelsey, Trevor Ford, Ronnie Burgess, Terry Medwin, Mel Charles and John Charles.\n\n\n1970s\nWales failed to qualify for the first four finals tournaments of the UEFA European Championship from its inception in 1960 They also did not replicate their success in qualifying for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, although they did achieve a highly creditable draw against then world champions England in the 1970 British Home Championship, weeks before England went to defend their title in Mexico 1970 FIFA World Cup This helped to give Wales a share of the Home Championship trophy for the year, goal difference not at that stage being used to determine an outright winner In 1976, the team – managed by Mike Smith – reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship, having finished top of qualifying Group 2 ahead of Hungary, Austria and Luxembourg, but this was not considered part of the finals Prior to 1980, only four countries qualified for the finals tournament, and Wales were drawn to play against the winners of Group 3 – Yugoslavia – in a two-legged, home-and-away tie Wales lost the first leg 2–0 in Zagreb and were eliminated from the competition following a 1–1 draw in a bad-tempered return leg at Cardiff's Ninian Park, which was marred by crowd trouble This initially led to Wales being banned from the 1980 tournament, but this was reduced on appeal to a four-year ban on qualifying matches being played within 100 miles of Cardiff Yugoslavia went on to finish fourth in the 1976 tournament.\n\n\n1980s\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Wales team – managed by Mike England – came extremely close to qualification; a 3–0 defeat against the Soviet Union in their final match meant they missed out on goal difference, but the real damage had been done by their failure to beat Iceland in their last home match, the match eventually finishing 2–2 after several hold-ups due to floodlight failures.\n\n\n1990s\nUnder coach Terry Yorath, Wales achieved a remarkable result on 5 June 1991 when defeating then world champions Germany in a Euro 1992 qualifier, thanks to a goal from Ian Rush Three months later, on 11 September 1991, Wales achieved a notable double by defeating Brazil for the only time in a friendly international, thanks to a goal from Dean Saunders [10] At this point, Wales seemed well placed to progress from their qualifying group 5 However, victories for Germany in their three remaining matches in the group, including a 4–1 win in the return fixture against Wales, eliminated the Welsh.\n\n\n2000s\nUnder Mark Hughes, Wales came close to qualifying for a place at Euro 2004 in Portugal, being narrowly defeated by Russia in the play-offs However, the defeat was not without its controversy, as Russian midfielder Yegor Titov tested positive for the use of a banned substance after the first qualifying leg, [16] a scoreless draw in Moscow Notwithstanding, FIFA opted not to take action against the Football Union of Russia other than instructing them not to field Titov again, and the Russian team went on to defeat Wales 1–0 in Cardiff to qualify for the final tournament [citation needed]\n\n\n2010s\nGary Speed was appointed as permanent manager on 14 December 2010 [23] Speed appointed 20-year-old Aaron Ramsey captain, making him the youngest Wales captain [24] In August 2011, Wales attained their lowest FIFA ranking of 117th [25] After some promising performances, in October 2011, Wales had rapidly risen to 45th in the FIFA rankings [citation needed] A 4–1 home win in a friendly match against Norway on 12 November 2011 proved to be Speed's last match in charge of Wales [citation needed] The match was a culmination of Speed's efforts which led Wales to receive the unofficial award for biggest mover of 2011 in the FIFA rankings [26] His tenure as manager ended in tragic circumstances two weeks later when he was found dead at his home on 27 November, having apparently committed suicide [27] [28]\n\n\nEuro 2016\nWales qualified for Euro 2016 in France, their first European Championship tournament, and were drawn into Group B with Slovakia, Russia and England On their Euro debut, on 11 June against Slovakia at the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Gareth Bale scored direct from a free-kick to give Wales a 1–0 lead, and Hal Robson-Kanu scored the winner in a 2–1 victory [41] In their second match, against England in Lens, Wales led 1–0 at half-time through another Bale free-kick, but lost 2–1 [42] Against Russia at the Stadium Municipal in Toulouse, Aaron Ramsey, Neil Taylor and Bale scored in a 3–0 win that made them win the group [43]\n\n\n2018 World Cup qualification and China Cup\nWales finished third in their 2018 World Cup qualifying group, therefore failing to qualify for the final tournament [48] [49] Chris Coleman resigned as Wales manager on 17 November 2017 to join Sunderland [50]\n\n\n2020s\nOn 15 January 2018, Ryan Giggs was confirmed as new manager [54] Despite losing two of the first three qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2020, [55] Wales went unbeaten in the second half of 2019 and ultimately qualified in second place following a 2–0 win over Hungary in their final match on 19 November [56] [57] Euro 2020 was delayed until 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, which meant Wales' next games came in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League [58] [56] They kept five consecutive clean sheets on the way to an unbeaten record in the competition, winning five games and drawing one, despite Giggs not being available for the last two games due to legal troubles [59] [60] With Rob Page in interim charge, the team beat Finland 3–1 in their final match to finish top of the group and gain promotion to League A for the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League [61]\n\n\nTeam image\nLive television broadcast rights are held by S4C (Welsh language commentary) and Sky Sports (English language commentary) until

Chwarae (\"The best play is team play\") The motto was briefly removed in 1984, but the badge stayed largely the same until 2010, when the shield was changed to feature rounded sides and the motto banner was changed from white to red and green The dragon also changed from rampant to rampant regardant The motto was removed again in 2019, following another major redesign of the badge, which saw the top of the shield flattened and the sides changed not to curve outwards; the green border was also thinned and the daffodils removed [79]\n\n\nKit supplier\nThe team is sometimes known and branded

football team represents Wales in international football. The team is controlled by the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the governing body for football in Wales.\n\n## History\n\nWales played its first competitive match on 25 March 1876 against Scotland in Glasgow, making it the third-oldest international football team in the world. Although the Scots won the first fixture 4–0, a return match was planned in Wales the following year, and so it was that the first international football match on Welsh soil took place at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, on 5 March 1877. Scotland took the spoils winning 2–0. Wales' first match against England came in 1879, a 2–1 defeat at the Kennington Oval, London, and in 1882, Wales faced Ireland for the first time, winning 7–1 in Wrexham.\n\n## The early years\n\nThe early years of Welsh football were marked by struggles on the pitch, with the team failing to make significant progress in international competitions. However, the team's performances were often boosted by the presence of talented players such as Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, and John Charles. These players helped to bring a sense of excitement and optimism to the team, and their contributions were instrumental in Wales' successes during this period.\n\n## 1958 World Cup\n\nThe 1950s were a golden age for Welsh football, with the team achieving a highly creditable draw against then world champions England in the 1970 British Home Championship. This helped to give Wales a share of the Home Championship trophy for the year, goal difference not at that stage being used to determine an outright winner. The team also qualified for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, finishing fourth in their group.\n\n## 1970s\n\nWales failed to qualify for the first four finals tournaments of the UEFA European Championship from its inception in 1960. The team also did not replicate their success in qualifying for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, although they did achieve a highly creditable draw against then world champions England in the 1970 British Home Championship. This helped to give Wales a share of the Home Championship trophy for the year, goal difference not at that stage being used to determine an outright winner. In 1976, the team – managed by Mike Smith – reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship, having finished top of qualifying Group 2 ahead of Hungary, Austria, and Luxembourg.\n\n## 1980s\n\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Wales team – managed by Mike England – came extremely close to qualification, but ultimately missed out on goal difference. The real damage had been done by their failure to beat Iceland in their last home match, the match eventually finishing 2–2 after several hold-ups due to floodlight failures.\n\n## 1990s\n\nUnder coach Terry Yorath, Wales achieved a remarkable result on 5 June 1991 when defeating then world champions Germany in a Euro 1992 qualifier, thanks to a goal from Ian Rush. Three months later, on 11 September 1991, Wales achieved a notable double by defeating Brazil for the only time in a friendly international, thanks to a goal from Dean Saunders. At this point, Wales seemed well placed to progress from their qualifying group, but victories for Germany in their remaining matches eliminated the Welsh team.\n\n## 2000s\n\nUnder Mark Hughes, Wales came close to qualifying for a place at Euro 2004 in Portugal, but were narrowly defeated by Russia in the play-offs. The defeat was not without controversy, as Russian midfielder Yegor Titov tested positive for the use of a banned substance after the first qualifying leg. Notwithstanding, FIFA opted not to take action against the Football Union of Russia other than instructing them not to field Titov again, and the Russian team went on to defeat Wales 1–0 in Cardiff to qualify for the final tournament.\n\n## 2010s\n\nGary Speed was appointed as permanent manager on 14 December 2010. Speed appointed 20-year-old Aaron Ramsey captain, making him the youngest Wales captain. In August 2011, Wales attained their lowest FIFA ranking of 117th. After some promising performances, in October 2011, Wales had rapidly risen to 45th in the FIFA rankings. A 4–1 home win in a friendly match against Norway on 12 November 2011 proved to be Speed's last match in charge of Wales. The match was a culmination of Speed's efforts which led Wales to receive the unofficial award for biggest mover of 2011 in the FIFA rankings. His tenure as manager ended in tragic circumstances two weeks later when he was found dead at his home on 27 November, having apparently committed suicide.\n\n## Euro 2016\n\nWales qualified for Euro 2016 in France, their first European Championship tournament, and were drawn into Group B with Slovakia, Russia, and England. On their Euro debut, on 11 June against Slovakia at the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Gareth Bale scored direct from a free-kick to give Wales a 1–0 lead, and Hal Robson-Kanu scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In their second match, against England in Lens, Wales led 1–0 at half-time through another Bale free-kick, but lost 2–1. Against Russia at the Stadium Municipal in Toulouse, Aaron Ramsey, Neil Taylor, and Bale scored in a 3–0 win that made them win the group.\n\n## 2018 World Cup qualification and China Cup\n\nWales finished third in their 2018 World Cup qualifying group, therefore failing to qualify for the final tournament. Chris Coleman resigned as Wales manager on 17 November 2017 to join Sunderland.\n\n## 2020s\n\nOn 15 January 2018, Ryan Giggs was confirmed as new manager. Despite losing two of the first three qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2020, Wales went unbeaten in the second half of 2019 and ultimately qualified in second place following a 2–0 win over Hungary in their final match on 19 November. Euro 2020 was delayed until 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, which meant Wales' next games came in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. They kept five consecutive clean sheets on the way to an unbeaten record in the competition, winning five games and drawing one, despite Giggs not being available for the last two games due to legal troubles. With Rob Page in interim charge, the team beat Finland 3–1 in their final match to finish top of the group and gain promotion to League A for the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League.\n\n## Team image\n\nLive television broadcast rights are held by S4C (Welsh language commentary) and Sky Sports (English language commentary) until 2022.\n\n## Colours and logo\n\nThe primary kit has long been all-red. The crest of the Football Association of Wales features a rampant Welsh Dragon on a white shield. From 1920, the shield was surrounded by a red border, and the letters 'FAW' were added in 1926. The badge was redesigned in 1951, adding a green border with 11 daffodils, as well as the Welsh-language motto Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae (\"The best play is team play\"). The motto was briefly removed in 1984, but the badge stayed largely the same until 2010, when the shield was changed to feature rounded sides and the motto banner was changed from white to red and green. The dragon also changed from rampant to rampant regardant. The motto was removed again in 2019, following another major redesign of the badge, which saw the top of the shield flattened and the sides changed not to curve outwards; the green border was also thinned and the daffodils removed.\n\n## Kit supplier\n\nThe team is sometimes known and branded mononymously as \"Cymru\", the Welsh language name for Wales, by the Football Association of Wales (FAW; or in Welsh: Cymdeithas Bêl-droed Cymru; CBC), as the FAW uses the term in its internal and external communications. In October 2022, the FAW announced it was considering rebranding the team to only use the Welsh name for the country, ditching the term \"Wales\", following the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The association said it was in discussions with UEFA over how to change the name, and were inspired by Turkey's rebrand to Türkiye and not being the last country alphabetically in some football events.\n\n## Name\n\nThe team is sometimes known and branded mononymously as \"Cymru\", the Welsh language name for Wales, by the Football Association of Wales (FAW; or in Welsh: Cymdeithas Bêl-droed Cymru; CBC), as the FAW uses the term in its internal and external communications.

1976, the team – managed by Mike Smith – reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship, having finished top of qualifying Group 2 ahead of Hungary, Austria and Luxembourg, but this was not considered part of the finals Prior to 1980, only four countries qualified for the finals tournament, and Wales were drawn to play against the winners of Group 3 – Yugoslavia – in a two-legged, home-and-away tie Wales lost the first leg 2–0 in Zagreb and were eliminated from the competition following a 1–1 draw in a bad-tempered return leg at Cardiff's Ninian Park, which was marred by crowd trouble This initially led to Wales being banned from the 1980 tournament, but this was reduced on appeal to a four-year ban on qualifying matches being played within 100 miles of Cardiff Yugoslavia

lawyer and his father is a Monte Carlo-based banker of Catalan Spanish descent [4] [5] [6] He has a younger brother, Gautier, who played for his older brother's former club Nice as a central defender [7] [8] As a youth, like his international and club teammate Yoann Gourcuff, Lloris excelled at tennis and played the sport up until the age of 13 He was among the top players in his age group, ranking high in the country's national standings before opting to focus on football [5]\n\n\nClub career\nLloris started playing football at the age of six at CEDAC (Centre de Diffusion et d'Action Culturelle), a local cultural center based in the neighborhood of Cimiez, Nice [10] [11] The centre offered a variety of activities, which included football Lloris played a variety of positions at the centre, such as in the attack, before switching to the goalkeeper position after coaches noticed that he possessed impressive goalkeeping qualities, such as ball-handling and catching skills [10] Lloris excelled at the position and caught the attention of former Nice goalkeeper and French international Dominique Baratelli, who recommended that the player join his former club At the age of ten, Lloris joined Nice's youth academy [10] He spent several years in the club's youth academy and was the starting goalkeeper for the club's under-17 team that won the 2003–04 edition of the Championnat Nationaux des 18 ans, a country-wide domestic league competition for players under the age of 18 [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nLloris received his first call-up to the senior national team for France's 6

an \"acrobatic shot-stopper,\" due to his athleticism in goal, [131] and is considered to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world, [132] [133] [134] with his former Tottenham manager José Mourinho even describing him as \"the best in the Premier League\" in 2020 [135] While he has been described in the media as being comfortable with the ball at his feet and generally reliable in his passing, [136] he has also come into criticism due to some high-profile errors he has made in his entire career, which often resulted in goals, mainly due to his poor distribution and decision making when

She stated that she was heavily invested in that relationship, saying in 2005, \"...all I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would let me have a baby with him.\" The band almost split up when Kanal ended the relationship. Their break-up inspired Stefani lyrically, and many of Tragic Kingdom's songs, such as \"Don't Speak\", \"Sunday Morning\", and \"Hey You!\", chronicle the ups and downs of their relationship.\n\n**Discography**\n\n**Solo Discography**\n\n* Love Angel Music Baby.

takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as new wave, synthpop, and electro [41] Stefani's decision to use her solo career as an opportunity to delve further into pop music instead of trying \"to convince the world of  [her] talent, depth and artistic worth\" was considered unusual [9] The album was described as \"fun as hell but .. not exactly rife with subversive social commentary\" [42] The album debuted on the US Billboard 200 albums chart at number seven, selling 309,000 copies in its first week [43] L.A.M.B reached multi-platinum status in the

fashion line named L.A.M.B in 2004 [19] The line takes influence from a variety of fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles [146] The line achieved popularity among celebrities and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself [147] [148] In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as \"a glorified merchandise line\", with varied products including a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments [149] [150] In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called

The way a city is defined can vary depending on the context and the criteria used. In this article, we will explore the different definitions of a city and provide a list of the largest cities in the world.\n\n**Definitions**\n\nA city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. UNICEF defines city proper as, \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government. Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.\n\n## City Proper (Administrative)\n\nA city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. This definition is often used by governments and administrative agencies to define the boundaries and population of a city. For example, the city proper of Tokyo, Japan includes the 23 wards of Tokyo, but excludes the surrounding suburbs and metropolitan area.\n\n## Urban Area\n\nA city can be defined as a conditionally contiguous urban area, without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. This definition is often used by urban planners and researchers to study the characteristics and trends of urban areas. For example, the urban area of New York City includes the five boroughs of New York City, as well as parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\n## Metropolitan Area\n\nA city can be defined by the inhabitants of its demographic population, as by metropolitan area, or labour market area. This definition is often used by economists and demographers to study the economic and demographic characteristics of a city and its surrounding area. For example, the metropolitan area of Los Angeles includes the city of Los Angeles and surrounding cities and suburbs in Los Angeles County.\n\n**List**\n\nThere are 81 cities in the world with a population exceeding 5 million people, according to 2018 estimates by the United Nations. The UN figures include a mixture of city proper, metropolitan area, and urban area. Here is a list of the 81 cities:\n\n1. Tokyo, Japan (38,140,000)\n2. Delhi, India (29,280,000)\n3.

{"title": "Easter", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe modern English term Easter, cognate with modern Dutch ooster and German Ostern, developed from an Old English word that usually appears in the form Ēastrun, Ēastron, or Ēastran; but also as Ēastru, Ēastro; and Ēastre or Ēostre [nb 4] Bede provides the only documentary source for the etymology of the word, in his eighth-century The Reckoning of Time He wrote that Ēosturmōnaþ (Old English for 'Month of Ēostre', translated in Bede's time as \"Paschal month\") was an English month, corresponding to April, which he says \"was once called after a goddess of theirs named Ēostre, in whose honour feasts were celebrated in that month\" [35]\n\n\nTheological significance\nEaster celebrates Jesus' supernatural resurrection from the dead, which is one of the chief tenets of the Christian faith [45] Paul writes that, for those who trust in Jesus's death and resurrection, \"death is swallowed up in victory\" The First Epistle of Peter declares that God has given believers \"a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead\" Christian theology holds that, through faith in the working of God, those who follow Jesus are spiritually resurrected with him so that they may walk in a new way of life and receive eternal salvation, and can hope to be physically resurrected to dwell with him in the Kingdom of Heaven [46]\n\n\nEarly Christianity\nAs the Gospels assert that both the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus occurred during the week of Passover, the first Christians timed the observance of the annual celebration of the resurrection in relation to Passover [49] Direct evidence for a more fully formed Christian festival of Pascha (Easter) begins to appear in the mid-2nd century Perhaps the earliest extant primary source referring to Easter is a mid-2nd-century Paschal homily attributed to Melito of Sardis, which characterizes the celebration as a well-established one [50] Evidence for another kind of annually recurring Christian festival, those commemorating the martyrs, began to appear at about the same time as the above homily [51]\n\n\nDate\nEaster and the holidays that are related to it are moveable feasts, in that they do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars (both of which follow the cycle of the sun and the seasons) Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar \n\n\nEarly Church controversies\nThe precise date of Easter has at times been a matter of contention By the later 2nd century, it was widely accepted that the celebration of the holiday was a practice of the disciples and an undisputed tradition The Quartodeciman controversy, the first of several Easter controversies, arose concerning the date on which the holiday should be celebrated [55]\n\n\nFirst Council of Nicaea (325 AD)\nThe settlement of the controversy about the Paschal season caused by the Quartodeciman practice of Asian churches is listed in our principal source for the works of the Council of Nicaea, Socrates Scholasticus's Ecclesiastical History, as one of the two reasons for which emperor Constantine convened the Council in 325 [70] The Canons of the Council preserved by Dionysius Exiguus and his successors do not include any relevant provision, but letters of individuals present at the Council mention a decision prohibiting Quartodecimanism and requiring that all Christians adopt a common method to independently determine Paschal observance following the churches of Rome and Alexandria, the latter \"since there was among the Egyptians an ancient science for the computation.\" [71]\nAlready in the end of the 4th century and, later on, Dionysius Exiguus and others following him maintained that the bishops assembled at Nicaea had promulgated the celebration of Easter on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox and that they had adopted the use of the 19-year lunar cycle, better known as Metonic cycle, to determine the date; subsequent scholarship has refuted this tradition, but, with regards to the rule of the equinox, evidence that the church of Alexandria had implemented it before 325 suggests that the Council of Nicaea implicitly endorsed it [72]\n\n\nComputations\nIn 725, Bede succinctly wrote: \"The Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox will give the lawful Easter.\" [82] However, this does not precisely reflect the ecclesiastical rules The full moon referred to (called the Paschal full moon) is not an astronomical full moon, but the 14th day of a lunar month Another difference is that the astronomical equinox is a natural astronomical phenomenon, which can fall on 19, 20 or 21 March, [83] while the ecclesiastical date is fixed by convention on 21 March [84]\n\n\nWestern-Eastern divergence\nIn Western Christianity, using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April, [89] within about seven days after the astronomical full moon [90] The preceding Friday, Good Friday, and following Monday, Easter Monday, are legal holidays in many countries with predominantly Christian traditions [91]\n\n\nProposed reforms of the date\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, some individuals and institutions have propounded changing the method of calculating the date for Easter, the most prominent proposal being the Sunday after the second Saturday in April Despite having some support, proposals to reform the date have not been implemented [95] An Orthodox congress of Eastern Orthodox bishops, which included representatives mostly from the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Serbian Patriarch, met in Constantinople in 1923, where the bishops agreed to the Revised Julian calendar [96]\n\n\nTable of the dates of Easter by Gregorian and Julian calendars\nThe WCC presented comparative data of the relationships:\n\n\nPosition in the church year\nIn most branches of Western Christianity, Easter is preceded by Lent, a period of penitence that begins on Ash Wednesday, lasts 40 days (not counting Sundays), and is often marked with fasting The week before Easter, known as Holy Week, is an important time for observers to commemorate the final week of Jesus' life on earth [106] The Sunday before Easter is Palm Sunday, with the Wednesday before Easter being known as Spy Wednesday (or Holy Wednesday) The last three days before Easter are Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday (sometimes referred to as Silent Saturday) [107]\n\n\nWestern Christianity\nThe Easter festival is kept in many different ways among Western Christians The traditional, liturgical observation of Easter, as practised among Roman Catholics, Lutherans, [120] and some Anglicans begins on the night of Holy Saturday with the Easter Vigil which follows an ancient liturgy involving symbols of light, candles and water and numerous readings form the Old and New Testament [121]\n\n\nEastern Christianity\nEastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholics and Byzantine Rite Lutherans have a similar emphasis on Easter in their calendars, and many of their liturgical customs are very similar [126]\n\n\nLiturgical observance\nThe Easter festival is kept in many different ways among Western Christians The traditional, liturgical observation of Easter, as

Anglican Church, such as All Saints' Day and Easter, as abominations because the Bible does not mention them [129] [130] Conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Easter as a violation of the regulative principle of worship and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin [131] [132]\n\n\nEaster celebrations around the world\nIn countries where Christianity is a state religion, or those with large Christian populations, Easter is often a public holiday [140] As Easter always falls on a Sunday, many countries in the world also recognize Good Friday and Easter Monday as public holidays [141] Depending on the country, retail stores, shopping malls and restaurants may be closed on the Friday, Monday or Sunday [142]\n\n\nEaster eggs\nThe egg is an ancient symbol of new life and rebirth [156] In Christianity it became associated with Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection [157] The custom of the Easter egg originated in the early Christian community of Mesopotamia, who stained eggs red in memory of the blood of Christ, shed at his crucifixion [158] [159] As such, for Christians, the Easter egg is a symbol of the empty tomb [25] [26] The oldest tradition is to use dyed chicken eggs.\n\n\nTraditional customs\nThe egg is an

many people give up candy (sweets) as their Lenten sacrifice, individuals indulge in them at Easter after having abstained during the preceding forty days of Lent [162]\n\n\nEaster Bunny\nIn some traditions, the children put out their empty baskets for the Easter Bunny to fill while they sleep They wake to find their baskets filled with candy eggs and other treats [166] [31] A custom originating in Germany, [166] the Easter Bunny is a popular legendary anthropomorphic Easter gift-giving character analogous to Santa Claus in American culture Many children around the world follow the tradition of coloring hard-boiled eggs and giving baskets of candy [31] Historically, foxes, cranes and storks were also sometimes named as the mystical creatures [166] Since the rabbit is a pest in Australia, the Easter Bilby is available as an alternative [167]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays,

such as All Saints' Day and Easter, as abominations because the Bible does not mention them [129] [130] Conservative Reformed denominations such as the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America likewise reject the celebration of Easter as a violation of the regulative principle of worship and what they see as its non-Scriptural origin [131] [132]\n\n\nEaster celebrations around the world\nIn countries where Christianity is a state religion, or those with large Christian populations, Easter is often a public holiday [140] As Easter always falls on a Sunday, many countries in the world also recognize Good Friday and Easter Monday as public holidays [141] Depending on the country, retail stores, shopping malls and restaurants may be closed on the Friday, Monday or Sunday [142]\n\n\nEaster eggs\nThe egg is an ancient symbol of new life and rebirth [156] In Christianity it became associated with Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection [157] The custom of the Easter egg originated in the early Christian community of Mesopotamia, who stained eggs red in memory of the blood of Christ, shed at his crucifixion [158] [159] As such, for Christians, the Easter egg is a symbol of the empty tomb [25] [26] The oldest tradition is to use dyed chicken eggs.\n\n\nTraditional customs\nThe egg is an ancient symbol of new life and rebirth

their Lenten sacrifice, individuals indulge in them at Easter after having abstained during the preceding forty days of Lent [162]\n\n\nEaster Bunny\nIn some traditions, the children put out their empty baskets for the Easter Bunny to fill while they sleep They wake to find their baskets filled with candy eggs and other treats [166] [31] A custom originating in Germany, [166] the Easter Bunny is a popular legendary anthropomorphic Easter gift-giving character analogous to Santa Claus in American culture Many children around the world follow the tradition of coloring hard-boiled eggs and giving baskets of candy [31] Historically, foxes, cranes and storks were also sometimes named as the mystical creatures [166] Since the rabbit is a pest in Australia, the Easter Bilby is available as an alternative [167]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific

In the United States, impeachment is a constitutional process that can be initiated at both the federal and state levels. This article provides an overview of the impeachment process in the United States, including its history, procedures, and outcomes.\n\n**Federal Impeachment**\n\nThe United States Constitution provides for the impeachment of federal officials, including the President, Vice President, and members of Congress. Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution states that \"The House of Representatives... shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\" This means that the House of Representatives has the exclusive power to initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials.\n\n**Constitutional Provisions**\n\nThe Constitution sets out the procedures for impeachment in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5, which states:\n\n\"The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. All impeachments shall be prosecuted and tried by the Senate, and no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.\"\n\nThis provision establishes the following key elements of the impeachment process:\n\n* The House of Representatives has the sole power to initiate impeachment proceedings.\n* The Senate has the power to try impeachments and convict federal officials.\n* A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is required for conviction.\n\n**Process**\n\nThe impeachment process typically involves three stages:\n\n1. **Impeachment Inquiry**: The first stage is an impeachment inquiry, which is an investigation into the alleged misconduct of a federal official. This stage is not constitutionally required, but it is typically used to gather evidence and determine whether there is sufficient cause to proceed with impeachment.\n2. **Impeachment Vote**: If the impeachment inquiry determines that there is sufficient cause, the House of Representatives will hold a vote on whether to impeach the official. A simple majority vote is required for impeachment.\n3. **Trial**: After impeachment, the case is sent to the Senate for trial. The Senate will hold a trial, and if a two-thirds majority vote is required for conviction, the official will be removed from office.\n\n**Impeachment in the House of Representatives**\n\nImpeachment proceedings may be requested by a member of the House of Representatives or by non-members, such as the Judicial Conference of the United States or a special prosecutor. The impeachment process begins with a resolution adopted by the full House of Representatives.\n\n**Trial in the Senate**\n\nSenate rules call for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 pm on the day after articles of impeachment are delivered to the Senate, except for Sundays. There is no timeframe requirement for when the managers must actually deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate. On the set date, senators are sworn in for the impeachment trial.\n\n**Removal and Disqualification**\n\nConviction immediately removes the defendant from office. Following the vote on conviction, the Senate may by a separate vote also bar the individual from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. The Senate has taken the position that disqualification votes only require a simple majority rather than a two-thirds supermajority.\n\n**Impeachment by State and Territorial Governments**\n\nState legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors and judicial officers, in every state except Oregon. The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal model. Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges.\n\n**Impeachment by Other Government Bodies and Organizations in the United States**\n\nOther governments and organizations in the United States also utilize impeachment. Tribal governments and municipal governments have impeachment procedures, including for officials such as mayors. Some cities, such as Houston, Missouri, allow for officials to be impeached by the municipal government.\n\n**Impeachment During the Colonial Era**\n\nSeveral of the Thirteen Colonies belonging to England that later formed the original states of the United States of America held impeachments. Impeachment was a process carried over from England. In the colonies, impeachment was a process that could also be used to try non-officeholders and give criminal penalties.\n\n**Impeachment in Independent Governments Later Admitted as States**\n\nSome states were independent governments before being admitted into the United States. In Vermont, some impeachments took place prior to its statehood.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Government.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Government.\n\n**Attribution**\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the United States Government.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nThis article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of impeachment in the United States.

The basilica is situated on Saint-Epvre square and is a significant example of Gothic architecture in the region.\n\nAccess and location\n--------------------\n\nThe basilica is easily accessible from the town center, with several nearby bus stops and a short walking distance to the main railway station. The square in front of the church is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, featuring several cafes and shops. The basilica's location in the old part of Nancy makes it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history and architecture.\n\nOrigin of the name\n-----------------\n\nThe basilica is named after Saint Epvre, the Aprus of Toul, whose relics are kept within a shrine in the altar. The name \"Saint-Epvre\" has been used since the end of the 19th century, although the church was sometimes referred to as \"Saint-Épure\" in the past.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of the Saint-Epvre Basilica dates back to the 11th century, when the parish church was founded by Duke Thierry II de Lorraine in 1080. The church was rebuilt in the flamboyant Gothic style between 1436 and 1451, with the addition of a church spire that served as a watchtower due to its high vantage point in the medieval town. The spire offered a panoramic view of the town and surrounding countryside, making it an essential landmark for the local population.\n\nProsper Morey's reconstruction\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the idea of reconstructing the basilica in a neo-Gothic style was proposed. The project was not without controversy, with some critics expressing opposition to the style and others questioning the necessity of such a reconstruction. The debate was reflected in a polemical publication in 1859, which criticized the neo-Gothic style and argued that it was not suitable for the basilica.\n\nDespite the opposition, the architectural competition for the reconstruction was launched, and various proposals were submitted. The winning design was submitted by Prosper Morey, a French architect who specialized in neo-Gothic architecture. Morey's design aimed to create a sense of continuity with the original 15th-century church while incorporating the latest architectural trends of the time.\n\nThe reconstruction of the basilica began in 1865 and took several years to complete. The project involved the removal of the original 15th-century church, which was largely preserved and integrated into the new building. The new basilica was designed to be larger and more imposing than the original church, with a striking facade and a tall, slender spire.\n\nThe reconstruction was not without controversy, with some critics arguing that it did not accurately represent the original 15th-century church. However, the project was ultimately completed, and the Saint-Epvre Basilica was officially consecrated in 1875.\n\nArchitecture\n------------\n\nThe Saint-Epvre Basilica is a striking example of neo-Gothic architecture, with a facade that features a tall, slender spire and a series of intricate stone carvings. The church is built using a combination of limestone and sandstone, with a striking contrast between the two materials that adds to the overall visual impact of the building.\n\nThe interior of the basilica is equally impressive, with a high, vaulted ceiling and a series of stunning stained-glass windows. The windows, which were designed by several prominent glass artists, feature a range of colors and patterns that create a sense of drama and spectacle.\n\nThe altar, which is dedicated to Saint Epvre, features a stunning shrine that houses the relics of the saint. The shrine is surrounded by a series of intricate stone carvings and ornate decoration, which add to the overall sense of reverence and devotion.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Saint-Epvre Basilica is a significant example of Gothic architecture in Nancy, France, and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in history and architecture. The basilica's stunning facade and impressive interior make it a truly unforgettable experience, and its rich history and cultural significance make it a valuable part of the region's heritage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint-Epvre_Basilica\" following this outline:\n\n\nAccess and location\nIt is located on Saint-Epvre square, in Nancy, in the old part of the town.\n\n\nOrigin of the name\nThe basilica, being the third church built in this location since the foundation of the Saint-Epvre parish in 1080, is dedicated to Saint Epvre, the Aprus of Toul, whose relics are kept within a shrine in the altar It was sometimes called Saint-Épure, until the end of the 19th century.\n\n\nHistory\nThe duke Thierry II de Lorraine settled the parish church in 1080 Between 1436 and 1451, the edifice is rebuilt in the flamboyant gothic style, and the church spire was also used as a watch tower, because it was the highest viewpoint in the medieval town.\n\n\nProsper Morey's reconstruction\nThe idea of reconstructing the edifice in a neo-gothic style was not unanimous, and some critics were heard even before the architectural competition was launched The opponents were against neo-gothic style, which was criticized in a polemical publication in 1859.\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Charles_II_of_England", "content": "\nEarly life, civil war and exile\nCharles was born at St James's Palace on 29 May 1630, eldest surviving son of Charles I, king of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his wife Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII of France Charles was their second child (the first being a son born about a year before, who had died within a day) [2] He was baptised on 27 June in the Chapel Royal by William Laud, a future archbishop of Canterbury, and during his infancy was supervised by the Protestant Countess of Dorset His godparents included his maternal uncle Louis XIII and maternal grandmother, Marie de' Medici, the Dowager Queen of France, both of whom were Catholics [3] At birth, Charles automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and the possessor of several other associated titles At or around his eighth birthday, he was designated Prince of Wales, though he was never formally invested [2]\n\n\nRestoration\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, Charles's initial chances of regaining the Crown seemed slim; Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard However, the new Lord Protector had little experience of either military or civil administration In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard Cromwell resigned During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy [21] Monck and his army marched into the City of London, and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament who had been excluded in December 1648, during Pride's Purge Parliament dissolved itself, and there was a general election for the first time in almost 20 years [22] The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications intending to bring about the return of a Presbyterian majority [23]\n\n\nClarendon Code\nThe Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660, and, shortly after Charles's English coronation, the second English Parliament of the reign assembled Dubbed the Cavalier Parliament, it was overwhelmingly Royalist and Anglican It sought to discourage non-conformity to the Church of England and passed several acts to secure Anglican dominance The Corporation Act 1661 required municipal officeholders to swear allegiance; [33] the Act of Uniformity 1662 made the use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer compulsory; the Conventicle Act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people, except under the auspices of the Church of England; and the Five Mile Act 1665 prohibited expelled non-conforming clergymen from coming within five miles (8 km) of a parish from which they had been banished The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles's reign The Acts became known as the Clarendon Code, after Lord Clarendon, even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against the Five Mile Act [34]\n\n\nGreat Plague and Great Fire\nIn 1665, the Great Plague of London began, peaking in September with up to 7,000 deaths per week [38] Charles, his family, and the court fled London in July to Salisbury; Parliament met in Oxford [39] Plague cases ebbed over the winter, and Charles returned to London in February 1666 [40]\n\n\nForeign policy and marriage\nSince 1640, Portugal had been fighting a war against Spain to restore its independence after a dynastic union of sixty years between the crowns of Spain and Portugal Portugal had been helped by France, but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally Negotiations with Portugal for Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father's reign and upon the restoration, Queen Luísa of Portugal, acting as regent, reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance [43] On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine's dowry of the port of Tangier in North Africa, the Seven Islands of Bombay in India (which had a major influence on the development of the British Empire), valuable trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal and two million Portuguese crowns (equivalent to £300,000 then [e]);

He was the son of Charles I and Henrietta Maria, and he was known for his charismatic personality, his love of pleasure, and his ability to navigate the complexities of the Restoration period.\n\n**Early life, civil war and exile**\n\nCharles was born at St James's Palace on 29 May 1630, eldest surviving son of Charles I, king of England, Scotland and Ireland, and his wife Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII of France. Charles was their second child (the first being a son born about a year before, who had died within a day). He was baptised on 27 June in the Chapel Royal by William Laud, a future archbishop of Canterbury, and during his infancy was supervised by the Protestant Countess of Dorset. His godparents included his maternal uncle Louis XIII and maternal grandmother, Marie de' Medici, the Dowager Queen of France, both of whom were Catholics.\n\nAt birth, Charles automatically became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and the possessor of several other associated titles. At or around his eighth birthday, he was designated Prince of Wales, though he was never formally invested.\n\n**Restoration**\n\nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, Charles's initial chances of regaining the Crown seemed slim; Cromwell was succeeded as Lord Protector by his son Richard. However, the new Lord Protector had little experience of either military or civil administration. In 1659, the Rump Parliament was recalled and Richard Cromwell resigned. During the civil and military unrest that followed, George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the City of London, and forced the Rump Parliament to re-admit members of the Long Parliament who had been excluded in December 1648, during Pride's Purge. Parliament dissolved itself, and there was a general election for the first time in almost 20 years. The outgoing Parliament defined the electoral qualifications intending to bring about the return of a Presbyterian majority.\n\n**Clarendon Code**\n\nThe Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660, and, shortly after Charles's English coronation, the second English Parliament of the reign assembled. Dubbed the Cavalier Parliament, it was overwhelmingly Royalist and Anglican. It sought to discourage non-conformity to the Church of England and passed several acts to secure Anglican dominance. The Corporation Act 1661 required municipal officeholders to swear allegiance; the Act of Uniformity 1662 made the use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer compulsory; the Conventicle Act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people, except under the auspices of the Church of England; and the Five Mile Act 1665 prohibited expelled non-conforming clergymen from coming within five miles of a parish from which they had been banished. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles's reign. The Acts became known as the Clarendon Code, after Lord Clarendon, even though he was not directly responsible for them and even spoke against the Five Mile Act.\n\n**Great Plague and Great Fire**\n\nIn 1665, the Great Plague of London began, peaking in September with up to 7,000 deaths per week. Charles, his family, and the court fled London in July to Salisbury; Parliament met in Oxford. Plague cases ebbed over the winter, and Charles returned to London in February 1666.\n\n**Foreign policy and marriage**\n\nSince 1640, Portugal had been fighting a war against Spain to restore its independence after a dynastic union of sixty years between the crowns of Spain and Portugal. Portugal had been helped by France, but in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 Portugal was abandoned by its French ally. Negotiations with Portugal for Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza began during his father's reign and upon the restoration, Queen Luísa of Portugal, acting as regent, reopened negotiations with England that resulted in an alliance. On 23 June 1661, a marriage treaty was signed; England acquired Catherine's dowry of the port of Tangier in North Africa, the Seven Islands of Bombay in India (which had a major influence on the development of the British Empire), valuable trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal and two million Portuguese crowns (equivalent to £300,000 then). While Portugal obtained military and naval support against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine.\n\n**Conflict with Parliament**\n\nAlthough previously favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king's wars and religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the Royal Declaration of Indulgence, in which he purported to suspend all penal laws against Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the Third Anglo-Dutch War.\n\n**Science**\n\nIn Charles's early childhood, William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle, was governor of the royal household and Brian Duppa, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, was his tutor. Neither man thought that the study of science subjects was appropriate for a future king, and Newcastle even advised against studying any subject too seriously. However, as Charles grew older, the renowned surgeon William Harvey was appointed his tutor. He was famous for his work on blood circulation in the human body and already held the position of physician to Charles I; his studies were to influence Charles's own attitude to science.\n\n**Later years**\n\nCharles faced a political storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next in line to the throne. The prospect of a Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (a former member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Lord Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).\n\n**Absolute monarch**\n\nFearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the continuing Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, for a second time that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for a more moderate Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.\n\n**Death**\n\nCharles suffered a sudden apoplectic fit on the morning of 2 February 1685, and died four days later at the Palace of Whitehall, at 11:45 am, aged 54. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison in the minds of many, including one of the royal doctors, but a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness are similar to those of uraemia, a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction. Charles had a laboratory among his many interests where, prior to his illness, he had been experimenting with mercury. Mercuric poisoning can produce irreversible kidney damage, but the case for that being a cause of his death is unproven. In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments, including bloodletting, purging and cupping, in the hope of effecting a recovery, which may have exacerbated his uraemia through dehydration, rather than helping to alleviate it.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe escapades of Charles after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester remained important to him throughout his life. He delighted and bored listeners with tales of his escape for many years. Numerous accounts of his adventures were published, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the Restoration. Though not averse to his escape being ascribed to divine providence, Charles himself seems to have delighted most in his ability to sustain his disguise as a man of ordinary origins, and to move unrecognised through his realm. Ironic and cynical, Charles took pleasure in stories that demonstrated the undetectable nature of any inherent majesty he possessed.\n\n**Titles, styles, honours and arms**\n\nThe official style of Charles II was \"Charles the Second, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" The claim to France was only nominal, and had been asserted by every English monarch since Edward III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled.\n\n**Issue**\n\nBy Lucy Walter (c. 1630 – 1658):\n\n* James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth (1649–1685)\n* Charles FitzCharles, 1st Earl of Plymouth (1657–1680)\n* Henry FitzCharles, 1st Baron Netherwood (1659–1690)\n* Charlotte Lee, Countess of Lichfield (1650–1718)\n* Anne Palmer, Countess of Chesterfield (1651–1690)\n* Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans (1670–1726)\n* James Beauclerk (1671–1681)\n* Mary Tudor (1673–1726)\n\n**Genealogical tables**\n\nSee also: Genealogy of Charles II of England\n\n**Notes**\n\n1.

She is the first woman to hold the position of President of India.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on June 20, 1958, in Uparbeda village, Baidaposi area of Rairangpur, Odisha. Her father, Biranchi Narayan Tudu, was a farmer, and her father and grandfather were traditional heads of the village council. Her family named her Durgi Tudu, but she was later renamed Droupadi by her school teacher. She has been nicknamed Batti, which eventually became Puti.\n\nMurmu was born into a Santali family, and her community has a rich cultural heritage. Her family has a strong tradition of social and community service, and she was encouraged to pursue her education and career in public service. She has spoken fondly of her family and community, and has credited them with instilling in her a strong sense of social responsibility and commitment to public service.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nFrom 1979 to 1983, Murmu worked as a junior assistant at the irrigation department of the Government of Odisha. After completing her education, she began her career in public service, working as a teacher at the Sri Aurobindo Integral Education and Research Centre in Rairangpur from 1994 to 1997. She taught Hindi, Odia, mathematics, and geography to students, and was known for her dedication and commitment to her students.\n\nMurmu never claimed a full salary at the school, instead using her earnings to support her family and community. This selflessness and generosity were characteristic of her early career, and would become a hallmark of her later public service.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn 1997, Murmu was elected as the councillor of the Rairangpur Nagar Panchayat, becoming the first woman to hold the position from a reserved seat for women. She joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) soon after, and has remained a loyal member of the party throughout her career.\n\nMurmu's entry into politics marked the beginning of a long and distinguished career in public service. She has held various positions, including Governor of Jharkhand, and has been a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights. Her commitment to public service has earned her widespread respect and admiration, both within and outside the BJP.\n\n**Governor of Jharkhand (2015-2021)**\n\nOn May 18, 2015, Murmu was sworn in as the Governor of Jharkhand, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She served as Governor for six years, during which time she played a key role in promoting social justice and human rights in the state.\n\nMurmu's tenure as Governor was marked by several significant events, including the administration of the oath of office to Hemant Soren as Chief Minister of Jharkhand in 2019. She also played a key role in promoting the interests of tribal communities in the state, and was a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights.\n\n**Pathalgadi Movement**\n\nIn 2016-2017, the Raghubar Das ministry was seeking amendments to the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act, 1908, and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act, 1949. These two original laws had safeguarded the rights of tribal communities on their land, and land transactions could only be done between tribal communities. The new amendments gave the tribals the right to allow the government to make commercial use of tribal land and to take tribal land on lease.\n\nMurmu was a key player in the Pathalgadi movement, a mass protest movement organized by the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and other tribal organizations against the proposed amendments. She was a vocal advocate for the rights of tribal communities, and played a key role in promoting their interests in the state.\n\n**Religion and Land Bill**\n\nIn 2017, Murmu approved the Freedom of Religion Bill, 2017, and the bill to amend the Land Acquisition 2013 Act passed by the Jharkhand Assembly. These bills were designed to promote social justice and human rights in the state, and were a key part of Murmu's efforts to promote the interests of tribal communities.\n\n**Presidential Campaign**\n\nIn June 2022, the BJP nominated Murmu as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)'s candidate for President of India for the 2022 election. She was a strong contender for the position, and was eventually elected as the 15th President of India on July 21, 2022.\n\nMurmu's campaign was marked by several significant events, including her visits to various states to seek support for her candidature. She was a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights, and played a key role in promoting the interests of tribal communities.\n\n**Presidency (2022-present)**\n\nOn July 26, 2022, Murmu took the oath as the 15th President of India, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She was administered the oath of office by the 48th Chief Justice of India, N V Ramana, in the presence of former presidents, the vice-president, prime minister, and other delegates.\n\nMurmu's presidency has been marked by several significant events, including her commitment to social justice and human rights. She has been a vocal advocate for the rights of tribal communities, and has played a key role in promoting their interests in the country.\n\n**Electoral Performance**\n\nMurmu's electoral performance has been impressive, and she has been a strong contender for various positions throughout her career. She was elected as the councillor of the Rairangpur Nagar Panchayat in 1997, and has remained a loyal member of the BJP ever since. Her commitment to public service has earned her widespread respect and admiration, both within and outside the BJP.\n\n**State Honours**\n\nMurmu has been awarded several state honours, including the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian honour in the country. She has also been awarded the Jharkhand Government's highest civilian honour, the Jharkhand Gaurav Samman.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Governors of Jharkhand\n* List of Presidents of India\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n* Jharkhand Mukti Morcha\n* Pathalgadi movement\n* Tribal communities in India\n* Social justice and human rights in India\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Droupadi Murmu: A Bio-Data\".

Born on October 22, 1936, in Liberty, Texas, Seale has been a prominent figure in the struggle for racial equality and social justice in the United States.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nBobby Seale was born in Liberty, Texas, to George Seale, a carpenter, and Thelma Seale (née Traylor), a homemaker. The Seale family lived in poverty during most of his early life. After moving around Texas, first to Dallas, then to San Antonio, and Port Arthur, Seale's family relocated to Codornices Village in Albany, California, during the Great Migration when he was eight years old. Seale attended Berkeley High School, then dropped out in 1955 and joined the United States Air Force. Three years later, a court martial convicted him of fighting with a commanding officer at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, resulting in a bad conduct discharge.\n\nActivism and Leadership\n------------------------\n\nBobby Seale and Huey P Newton were strongly inspired by the teachings of activist Malcolm X, who had been assassinated in 1965. The two joined together in October 1966 to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan \"freedom by any means necessary\" as their own. Prior to starting the Black Panther Party, Seale and Newton created a group known as the Soul Students Advisory Council.

Prior to starting the Black Panther Party, Seale and Newton created a group known as the Soul Students Advisory Council. The group was organized to operate through \"ultra-democracy,\" defined as individualism manifesting itself as an aversion to discipline. \"The goal was to develop a college campus group that would help develop leadership; to go back to the black community and serve the black community in a revolutionary fashion.\"\n\nWriting\n--------\n\nSeale and Newton together wrote the doctrines \"What We Want Now!\", which Seale said were intended to be \"the practical, specific things we need and that should exist,\" and \"What We Believe,\" which outlines the philosophical principles of the Black Panther Party in order to educate the people and disseminate information about the specifics of the party's platform. These writings were part of the party's Ten-Point Program. Also known as \"The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense Ten-Point Platform and Program,\" this was a set of guidelines to the Black Panther Party's ideals and ways of operation. Seale and Newton named Newton as Minister of Defense and Seale as the Chairman of the party. During his time with the Panthers, Seale was kept under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of its illegal COINTELPRO program.\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 8\n---------------------------\n\nBobby Seale was one of the original \"Chicago Eight\" defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot in the wake of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. While in prison, Seale said, \"To be a Revolutionary is to be an Enemy of the state To be arrested for this struggle is to be a Political Prisoner.\" The evidence against Seale was slim, as he did not participate in activist planning for the convention's protests and had gone to Chicago as a last-minute replacement for activist Eldridge Cleaver. He was in Chicago for only two days of the convention.\n\nNew Haven Black Panther trials\n------------------------------\n\nWhile serving his four-year sentence, Seale was tried in 1970 as part of the New Haven Black Panther trials. Several officers of the Panther organization had killed fellow Panther, Alex Rackley, who had confessed under torture to being a police informant. The leader of the murder plan, George W Sams Jr., turned state's evidence and testified that Seale, who had visited New Haven hours before the murder, had ordered him to kill Rackley. The trials were accompanied by a large demonstration in New Haven on May Day, 1970. This coincided with the beginning of the American college student strike of 1970. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in Seale's trial, and the charges were eventually dropped. The government suspended his contempt convictions, and Seale was released from prison in 1972.\n\n1973 and 1974 activities\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1973 Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland, California as a Democrat. He received the second-most votes in a field of nine candidates but ultimately lost in a run-off with incumbent Mayor John Reading.\n\nThe Ten Point Platform\n----------------------\n\nSeale worked with Huey Newton to create the Ten Point platform. It included political and social demands they believed necessary for the survival of the Black population in the United States. The two men formulated the Ten Point Platform in the late 1960s, and from these ideologies developed the Black Panther Party. The document encapsulated the economic exploitation of the black body, and addressed the mistreatment of the black race. This document was attractive to those suffering under the oppressive nature of white power. The document is based on the conclusion that a combination of racism and capitalism resulted in fascism in the United States. The Ten Point Platform lays out the need for full employment of Black people, decent shelter, and decent education. They defined decent education as the full history of the United States, including acknowledgement of the genocide and displacement of Native Americans and the enslavement of Africans. The platform calls for the release of political prisoners.\n\nOther work\n------------\n\nIn 1978, Seale wrote an autobiography titled A Lonely Rage. Also, in 1987, he wrote a cookbook called Barbeque'n with Bobby Seale: Hickory & Mesquite Recipes, the proceeds going to various non-profit social organizations. Seale also advertised Ben & Jerry's ice cream.\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nSeale's life and activism have been featured in various films, books, and documentaries, including the 1990 film Panther, directed by Mario Van Peebles, and the 2016 film All Eyez on Me, which tells the story of Tupac Shakur's life and his interactions with Seale and other Black Panther leaders.\n\nPublications\n-------------\n\nSeale has written several books, including:\n\n* A Lonely Rage: The Autobiography (1978)\n* Barbeque'n with Bobby Seale: Hickory & Mesquite Recipes (1987)\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Black Panther Party\n* Huey P Newton\n* Malcolm X\n* COINTELPRO\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article is based on the following sources:\n\n* Bobby Seale's autobiography, A Lonely Rage\n* Various interviews and articles about Seale's life and activism\n\nFurther reading\n----------------\n\n* The Black Panther Party's Ten-Point Platform\n* The autobiography of Huey P Newton, Revolutionary Suicide\n* The biography of Malcolm X, Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention\n\nExternal links\n----------------\n\n* Bobby Seale's official website\n* The Black Panther Party's official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bobby_Seale\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBobby Seale was born in Liberty, Texas, to George Seale, a carpenter, and Thelma Seale (née Traylor), a homemaker [6] The Seale family lived in poverty during most of his early life After moving around Texas, first to Dallas, then to San Antonio, and Port Arthur, Seale's family relocated to Codornices Village [7] in Albany, California, during the Great Migration when he was eight years old [8] Seale attended Berkeley High School, then dropped out in 1955 and joined the United States Air Force [9] Three years later, a court martial convicted him of fighting with a commanding officer [citation needed] at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, [6] resulting in a bad conduct discharge [10]\n\n\nActivism and leadership\nBobby Seale and Huey P Newton were strongly inspired by the teachings of activist Malcolm X, who had been assassinated in 1965 The two joined together in October 1966 to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan \"freedom by any means necessary\" as their own Prior to starting the Black Panther Party, Seale and Newton created a group known as the Soul Students Advisory Council The group was organized to operate through \"ultra-democracy\", defined as individualism manifesting itself as an aversion to discipline \"The goal was to develop a college campus group that would help develop leadership;

initially used the same requirements as the 2030 World Cup FIFA later lowered the requirement for the number of existing stadiums with a minimum capacity of 40,000 from seven to four [4] Due to FIFA's confederation rotation policy, only member associations from the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation were eligible to host [5] FIFA made the decision to host the 2030 World Cup in three continents (Africa, Europe and South America) and the 2026 World Cup was set to be held in North America, which meant that the 2034 World Cup would necessarily have to be held in Asia or Oceania [2]\n\n\nBids\nAfter Saudi Arabia abandoned its 2030 bid alongside Greece and Egypt, they switched their focus to a solo 2034 bid Similar strategies to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was held in November–December as opposed to the usual summer scheduling, may be used to mitigate the country's summer heat, though SAFF insisted on a plan to host in the summer [7] The country's bid was announced on 4 October 2023 [8] On 5 October, AFC President Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa backed Saudi Arabia's bid [9] On the 9th, Saudi Arabia announced that it submitted the official letter of intent and signed the declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, and that over 70 member associations already pledged their support for its bid [10]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nAfter Saudi

declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, and that over 70 member associations already pledged their support for its bid [10]\n\n\nDeclined bids\nThe first bid for the 2034 FIFA World Cup was proposed as a collective bid by the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ten countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) The idea of a combined ASEAN bid was mooted as early as January 2011, when the former Football Association of Singapore President, Zainudin Nordin, said in a statement that the proposal was made at an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting, despite the fact that countries cannot bid (as that's up to national associations) [19] In 2013, Nordin and Special Olympics Malaysia President, Datuk Mohamed Faisol Hassan, recalled the idea for ASEAN to jointly host a World Cup Under FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC) as Asian Football Confederation members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022 [20] [21] Therefore, the earliest bid by an AFC member could be made for 2034 [22] [23]

bid with neighbouring New Zealand, an OFC member with which they co-hosted the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup [31] [32] Australia re-established this intention in August 2021, shortly after Brisbane's success in bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics [33] A joint bid with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries instead of New Zealand was also discussed by Football Australia [34] However, Indonesia remained reluctant to the joint bid with Australia, considering the country was also taking part in the ASEAN bid for the same competition [35] An alternative suggestion was for Australia and New Zealand to partner alongside Malaysia and Singapore, instead of Indonesia even though both countries were also involved in the ASEAN bid as well [13] [14]\n\n\nVenues\nThe official list of stadiums was confirmed on 31 July 2024 by the bid book The tournament will be held in 5 cities; Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha and Neom, with a total of 15 stadiums (11 of which will be new) The King Salman

Clifford Chance did an assessment of human rights in the country, the report was criticised by eleven rights organisations including, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch [40] [41] The nontransparent nature of the bid has also been criticised by Norwegian Football Federation president Lise Klaveness, who stated that despite the reforms after the 2015 FIFA corruption case, little measures were taken to ensure that hosts met risk and human rights assessments Norwegian club Fredrikstad have put pressure on their federation to boycott the tournament [42] [43] On 11 November 2024,

The film is a semi-autobiographical account of Chung's own childhood, exploring the experiences of a Korean-American family in rural Arkansas in the 1980s.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows the Yi family, a Korean immigrant family, as they move from California to a rural area in Arkansas in 1983. The family, consisting of parents Jacob and Monica, and their two young children, David and Anne, are seeking a better life in the countryside. They purchase a small plot of land, where Jacob hopes to grow and sell Korean produce to vendors in Dallas.\n\nOne of Jacob's first decisions is to decline the services of a water diviner, opting instead to dig a well in a spot he chooses himself. He enlists the help of Paul, an eccentric Korean War veteran, to assist with the well-digging process. Meanwhile, Monica is disappointed with the family's new mobile home and the lack of urban amenities, particularly a hospital for their son David, who has a heart condition.\n\nAs the family struggles to adapt to their new life, they work sexing chicks at a nearby hatchery and frequently argue with each other. David and Anne eavesdrop on their parents' conversations, adding to the tension within the family.\n\nThroughout the film, tensions rise as the family faces challenges in their new home. Jacob's determination to succeed in growing Korean produce puts pressure on the family, while Monica's concerns about their health and well-being are constantly at odds with Jacob's ambitions.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Youn Yuh-jung, Will Patton, and Scott Haze.

Filming lasted for 25 days, and editor Harry Yoon worked on the film's editing during production to meet the deadline for the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n# Development\n\nMinari was initially inspired by Lee Isaac Chung's childhood experiences as a Korean-American growing up in rural Arkansas. Chung was inspired to make a film about his childhood after discovering that Willa Cather, the author of My Ántonia, did not want her works adapted into films.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Emile Mosseri, who incorporated traditional Korean instruments and melodies into the music. The film's soundtrack features a range of genres, from traditional Korean folk music to contemporary American folk and rock.\n\n# Release\n\nMinari premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2020, to critical acclaim.
