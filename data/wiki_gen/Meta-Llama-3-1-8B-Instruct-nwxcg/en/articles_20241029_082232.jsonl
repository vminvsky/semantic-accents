Born on April 16, 1974, in California, USA, Sharma has become one of the most celebrated and respected climbers of his generation.\n\n#Early life\nChris Sharma was introduced to climbing at a young age by his parents, who were both enthusiasts of the sport. His father, a lawyer, and his mother, a former gymnast, encouraged his early interest in climbing, which helped shape his physical and mental abilities. Sharma grew up in a family that valued outdoor activities, and he spent much of his childhood exploring the natural world. He developed a strong connection to the environment and a deep respect for the challenges it presented.\n\n#Climbing career\n\n##1996–2002 (to Realization)\nSharma's climbing career took off in the mid-1990s, when he began competing in local and national competitions. He quickly gained recognition for his exceptional technique and innovative climbing style, which focused on fluid movement and precise footwork.

The term \"tartan\" is often used to describe the plaid patterns worn by Scottish Highlanders, but it is also used to refer to the weaves and patterns of other cultures.\n\n**Etymology and terminology**\n\nThe word \"tartan\" comes from the French \"tartane\", which was used to describe the woolen plaids worn by Scottish Highlanders. In Scottish Gaelic, the language spoken in Scotland, the patterns are known as \"plaid\" or \"bdighean\".\n\nIn the 18th century, the term \"tartan\" began to be used in English to describe the specific patterns of plaid worn by Scottish Highlanders. Today, the term is used to describe a wide range of patterns, not just those associated with Scotland.\n\n**Weaving and design**\n\n### Weaving construction\n\nTartan patterns are created using a specific type of weaving called \"twill\". Twill weaving involves alternating warp and weft threads, which creates a diagonal pattern. The pattern is then repeated at regular intervals to create the characteristic stripes of tartan.\n\n### Styles and design principles\n\nThere are several styles of tartan, including:\n\n* **Sett**: A sett is the basic pattern of a tartan, made up of a combination of colors and stripes. Sets are used to create a wide range of tartan patterns.\n* **Break**: A break is a change in the pattern of a tartan, often used to create a new sett.\n* **Drop**: A drop is a change in the pattern of a tartan, often used to create a new sett or to add a new color to the pattern.\n\n### Colour, palettes, and meaning\n\nTartan patterns often feature a range of colors, including:\n\n* **Primary colors**: The primary colors of a tartan are the basic colors used in the pattern, such as red, blue, and green.\n* **Secondary colors**: Secondary colors are created by mixing primary colors together.\n* **Neutral colors**: Neutral colors are used to add depth and contrast to a tartan pattern.\n* **Metallic colors**: Metallic colors are used to add a touch of luxury and sophistication to a tartan pattern.\n\nThe meaning of a tartan pattern can vary depending on the specific pattern and the culture it is associated with. In Scotland, for example, tartans are often associated with specific clans or families.\n\n**Early history**\n\n### Pre-medieval origins\n\nThe origins of tartan are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in the pre-medieval period. The earliest known examples of tartan patterns date back to the Iron Age, over 2,000 years ago.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan patterns were used to create a wide range of clothing and textiles, including kilts, plaids, and cloaks.\n\n### 16th century\n\nIn the 16th century, the use of tartan patterns became more widespread, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders.\n\n### 17th century\n\nDuring the 17th century, the use of tartan patterns became even more widespread, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the use of tartan patterns became even more widespread, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders. The tartan patterns used during this period were often more complex and sophisticated than those used in earlier periods.\n\n### Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n\nIn the late 18th century, the British government outlawed the wearing of tartan patterns as part of the Act of Proscription, which aimed to suppress Scottish culture and identity. This led to a wave of protests and rebellions, including the Jacobite rising of 1745.\n\n### Proscription and its aftermath\n\nThe Act of Proscription was repealed in 1782, and the wearing of tartan patterns was once again permitted. However, the use of tartan patterns continued to be restricted, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders.\n\n**Regimental tartans**\n\nRegimental tartans are specific patterns of tartan worn by military regiments. These patterns are often unique to each regiment and are used to identify the regiment's members.\n\n### Clan tartans\n\nClan tartans are specific patterns of tartan worn by Scottish clans. These patterns are often associated with specific families or individuals.\n\n## Long-running debate\n\nThe debate over clan tartans has been ongoing for centuries, with some arguing that the patterns should be reserved for clan members and others arguing that they should be available to anyone.\n\n## Earliest evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 16th century, with the tartan patterns used during this period often being more complex and sophisticated than those used in earlier periods.\n\n## Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n\nThere is a lack of further evidence of early adoption of clan tartans, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly when and how they became popular.\n\n## 19th century broad adoption\n\nIn the 19th century, clan tartans became more widely adopted, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders.\n\n## 20th century consolidation\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of clan tartans became more consolidated, with many families and individuals claiming specific patterns as their own.\n\n## Recognition by clan chiefs\n\nToday, many clan chiefs recognize specific tartan patterns as belonging to their families, and these patterns are often worn with pride by clan members.\n\n**Modern general use**\n\n### Late Georgian\n\nIn the late Georgian period, tartan patterns became more widely used in civilian clothing, particularly among the Scottish Highlanders.\n\n### The King's jaunt in tartan\n\nIn the late 18th century, King George IV visited Scotland, where he wore a tartan patterned kilt. This helped to popularize the use of tartan patterns in civilian clothing.\n\n### Civilian spread\n\nThe use of tartan patterns in civilian clothing spread throughout the 19th century, with many people wearing tartan patterned clothes as a way to show their Scottish heritage.\n\n**Victorian**\n\n### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nIn the 19th century, a book called Vestiarium Scoticum, written by Scottish Highlanders, helped to popularize the use of tartan patterns in civilian clothing.\n\n### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nThe Queen Victoria's love of Scotland and her adoption of Scottish culture, including the wearing of tartan patterns, helped to popularize the use of tartan patterns in civilian clothing.\n\n### Ripple effects\n\nThe use of tartan patterns in civilian clothing had ripple effects throughout the 19th century, with many people adopting the patterns as a way to show their Scottish heritage.\n\n**20th century to present**\n\n### Diaspora and globalisation\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of tartan patterns became more widespread, particularly among Scottish diaspora communities.\n\n### Industry and politics\n\nThe use of tartan patterns became an important part of Scottish industry and politics, with many companies and politicians adopting the patterns as a way to show their Scottish heritage.\n\n### In popular culture\n\nTartan patterns have been featured in popular culture, including in music, film, and literature.\n\n**Popular designs**\n\nThere are many popular tartan designs, including:\n\n* **Scottish Highlands**: A classic tartan pattern featuring a mix of red, blue, and green stripes.\n* **Black Watch**: A tartan pattern featuring a mix of black, green, and blue stripes.\n* **Gordon**: A tartan pattern featuring a mix of green, blue,

He was a key drafter of the document and is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution.\"\n\nSeveral works by Madison provide valuable insights into the Constitution and its development. One such work is Madison's _Federalist No. 10_ (1788), which discusses the importance of a large republic in preventing the concentration of power.\n\nAnother significant work is Madison's _Federalist No. 51_ (1788), which discusses the importance of checks and balances in the Constitution.\n\n**Journals 4**\n\nSeveral journals published during Madison's lifetime provided important insights into the Constitution. One such journal was the _National Gazette_ (1791-1793), which published numerous articles on the Constitution and its implications for the federal government.\n\nAnother significant journal was the _Federal Gazette_ (1790-1793), which published numerous articles on the Constitution, including its history and interpretation.\n\n**Madison correspondence**\n\nMadison's correspondence provides valuable insights into the Constitution and its development. One such correspondence is Madison's letter to Thomas Jefferson (1787), in which he discusses the importance of a strong central government.\n\nAnother significant correspondence is Madison's letter to George Washington (1787), in which he discusses the importance of a bicameral legislature.\n\n**Slavery and the Constitution**\n\nThe issue of slavery played a significant role in the development of the Constitution. The Founders' compromise on slavery, known as the Three-Fifths Compromise, allowed slave-holding states to count each slave as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes.\n\nSeveral works discuss the impact of slavery on the Constitution. One such work is _Slavery and the Constitution_ (1967), edited by Don E. Fehrenbacher. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the role of slavery in the Constitution and its implications for the federal government.\n\nAnother significant work is _The Slavery Debate in the Constitutional Convention_ (1972), edited by Donald Lutz. This work provides a detailed account of the debates that took place in the Constitutional Convention regarding the issue of slavery.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **United States Constitution**\n* **Federalist Papers**\n* **Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787**\n* **Slavery in the United States**\n* **Three-Fifths Compromise**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This bibliography provides a comprehensive overview of the Constitution and its development.\n* The works listed here are not exhaustive, but rather a selection of some of the most significant publications and analyses of the Constitution.\n* The bibliography includes a range of sources, from primary sources to secondary sources, and from historical works to contemporary analyses.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* This bibliography does not include citations or references, but rather a list of relevant sources.\n* For a more comprehensive list of citations, please see the individual sources listed in the bibliography.\n\n**External links**\n\n* **United States Constitution**\n* **Federalist Papers**\n* **Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787**\n* **Slavery in the United States**\n* **Three-Fifths Compromise**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bibliography_of_the_United_States_Constitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Preliminary notes\n#18th century publications\n#19th century publications\n##Journals 1\n#20th century publications\n##Journals 2\n#21st century publications\n##Journals 3\n#Primary sources\n##Works influential to the Founders\n#James Madison\n##Journals 4\n##Madison correspondence\n#Slavery and the Constitution\n##Journals 5\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, he is one of the most influential and innovative filmmakers of the 20th century. Godard was a key figure in the French New Wave (Nouvelle Vague) movement, which revolutionized the film industry with its emphasis on visual style, location shooting, and non-linear narrative.\n\nGodard's early life was marked by a strong interest in literature and philosophy. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris and developed a passion for literature, which would later influence his filmmaking style. In the early 1950s, Godard began writing film criticism for the left-wing newspaper, Politique Hebdo, where he developed his distinctive voice and style.\n\nEarly Career (1950–1959)\n\n**Film criticism**\n\nGodard's film criticism played a significant role in shaping his approach to filmmaking.

This event captivated the nation's attention, sparking intense public interest and speculation about the possible origin and purpose of these mysterious objects.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe flying disc craze began on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier in Washington state. Arnold's sighting was a significant moment in modern UFO history, as it is often credited with popularizing the term \"flying saucer.\" Over the next few weeks, a wave of similar sightings swept the country, with reports coming in from various parts of the United States, particularly in the West.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n#### Initial Reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc was made by Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947. Arnold was a successful businessman and pilot who was flying his private plane over Mount Rainier when he saw nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation at an altitude of about 9,000 feet. The objects were described as silver, saucer-shaped, and about 30 feet in diameter. Arnold reported that the objects flew in a zig-zag pattern and disappeared into the distance.\n\n#### Additional Reports\n\nIn the days following Arnold's sighting, numerous other reports of flying discs began to surface. On June 25, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a disc-shaped object over the city of Mount Vernon, Washington. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter and was seen flying at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. Similar reports came in from other parts of the country, including California, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\n#### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nThe Pacific Northwest region of the United States was particularly active during the flying disc craze, with numerous reports coming in from Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Many of these reports were met with skepticism, as some attributed the sightings to the recent introduction of jet aircraft into the region. However, the characteristics of the objects described in these reports – such as their disk-shaped appearance and high speeds – did not match those of any known aircraft.\n\n#### Reports throughout the West\n\nReports of flying discs continued to pour in from across the West, including California, Arizona, and Nevada. Many of these reports described objects that were seen flying at high speeds and altitudes, often in a zig-zag or erratic pattern. Some reports also described objects that were seen landing or taking off from the ground, sparking speculation about the possible origin and purpose of these mysterious objects.\n\n#### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the flying disc craze reached its peak, various explanations for the sightings were offered. Some attributed the sightings to the introduction of new aircraft or other technological developments, while others suggested that the objects were of extraterrestrial origin. The government and other authorities were also quick to offer explanations, with some suggesting that the sightings were caused by natural phenomena such as meteors or weather balloons.\n\n#### Increasing prominence\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, the sightings began to gain increasing prominence in the media and public consciousness. On June 30, 1947, the _Los Angeles Times_ ran a front-page story on the sightings, while other newspapers and magazines began to follow suit. The sightings also began to attract the attention of government and military officials, who were eager to investigate the phenomenon.\n\n#### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn July 1, 1947, the Lieutenant Governor of Washington state, Victor A. Meyers, reported seeing a flying disc in the skies above Olympia. Meyers' sighting was significant, as it was one of the most high-profile sightings of the summer. In response to the report, the Washington state government launched an official investigation into the sightings, which was led by the state highway patrol.\n\n#### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nAs the flying disc craze reached its peak, reports of landings and other unusual events began to surface. On July 3, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc land in a field near San Francisco. The object was described as being about 20 feet in diameter and was seen emitting a bright light. Similar reports came in from other parts of the country, including reports of discs landing in fields and forests.\n\n#### July 4 press reports\n\nOn July 4, 1947, the _San Francisco Chronicle_ ran a front-page story on the sightings, which included reports of landings and other unusual events. The story sparked widespread media attention and public interest in the phenomenon.\n\n#### Flight 105\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc over Flight 105, a commercial airliner that was flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The object was described as being about 50 feet in diameter and was seen flying alongside the plane.\n\n#### Group sightings\n\nAs the flying disc craze reached its peak, reports of group sightings began to surface. On July 6, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc in the skies above Seattle. The object was described as being about 30 feet in diameter and was seen flying in a zig-zag pattern.\n\n#### Atomic link claimed\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, some reports began to surface suggesting a link between the sightings and atomic energy. On July 8, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc over the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state. The object was described as being about 20 feet in diameter and was seen emitting a bright light.\n\n#### Reports peak\n\nThe peak of the flying disc craze was reached in mid-July 1947, with reports pouring in from across the country. The sightings were widely reported in the media and sparked intense public interest and speculation about the possible origin and purpose of these mysterious objects.\n\n##Weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes\n\nAs the flying disc craze reached its peak, some reports began to surface suggesting that the sightings were caused by weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes. On July 10, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc over the city of Portland, Oregon. However, an investigation by the local authorities revealed that the object was actually a weather balloon.\n\n#### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a group of investigators reported finding debris from a flying disc in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. The debris was described as being made of metal and was seen emitting a bright light. However, an investigation by the military revealed that the debris was actually from a crashed balloon.\n\n#### Reports diminish\n\nAs the flying disc craze began to subside, reports of sightings began to diminish. However, some reports continued to surface, particularly in the West.\n\n#### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nOn July 15, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc recovered in a field near Hollywood, California. However, an investigation revealed that the object was actually a hoax.\n\n#### Balloons\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, some reports began to surface suggesting that the sightings were caused by balloons. On July 17, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc over the city of Detroit, Michigan. However, an investigation by the local authorities revealed that the object was actually a balloon.\n\n#### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nOn July 18, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc recovered in a field near Twin Falls, Idaho. However, an investigation revealed that the object was actually a hoax.\n\n##Reports subside\n\nAs the flying disc craze began to subside, reports of sightings began to diminish. However, some reports continued to surface, particularly in the West.\n\n##Crash at Kelso\n\nOn July 19, 1947, a group of witnesses reported seeing a flying disc crash in a field near Kelso, Washington. However, an investigation by the local authorities revealed that the object was actually a balloon.\n\n##Public awareness\n\nAs the flying disc craze reached its peak, the public became increasingly aware of the phenomenon. The sightings were widely reported in the media and sparked intense public interest and speculation about the possible origin and purpose of these mysterious objects.\n\n##Maps and table of reports\n\nBelow is a map and table of reports of flying discs during the 1947 flying disc craze:\n\n**Map**\n\n* [Insert map of the United States with reports of flying discs marked]\n\n**Table**\n\n| Date | Location | Description | Source |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| June 24, 1947 | Mount Rainier, Washington | 9 disk-shaped objects seen flying in formation | Kenneth Arnold |\n| June 25, 1947 | Mount Vernon, Washington | 50-foot-diameter disc seen flying at 1,000 feet | Witnesses |\n| June 27, 1947 | San Francisco, California | 30-foot-diameter disc seen flying at 2,000 feet | Witnesses |\n| June 30, 1947 | Seattle, Washington | 50-foot-diameter disc seen flying in a zig-zag pattern | Witnesses |\n| July 1, 1947 | Olympia, Washington | 20-foot-diameter disc seen flying at 1,000 feet | Lt.

While Zionism is often associated with secular nationalism, it has also been influenced by various racial and ethnic conceptions of Jewish identity. This article will explore the history and development of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, from its early days to the present.\n\nLiterature Review\n----------------\n\nThe literature on racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism is diverse and multifaceted. Some scholars have argued that Zionism was inherently racist, perpetuating a \"Jewish superiority complex\" that saw Jews as a distinct and superior racial group. Others have contended that Zionism was a response to anti-Semitism, and that its emphasis on Jewish distinctness was a defensive measure against the threat of assimilation. Still, others have suggested that Zionism was a form of \" ethnic nationalism,\" which emphasized the shared cultural and historical experiences of Jews as a distinct ethnic group.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Background\n\nThe idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine dates back to the late 19th century, when Jewish intellectuals such as Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau began to advocate for a Jewish state. This movement, known as Zionism, was driven by a desire to escape the persecution and anti-Semitism that Jews faced in Europe. However, Zionism was not a monolithic movement, and its early leaders held diverse views on the nature of Jewish identity.\n\n### Early Zionism\n\nIn the early years of Zionism, many leaders saw the movement as a form of \"Jewish nationalism,\" which emphasized the shared cultural and historical experiences of Jews as a distinct national group. This view was reflected in Herzl's book \"The Jewish State,\" which argued that Jews should establish a sovereign state in Palestine as a way to escape anti-Semitism and achieve self-determination. However, some leaders, such as Nordau, also emphasized the racial and ethnic aspects of Jewish identity, seeing Jews as a distinct and superior racial group.\n\n### 1948–1960s\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the development of Zionism. The new state was seen as a fulfillment of the Zionist dream, and many Jews around the world felt a strong sense of national pride and identity. However, the new state also faced significant challenges, including the displacement of Palestinians and the struggle for recognition by the international community. In this period, some Zionist leaders continued to emphasize the racial and ethnic aspects of Jewish identity, seeing Jews as a distinct and superior racial group.\n\n### 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw significant changes in the Israeli education system, with a shift towards a more secular and inclusive definition of Jewish identity. This period also saw the rise of the \"new historiography,\" a school of historians who emphasized the complexities and nuances of Jewish history and identity. However, some Zionist leaders continued to emphasize the racial and ethnic aspects of Jewish identity, seeing Jews as a distinct and superior racial group.\n\n### The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe discovery of the human genome in the early 2000s marked a significant turning point in the study of Jewish identity. Genetic research has shown that Jews are a genetically distinct population, with a unique genetic profile that reflects their shared history and ancestry. However, this research has also raised questions about the nature of Jewish identity and the implications of genetic determinism. Some scholars have argued that Jewish identity is not fixed or essential, but rather a complex and multifaceted concept that can be understood in a variety of ways.\n\n### Race and Non-Jews\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has also been influenced by the idea of \"race\" and the relationship between Jews and non-Jews. Some Zionist leaders have emphasized the idea of \"Jewish superiority,\" seeing Jews as a distinct and superior racial group. However, this view has been criticized by many scholars and intellectuals, who argue that it is based on a flawed and outdated understanding of racial identity. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the complexities and nuances of Jewish identity, and the need to move beyond simplistic and essentialized definitions of Jewishness.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\nThe concept of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism has had significant implications for the Jewish community and the wider world. It has shaped the way that Jews have understood themselves and their place in the world, and has influenced the way that they interact with non-Jews. It has also had significant implications for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the struggle for recognition and self-determination in the Middle East.\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Zionism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Jewish identity\n* Genetic determinism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of the literature on racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism. It draws on a wide range of sources, including academic journals, books, and primary documents. The article aims to provide a balanced and nuanced understanding of this complex and multifaceted topic.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conference led to the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and the establishment of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).\n\n### ##Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has been adopted by corporations and organizations around the world as a marketing opportunity.

It was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involved theological, institutional, and social changes that shaped European society and culture.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" was first used by the Catholic Church to describe the movement, and it was initially seen as a reform within the Church rather than a separation from it. However, over time, the term came to be associated with the emergence of Protestantism and the break with Catholic tradition.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Reformation was a response to various problems and tensions within the Catholic Church in the late Middle Ages. These problems included:\n\n### Calamities\n\nThe 14th-century Black Death, which devastated Europe and led to significant social and economic changes, also had a profound impact on the Church. The Church's inability to provide effective spiritual guidance and support during this time contributed to a loss of faith among the laity.\n\n### Late Medieval Christianity\n\nThe late Middle Ages saw significant changes within the Catholic Church, including:\n\n#### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church had become a vast and complex institution, with a large bureaucracy and a strong emphasis on hierarchy and authority. This led to a sense of distance between the clergy and the laity, as well as a focus on wealth and power rather than spiritual values.\n\n#### Clergy\n\nThe clergy had become increasingly separated from the laity, with many priests and bishops living in luxury and enjoying privileges that set them apart from ordinary people. This led to a decline in the spiritual authority of the clergy and a growing sense of disillusionment among the laity.\n\n#### Papacy\n\nThe papacy had become increasingly powerful and corrupt, with the Pope exercising absolute authority over the Church. This led to a sense of resentment among some clergy and laity, who felt that the papacy was out of touch with the needs and concerns of ordinary people.\n\n#### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nThe Catholic Church had attempted to reform itself in the 14th and 15th centuries, but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Church's emphasis on wealth and power, as well as its corruption and mismanagement, continued to erode its spiritual authority and credibility.\n\n### Humanism and lay religion\n\nThe Renaissance humanism movement, which emerged in the 14th century, emphasized the study of classical texts and the pursuit of individualism and intellectual curiosity. This movement had a significant impact on the development of the Reformation, as it helped to lay the groundwork for a more individualistic and biblically-based approach to faith.\n\n### Dissidents\n\nThere were many dissidents within the Catholic Church who were critical of its corruption and mismanagement. These dissidents included theologians, priests, and laity who were seeking to reform the Church from within.\n\n**Beginnings**\n\nThe Reformation began in Germany in the early 16th century, with the publication of Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses in 1517. Luther's theses challenged the Catholic Church's practice of selling indulgences, which he saw as corrupt and unbiblical.\n\n### Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nLuther's Ninety-five Theses were a call to reform the Church, arguing that the sale of indulgences was a sinful practice that undermined the authority of Scripture. The theses were widely disseminated and sparked a heated debate within the Church.\n\n### New theology\n\nLuther's theology was based on a biblically-based approach to faith, which emphasized individual interpretation and rejection of tradition. This approach was radical for its time and helped to lay the groundwork for the emergence of Protestantism.\n\n### Spread\n\nLuther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and beyond, attracting a large following of dissidents and reformers. The spread of Luther's ideas was facilitated by the emergence of printing technology, which made it possible to disseminate books and pamphlets widely.\n\n### Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the emergence of Luther's ideas with resistance and oppression. Many of Luther's followers were persecuted, and the Church attempted to suppress the spread of his ideas through censorship and violence.\n\n**Alternatives**\n\nAs the Reformation gained momentum, alternative approaches to faith emerged, including:\n\n### Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nSome Saxon radicals and rebellious knights saw the Reformation as an opportunity to challenge the authority of the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire. These groups were often more radical than Luther and his followers, seeking to establish a new order based on biblical principles.\n\n### Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation. Zwingli's theology was more radical than Luther's, emphasizing the importance of individual interpretation and the rejection of tradition.\n\n### Swiss Brethren\n\nThe Swiss Brethren, a group of Anabaptist reformers, emerged in the 1520s. The Swiss Brethren emphasized the importance of adult baptism, community, and pacifism, and saw themselves as a distinct group within the Reformation.\n\n### Peasants' War\n\nThe Peasants' War, a major uprising of peasants and commoners, broke out in Germany in the 1520s. The war was sparked by economic and social grievances, as well as the influence of radical reformers like Thomas Müntzer.\n\n**Consolidation**\n\nAs the Reformation gained momentum, Protestantism began to consolidate, with the emergence of new institutions and confessions:\n\n### Princely Reformation in Germany\n\nThe Princely Reformations in Germany, led by princes and nobles, helped to establish Protestantism as a major force within the Holy Roman Empire. These reforms were often driven by a desire to break with Catholic tradition and establish a new order based on biblical principles.\n\n### Stalemate in Switzerland\n\nThe Reformation in Switzerland was marked by a stalemate between the Protestant and Catholic factions. The Confederation of Switzerland, a loose alliance of cantons, was unable to reach a consensus on the issue of faith, leading to a de facto separation between the two groups.\n\n### Schleitheim Articles\n\nThe Schleitheim Articles, a set of principles drawn up by Swiss Brethren, emphasized the importance of adult baptism, community, and pacifism. These articles helped to establish the Swiss Brethren as a distinct group within the Reformation.\n\n### Confessions\n\nThe Protestant confessions, drawn up by theologians and reformers, helped to establish a common language and set of principles for the emerging Protestant churches. These confessions emphasized the importance of individual interpretation, the authority of Scripture, and the rejection of tradition.\n\n### Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nThe Royal Reformation in Scandinavia, led by Christian monarchs, helped to establish Protestantism as a major force within the region. These reforms were often driven by a desire to break with Catholic tradition and establish a new order based on biblical principles.\n\n**Catholic reform**\n\nAs the Reformation gained momentum, the Catholic Church responded with a series of reforms:\n\n### Beginnings\n\nThe Catholic Church had attempted to reform itself in the 14th and 15th centuries, but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Church's emphasis on wealth and power, as well as its corruption and mismanagement, continued to erode its spiritual authority and credibility.\n\n### New Orders\n\nThe Catholic Church established new orders, such as the Jesuits, to implement its reforms and counter the influence of Protestantism. These orders emphasized the importance of education, missionary work, and spiritual renewal.\n\n### Council of Trent\n\nThe Council of Trent, a major Catholic gathering of bishops and theologians, helped to establish a new approach to faith and reform within the Catholic Church. The Council emphasized the importance of tradition, the authority of the Pope, and the rejection of Protestantism.\n\n**New waves**\n\nAs the Reformation gained momentum, new waves of reform emerged, including:\n\n### English reformation under Henry VIII\n\nThe English Reformation, led by Henry VIII, helped to establish Protestantism as a major force within the region. Henry's desire to break with Catholic tradition and establish a new order based on biblical principles led to the establishment of the Church of England.\n\n### Münster\n\nThe Münster Anabaptists, a radical group of reformers, established a short-lived theocratic state in Münster, Germany. The Münster experiment was marked by violence, fanaticism, and a rejection of the authority of Scripture.\n\n### Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin, a French theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, a comprehensive summary of Protestant theology, helped to establish Calvinism as a major force within the Reformation.\n\n### Reformation in Britain\n\nThe Reformation in Britain, led by Protestant reformers, helped to establish Protestantism as a major force within the region. These reforms were often driven by a desire to break with Catholic tradition and establish a new order based on biblical principles.\n\n### Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n\nMichael Servetus, a Spanish theologian, emerged as a radical reformer who rejected the authority of Scripture and sought to establish a new order based on reason and individual interpretation. Servetus's ideas were influential within the Reformation, but ultimately led to his execution.\n\n**Wars of religion and tolerance**\n\nThe Reformation led to a series of wars and conflicts, including:\n\n### Schmalkaldic Wars\n\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars, a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces, marked a major turning point in the Reformation. The wars were sparked by the failure of the Protestant princes to reach a consensus on the issue of faith.\n\n### French Wars of Religion\n\nThe French Wars of Religion, a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces, marked a major turning point in the Reformation. The wars were sparked by the failure of the French monarchy to establish a clear policy on the issue of faith.\n\n### Revolt in the Netherlands\n\nThe Revolt in the Netherlands, a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces, marked a major turning point in the Reformation. The revolt was sparked by the failure of the Spanish monarchy to establish a clear policy on the issue of faith.\n\n### Edict of Torda\n\nThe Edict of Torda, a major peace treaty between Protestant and Catholic forces, marked a major turning point in the Reformation. The edict established a policy of tolerance and coexistence between the two groups.\n\n### Warsaw Confederation\n\nThe Warsaw Confederation, a major agreement between Protestant and Catholic forces, marked a major turning point in the Reformation. The confederation established a policy of tolerance and coexistence between the two groups.\n\n### Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n\nThe Reformation led to a series of counter-reformation movements and regional conflicts, including:\n\n**Reformation outside Germany**\n\nThe Reformation spread beyond Germany, including:\n\n### Nordic countries\n\nThe Reformation spread to the Nordic countries, including:\n\n#### Iceland\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to Iceland by Protestant reformers, leading to a significant shift in the island's faith and culture.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nThe Reformation spread to Great Britain, including:\n\n#### England\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to England by Protestant reformers, leading to the establishment of the Church of England.\n\n#### English North America\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to English North America by Protestant settlers, leading to the establishment of a distinct Protestant culture.\n\n### Wales\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to Wales by Protestant reformers, leading to a significant shift in the country's faith and culture.\n\n### Scotland\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to Scotland by Protestant reformers, leading to the establishment of the Church of Scotland.\n\n### France\n\nThe Reformation spread to France, but was ultimately unsuccessful in establishing a strong foothold.\n\n### Spain\n\nThe Reformation was largely unsuccessful in Spain, where the Catholic Church maintained a strong hold.\n\n### Italy\n\nThe Reformation was largely unsuccessful in Italy, where the Catholic Church maintained a strong hold.\n\n### Slovenia\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to Slovenia by Protestant reformers, leading to a significant shift in the country's faith and culture.\n\n### Greece\n\nThe Reformation was introduced to Greece by Protestant reformers, but was ultimately unsuccessful in establishing a strong foothold.\n\n**Spread**\n\nThe Reformation spread through various means, including:\n\n### Printing\n\nThe printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg, played a major role in the spread of the Reformation. The press allowed for the mass production of books and pamphlets, making it possible to disseminate ideas and information widely.\n\n### Education\n\nEducation played a major role in the spread of the Reformation, as schools and universities became centers of learning and intellectual inquiry.

Their history spans several centuries, with evidence of Samnite presence dating back to the 6th century BC. The Samnites played a significant role in the development of the Italian peninsula, particularly during the Roman Republic era.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe etymology of the term \"Samnite\" is uncertain, but it is believed to be derived from the Oscan language, spoken by the Samnites. The name \"Samnites\" may be related to the city of Samnium, which was a major Samnite settlement. The Latin name for the Samnites, \"Sammioi,\" was used by the Romans.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they emerged as a distinct ethnic group during the Iron Age. The Samnites were likely influenced by the nearby Etruscan civilization and shared cultural and linguistic ties with other Italic peoples. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Samnites developed a complex society, with a strong emphasis on agriculture, trade, and warfare.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Romans that lasted from 343 to 290 BC. The wars began when the Samnites, who had been expanding their territory, clashed with the Romans, who sought to expand their influence in central Italy. The Samnites, led by their skilled warriors, initially enjoyed significant victories, but the Romans eventually gained the upper hand, thanks to their superior organization and tactics. The wars saw the introduction of the Roman legion, which would become a hallmark of Roman military power.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to play a significant role in Italian politics, often allying themselves with other Italic peoples to counter Roman expansion. However, the Roman conquest of Italy eventually led to the decline of the Samnite civilization, and by the 1st century AD, the Samnites had been largely assimilated into Roman culture.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were primarily an agricultural society, with a strong emphasis on farming, herding, and trade. They cultivated crops such as wheat, barley, and grapes, and raised livestock like cattle, pigs, and sheep. The Samnites also engaged in trade with neighboring cities, exchanging goods such as textiles, metals, and pottery.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnites were governed by a complex system of councils and assemblies. The city-states were typically ruled by a council of elders, while larger cities had a greater degree of autonomy. The Samnites also had a system of sacred kings, who served as spiritual leaders and mediators.\n\n### Military\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnite warriors were renowned for their distinctive armor, which consisted of a bronze cuirass, a helmet with a nasal guard, and greaves on their legs. They also carried a small shield, known as a scutum, made of wood or metal.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were skilled warriors, using a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, and javelins. Their swords were typically made of iron and had a curved blade, which allowed for more efficient cutting and thrusting.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites worshipped a pantheon of gods and goddesses, many of whom were shared with the Romans. Their primary deity was Jupiter, who was revered as the king of the gods. The Samnites also worshipped other gods, such as Mars, Venus, and Diana.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nWomen in Samnite society played a significant role, often inheriting property and participating in trade and commerce. However, they were also subject to certain restrictions, including limited access to education and public life.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were known for their rich artistic traditions, which included sculpture, pottery, and metalwork. Their art often featured mythological and symbolic motifs, reflecting their deep connection to their divine pantheon.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore traditional clothing, often made from natural fibers like wool and linen. Their garments were often decorated with intricate patterns and designs, which reflected their social status and occupation.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites enjoyed a variety of recreational activities, including hunting, fishing, and sports. They also celebrated festivals and rituals, often in honor of their gods and goddesses.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites were skilled engineers, building complex irrigation systems, roads, and bridges. Their cities were often fortified, with walls and defensive structures designed to protect against invaders.\n\n**Notable Samnites**\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\nSome notable leaders of the Samnites include:\n\n* Gisclus, a Samnite general who led the Samnite resistance against the Romans during the Samnite Wars.\n* Caius Pontius, a Samnite leader who played a key role in the Samnite Wars.\n* Caius Papius, a Samnite leader who served as a sacred king and mediator.\n\n### Social War leaders\n\nDuring the Social War, a conflict between the Romans and the Italic peoples, including the Samnites, some notable leaders emerged, including:\n\n* Spartacus, a Thracian gladiator who led a large slave uprising and briefly allied himself with the Samnites.\n* Quintus Pomponius, a Samnite leader who served as a general and politician.\n\n### Romans of Samnite origin\n\nSome notable Romans of Samnite origin include:\n\n* Tibeius, a Roman general who served in the Samnite Wars.\n* Gaius Marius, a Roman general and statesman who claimed Samnite ancestry.\n\n### Catholic Popes\n\nSome Catholic Popes of Samnite origin include:\n\n* Pope Victor I, who was of Samnite descent.\n* Pope Felix II, who was also of Samnite ancestry.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Etruscan civilization\n* Roman Republic\n* Samnite Wars\n* Social War\n* Italic peoples\n\n**References**\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Livy, Ab Urbe Condita\n* Polybius, Histories\n* Plutarch, Lives\n* Cicero, Orationes\n* Silius Italicus, Punica\n* Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities\n* Strabo, Geographica\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Samnites at Livius.org\n* The Samnites at Roman-Forum.org\n* The Samnite Wars at Roman-Forum.org", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Samnites\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#History\n##Origins and early history\n##Samnite Wars\n##Later history\n#Society\n##Economy\n##Government\n##Military\n###Armor\n###Weaponry\n#Culture\n##Religion\n##Gender roles\n##Art\n##Clothing\n##Recreation\n##Cities and engineering\n#Notable Samnites\n##Leaders of the Samnites\n##Social War leaders\n##Romans of Samnite origin\n##Catholic Popes\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The operation was carried out by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and was authorized by a search warrant issued by a federal court.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was a significant event in the context of the handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records, particularly those classified as sensitive or confidential. The incident also raised questions about the role of the presidency in declassifying national security information and the handling of classified material by former government officials.\n\n**Handling, Storage, and Disposition of U.S. Government Records**\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by a complex set of laws and regulations. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for ensuring that federal agencies comply with these laws and regulations.\n\n### Criminal Laws Listed on Search Warrant\n\nThe search warrant issued in this case listed several federal laws that were allegedly violated by Trump or his representatives. These laws include:\n\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(e): Gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 793(f): Failure to report the loss of defense information\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071: Concealment, removal, or mutilation generally\n* 18 U.S.C. § 2071(b): Concealment, removal, or mutilation of official records\n\n### Classified Material and the Presidency\n\nThe handling of classified material is a critical aspect of national security, and the presidency plays a significant role in this process.\n\n#### Declassification, Presidential Powers and Regulations\n\nThe president has the authority to declassify national security information, but this power is not absolute. The president must follow established procedures and guidelines for declassification, and must also consider the potential consequences of declassification on national security.\n\n#### Protocols for Loss or Compromise of Classified Material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, the government has established protocols for responding to the situation. These protocols include immediate notification of affected agencies, containment of the breach, and investigation of the incident.\n\n**Events Leading to the Search**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was the culmination of a series of events and actions taken by NARA and the FBI/DOJ.\n\n## NARA Actions to Retrieve Presidential Records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nNARA had been attempting to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago for several years, but Trump had refused to comply with their requests.\n\n### Partial Return of Records to NARA\n\nIn January 2022, Trump returned a small number of records to NARA, but many more were still missing.\n\n### Trump's Statement Regarding Return of Records\n\nTrump claimed that he had declassified the records and that they were not classified at the time of their removal from the White House.\n\n### NARA Makes Criminal Referral\n\nNARA referred the matter to the FBI/DOJ, which launched a criminal investigation into the handling of classified material.\n\n### Tom Fitton's Advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to return the records to NARA, but Trump refused.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation and Issues Subpoenas\n\nThe FBI/DOJ launched a criminal investigation into the handling of classified material and issued subpoenas to Trump and his representatives.\n\n### May 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump, requiring him to produce documents related to the investigation.\n\n### June 2022 Subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI/DOJ issued a second subpoena to Trump, requiring him to produce additional documents.\n\n## FBI/DOJ Obtains Search Warrant from Federal Court\n\nThe FBI/DOJ obtained a search warrant from a federal court, authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago for classified material.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, and lasted several hours.\n\n## Search of Other Trump Properties\n\nThe search warrant also authorized the search of other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York City.\n\n**Release of Search Warrant, Property Receipt, and Affidavit**\n\nThe search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit were released to the public on August 12, 2022.\n\n## Release of Search Warrant and Property Receipt\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt were released, revealing the details of the search and the items seized.\n\n### Seized Materials\n\nThe seized materials included classified documents, boxes, and other items related to the investigation.\n\n### Missing Materials\n\nThe property receipt revealed that some items were missing, including a set of classified documents.\n\n## Motions to Release Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, which was denied by the court.\n\n## Release of Redacted Search Warrant Affidavit\n\nThe redacted search warrant affidavit was released on August 26, 2022, revealing more details about the investigation.\n\n## Release of Detailed Property List\n\nA detailed property list was released, revealing the items seized during the search.\n\n**Trump v.

The season was played from September 2022 to March 2023.\n\n**Changes from last season**\n\nThe 2022–23 I-League 2nd Division saw several changes from the previous season.

The following are the key aspects of the qualification process:\n\n### Selection criteria\n\nThe selection criteria for the 2022–23 I-League 2nd Division were based on the performance of teams in the previous season.

Other teams that were interested in participating in the league had to go through a qualification tournament.\n\n### Teams selection through state leagues\n\nSome teams were selected through state leagues, which were held across various states in India. These leagues provided an opportunity for teams to showcase their skills and gain promotion to the I-League 2nd Division.\n\n### Reserve teams\n\nSome teams that were part of the qualification process were reserve teams of I-League clubs. These teams were allowed to participate in the qualification tournament, but were not eligible for promotion to the I-League.\n\n### Qualification tournament\n\nThe qualification tournament was a round-robin tournament that was played between teams that were not automatically qualified for the league.

The fort played a significant role in the history of the region, serving as a military outpost, a trading post, and a symbol of Dutch colonial power.\n\nHistory\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nFort Amsterdam was established in 1621 by the Dutch West India Company, a semi-official trading company sponsored by the Dutch government to exploit the economic opportunities of the New World. The fort was built on a hill overlooking the Hudson River, which was an important waterway for trade and navigation. The first commander of the fort was Willem Verhulst, a Dutch naval officer who was tasked with protecting the Dutch trading post in the area and asserting Dutch control over the region.\n\nDuring its early years, Fort Amsterdam was a small, wooden structure with a few buildings and a palisade wall for defense. However, it quickly grew into a larger fortification, with a stone wall, bastions, and a number of buildings, including a church, a hospital, and a number of private homes. The fort was also home to a number of Dutch colonists, who established a small settlement nearby.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Netherland, including Fort Amsterdam, from the Dutch. The English renamed the fort \"New York\" after the Duke of York, who would later become King James II of England. During this period, the fort underwent significant renovations, with the construction of a new stone wall, bastions, and a number of buildings. The English also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council to oversee the administration of the colony.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New Netherland, including Fort Amsterdam, from the English, and it was returned to Dutch control. However, the Dutch period of rule was short-lived, and in 1674, the English regained control of the colony.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nDuring this period, the English continued to develop and expand the fort, with the construction of a new bastion and a number of buildings. The English also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council to oversee the administration of the colony.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, the English government granted a charter to a group of colonists, who established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council. However, this period of colonist rule was short-lived, and in 1691, the English government reasserted its control over the colony.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nDuring this period, the British developed and expanded the fort, with the construction of new buildings and the establishment of a new military garrison. The British also established a new government in the colony, with a governor and a council to oversee the administration of the colony.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the early years of the 18th century, tensions began to rise between the British government and the colonists in New York. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonists, which they saw as an attempt to exert control over their lives and their economy. The colonists, who had grown accustomed to a high degree of autonomy, saw these taxes as an attack on their rights and their way of life.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the colonists in New York, who were now largely opposed to British rule, established a new government, with a committee of safety to oversee the administration of the colony. However, this period of colonist rule was short-lived, and in 1776, the British government reasserted its control over the colony.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nDuring this period, the British continued to develop and expand the fort, with the construction of new buildings and the establishment of a new military garrison. The British also imposed a series of harsh measures on the colonists, including the execution of rebel leaders and the imprisonment of thousands of colonists.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the British government signed the Treaty of Paris, which recognized American independence and ended the war. The Americans took control of Fort Amsterdam, which was renamed \"Fort Washington.\" During this period, the Americans developed and expanded the fort, with the construction of new buildings and the establishment of a new military garrison.\n\nSee also\n\n* New Netherland\n* New York City\n* Hudson River\n* Dutch West India Company\n* British America\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is based on a variety of historical sources, including primary and secondary materials.

The election was held after the dissolution of the 24th Knesset in August 2022, after a series of coalition crises and disagreements between the parties.\n\n# Background\nThe 2022 election was the second in a row to be held before the end of the previous Knesset's term, following the 2021 election, which resulted in a fragile government coalition. The Likud Party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, had been the dominant force in Israeli politics for several years, but faced growing opposition from other parties, particularly the Blue and White Party, led by Benny Gantz.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, several parties announced their decision to run, including the Likud, Blue and White, Labor, Meretz, and the United Arab List. Other parties, such as the Religious Zionist Party and the United Torah Judaism Party, also announced their candidacy. The election was expected to be a closely contested and potentially volatile affair, with several parties vying for power.\n\n# Campaign\nThe campaign for the 2022 election was marked by several key issues, including the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories, the COVID-19 pandemic, and economic issues. The Likud Party campaigned on a platform of stability and security, promising to enforce the law and maintain order in Israel. The Blue and White Party, on the other hand, campaigned on a platform of social justice and equality, promising to address issues such as housing, education, and healthcare.\n\nOther parties, such as Labor and Meretz, campaigned on a platform of social and economic reform, promising to address issues such as poverty, inequality, and the cost of living. The United Arab List campaigned on a platform of Palestinian rights and self-determination, promising to address issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel.\n\nThroughout the campaign, several leaders and candidates from different parties engaged in debates and public forums, discussing key issues and policies. The campaign was also marked by several controversies and scandals, including allegations of corruption and misconduct by several leaders and candidates.\n\n# Timeline\nThe election was held on November 1, 2022, with voting taking place throughout the day. The results were announced in the evening, with the Likud Party emerging as the largest party in the Knesset, followed closely by the Blue and White Party. Other parties, such as Labor, Meretz, and the United Arab List, also won seats in the Knesset.\n\nThe election was followed by a period of coalition negotiations and government formation, with several parties vying for power and influence. After several weeks of negotiations, a new government coalition was formed, led by the Likud Party and including several other parties.\n\n# Electoral system\nThe 2022 election was held under the proportional representation system, in which voters elect representatives to the Knesset based on the number of votes cast for each party. The system is designed to ensure that the number of seats won by each party reflects the number of votes it receives.\n\n## Surplus-vote agreements\nIn the 2022 election, several parties entered into surplus-vote agreements, in which they agreed to transfer their excess votes to other parties in exchange for support in the Knesset. These agreements were seen as a way for smaller parties to increase their influence and representation in the Knesset.\n\n# Political parties\nSeveral parties competed in the 2022 election, including:\n\n## Factions before the election\nBefore the election, several factions emerged within the parties, including:\n\n* The Likud Party: The Likud Party was divided between two main factions, one led by Benjamin Netanyahu and the other by Gideon Saar.\n* The Blue and White Party: The Blue and White Party was divided between two main factions, one led by Benny Gantz and the other by Moshe Yaalon.\n* Labor Party: The Labor Party was divided between two main factions, one led by Merav Michaeli and the other by Itzik Shmuli.\n* Meretz Party: The Meretz Party was divided between two main factions, one led by Zehava Gal-On and the other by Nitzan Horowitz.\n\n## Retiring incumbents\nSeveral incumbent MKs chose not to run in the 2022 election, including:\n\n* Avishai Braverman (Labor Party)\n* Yoel Hasson (Knesset member)\n* Ghaleb Majadele (Labor Party)\n\n## Contesting parties\nSeveral parties competed in the 2022 election, including:\n\n* Likud Party\n* Blue and White Party\n* Labor Party\n* Meretz Party\n* Religious Zionist Party\n* United Torah Judaism Party\n* United Arab List\n* Yesh Atid Party\n* New Hope Party\n\n## Not running\nSeveral parties chose not to run in the 2022 election, including:\n\n* The Joint List\n* The Jewish Home Party\n* The Otzma Yehudit Party\n\n# Leadership elections and primaries\nSeveral parties held leadership elections and primaries in the lead-up to the 2022 election, including:\n\n## Balad\nThe Balad Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Amjad Sabri was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Hadash\nThe Hadash Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Ofer Cassif was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Labor\nThe Labor Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Merav Michaeli was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Likud\nThe Likud Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Benjamin Netanyahu was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Meretz\nThe Meretz Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Nitzan Horowitz was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Religious Zionist\nThe Religious Zionist Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Itamar Ben-Gvir was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Ta'al\nThe Ta'al Party held a leadership election in 2022, in which Ahmad Tibi was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## United Arab List\nThe United Arab List held a leadership election in 2022, in which Mansour Abbas was elected as the party's leader.\n\n# Opinion polls\nSeveral opinion polls were conducted in the lead-up to the 2022 election, including:\n\n* A poll conducted by the Smith Institute in September 2022, which found that the Likud Party was leading with 30 seats, followed by the Blue and White Party with 25 seats.\n* A poll conducted by the Dialog Institute in October 2022, which found that the Likud Party was leading with 31 seats, followed by the Blue and White Party with 24 seats.\n\n# Debates\nSeveral debates were held between leaders and candidates from different parties, including:\n\n* A debate held on October 25, 2022, between Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz on Channel 1.\n* A debate held on October 28, 2022, between Merav Michaeli and Itamar Ben-Gvir on Channel 2.\n\n# Results\nThe results of the 2022 election were announced on November 1, 2022, with the Likud Party emerging as the largest party in the Knesset, followed closely by the Blue and White Party.

The controversy centers on an alleged breach of COVID-19 lockdown rules in Durham, England, in April 2021.\n\n# Durham event\n\nIn April 2021, the UK was still under strict COVID-19 lockdown rules. Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, who were then the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party, were spotted drinking beer and eating a takeaway meal at the headquarters of the Labour Party in Durham on April 30, 2021. This event was first reported by The Mail on Sunday on May 16, 2021.\n\n## Video footage\n\nVideo footage of the event, which was obtained by The Mail on Sunday, showed Starmer and Rayner enjoying a meal and drinks on the grounds of the Labour Party headquarters in Durham. The footage, which was taken at around 8:30 pm, showed the duo eating a meal and drinking beer while allegedly ignoring social distancing rules.\n\nThe video footage was widely shared on social media, sparking outrage and criticism from the public and the media. Many people expressed their disappointment and frustration with the Labour Party's leadership for allegedly flouting lockdown rules.\n\n# Response to Partygate\n\nThe Beergate controversy drew comparisons with the Partygate scandal, which had erupted earlier in 2022 and centered on the British government's handling of COVID-19 lockdown rules. The Conservative Party had faced widespread criticism and calls for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resignation after it was revealed that he and other government officials had attended parties at 10 Downing Street while COVID-19 restrictions were in place.\n\nMany critics pointed out that if Boris Johnson had been caught breaking COVID-19 lockdown rules in the same way as Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, he would have faced severe consequences, including potential prosecution. The Beergate controversy highlighted the perceived double standards and hypocrisy of the Labour Party's leadership.\n\n# Initial police review\n\nThe Labour Party's headquarters in Durham was visited by police on May 23, 2021, following complaints about the alleged breach of COVID-19 lockdown rules. The police review was conducted by Durham Constabulary.\n\nDuring the review, the police questioned Starmer and Rayner about the incident, and they provided statements. The police also reviewed the video footage and other evidence.\n\n## Calls for further investigation\n\nDespite the initial police review, many people called for a further investigation into the Beergate controversy. The Conservative Party and other critics accused the Labour Party's leadership of hypocrisy and demanded that they face the same consequences as Boris Johnson and other government officials who had attended parties at 10 Downing Street.\n\nThe opposition also accused the Labour Party of trying to cover up the incident and avoid accountability. The calls for a further investigation led to increased pressure on the Labour Party's leadership to provide more information and answer questions about the incident.\n\n# Police investigation\n\nOn June 20, 2022, the Labour Party announced that it had received a formal letter from the police stating that they would be conducting a full investigation into the Beergate controversy. The investigation was led by Durham Constabulary.\n\n## Start of investigation\n\nThe police investigation began in July 2022 and involved reviewing evidence, including video footage, witness statements, and other documents. The police also interviewed Starmer, Rayner, and other Labour Party officials.\n\n## New allegations\n\nAs the investigation progressed, new allegations emerged about the Labour Party's handling of COVID-19 lockdown rules. It was reported that the party had held multiple gatherings and events at its headquarters in Durham, despite the strict lockdown rules in place.\n\nThe new allegations sparked further outrage and criticism from the public and the media. Many people expressed their disappointment and frustration with the Labour Party's leadership for allegedly flouting lockdown rules and trying to cover up the incident.\n\n## Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n\nIn response to the growing pressure and criticism, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner made public statements pledging to resign if they were found to have breached COVID-19 lockdown rules. The pledges were seen as an attempt to deflect criticism and avoid accountability.\n\n## Responses to pledges\n\nThe Conservative Party and other critics responded to the pledges by pointing out that they were not enough to address the underlying issues and concerns about the Labour Party's leadership. Many people argued that the pledges were a cynical attempt to avoid consequences and maintain power.\n\n## Police questionnaires\n\nIn August 2022, the police sent questionnaires to Starmer, Rayner, and other Labour Party officials as part of the investigation. The questionnaires asked for further information and clarification about the incident.\n\n## Outcome\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it had concluded its investigation into the Beergate controversy.

It was a significant event that caused widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**#Earthquake**\n\n**##Tectonic setting**\n\nAfghanistan is located in a seismically active region, with the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates intersecting beneath the country. This convergence has led to the formation of the Hindu Kush mountain range, which is still rising by about 1 cm (0.4 in) per year. The region experiences frequent earthquakes, with the majority being shallow and caused by tectonic activity.\n\n**##Characteristics**\n\nThe June 2022 earthquake was a magnitude 5.9 Mw (moment magnitude scale) event, with its epicenter located in the Paktika Province, approximately 150 km (93 mi) southeast of the capital city of Kabul. The earthquake's focal depth was reported to be around 52 km (32 mi). The earthquake's strike-slip mechanism indicates that it was caused by a rupture in the Earth's crust, possibly related to the ongoing tectonic convergence.\n\n**##Intensity**\n\nThe earthquake's intensity was reported as VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI) in some areas. The intensity of the earthquake varied across different regions, with the highest intensity reported in the Paktika and Khost provinces. The earthquake's effects were also felt in neighboring countries, including Pakistan and Tajikistan.\n\n**##Aftershocks**\n\nFollowing the main earthquake, multiple aftershocks were reported in the region. Some of the notable aftershocks included a magnitude 4.5 Mw event that occurred on June 23, 2022, and a magnitude 4.2 Mw event that occurred on June 24, 2022. The aftershocks continued for several days, with some events occurring in the following weeks.\n\n**#Impact**\n\n**##Afghanistan**\n\nThe June 2022 earthquake resulted in significant damage to infrastructure and loss of life in Afghanistan. The earthquake's impact was particularly severe in the Paktika and Khost provinces, where entire villages were destroyed. According to reports, over 1,000 people were killed, and more than 2,000 were injured. The earthquake also displaced thousands of people, with many forced to take shelter in temporary camps.\n\n**##Pakistan**\n\nThe earthquake's impact was also felt in neighboring Pakistan, where damage and loss of life were reported in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The earthquake's effects were particularly severe in the Tirah Valley, where multiple villages were destroyed. According to reports, over 20 people were killed, and more than 50 were injured in Pakistan.\n\n**#Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the June 2022 earthquake was marked by a massive relief effort, with international aid pouring in to support the affected communities. The Afghan government, with the assistance of international organizations, worked to provide emergency assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care.\n\n**#Domestic response**\n\nThe Afghan government responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ashraf Ghani issuing a statement condemning the earthquake and offering condolences to the families of the victims. The government also established an emergency response committee to coordinate relief efforts.\n\n**#International response**\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with multiple countries and organizations offering aid and assistance. The United Nations, the European Union, and the United States were among the first to respond, with the European Union committing €10 million in emergency aid.\n\n**##United States**\n\nThe United States responded quickly to the disaster, with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) providing emergency assistance to the affected communities. The U.S. government also committed $50 million in aid to support the relief efforts.\n\n**##International organizations**\n\nMultiple international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Food Programme (WFP), responded to the disaster, providing emergency assistance and support to the affected communities.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* List of earthquakes in Pakistan\n* List of deadliest earthquakes\n\n**#References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided, as per the requirements)\n\n**#Further reading**\n\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: Death toll rises as rescue efforts continue\" (BBC News)\n* \"Pakistan earthquake: Death toll rises as rescue efforts continue\" (Al Jazeera)\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: UN chief urges calm as death toll rises\" (UN News)\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Afghanistan Earthquake 2022 (USGS)\n* Afghanistan Earthquake 2022 (European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre)\n* Afghanistan Earthquake 2022 (Pakistan Meteorological Department)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"June_2022_Afghanistan_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Tectonic setting\n##Characteristics\n##Intensity\n##Aftershocks\n#Impact\n##Afghanistan\n##Pakistan\n#Aftermath\n#Domestic response\n#International response\n##United States\n##International organizations\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
