The film is the tenth installment in the Saw franchise, and serves as a direct sequel to the events of 2017's Jigsaw.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place immediately after the events of Jigsaw, with the surviving characters from the previous film, including Logan Nelson (Paul Braunstein) and Eleanor Bonneville (Claudia Herlhy), who are trying to come to terms with the events that transpired. Meanwhile, a new character, Detective Chris Sullivan (Max Huang), begins to investigate the gruesome murders that are once again connected to Jigsaw's legacy.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Logan and Eleanor find themselves trapped in a complex game designed by a mysterious figure, who claims to be a protégé of John Kramer. The participants of the game are forced to navigate a series of deadly challenges, each designed to test their moral fiber and push them to their limits.\n\nThroughout the film, the characters are forced to confront their own dark pasts and the true nature of the game they are trapped in. As the body count rises, Detective Sullivan becomes increasingly entangled in the web of deceit, and must navigate the complex world of Jigsaw's games to uncover the truth behind the sinister plot.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tobin Bell as John Kramer / Jigsaw\n* Shawnee Smith as Amanda Young\n* Cary Elwes as Dr. Lawrence Gordon\n* Costas Mandylor as Detective David Tapp\n* Michael Emerson as Dr. Malcolm Crowe\n* Betsy Russell as Jill Tuck\n* Paul Braunstein as Logan Nelson\n* Claudia Herlhy as Eleanor Bonneville\n* Max Huang as Detective Chris Sullivan\n* Chris Britton as Darius\n* Simone Kessell as Detective Kate McCall\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Saw X began in 2020, with Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger being approached to write the script. The film was initially intended to be a direct sequel to Jigsaw, with the surviving characters from the previous film returning to confront the legacy of John Kramer.\n\nHowever, as the script evolved, the filmmakers decided to introduce a new character, Detective Chris Sullivan, who would serve as a conduit for the audience to experience the world of Jigsaw's games. The film's plot was designed to be a self-contained story, while also honoring the themes and tone of the original Saw film.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Saw X was a lengthy one, with the filmmakers holding auditions for several months before finalizing the cast. Tobin Bell, who had played John Kramer in the previous films, was approached to reprise his role, despite his initial reluctance to return to the franchise.\n\nShawnee Smith, who had played Amanda Young in the previous films, was also approached to return, but her character's role in the film was eventually reduced due to script changes.\n\nThe film's cast was finalized in early 2022, with Paul Braunstein and Claudia Herlhy being cast as Logan and Eleanor, respectively. Max Huang was cast as Detective Chris Sullivan, and the film's supporting cast was rounded out by Chris Britton and Simone Kessell.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on Saw X began in March 2022, with the cast and crew working tirelessly to bring the film's complex plot to life. The film's production team was led by director Darren Lynn Bousman, who had previously directed several installments in the Saw franchise.\n\nThe film's budget was reportedly significantly higher than the previous installments in the franchise, with the filmmakers investing heavily in special effects and set design. The film's shooting schedule was also extended to accommodate the complex plot and multiple locations.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on Saw X began in June 2022, with the film's editing team working to assemble the footage into a cohesive narrative. The film's visual effects were handled by a team of experts, who worked to create the film's complex set pieces and gore.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Charlie Clouser, who had previously worked on several installments in the Saw franchise. The score was designed to be a departure from the previous films, with a greater emphasis on orchestral elements and a more atmospheric tone.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Saw X was launched in August 2022, with the film's first trailer debuting online. The trailer was a blood-soaked, atmospheric affair, showcasing the film's complex plot and gruesome set pieces.\n\nThe film's marketing team released several promotional posters and stills, each highlighting the film's cast and plot. The film's social media campaign was also launched, with the franchise's official Twitter account sharing behind-the-scenes content and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n### Theatrical\n\nSaw X was released on October 27, 2023, in a limited theatrical run. The film's opening weekend was marked by a modest box office performance, with the film grossing $2.5 million in its opening weekend.\n\nHowever, the film's performance improved significantly in subsequent weeks, with the film grossing $5.5 million in its second weekend and $8.2 million in its third weekend. The film's strong performance was attributed to its positive word-of-mouth and the loyal fan base of the Saw franchise.\n\n### Home media\n\nSaw X was released on digital platforms on November 17, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on December 12, 2023. The home media release was accompanied by a limited edition Blu-ray set, which included exclusive behind-the-scenes content and a bonus disc featuring the film's deleted scenes.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nSaw X grossed $25.6 million in its domestic box office run, making it the lowest-grossing film in the Saw franchise. However, the film's international box office performance was stronger, with the film grossing $50.2 million in its global box office run.\n\n### Critical response\n\nSaw X received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the film's complex plot and atmospheric tone, while others panned the film's lack of originality and excessive gore.\n\nThe film holds a 38% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with several critics praising the film's visuals and performances. However, many critics felt that the film's plot was convoluted and that the film's use of gore was excessive.\n\nThe film's cast also received mixed reviews, with some praising the performances of Paul Braunstein and Claudia Herlhy, while others felt that the film's supporting cast was underutilized.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nA sequel to Saw X is in development, with Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger set to return as writers. The film is expected to be a direct sequel to Saw X, with the surviving characters from the previous film returning to confront the legacy of John Kramer.\n\nThe film's plot is expected to be a departure from the previous films, with a greater emphasis on character development and a more complex plot. The film's production team is expected to include returning director Darren Lynn Bousman and a new cast of characters.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Saw X is the final film in the Saw franchise, with the film's writers confirming that the series will conclude with the sequel to Saw X.\n* The film's budget was reportedly significantly higher than the previous installments in the franchise, with the filmmakers investing heavily in special effects and set design.\n* The film's cast was finalized in early 2022, with several cast members being approached to return to the franchise.\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* Saw X on IMDb\n* Saw X on Rotten Tomatoes\n* Saw X on Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saw_X\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Sequel\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, the acquisition also raised concerns about the fate of Twitter's moderation policies and the potential for increased censorship.\n\n#Account suspensions\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions began on December 14, when a large number of accounts were suspended for allegedly violating Twitter's rules on \"sensitive media.\" The suspensions affected a wide range of users, including journalists, activists, and ordinary users. Many of the suspended accounts were later reinstated, but not before sparking widespread outrage and criticism.\n\n##Twitter policy changes\n\nIn the days leading up to the suspensions, Twitter had announced a number of changes to its content moderation policies. The updates aimed to clarify the platform's rules on sensitive media, including images and videos that may be disturbing or triggering. However, the changes also sparked concerns that Twitter was over-correcting and imposing overly broad restrictions on user content.\n\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOne of the notable groups affected by the suspensions were flight-tracking enthusiasts, who use Twitter to track the movements of commercial aircraft in real-time. The suspensions were sparked by complaints from governments and airlines about the use of Twitter to track sensitive passenger information. However, many of the suspended accounts were also tracking publicly available flight data, raising questions about the necessity of the suspensions.\n\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nThe suspensions also targeted a number of journalist accounts, including those belonging to prominent media outlets. The suspensions were criticized as an attempt to silence journalists and undermine free speech on the platform. Many of the suspended journalists were later reinstated, but not before sparking widespread criticism and condemnation.\n\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nIn response to the suspensions, Twitter issued a statement explaining that the suspensions were necessary to protect users from \"sensitive media\" and to comply with regulatory requirements. However, the explanation was met with skepticism by many users and critics, who pointed out that the suspensions were overly broad and targeted innocent users.\n\nElon Musk also weighed in on the suspensions, tweeting that the platform was \"trying to do the right thing\" and that the suspensions were necessary to protect users. However, his comments were also criticized as dismissive and tone-deaf, given the widespread outrage and criticism sparked by the suspensions.\n\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n\nIn the days following the suspensions, Twitter reinstated many of the suspended accounts, including those belonging to journalists and flight-tracking enthusiasts. However, the reinstatements were met with skepticism by many users, who pointed out that the suspensions had already caused significant harm and damage to the affected users and their communities.\n\n#Responses\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions sparked a wide range of responses from users and critics. Many of the suspended journalists spoke out against the suspensions, condemning them as an attempt to silence free speech and undermine the media.\n\n##Suspended journalists\n\nMany of the suspended journalists spoke out against the suspensions, condemning them as an attempt to silence free speech and undermine the media. Some of the suspended journalists included:\n\n* Glenn Greenwald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who was suspended for allegedly violating Twitter's rules on \"sensitive media.\"\n* Matt Taibbi, a journalist and author who was suspended for allegedly violating Twitter's rules on \"sensitive media.\"\n* Bari Weiss, a journalist and author who was suspended for allegedly violating Twitter's rules on \"sensitive media.\"\n\n##Other commentators\n\nOther commentators also weighed in on the suspensions, expressing concern about the impact on free speech and the role of social media in modern society. Some of the commentators included:\n\n* Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, who expressed concern about the impact of social media on free speech and democracy.\n* Shoshana Zuboff, a scholar and author who expressed concern about the impact of social media on free speech and the role of technology in modern society.\n\n#See also\n\n* Twitter suspensions\n* Elon Musk\n* Free speech\n* Social media\n* Content moderation\n* Journalism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The concept of integration has evolved over time, with different phases and approaches emerging in response to changing global and regional circumstances.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe idea of European integration has its roots in the aftermath of World War II, when European leaders recognized the need for cooperation to prevent future conflicts and create a more stable and prosperous continent. Over the years, European integration has progressed through several phases, from the initial steps of cooperation and intergovernmental agreements to the establishment of the European Union (EU), a unique political and economic entity with a single market, currency, and governance structure.\n\n**History**\n\n### Proto-integration period\n\nThe proto-integration period spans from the early 20th century to the end of World War II. During this time, European states began to cooperate on specific issues, such as trade, transportation, and cultural exchange.

This phase saw the introduction of key concepts, such as the single market, customs union, and economic integration.\n\n### Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of European integration focused on the development of EU policies and institutions, including the Single European Act (1986) and the Maastricht Treaty (1992). These agreements introduced the concept of governance, including the creation of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Court of Justice.\n\n### Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of European integration saw the transformation of the EEC into the European Union (EU) with the introduction of the Euro currency, the Schengen Area, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions more. In 2017, the Sudanese government merged the Janjaweed militia, a group responsible for many atrocities in Darfur, with the Sudanese Armed Forces to form the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), became a powerful force in the country.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, mass protests across Sudan led to the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled the country for over 30 years. The protests were met with brutal force, but eventually, the military stepped in and took control of the government. A transitional government was established, with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as the head of the Sovereignty Council. However, the transition was marked by power struggles and disagreements between the military and civilian leaders.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, was formed in 2011 as a result of the South Sudanese independence referendum. The group emerged as a key player in the Darfur conflict, fighting against the Sudanese government. The SLM, on the other hand, was formed in 2003 as a response to the Sudanese government's policies in Darfur. The group has been involved in various peace negotiations and agreements but has also been accused of committing atrocities.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the outbreak of the civil war, tensions between the SAF, RSF, and SPLM-N were running high. The RSF had become increasingly powerful, and the SPLM-N was strengthening its position in the Darfur region. The Sudanese government had also been cracking down on opposition groups, leading to widespread arrests and detentions.\n\n**Course of the war**\n\n### April–May 2023\n\nThe conflict began in April 2023, when clashes broke out between the SAF and the RSF in Khartoum. The fighting was intense, and several key locations in the city were seized by the RSF. The conflict quickly spread to other parts of the country, including Darfur, Kordofan, and Gezira.\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe Battle of Khartoum was a key battle in the conflict, fought between the SAF and the RSF in the city of Khartoum. The RSF, led by General Hemedti, made significant gains, capturing several key locations and pushing the SAF back. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nIn May 2023, the Sudanese government and the SPLM-N signed a ceasefire agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The agreement aimed to bring an end to the conflict and establish a peace process. However, the agreement was short-lived, and fighting continued in various parts of the country.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\nFighting continued in Khartoum and other parts of the country, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Diplomatic efforts were made to broker a peace agreement, but progress was slow.\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nThe fighting in Khartoum continued, with the RSF making gains and pushing the SAF back. The city was severely damaged, and many civilians were displaced.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nSeveral international organizations and countries, including the African Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, made efforts to broker a peace agreement. However, the negotiations were slow, and progress was limited.\n\n#### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nThe SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, played a key role in the conflict, fighting against the Sudanese government. The group made significant gains in Darfur, capturing several key locations and pushing the government back.\n\n#### Darfur front\n\nThe Darfur front of the conflict was particularly intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The SLM and the SPLM-N fought against the Sudanese government, making gains and pushing the government back.\n\n### October–December 2023\n\nThe conflict continued to escalate, with the SAF and the RSF suffering heavy casualties. The RSF made significant gains, capturing several key locations and pushing the SAF back.\n\n#### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn November 2023, the SAF collapsed in Darfur, with the SLM and the SPLM-N making significant gains. The government's control in the region was severely weakened.\n\n#### Peace negotiations stall\n\nThe peace negotiations stalled, with both sides refusing to compromise. The conflict continued to escalate, with heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n#### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF crossed the Nile River, capturing several key locations and pushing the SAF back. The move was a major strategic gain for the RSF.\n\n### January–April 2024\n\nFighting continued in various parts of the country, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Diplomatic efforts were made to broker a peace agreement, but progress was slow.\n\n#### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nGeneral Hemedti traveled abroad, meeting with international leaders and diplomats. The RSF leader's trip was seen as a bid to secure international support and recognition.\n\n#### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nFighting continued in Kordofan and Gezira, with the RSF making gains and pushing the SAF back. The conflict resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.\n\n#### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn February 2024, the SAF made significant gains in Omdurman, capturing several key locations and pushing the RSF back. The move was a major strategic gain for the government.\n\n### April 2024–present\n\nFighting continues in various parts of the country, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, but progress is slow.\n\n#### Fighting in Darfur\n\nFighting continues in Darfur, with the SLM and the SPLM-N making gains and pushing the government back.\n\n#### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nFighting continues in Kordofan, with the RSF making gains and pushing the SAF back.\n\n#### Fighting along the Nile\n\nFighting continues along the Nile", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n##Political transition\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n##Prelude\n#Course of the war\n##April–May 2023\n###Battle of Khartoum\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n##June–September 2023\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n###Diplomatic efforts\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n###Darfur front\n##October–December 2023\n###SAF collapse in Darfur\n###Peace negotiations stall\n###RSF Crossing of the Nile\n##January–April 2024\n###Hemedti travels abroad\n###Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n###SAF gains in Omdurman\n##April 2024–present\n###Fighting in Darfur\n###Fighting in Kordofan\n###Fighting along the Nile\n###SAF offensives\n#Casualties\n##Darfur\n##Sexual violence\n##Casualties among humanitarian workers\n##Attacks on journalists\n##Foreign casualties\n##Notable deaths\n#Foreign involvement\n##Egypt\n###Egyptian POWs\n##United Arab Emirates\n##Russia\n###Wagner Group\n##Iran\n##Other foreign actors\n###Chad\n###Kenya\n###Libyan National Army\n###Ukraine\n###United Kingdom\n##Evacuation of foreign nationals\n##Sanctions\n###United States\n###Other countries\n#Humanitarian impact\n##Refugees\n#Economic impact\n#War crimes investigations\n#Disinformation\n##Examples\n##Responses\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chase, a Federalist and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1804 for alleged partisan and biased conduct during his trial of several Democratic-Republican politicians.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe impeachment trial of Samuel Chase was a landmark event in the early history of the United States, testing the Constitution's impeachment clause and the balance of power between the legislative and judicial branches. The trial was a reflection of the intense partisanship and ideological divisions that characterized the early years of the American republic. Chase's impeachment and trial provide a fascinating case study of the complex interplay between politics, law, and the Constitution.\n\n**Background**\n\nSamuel Chase was a Maryland lawyer and politician who had served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and a judge on the U.S. Supreme Court since 1796. He was a strong Federalist and a vocal opponent of Democratic-Republicans, who dominated the Democratic-Republican Party. Chase's reputation for partisan zealotry and biased decision-making had earned him many enemies, particularly among the Democratic-Republicans.\n\n**Impeachment in the House of Representatives**\n\n### **Vote to Launch Impeachment Inquiry**\n\nOn February 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 69-32 to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct as a Supreme Court Justice. The resolution was sponsored by Democratic-Republican Representative Thomas Everett of Massachusetts, who accused Chase of abusing his power and engaging in partisan politics.\n\n### **Early Inquiry Developments**\n\nThe House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Representative Abiel Foster of New Hampshire, conducted the impeachment inquiry. The committee gathered evidence and testimony from various witnesses, including Chase's colleagues and adversaries on the Supreme Court. The investigation focused on allegations of Chase's biased behavior during the trials of several Democratic-Republican politicians, including Haynesbury, who was accused of treason.\n\n### **Adoption of Impeachment Resolution**\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to adopt a resolution impeaching Samuel Chase. The resolution charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged abuse of power and partisan conduct. The resolution specifically cited Chase's behavior during the trials of several Democratic-Republican politicians, including Haynesbury, as evidence of his misconduct.\n\n### **Subsequent Months of Inquiry**\n\nThe impeachment inquiry continued for several months, with the House Committee on the Judiciary gathering more evidence and testimony. The committee heard from several witnesses, including Chase's colleagues and adversaries on the Supreme Court. The investigation focused on the allegations of Chase's biased behavior and abuse of power.\n\n### **Adoption of Articles of Impeachment**\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted 73-32 to adopt seven articles of impeachment against Samuel Chase. The articles charged Chase with various offenses, including:\n\n### **Article I**\n\n* Article I charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged abuse of power and partisan conduct.\n\n### **Article II**\n\n* Article II charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged biased behavior during the trial of Haynesbury.\n\n### **Article III**\n\n* Article III charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged abuse of power and partisan conduct during the trial of West.\n\n### **Article IV**\n\n* Article IV charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged biased behavior during the trial of Burr.\n\n### **Article V**\n\n* Article V charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged abuse of power and partisan conduct during the trial of Haynesbury.\n\n### **Article VI**\n\n* Article VI charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged biased behavior during the trial of Lee.\n\n### **Article VII**\n\n* Article VII charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged abuse of power and partisan conduct during the trial of West.\n\n### **Article VIII**\n\n* Article VIII charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" for his alleged biased behavior during the trial of Burr.\n\n### **Vote Overview**\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 73-32 to adopt the articles of impeachment against Samuel Chase. The impeachment resolution was supported by 73 Democratic-Republicans and opposed by 32 Federalists.\n\n**Appointment of House Managers**\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives appointed five House managers to prosecute the impeachment case against Samuel Chase. The managers were:\n\n1. Representative Thomas Everett of Massachusetts\n2. Representative Abiel Foster of New Hampshire\n3. Representative Thomas Buck of New York\n4. Representative William McCreery of Kentucky\n5. Representative James Stephenson of Virginia\n\n**Senate Trial**\n\n### **Officers of the Trial**\n\nThe Senate appointed several officers to preside over the impeachment trial of Samuel Chase. The officers included:\n\n1. Chief Justice John Marshall, who presided over the trial\n2. Senator John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, who served as the impeachment manager\n3. Senator William Branch Giles of Virginia, who served as the impeachment manager\n4.

The United States came in second with 25 medals, while Germany took the bronze medal with 25 medals as well, but due to having fewer gold medals, the Germans ultimately finished in second place.\n\n| Rank | Nation | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| 1 | Norway | 16 | 8 | 13 | 37 |\n| 2 | United States | 8 | 10 | 7 | 25 |\n| 3 | Germany | 5 | 10 | 10 | 25 |\n| 4 | Canada | 4 | 8 | 6 | 18 |\n| 5 | China | 9 | 4 | 2 | 15 |\n| 6 | Netherlands | 8 | 5 | 5 | 18 |\n| 7 | Great Britain | 1 | 6 | 2 | 9 |\n| 8 | Austria | 7 | 7 | 4 | 18 |\n| 9 | Switzerland | 7 | 2 | 0 | 9 |\n| 10 | France | 5 | 7 | 3 | 15 |\n\n## Changes in medal standings\n\nThe medal standings saw significant changes throughout the competition.

Beyond its historical significance and architectural importance, Mount Rushmore has become a cultural icon, symbolizing American values and ideals. This article explores the various ways in which Mount Rushmore has been represented in popular culture, from literature and film to music and advertising.\n\n**Reasons for Popularity**\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity can be attributed to its unique blend of natural and man-made elements.

The village is situated in the south end of the city, near the Britannia Conservation Area and the Ottawa River. Britannia Village is known for its unique history, diverse architecture, and strong sense of community.\n\n# History\n\n## Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was originally established as a mill town in 1826. The village was founded by the Ottawa Valley Milling Company, which built a gristmill and a sawmill along the banks of the Ottawa River. The mill town was designed to be a self-sufficient community, with workers' homes, shops, and a church built nearby. During this period, the village was a thriving industrial center, with the mills producing flour, lumber, and other goods.\n\n## Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn 1887, the Ottawa Valley Milling Company sold the village to a group of investors who converted it into a summer-cottage resort. The village was marketed as a relaxing destination for wealthy families from Ottawa and other parts of Canada. The resort offered a range of amenities, including a hotel, a golf course, and a variety of recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, and boating. During this period, the village underwent significant changes, including the construction of new homes, hotels, and other buildings.\n\n### Engineering feats\n\nThe construction of the resort required significant engineering feats, including the creation of a artificial beach along the Ottawa River. The beach was built by excavating sand and gravel from the river and creating a man-made shoreline. The beach was a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, and it remains a feature of the village to this day.\n\n### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, the resort was expanded to include an amusement park, which featured a range of rides, games, and attractions. The amusement park was a major draw for tourists and locals, and it remained a popular destination until its closure in the 1960s.\n\n## Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nIn the 1960s, the resort began to decline, and the village was transformed into a rural commuter town. Many of the summer homes were converted into year-round residences, and the village became a popular destination for families and commuters working in Ottawa. During this period, the village underwent significant changes, including the construction of new homes, schools, and community facilities.\n\n## Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts. The village has been the focus of many community-led initiatives, including the creation of new parks, trails, and community facilities. The village has also seen significant investment in flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a new stormwater management system.\n\n### Flood proofing\n\nIn the early 2000s, the village was hit by severe flooding, which damaged many homes and businesses. In response, the city of Ottawa invested in a new stormwater management system, which includes a network of storm sewers, culverts, and other flood-control measures. The system has been designed to reduce the risk of flooding and protect the village from future storms.\n\n### Gentrification\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has experienced gentrification, with an influx of new residents and businesses. Many of the old homes have been renovated and upgraded, and new businesses have opened in the village, including restaurants, cafes, and shops. While some residents have expressed concerns about the impact of gentrification on the village's character, many others see it as a positive development that has brought new energy and investment to the community.\n\n# Heritage buildings and architectural style\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, including homes, churches, and community facilities. The village's architectural style reflects its history as a mill town and summer-cottage resort. Many of the homes feature classic Victorian and Edwardian styles, with details such as bay windows, porches, and decorative trim. The village's churches are also notable for their historic architecture, including the Britannia United Church, which dates back to the late 19th century.\n\n## Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSome of the addresses of buildings with heritage status in Britannia Village include:\n\n* 123 Main Street: Britannia United Church\n* 456 Queen Street: Heritage Home\n* 789 Park Street: Victoria School (now a community center)\n* 901 River Road: Britannia Beach Hotel (now a private residence)\n\n## Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nMany modern residences in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as traditional design elements, decorative trim, and historic details. Some examples of heritage attributes in modern residences include:\n\n* Bay windows and decorative shutters\n* Porches and verandas\n* Decorative trim and molding\n* Historic stained glass windows\n* Classic rooflines and chimneys\n\n# Character\n\nBritannia Village has a unique character that reflects its history and community.

The village is also home to a variety of community facilities, including parks, trails, and community centers.

The Legalist philosophy emphasized the importance of law, strict punishment, and the role of the state in maintaining social order. This school of thought was characterized by its pragmatic approach to governance, its skepticism of traditional morality, and its focus on the implementation of strict laws and regulations to govern human behavior.\n\n**Retrospective Current**\n\nThe development of Legalism was closely tied to the concept of the \"retrospective current,\" which referred to the idea that the past was a source of wisdom and guidance for the present. This concept was central to the Legalist philosophy, as it emphasized the importance of learning from historical examples and precedents in order to inform contemporary governance.\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nOne of the earliest known Legalist texts, the \"Chapter 43 Ding fa\" from the \"Han Feizi,\" provides insight into the development of Legalist thought. This chapter deals with the importance of establishing clear laws and regulations, as well as the role of punishment in maintaining social order. The chapter emphasizes the need for laws to be consistent and predictable, in order to promote stability and security.\n\n### Imperial Confucian Category\n\nThe Legalist school was often categorized as a distinct branch of Confucianism, although this categorization is somewhat misleading. While Legalists did draw on Confucian ideas, they also rejected many of the key tenets of Confucianism, such as the emphasis on morality and personal cultivation. The Legalist school was more focused on the role of the state and the implementation of strict laws and regulations.\n\n**Military Mobilization**\n\nThe Qin dynasty, which emerged in 221 BCE, was heavily influenced by Legalist thought. The Qin state was characterized by its vast military mobilization, which was used to conquer and unify the various warring states of ancient China. The Qin military was organized around a strict hierarchical structure, with clear lines of authority and a focus on discipline and obedience.\n\n**Sima Qian**\n\nSima Qian, a renowned Chinese historian, was a key figure in the development of the Legalist school. His work, \"Records of the Grand Historian,\" provides a comprehensive account of the Qin dynasty and its military conquests. Sima Qian's work was heavily influenced by Legalist thought, and his emphasis on the importance of military mobilization and the role of the state in maintaining social order reflects the key tenets of the Legalist school.\n\n**Huang-Lao and Mawangdui**\n\nThe Huang-Lao school, which emerged during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), was heavily influenced by Legalist thought. The Huang-Lao school emphasized the importance of natural law and the role of the state in maintaining social order. The Mawangdui texts, which date back to the Han dynasty, provide insight into the development of the Huang-Lao school and its relationship to Legalist thought.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao school was closely tied to the teachings of Laozi, the legendary founder of Taoism. While Laozi's teachings emphasized the importance of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature, the Huang-Lao school took a more pragmatic approach, emphasizing the role of the state in maintaining social order. The Huang-Lao school's emphasis on the importance of natural law and the role of the state in maintaining social order reflects the key tenets of the Legalist school.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao, a renowned Chinese philosopher, was a key figure in the development of the Legalist school. His teachings emphasized the importance of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature. Zhuangzi, a prominent Taoist philosopher, was also influenced by Legalist thought, although his emphasis on individualism and the rejection of traditional morality reflects a more critical perspective on the Legalist school.\n\n**Changing with the Times**\n\nThe Legalist school was characterized by its emphasis on adaptation and change. The Legalist philosopher A.C. Graham argued that the Legalist school was closely tied to the concept of \"changing with the times,\" which referred to the need for individuals and states to adapt to changing circumstances in order to survive and thrive. The Legalist school's emphasis on adaptation and change reflects its pragmatic approach to governance and its focus on the implementation of strict laws and regulations to govern human behavior.\n\n**Confucian Influences**\n\nWhile the Legalist school rejected many of the key tenets of Confucianism, it also drew on Confucian ideas in its development. The Legalist philosopher Shen Dao, for example, was heavily influenced by Confucian thought, although his emphasis on natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature reflects a more critical perspective on Confucianism.\n\n### Sheng Ming and Wu Wei\n\nThe Legalist school's emphasis on natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature reflects its focus on the concept of \"Sheng Ming,\" or natural destiny. The concept of Sheng Ming emphasizes the idea that individuals have a natural destiny that is determined by their circumstances and actions. The Legalist school's emphasis on Sheng Ming reflects its pragmatic approach to governance and its focus on the implementation of strict laws and regulations to govern human behavior.\n\nThe Legalist school's emphasis on \"Wu Wei,\" or non-action, also reflects its focus on the concept of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature. Wu Wei emphasizes the idea that individuals should avoid interfering with the natural order of things and instead allow events to unfold naturally. The Legalist school's emphasis on Wu Wei reflects its pragmatic approach to governance and its focus on the implementation of strict laws and regulations to govern human behavior.\n\n**Han Feizi**\n\nHan Feizi, a renowned Legalist philosopher, was heavily influenced by Legalist thought. His teachings emphasized the importance of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature. Han Feizi's emphasis on the importance of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature reflects the key tenets of the Legalist school.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nThe \"Daodejing\" is a foundational text of Taoism, and chapter 17 provides insight into the development of Taoist thought. This chapter deals with the importance of natural law and the need for individuals to cultivate their inner nature. The chapter emphasizes the idea that individuals should avoid interfering with the natural order of things and instead allow events to unfold naturally.\n\n**School of Names**\n\nThe Legalist school was often categorized as a distinct branch of Confucianism, although this categorization is somewhat misleading.

The trophy is named after Andy Herder, a former QMJHL player who was killed in a car accident in 1976.\n\n# History\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was first presented in the 1977-78 season as a way to honor Andy Herder's memory. The trophy is awarded annually to the player who has demonstrated the greatest all-around ability, including outstanding performance on the ice, leadership, and sportsmanship.\n\n# The Herder family\nAndy Herder was born on December 17, 1954, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He began his junior hockey career with the Halifax Colonels in the Maritime Junior Hockey League and later joined the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles in the QMJHL. Herder's playing career was cut short when he was killed in a car accident on February 21, 1976, at the age of 21. He was remembered by his teammates and coaches as a talented player who was loved by everyone in the hockey community.\n\n# The trophy\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver trophy with a cylindrical shape and a flat base. It is adorned with the QMJHL logo and the name of the winner is engraved on a plate at the base of the trophy. The trophy is presented to the winner at the end of the QMJHL playoffs and is considered one of the most prestigious awards in junior hockey.\n\n## Conditions placed by the trophy donor\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was donated by Herder's family, who established a set of conditions that must be met in order for a player to be eligible for the award. The conditions are as follows:\n\n1. The player must have played a minimum of 30 games in the QMJHL.\n2. The player must have been a member of a team that has made the playoffs.\n3. The player must have demonstrated outstanding performance on the ice, including goals, assists, and penalty minutes.\n4. The player must have shown exceptional sportsmanship and leadership on and off the ice.\n5. The player must have been a full-time student and maintained a minimum GPA of 2.0.\n6. The player must have been involved in community service and charitable activities.\n7. The player must have been a positive influence on his teammates and coaches.\n\n### Exceptions to the original conditions\nOver the years, the QMJHL has made exceptions to the original conditions established by the Herder family. Some of these exceptions include:\n\n#### Condition #2\nIn the 1999-2000 season, the QMJHL allowed players who played a minimum of 20 games in the league to be eligible for the award, rather than the original 30 games.\n\n#### Condition #4\nIn the 2010-2011 season, the QMJHL removed the requirement that players must have shown exceptional sportsmanship and leadership on and off the ice. Instead, the league emphasized the importance of character development and community involvement.\n\n#### Condition #7\nIn the 2015-2016 season, the QMJHL removed the requirement that players must have been a positive influence on their teammates and coaches. Instead, the league focused on the player's overall performance and contributions to the team.\n\n# Series format\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is awarded as part of the QMJHL playoffs, which are a best-of-seven series between the top teams in the league. The winner of the Herder Memorial Trophy is determined by a vote of the QMJHL's general managers and coaches.\n\n## Series format history\nThe QMJHL playoffs have undergone several changes over the years, including the introduction of a new series format in the 2010-2011 season. The current format features a round-robin tournament in the first round, followed by a best-of-seven series in the quarterfinals and semifinals, and a best-of-seven series in the finals.\n\n# Herder Champions\nThe following players have won the Herder Memorial Trophy since its inception in 1977:\n\n* 1977-78: Jacques Richard, Cape Breton Screaming Eagles\n* 1978-79: Michel Petit, Quebec Remparts\n* 1979-80: Luc Tardif, Quebec Remparts\n* 1980-81: Benoit Gosselin, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1981-82: Claude Verret, Quebec Remparts\n* 1982-83: Marc Robitaille, Quebec Remparts\n* 1983-84: Eric Perrin, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1984-85: Pierre Turgeon, Quebec Remparts\n* 1985-86: François Gravel, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1986-87: Sylvain Turgeon, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1987-88: Martin Gélinas, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1988-89: Claude Lapointe, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1989-90: Martin Rucinski, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1990-91: Patrick Poulin, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1991-92: Yanic Perrault, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1992-93: Jason Allison, Longueuil Collège Français\n* 1993-94: Jason Allison, Longueuil Collège Français\n* 1994-95: Yanic Perrault, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1995-96: Yanic Perrault, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1996-97: Yanic Perrault, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1997-98: Yanic Perrault, Sherbrooke Castors\n* 1998-99: Chris Stanley, Acadie-Bathurst Titan\n* 1999-2000: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2000-01: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2001-02: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2002-03: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2003-04: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2004-05: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2005-06: Alexandre Picard, Niagara Cutting Edge\n* 2006-07: Chris Stewart, Moncton Wildcats\n* 2007-08: Chris Stewart, Moncton Wildcats\n* 2008-09: Chris Stewart, Moncton Wildcats\n* 2009-10: Chris Stewart, Moncton Wildcats\n* 2010-11: Brandon Gormley, Moncton Wildcats\n* 2011-12: Dougie Hamilton, Niagara IceDogs\n* 2012-13: Dougie Hamilton, Niagara IceDogs\n* 2013-14: Dougie Hamilton, Niagara IceDogs\n* 2014-15: Denis Gauthier, Shawinigan Cataractes\n* 2015-16: Denis Gauthier, Shawinigan Cataractes\n* 2016-17: Charles Hudon, Chicoutimi Saguenéens\n* 2017-18: Charles Hudon, Chicoutimi Saguenéens\n* 2018-19: Mathieu Perreault, Rouyn-Noranda Huskies\n* 2019-20: Mathieu Perreault, Rouyn-Noranda Huskies\n* 2020-21: William Creason, Saint John Sea Dogs\n\n# Presentation ceremony and final game results\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is presented to the winner at the end of the QMJHL playoffs.

She was nominated by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the Senate on April 7, 2022.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nKetanji Onyika Brown was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C. to Ketanji Brown, a school administrator, and Johnny Brown, a judge. She grew up in a middle-class family and was raised in a Christian household. Jackson's parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, who later remarried.\n\nJackson attended the Georgetown Day School, a private co-educational day school in Washington, D.C. She was an active member of the school's debate team and was recognized as one of the top debaters in the nation. After graduating from high school in 1988, Jackson was accepted into Harvard University, where she majored in government and African and African American Studies. She graduated magna cum laude in 1992.\n\nJackson then attended Harvard Law School, where she earned her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1996. During her time at law school, she was an editor of the Harvard Law Review and was a member of the student-run advocacy group, the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review. After graduating from law school, Jackson clerked for Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and then for Judge Stephen F. Williams of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n#Early career\n\nAfter completing her clerkship, Jackson worked as an associate at the law firm Goodwin Procter in Washington, D.C. from 1999 to 2005. She then joined the U.S. Department of Justice, where she worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Public Integrity Section from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, Jackson joined the private law firm Morrison & Foerster, where she worked as a litigation associate until 2010.\n\n#U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)\n\nIn 2010, Jackson was appointed to the U.S. Sentencing Commission by President Barack Obama. She served on the commission from 2010 to 2014, during which time she played a key role in reforming the federal sentencing guidelines. Jackson was a strong advocate for reducing the disparities in sentencing between different districts and for increasing the use of alternative sentencing options, such as community service and probation.\n\n#District Court (2013–2021)\n\nIn 2013, Jackson was nominated by President Obama to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed by the Senate on October 29, 2013, and took the oath of office on November 12, 2013. During her time on the district court, Jackson presided over a number of high-profile cases, including a civil rights lawsuit against the District of Columbia and a dispute over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n##Selected rulings\n\nOne of Jackson's notable rulings as a district court judge was in the case of _United States v. Concepcion_. In this case, Jackson held that the government's use of a mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional because it did not provide sufficient guidance to the sentencing court. This ruling was seen as a significant victory for defendants' rights and highlighted Jackson's commitment to upholding the Constitution.\n\nAnother notable ruling was in the case of _Johnson v. District of Columbia_. In this case, Jackson held that the District of Columbia's use of a \"stop-and-frisk\" policy was unconstitutional because it did not provide sufficient justification for the stops. This ruling was seen as a significant victory for civil rights and highlighted Jackson's commitment to upholding the Fourth Amendment.\n\n#U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, Jackson was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She was confirmed by the Senate on June 29, 2021, and took the oath of office on July 9, 2021. During her time on the court of appeals, Jackson presided over a number of high-profile cases, including a dispute over the constitutionality of a district court's decision to block a Trump administration policy.\n\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 25, 2022, President Biden nominated Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The nomination was widely seen as a historic moment, as Jackson would be the first African American woman to serve on the Court. Jackson's nomination was praised by many, including civil rights leaders and liberal politicians, who saw her as a strong advocate for justice and equality.\n\n#U.S. Supreme Court (2022–present)\n\nOn April 7, 2022, the Senate confirmed Jackson's nomination, and she took the oath of office as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Jackson is the first African American woman to serve on the Court and is widely seen as a trailblazer for future generations of lawyers and judges.\n\n##Labor disputes\n\nOne of Jackson's first significant opinions as a Supreme Court Justice was in the case of _National Labor Relations Board v. Columbia University_. In this case, Jackson held that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had the authority to require a university to recognize a union as the representative of its graduate student employees. This ruling was seen as a significant victory for labor rights and highlighted Jackson's commitment to upholding the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n##Affirmative action\n\nIn the case of _Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University_, Jackson authored a concurring opinion that argued that the use of affirmative action policies by Harvard University was constitutional. This opinion was seen as a significant victory for advocates of affirmative action and highlighted Jackson's commitment to upholding the principles of diversity and inclusion.\n\n##Judicial philosophy\n\nJackson's judicial philosophy has been described as liberal and progressive. She has been a strong advocate for justice and equality, and has been critical of policies and practices that she believes are unfair or discriminatory. Jackson has also been a strong advocate for the rights of women and minorities, and has been praised for her commitment to upholding the Constitution.\n\n#Personal life\n\nJackson is married to Patrick G. Jackson, a lawyer who works as a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. The couple has two children together. Jackson is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and has been recognized for her community service and philanthropic work.\n\n##Affiliations\n\nJackson is a member of the American Bar Association, the National Bar Association, and the District of Columbia Bar Association. She has also been a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).\n\n#Selected works\n\nJackson has written a number of articles and essays on topics related to law and justice. Some of her selected works include:\n\n* \"The Need for Reform in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\" (2010)\n* \"The Role of the Judiciary in Promoting Justice and Equality\" (2015)\n* \"The Importance of Affirmative Action in Promoting Diversity and Inclusion\" (2019)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of African American Supreme Court justices\n* List of female justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the life and career of Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The island nation is home to a population of around 178,000 people. Saint Lucia is known for its lush tropical rainforests, rugged volcanic peaks, and pristine beaches. The island has a rich history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the pre-colonial era.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the Latin name of the island, \"Santa Lucia,\" which was given by Christopher Columbus in 1502. The island was named after Saint Lucy, a 4th-century martyr who is revered in many Catholic countries. Over time, the name was adapted to \"Saint Lucia\" to reflect the island's cultural and linguistic heritage.\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak people, who migrated to the island from the mainland in the 1st millennium AD. The Arawaks established a thriving society on the island, with a complex system of government and a strong spiritual tradition. They were skilled farmers, fishermen, and craftsmen, and their culture had a lasting impact on the island's history.\n\n## Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus arrived on the island, and it was subsequently claimed by Spain. However, the Spanish failed to establish a permanent settlement on the island, and it was later ceded to France in 1660. The French established a series of fortifications and plantations on the island, and they introduced enslaved Africans to work on the plantations.\n\n## 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia became a major producer of sugar, coffee, and indigo. The island's economy was heavily dependent on the transatlantic slave trade, and many enslaved Africans were brought to the island to work on the plantations. The island was also the site of several battles between the French and the British, who eventually gained control of the island in 1814.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the early 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence. The island gained internal self-government in 1967, and it became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967. In 1979, Saint Lucia gained full independence from the UK, with Sir John Compton as its first prime minister.\n\n## Post-independence era\n\nSince independence, Saint Lucia has maintained a stable democracy and a market-based economy. The island has also made significant progress in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. In 2011, the island's Prime Minister, Stephenson King, launched a new national development plan, which aims to promote economic growth and social development.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with average temperatures ranging from 23°C to 28°C throughout the year. The island is susceptible to hurricanes, which can bring strong winds and heavy rainfall. The dry season runs from December to May, while the wet season runs from June to November.\n\n## Geology\n\nSaint Lucia is a volcanic island, with a rugged terrain and numerous peaks. The island's highest peak, Gros Piton, rises to 950 meters above sea level. The island is also home to several hot springs and geysers, which are a result of the volcanic activity.\n\n# Government\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own local government. The districts are: Anse-la-Raye, Castries, Choiseul, Dauphin, Dennery, Gros-Islet, Laborie, Micoud, Praslin, Soufrière, and Vieux-Fort.\n\n## Law and crime\n\nSaint Lucia has a relatively low crime rate compared to other countries in the region. However, the island has experienced a rise in violent crime in recent years, including armed robberies and homicides. The island's police force is responsible for maintaining law and order, and they work closely with other regional and international agencies to combat crime.\n\n## Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of several regional and international organizations, including the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, and the Caribbean Community. The island has also established diplomatic relations with several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.\n\n# Economy\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism is a major contributor to Saint Lucia's economy, with millions of visitors arriving on the island each year. The island's pristine beaches, lush rainforests, and vibrant culture make it a popular destination for tourists. The island's tourism industry is also supported by a range of infrastructure, including hotels, resorts, and attractions.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is another significant sector of the island's economy, with crops such as bananas, mangoes, and avocados being major exports. The island's fertile soil and favorable climate make it an ideal location for agriculture, and the sector is supported by a range of infrastructure, including irrigation systems and storage facilities.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSaint Lucia has invested heavily in its infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and ports. The island's Hewanorra International Airport is a major hub for the region, and it offers flights to several destinations in the Caribbean and beyond. The island's ports are also an important hub for trade and commerce, with cargo ships arriving from around the world.\n\n# Demographics\n\n## Ethnic groups\n\nSaint Lucia has a diverse population, with several ethnic groups represented. The island's population is predominantly of African descent, with a smaller proportion of European, Asian, and indigenous American ancestry. The island's population is also divided into several distinct ethnic groups, including the Saint Lucian Creole, the French, and the British.\n\n## Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, but the island's population also speaks a range of creole languages, including Saint Lucian Creole and French-based creoles. Many islanders also speak French and other languages, reflecting the island's colonial history.\n\n## Religion\n\nThe majority of Saint Lucians are Christian, with a significant proportion of the population identifying as Roman Catholic. Other Christian denominations, including Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist, are also represented on the island. The island's population is also home to a small but significant Muslim community.\n\n## Education\n\nEducation is highly valued in Saint Lucia, and the island has a well-developed education system. The island's education system is based on the British model, and it offers a range of qualifications, including the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) and the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE). The island's education system is supported by a range of infrastructure, including schools, libraries, and educational resources.\n\n## Healthcare\n\nThe island's healthcare system is well-developed, with a range of medical facilities and services available. The island's healthcare system is based on the British model, and it offers a range of medical services, including primary care, specialist care, and emergency services. The island's healthcare system is supported by a range of infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and medical equipment.\n\n# Culture\n\n## Media\n\nThe island's media landscape is diverse, with several newspapers, radio stations, and television stations available. The island's media is largely independent, and it plays an important role in shaping public opinion and promoting the island's culture.\n\n## Music\n\nMusic is an important part of Saint Lucian culture, with a range of traditional and modern styles represented.

The island's music is also characterized by its use of calypso and soca rhythms, which are an important part of the island's cultural heritage.\n\n## Food\n\nThe island's cuisine is a fusion of African, European, and indigenous American influences, and it features a range of traditional dishes, including jerk chicken, fried fish, and pepper pot soup. The island's cuisine is also characterized by its use of fresh seafood, including lobster, crab, and shrimp.\n\n## Sports\n\nSports are an important part of Saint Lucian culture, with a range of traditional and modern sports represented.

The subsequent state funeral and national mourning period were unprecedented in scale and scope, reflecting the monarch's extraordinary life, reign, and impact on the Commonwealth.\n\n**Background**\n\nElizabeth II was born on 21 April 1926 to Prince Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York. She ascended to the throne on 6 February 1952 following the death of her father, King George VI.

It is a type of drone used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 is one of the many drones developed by Iran in recent years, as part of the country's efforts to strengthen its military capabilities. The drone has been involved in several conflicts and has been used by various countries, including Iran, Russia, and Syria. The Shahed 136 has also been the subject of controversy, with some countries questioning its classification as a military drone.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 is a small, single-engine drone with a wingspan of approximately 4 meters (13 feet) and a length of around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). It has a payload capacity of around 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and can reach speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour). The drone is powered by a diesel engine and has a range of around 1,000 kilometers (620 miles).\n\n**Deployment**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 has been used in several conflicts, including the Yemeni Civil War and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The drone has been employed by various countries, including Iran, Russia, and Syria, for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat.\n\n**Comms and guidance system**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 is equipped with a communication system that allows it to receive commands and transmit data in real-time. The drone uses a satellite link to communicate with its operators, allowing it to receive instructions and send back information on its mission status.\n\n**Electronics**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 is equipped with advanced electronics, including a navigation system, a communication system, and a payload management system. The drone's electronics allow it to operate autonomously, using pre-programmed instructions to complete its missions.\n\n**Geran-2**\n\nThe Geran-2 is a variant of the HESA Shahed 136 that features improved performance and capabilities. The Geran-2 has a longer range and can carry a heavier payload than the original Shahed 136. It is also equipped with advanced sensors and a more sophisticated navigation system.\n\n**Combat history**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 has been involved in several conflicts, including the Yemeni Civil War and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n### Yemeni Civil War\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 was first used in the Yemeni Civil War in 2015, where it was employed by the Houthi rebels against the Yemeni government. The drone was used for surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as for combat missions against government forces.\n\n### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 was used by Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, where it was employed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The drone was also used for combat missions against Ukrainian forces.\n\n#### First appearances\n\nThe first appearance of the Shahed 136 in Ukraine was in February 2022, when Russian forces were spotted using the drone for reconnaissance missions.\n\n#### October waves\n\nIn October 2022, Russia launched a wave of attacks on Ukraine using Shahed 136 drones. The drones were used to target Ukrainian military installations and infrastructure.\n\n#### Ukrainian defense\n\nUkraine responded to the Russian attacks by developing its own defense systems, including anti-drone systems and air defense systems.\n\n#### Production in Russia\n\nIt was reported that Russia had begun producing the Shahed 136 drone locally, allowing it to increase its production capacity and reduce its reliance on imported drones.\n\n#### Reactions\n\nThe use of the Shahed 136 drone by Russia in Ukraine was met with criticism from the international community, with many countries condemning the use of drones in conflict.\n\n### 2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 was also used in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan in 2022, where it was employed by the Syrian government against rebel forces.\n\n### 2023 Indian Ocean\n\nIn 2023, it was reported that the HESA Shahed 136 had been used by Iran in the Indian Ocean, where it was employed for surveillance and reconnaissance missions.\n\n### 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n\nIn 2024, Iran launched a series of strikes on Israel using the HESA Shahed 136 drone, which was used to attack Israeli military installations and infrastructure.\n\n**Classification controversy**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 has been the subject of controversy, with some countries questioning its classification as a military drone. Iran has claimed that the Shahed 136 is a civilian drone, used for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. However, its use in combat missions and its design and capabilities have led some countries to question its civilian status.\n\n**Relations with other Shahed drones**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 has several variants, including the Shahed 131 and the Shahed 238. The Shahed 131 is a smaller and more basic variant of the Shahed 136, while the Shahed 238 is a more advanced variant with improved capabilities.\n\n### Shahed 131\n\nThe Shahed 131 is a smaller and more basic variant of the Shahed 136, with a shorter range and a lighter payload capacity.\n\n### Shahed 238\n\nThe Shahed 238 is a more advanced variant of the Shahed 136, with improved capabilities and a longer range.\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe HESA Shahed 136 has been used by several countries, including Iran, Russia, and Syria. It has also been used by other countries, including Iraq and Yemen.\n\n**See also**\n\n* HESA Shahed 131\n* HESA Shahed 238\n* Iranian drone program\n* Russian drone program\n* Syrian drone program\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HESA_Shahed_136\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n##Description\n##Deployment\n##Comms and guidance system\n##Electronics\n#Geran-2\n#Combat history\n##Yemeni Civil War\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###First appearances\n###October waves\n###Ukrainian defense\n###Production in Russia\n###Reactions\n##2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n##2023 Indian Ocean\n##2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n#Classification controversy\n#Relations with other Shahed drones\n##Shahed 131\n##Shahed 238\n#Operators\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in the Italian Communist Party and later became a leading member of the Democratic Party.\n\nEarly Life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy, to a family of Italian lawyers and politicians. His father, Giovanni Napolitano, was a lawyer and a member of the Italian Socialist Party. Napolitano's early life was marked by a strong sense of social and political awareness, which was influenced by his family's progressive values.\n\nEarly Political Career\n\nWorld War II and Anti-Fascist Resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano joined the anti-fascist resistance movement, fighting against the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. He became a member of the Italian Partisans, a group of anti-fascist fighters who were determined to overthrow the regime. Napolitano's involvement in the resistance movement had a profound impact on his political views, shaping his commitment to democratic values and his opposition to authoritarianism.\n\nFrom Post-War Years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nAfter the war, Napolitano became involved in the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which was a major force in Italian politics at the time. He quickly rose through the party ranks, becoming a prominent figure in the PCI's youth organization. In the 1950s, Napolitano was involved in the PCI's efforts to support the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which was a popular uprising against the Soviet-backed government in Hungary. Napolitano's involvement in the Hungarian Revolution marked a significant turning point in his political career, as he became increasingly committed to the principles of democracy and human rights.\n\nLeading Member of the Italian Communist Party\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s\n\nNapolitano's involvement in the PCI continued to grow, and he became a leading figure in the party's leadership. He played a key role in the PCI's efforts to modernize and reform the party, introducing new policies and practices that aimed to make the PCI more democratic and inclusive. Napolitano's leadership style was characterized by his emphasis on consensus-building and his commitment to finding common ground with other parties and groups. He played a key role in shaping the PCI's policy agenda, which focused on issues such as social justice, economic development, and human rights.\n\nAfter the Italian Communist Party\n\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected as the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Italian parliament. He served in this role until 1994, when he was appointed as the Minister of the Interior in the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. As President of the Chamber of Deputies, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the country's legislative agenda, working to promote social and economic reform.\n\nLate 1990s and Early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano continued to play a prominent role in Italian politics. He served as the Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1999, overseeing a range of key policy areas, including public security, immigration, and law and order. He also played a key role in the development of the country's anti-terrorism laws, working to strengthen the country's defenses against terrorist threats.\n\nPresident of Italy\n\nFirst Term (2006–2013)\n\nElection\n\nNapolitano was elected as the President of Italy in 2006, winning the election in the first round of voting. He was the first Italian politician to be elected to the presidency without the support of the majority party in the legislature. His election marked a significant turning point in Italian politics, as he became the first President of Italy to be elected from outside the traditional party system.\n\nProdi Cabinet\n\nAs President, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the country's policy agenda, working closely with the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. The Prodi government was formed in 2006 and was characterized by its commitment to social justice, economic development, and human rights. Napolitano worked closely with Prodi to promote key policy initiatives, including the development of a new civil service system and the introduction of a range of social and economic reforms.\n\n2008 Political Crisis\n\nIn 2008, Italy was hit by a major political crisis, as the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi faced a series of challenges and controversies. Napolitano played a key role in resolving the crisis, working closely with the government and the opposition to find a solution. His leadership helped to stabilize the country and prevent a major crisis.\n\nEluana Englaro Incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano became embroiled in a major controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who was suffering from a severe form of paralysis. Englaro's family had requested that she be allowed to die, but the Italian government had intervened to prevent this from happening. Napolitano played a key role in resolving the crisis, working closely with the government and the opposition to find a solution.\n\n2011 Political Crisis\n\nIn 2011, Italy was hit by another major political crisis, as the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi faced a series of challenges and controversies. Napolitano played a key role in resolving the crisis, working closely with the government and the opposition to find a solution. His leadership helped to stabilize the country and prevent a major crisis.\n\nSecond Term (2013–2015)\n\nRe-election\n\nNapolitano was re-elected as the President of Italy in 2013, winning the election in the first round of voting. His re-election marked a significant turning point in Italian politics, as he became the first President of Italy to be re-elected to a second term.\n\nLetta Cabinet\n\nAs President, Napolitano played a key role in shaping the country's policy agenda, working closely with the government of Prime Minister Enrico Letta. The Letta government was formed in 2013 and was characterized by its commitment to social justice, economic development, and human rights. Napolitano worked closely with Letta to promote key policy initiatives, including the development of a new economic growth strategy and the introduction of a range of social and economic reforms.\n\nRenzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Napolitano's successor as President of Italy was elected, and he stepped down from the office. However, he remained a prominent figure in Italian politics, working closely with the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
