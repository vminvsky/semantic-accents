James Sr., who worked as a swimming pool manager, welder, and shopkeeper [12] He has an older sister, a younger brother, [14] and a younger sister When he was nine years old, he moved with his family to England and grew up in the Bishopton area of Stratford-upon-Avon [11] He has described his early life as \"hopelessly itinerant\" and said his family moved constantly owing to the aspirations and failures of his father, who was an occasionally violent alcoholic; Ramsay described him as a \"hard-drinking womaniser\" [12] In his autobiography, he revealed that his father abused and neglected the children and his mother [13] [15] He worked as a pot washer in a local Indian restaurant where his sister was a waitress [16] He had hoped to become a footballer and was first chosen to play under-14 football at the age of 12, but his early footballing career was marked by injuries; after a serious knee injury, he was forced to give it up [13] At the age of 16, he moved out of the family home and into an apartment in Banbury [17]\n\n\nEarly cooking career\nRamsay's interest in cooking began in his teenage years; rather than be known as \"the football player with the gammy knee\", [13] he decided to pay more serious attention to his culinary education at age 19 Ramsay enrolled at North Oxfordshire Technical College, sponsored by the Rotarians, to study hotel management He described his decision to enter catering college as \"a complete accident\" [18]\n\n\nHead chef\nUpon his return to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the position of head chef, under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann, at the three-Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in Chelsea Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners The restaurant was renamed Aubergine and won its first Michelin star 14 months later In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star A dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998 [21] [22] He has described the decision to set out on his own as \"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life\" [23]\n\n\nAwards\nRestaurant Gordon Ramsay, located at Royal Hospital Road, London, was

stock.\" [141] [142] In a 2007 interview, he joked: \"My biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said 'Dad, I'm a vegetarian.' Then I would sit them on the fence and electrocute them.\" [143] In 2016, when asked on Twitter whether he was allergic to anything, he wrote \"Vegans\" and followed up with: \"It's a joke jack it's not vegans!

reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds He later recalled, \"I thought I was a goner I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water When I got to the top after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive.\" [170]\n\n\nPre-prepared meal controversy\nOn 17 April 2009, it was revealed that one of Ramsay's restaurants, Foxtrot Oscar in London's Chelsea area, used pre-prepared food that was heated up and sold with mark-ups of up to 586% It was also revealed that three of his gastropubs in London did the same thing A spokeswoman for Ramsay said, \"Gordon Ramsay chefs prepare components of dishes devised and produced to the highest Gordon Ramsay standards These are supplied to those kitchens with limited cooking space such as Foxtrot Oscar and Gordon Ramsay's highly acclaimed pubs, including the Narrow These are sealed and transported daily in refrigerated vans and all menu dishes are then cooked in the individual kitchens This is only for the supply of Foxtrot Oscar and the three pubs and allows each establishment to control the consistency and the quality of the food served.\" [172] [173] Reflecting on the controversy in 2010, Ramsay was unapologetic: \"When I was working at the Gavroche all those years ago, the duck terrine wasn't made there It was made outside, then brought to the restaurant wrapped in plastic This is standard practice What on earth was the fuss about?\" [174]\n\n\nControversy over Cornwall\nOn 23 March 2022 in an interview for BBC Radio 2, Ramsay remarked, \"...Trust me I absolutely love Cornwall, it's just the Cornish I can't stand.\" This received a response from the leader of the political party Mebyon Kernow, Clir D Cole saying;\n\n\nFootball\nRamsay played football and was first chosen to play under-14 football at age 12 He was chosen to play for Warwickshire His footballing career was marked by injuries, causing him to remark later in life, \"Perhaps I was doomed when it came to football.\" [13] In mid-1984, Ramsay had a trial with Rangers, the club he supported as a boy He seriously injured his knee, smashing the cartilage during training [177] Ramsay has claimed to have

15 [180] Allan Cairns, a photographer who took a picture of Ramsay playing for Rangers in September 1985, said the photo was not one of the Rangers first team but a side picked to play a testimonial match A Rangers spokesman said: \"Ramsay was a trialist in that testimonial game He trained with us for a few months after that but then got injured.\" [181]\n\n\nRangers revisited\nIn series 4, episode 12, of The F Word (originally aired on 29 July 2008), Ramsay visited Ibrox, the home ground of his favourite childhood team, Rangers, and exclaimed, \"Home sweet home!\" He explained, \"My dream came true when I was spotted in the mid- [19]80s and I joined the youth team here in Ibrox.\" He related that one of his fondest memories is playing alongside former Rangers and Scotland striker Ally McCoist, who said about Ramsay: \"I remember him well and the one thing that never ever will change is that he's a competitive so-and-so and wants to do and be the best that he can.\" Ramsay recalled that \"the pain of being released on the back of an injury\" was only assuaged many years later \"after receiving  [his] third Michelin Star\", and concluded, \"Without the upset at Ibrox, I would not be the chef I am today.\" [182]\n\n\nOther interests\nRamsay is a football fan and supports Rangers [183] and Chelsea [184] As a baseball fan, he follows the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Angels However, he feels that the game of baseball is often too long, joking that this leads to fans spending most of the time eating or sleeping which could lead to them being unhealthy [185]

This festival is of great importance in Hinduism, and its celebration varies across different regions and cultures.\n\n**Description**\n----------------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is a festival of contemplation, characterized by spiritual practices, devotion, and self-reflection. It is a night of intense spiritual seeking, where devotees seek to connect with the divine and attain spiritual enlightenment. The festival is celebrated with great fervor and devotion, with people from all over the world participating in the festivities.\n\n**Legend and Significance**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Maha Shivaratri is mentioned in several Puranas, particularly the Skanda Purana, Linga Purana, and Padma Purana. These medieval era Shaiva texts present different versions associated with this festival, such as fasting, and offering reverence to a lingam - an emblematic figure of Shiva. According to legend, Lord Shiva performed the Tandava dance, a cosmic dance of creation and destruction, on the night of Maha Shivaratri. This dance is said to have created the universe and destroyed it, only to create it again.\n\n**Worship**\n---------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is celebrated in various ways across different regions. In Tamil Nadu, the festival is celebrated with great pomp and fanfare in the Annamalaiyar temple located in Tiruvannamalai district. The special process of worship on this day is Girivalam or Giri Pradakshina, a 14-kilometer bare foot walk around Shiva's temple on top of the hill. A huge lamp of oil and camphor is lit on the hilltop at sunset, and a ritual marathon is undertaken by the devotees to the 12 Shiva shrines in the district of Kanyakumari on the day of Shivaratri called Sivalaya Ottam. In recent years, the Isha Foundation has been a major patron of such festivities in India, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi having attended the celebration hosted at the site of the Giant Adiyogi in Coimbatore.\n\n**India**\n---------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is celebrated in various parts of India, with different regions having their own unique traditions and customs. In the state of Maharashtra, the festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm, with devotees offering special prayers and performing austerities. In the state of Madhya Pradesh, the festival is celebrated with great fanfare, with devotees performing a ritual dance called the \"Tandava\" in honor of Lord Shiva. In the state of Gujarat, the festival is celebrated with great devotion, with devotees offering special prayers and performing austerities.\n\n**Nepal**\n---------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is a national holiday in Nepal and celebrated widely in temples all over the country, especially in the Pashupatinath temple. Thousands of devotees visit the famous Shiva Shakti Peetham nearby as well. Holy rituals are performed all over the nation. Maha Shivaratri is celebrated as Nepali Army Day amid a spectacular ceremony held at the Army Pavilion, Tundikhel. In the capital city of Kathmandu, there is a provision of road blockage where children use ropes and strings to stop the people or vehicle passing through in exchange of money. Worshippers of Shiva stay up all night and smoke marijuana as Shiva is believed to be an avid smoker and marijuana smoking on this day is called taking 'Shivako Prasad' or 'Shiva Buti' literally the \"Blessing of Shiva\". Crowds of sadhus and saints travel to Pashupatinath Temple located in Kathmandu from all of Nepal and neighbouring India to celebrate the day and perform puja on this day.\n\n**Pakistan**\n---------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is also celebrated in Pakistan, with the Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple in Karachi being a major center of devotion. The festival is attended by 25,000 people, with devotees fasting and visiting the temple on the night of Shivaratri. Devotees from the Chanesar Goth come to the temple carrying water from the holy river Ganges, in order to bathe the idol of Shiva. Puja is performed until 5 am, when an aarti is then done. Devotees then walk barefoot with women carrying a pooja thali containing flowers, incense sticks, rice, coconut and a diya to the sea after which they are free to break their fast and eat breakfast later on, which was made in the temple kitchen.\n\n**Outside South Asia**\n----------------------\n\nMaha Shivaratri is the main Hindu festival among the Shaiva Hindu diaspora from Nepal and India. In Indo-Caribbean communities, thousands of Hindus spend the beautiful night in over four hundred temples across multiple countries, offering special jhalls (an offering of milk and curd, flowers, sugarcane and sweets) to Shiva. In Mauritius, Hindus go on pilgrimage to Ganga Talao, a crater-lake.\n\n**Fasting**\n---------\n\nFasting and meditation is recommended for Hindus during Maha Shivaratri. Those fasting may engage in \"nirjala vrat,\" or fasting from all food and water, or fast from meat, eating only fruits and milk during the day. Some devotees also observe a partial fast, where they eat only vegetarian food and avoid certain types of food. The fast is said to help devotees focus their minds and connect with the divine.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Maha_Shivaratri\" following this outline:\n\n\nDescription\nA festival of contemplation\n\n\nLegend and significance\nThe Maha Shivaratri is mentioned in several Puranas, particularly the Skanda Purana, Linga Purana, and Padma Purana These medieval era Shaiva texts present different versions associated with this festival, such as fasting, and offering reverence to a lingam - an emblematic figure of Shiva [8]\n\n\nWorship\nMaha Shivaratri is celebrated in Tamil Nadu with great pomp and fanfare in the Annamalaiyar temple located in Tiruvannamalai district The special process of worship on this day is Girivalam or Giri Pradakshina, a 14-kilometer bare foot walk around Shiva's temple on top of the hill A huge lamp of oil and camphor is lit on the hilltop at sunset - not to be confused with Karthigai Deepam [citation needed] A ritual marathon is undertaken by the devotees to the 12 Shiva shrines in the district of Kanyakumari on the day of Shivaratri called Sivalaya Ottam [citation needed] In recent years, the Isha Foundation has been a major patron of such festivities in India, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi having attended the celebration hosted at the site of the Giant Adiyogi in Coimbatore [23]\n\n\nIndia\nMaha Shivaratri is celebrated in Tamil Nadu with great pomp and fanfare in the Annamalaiyar temple located in Tiruvannamalai district The special process of worship on this day is Girivalam or Giri Pradakshina, a 14-kilometer bare foot walk around Shiva's temple on top of the hill A huge lamp of oil and camphor is lit on the hilltop at sunset - not to be confused with Karthigai Deepam [citation needed] A ritual marathon is undertaken by the devotees to the 12 Shiva shrines in the district of Kanyakumari on the day of Shivaratri called Sivalaya Ottam [citation needed] In recent years, the Isha Foundation has been a major patron of such festivities in India, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi having attended the celebration hosted at the site of the Giant Adiyogi in Coimbatore [23]\n\n\nNepal\nMaha Shivaratri is a national holiday in Nepal and celebrated widely in temples all over the country, especially in the Pashupatinath temple Thousands of devotees visit the famous Shiva Shakti Peetham nearby as well Holy rituals are performed all over the nation Maha Shivaratri is celebrated as Nepali Army Day amid a spectacular ceremony held at the Army Pavilion, Tundikhel [32] In the capital city of Kathmandu, there is a provision of road blockage where children use ropes and strings to stop the people or vehicle passing through in exchange of money [33] Worshippers of Shiva stay up all night and smoke marijuana as Shiva is believed to be an avid smoker and marijuana smoking on this day is called taking ‘Shivako Prasad’ or ‘Shiva Buti’ literally the \"Blessing of Shiva\" [34] Crowds of sadhus and saints travel to Pashupatinath Temple located in Kathmandu from all of Nepal and neighbouring India to celebrate the day and perform puja on this day [35]\n\n\nPakistan\nAnother major temple where Shivaratri is celebrated is the Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple in Karachi whose Shivaratri festival is attended by 25,000 people [36] On the Shivaratri night, Hindus in Karachi fast and visit the temple Later, devotees from the Chanesar Goth come to the temple carrying water from the holy river Ganges, in order to bathe the idol of Shiva Puja is performed until 5 am, when an aarti is then done Devotees then walk barefoot with women carrying a pooja thali containing flowers, incense sticks, rice, coconut and a diya to the sea after which they are free to break their fast They eat breakfast later on, which was made in the temple kitchen [37]\n\n\nOutside South Asia\nMaha Shivaratri is the main Hindu festival among the Shaiva Hindu diaspora from Nepal and India In Indo-Caribbean communities, thousands of Hindus spend the beautiful night in over four hundred temples across multiple countries, offering special jhalls (an offering of milk and curd, flowers, sugarcane and sweets) to Shiva [38] In Mauritius, Hindus go on pilgrimage to Ganga Talao, a crater-lake [39]\n\n\nFasting\nFasting and meditation is recommended for Hindus during Maha Shrivastri [40] Those fasting may engage in \"nirjala vrat,\" or fasting from all food and water, or fast from meat, eating only fruits and milk during the day.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

but they had fewer flying hours—2,300 on average compared with 3,500 and 2,800 for the first two groups, and only eight of the fourteen were test pilots Of the thirty astronauts selected in the first three groups, only Collins and his third group colleague William Anders were born outside the United States, [32] [33] and Collins was the only one with an older brother; all the rest were the eldest or only sons in their families [34] Training began with a 240-hour course on the basics of spaceflight Fifty-eight hours of this was devoted to geology, something Collins did not readily understand and in which he never became very interested [35] At the end, Alan Shepard, the Chief of the Astronaut Office, asked the fourteen to rank their fellow astronauts in the order they would want to fly with them in space Collins picked David Scott in the number one position [36]\n\n\nProject Gemini\nAfter this basic training, the third group was assigned specializations Collins received his first choice: pressure suits and extravehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks) [37] His job was to monitor development and act as a liaison between the Astronaut Office and contractors [38] He was disturbed by the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, because he was not involved despite being the person with the greatest knowledge of the subject [39]\n\n\nCrew assignments\nAfter this basic training, the third group was assigned specializations Collins received his first choice: pressure suits and extravehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks) [37] His job was to monitor development and act as a liaison between the Astronaut Office and contractors [38] He was disturbed by the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, because he was not involved despite being the person with the greatest knowledge of the subject [39]\n\n\nGemini 10\nFifteen scientific experiments were carried on Gemini 10—more than any other Gemini mission except the two-week-long Gemini 7 [53] After Gemini 9's EVA ran into problems, the remaining Gemini objectives had to be completed on the last three flights While the overall number of objectives increased, the difficulty of Collins' EVA was scaled significantly back There was no backpack or astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU), as there had been on Gemini 8 [46]\n\n\nApollo program\nShortly after Gemini 10, Collins was assigned to the backup crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Borman as commander (CDR), Stafford as command module pilot (CMP), and Collins as lunar module pilot (LMP) Along with learning the new Apollo command and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Collins received helicopter training, as these were thought to be the best way to simulate the landing approach of the LM After the completion of Project Gemini, it was decided to cancel the Apollo 2 flight, since it would just repeat the Apollo 1 flight Stafford was given his own crew, and Anders was assigned to Borman's crew Slayton had decided an Apollo mission commander should be an experienced astronaut who had already flown a mission, and that on flights with a LM, the CMP should also have some spaceflight experience, something Anders did not yet have, since the CMP would have to fly the CM alone Collins was therefore moved to the CMP position on the Apollo 9 prime crew, and Anders became the LMP [67] The practice became that the CMP would be the next most senior member of the crew, and that they would go on to command later Apollo flights [68]\n\n\nApollo 8\nHaving trained for the flight, Collins was made a capsule communicator (CAPCOM), an astronaut stationed at Mission Control responsible for communicating directly with the crew during a mission [74] As part of the Green Team, he covered the launch phase up to translunar injection, the rocket burn that sent Apollo 8 to the Moon [75] The successful completion of the first crewed circumlunar flight was followed by the announcement of the Apollo 11 crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins At that time, in January 1969, it was uncertain this would be the lunar landing mission; this depended on the success of Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 testing the LM [76]\n\n\nApollo 11\nAs CMP, Collins' training was completely different from the LM and lunar EVA, and was sometimes done without Armstrong or Aldrin being present Along with simulators, there were measurements for pressure suits, centrifuge training to simulate the reentry, and practicing docking with a huge rig at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia Since he would be the active participant in the rendezvous with the LM, Collins compiled a book [77] of 18 different rendezvous schemes for various scenarios including ones where the LM did not land, or it launched too early or too late This book ran for 117 pages [77]\n\n\nPost-NASA activities\nNASA Administrator Thomas O Paine told Collins that Secretary of State William P Rogers was interested in appointing Collins to the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs After the crew returned to the U.S in November, Collins sat down with Rogers and accepted the position on the urgings of President Nixon [107] He was an unusual choice for the role, as he was neither a journalist nor a career diplomat Nor, unlike some of his predecessors, did he act as the department spokesperson Instead, as the head of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs, his role was that of managing relations with the public at large He had a staff of 115 and a budget of $2.5 million, [108] but this was small compared with the 6,000 public affairs staff at the United States Department of Defense [109]\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs\nNASA Administrator Thomas O Paine told Collins that Secretary of State William P Rogers was interested in appointing Collins to the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs After the crew returned to the U.S in November, Collins sat down with Rogers and accepted the position on the urgings of President Nixon [107] He was an unusual choice for the role, as he was neither a journalist nor a career diplomat Nor, unlike some of his predecessors, did he act as the department spokesperson Instead, as the head of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs, his role was that of managing relations with the public at large He had a staff of 115 and a budget of $2.5 million, [108] but this was small compared with the 6,000 public affairs staff at the United States Department of Defense [109]\n\n\nDirector of the National Air and Space Museum\nOn August 12, 1946, Congress passed an authorization bill for a National Air Museum, to be administered by the Smithsonian Institution, and located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C [117] Under the U.S legislative system, authorization is insufficient;

Born on October 31, 1930, in Rome, Italy, Collins spent his early life in the United States, where he developed a passion for flight and eventually became a decorated military pilot and astronaut.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCollins was born in Rome, Italy, where his father, James Lawton Collins, was serving as a military attaché for the United States Army. Collins' mother, Virginia Collins, was of British descent, and his father's family hailed from Ireland. As a child, Collins moved to various locations in the United States, including Washington, D.C., and New York City, where he developed an interest in flight and the military.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nCollins began his military service in 1952, when he enlisted in the United States Air Force. He underwent basic flight training at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi and later moved on to San Marcos Air Force Base in Texas to learn instrument and formation flying. Collins then attended James Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas, where he trained in jet aircraft. He was awarded his wings upon completion of the course at Waco and was chosen for advanced day-fighter training at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. Collins' training was marked by several accidents, including one that resulted in the death of his instructor.\n\n**Fighter Pilot**\n\nCollins' experience as a fighter pilot prepared him well for his future role as an astronaut. He accumulated over 1,500 flying hours, which was the minimum required for admission to the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Collins was a member of Class 60C, which included fellow astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Irwin, and Tom Stafford. As a test pilot, Collins flew a range of aircraft, including the North American T-28 Trojan, the F-86 Sabre, the B-57 Canberra, the T-33 Shooting Star, and the F-104 Starfighter.\n\n**Space Program**\n\nIn 1963, Collins was selected as an astronaut for the Gemini program, which was the precursor to the Apollo program. The third group of astronauts, which included Collins, was younger and better educated than the first two groups, but had fewer flying hours. Collins was assigned to the pressure suits and extravehicular activities (EVAs) specialization, which made him the expert on spacewalks. He was disturbed by the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, which was carried out without his involvement.\n\n**Gemini 10**\n\nCollins was a member of the Gemini 10 mission, which was launched on July 18, 1966. The mission was a success, with Collins and his crewmate, John Young, completing 22 orbits of the Earth and conducting several scientific experiments. Collins' EVA was a key part of the mission, and he spent a total of 2 hours and 15 minutes outside the spacecraft.\n\n**Apollo Program**\n\nAfter the Gemini program, Collins was assigned to the Apollo program, where he was a member of the backup crew for the second crewed Apollo flight. Collins was also assigned to the Apollo 9 prime crew, where he served as the Command Module Pilot (CMP). Collins was the first astronaut to be assigned to the CMP position, which made him the next most senior member of the crew. He was responsible for learning the new Apollo command and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM).\n\n**Apollo 8**\n\nCollins was a member of the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first crewed circumlunar flight. Collins was a capsule communicator (CAPCOM), which made him responsible for communicating directly with the crew during the mission. Collins was part of the Green Team, which covered the launch phase up to translunar injection.\n\n**Apollo 11**\n\nCollins was a member of the Apollo 11 mission, which was the first manned mission to land on the Moon. Collins was the Command Module Pilot (CMP), which made him responsible for learning the new Apollo command and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). Collins was also responsible for rendezvousing with the Lunar Module (LM) and docking with it. Collins compiled a book of 18 different rendezvous schemes for various scenarios, including ones where the LM did not land, or it launched too early or too late.\n\n**Post-NASA Activities**\n\nAfter the Apollo program, Collins was appointed as the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, a position he held from 1969 to 1971. Collins was an unusual choice for the role, as he was neither a journalist nor a career diplomat. He managed relations with the public at large and had a staff of 115 and a budget of $2.5 million.\n\n**Director of the National Air and Space Museum**\n\nCollins was also a trustee of the National Air and Space Museum, which was administered by the Smithsonian Institution. Collins was a strong advocate for the museum and worked to promote its development.\n\n**Other Activities**\n\nCollins completed the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program in 1974 and became the vice president of LTV Aerospace in Arlington County, Virginia, in 1980. Collins resigned from LTV in 1985 to start his own consulting firm, Michael Collins Associates. Collins also wrote an autobiography, \"Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys,\" which was published in 1974.\n\n**Death**\n\nCollins died on April 28, 2021, at the age of 90, due to cancer.\n\n**Honors and Awards**\n\nCollins was a long-time trustee of the National Geographic Society and served as Trustee Emeritus. He was also a fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nCollins has been portrayed in several films and documentaries, including \"In the Shadow of the Moon,\" \"Youth in Revolt,\" \"Apollo 11,\" \"From the Earth to the Moon,\" \"Moon Shot,\" and \"First Man.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michael_Collins_(astronaut)\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nCollins was born on October 31, 1930, in Rome, Italy [1] [2] He was the second son of James Lawton Collins, [3] a career U.S Army officer, who was the U.S military attaché there from 1928 to 1932, and Virginia C Collins (née Stewart) [4] Collins had an older brother, James Lawton Collins Jr [5] [6] and two older sisters, Virginia and Agnes Collins' mother was of British descent, and his father's family hailed from Ireland [7]: 11 \n\n\nMilitary service\nCollins began basic flight training in the T-6 Texan at Columbus Air Force Base in Columbus, Mississippi, in August 1952, then moved on to San Marcos Air Force Base in Texas to learn instrument and formation flying, and finally to James Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas, for training in jet aircraft Flying came easily to him, and unlike many of his colleagues, he had little fear of failure He was awarded his wings upon completion of the course at Waco, and in September 1953, he was chosen for advanced day-fighter training at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, flying F-86 Sabres The training was dangerous; eleven people were killed in accidents during the 22 weeks he was there [14] [17]\n\n\nFighter pilot\nCollins began basic flight training in the T-6 Texan at Columbus Air Force Base in Columbus, Mississippi, in August 1952, then moved on to San Marcos Air Force Base in Texas to learn instrument and formation flying, and finally to James Connally Air Force Base in Waco, Texas, for training in jet aircraft Flying came easily to him, and unlike many of his colleagues, he had little fear of failure He was awarded his wings upon completion of the course at Waco, and in September 1953, he was chosen for advanced day-fighter training at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, flying F-86 Sabres The training was dangerous; eleven people were killed in accidents during the 22 weeks he was there [14] [17]\n\n\nTest pilot\nCollins' MTD posting allowed him to accumulate over 1,500 flying hours, the minimum required for admission to the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California His application was successful, and on August 29, 1960, he became a member of Class 60C, [23] which included Frank Borman, Jim Irwin and Tom Stafford, who later became astronauts Military test pilot instruction started with the North American T-28 Trojan, and proceeded through the high performance F-86 Sabre, B-57 Canberra, T-33 Shooting Star, and the F-104 Starfighter [24] Collins was a heavy smoker, but quit in 1962 after suffering a particularly bad hangover The next day, he spent what he described as the worst four hours of his life in the co-pilot's seat of a B-52 Stratofortress while going through the initial stages of nicotine withdrawal [25]\n\n\nSpace program\nCompared with the first two groups of astronauts, the third group of fourteen astronauts, which included Collins, was younger, with an average age of 31—the first two groups had an average age of 34.5 and 32.5 at their time of selection—and was better educated, with an average of 5.6 years of tertiary education; but they had fewer flying hours—2,300 on average compared with 3,500 and 2,800 for the first two groups, and only eight of the fourteen were test pilots Of the thirty astronauts selected in the first three groups, only Collins and his third group colleague William Anders were born outside the United States, [32] [33] and Collins was the only one with an older brother; all the rest were the eldest or only sons in their families [34] Training began with a 240-hour course on the basics of spaceflight Fifty-eight hours of this was devoted to geology, something Collins did not readily understand and in which he never became very interested [35] At the end, Alan Shepard, the Chief of the Astronaut Office, asked the fourteen to rank their fellow astronauts in the order they would want to fly with them in space Collins picked David Scott in the number one position [36]\n\n\nProject Gemini\nAfter this basic training, the third group was assigned specializations Collins received his first choice: pressure suits and extravehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks) [37] His job was to monitor development and act as a liaison between the Astronaut Office and contractors [38] He was disturbed by the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, because he was not involved despite being the person with the greatest knowledge of the subject [39]\n\n\nCrew assignments\nAfter this basic training, the third group was assigned specializations Collins received his first choice: pressure suits and extravehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks) [37] His job was to monitor development and act as a liaison between the Astronaut Office and contractors [38] He was disturbed by the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, because he was not involved despite being the person with the greatest knowledge of the subject [39]\n\n\nGemini 10\nFifteen scientific experiments were carried on Gemini 10—more than any other Gemini mission except the two-week-long Gemini 7 [53] After Gemini 9's EVA ran into problems, the remaining Gemini objectives had to be completed on the last three flights While the overall number of objectives increased, the difficulty of Collins' EVA was scaled significantly back There was no backpack or astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU), as there had been on Gemini 8 [46]\n\n\nApollo program\nShortly after Gemini 10, Collins was assigned to the backup crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Borman as commander (CDR), Stafford as command module pilot (CMP), and Collins as lunar module pilot (LMP) Along with learning the new Apollo command and service module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Collins received helicopter training, as these were thought to be the best way to simulate the landing approach of the LM After the completion of Project Gemini, it was decided to cancel the Apollo 2 flight, since it would just repeat the Apollo 1 flight Stafford was given his own crew, and Anders was assigned to Borman's crew Slayton had decided an Apollo mission commander should be an experienced astronaut who had already flown a mission, and that on flights with a LM, the CMP should also have some spaceflight experience, something Anders did not yet have, since the CMP would have to fly the CM alone Collins was therefore moved to the CMP position on the Apollo 9 prime crew, and Anders became the LMP [67] The practice became that the CMP would be the next most senior member of the crew, and that they would go on to command later Apollo flights [68]\n\n\nApollo 8\nHaving trained for the flight, Collins was made a capsule communicator (CAPCOM), an astronaut stationed at Mission Control responsible for communicating directly with the crew during a mission [74] As part of the Green Team, he covered the launch phase up to translunar injection, the rocket burn that sent Apollo 8 to the Moon [75] The successful completion of the first crewed circumlunar flight was followed by the announcement of the Apollo 11 crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins At that time, in January 1969, it was uncertain this would be the lunar landing mission; this depended on the success of Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 testing the LM [76]\n\n\nApollo 11\nAs CMP, Collins' training was completely different from the LM and lunar EVA, and was sometimes done without Armstrong or Aldrin being present Along with simulators, there were measurements for pressure suits, centrifuge training to simulate the reentry, and practicing docking with a huge rig at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia Since he would be the active participant in the rendezvous with the LM, Collins compiled a book [77] of 18 different rendezvous schemes for various scenarios including ones where the LM did not land, or it launched too early or too late This book ran for 117 pages [77]\n\n\nPost-NASA activities\nNASA Administrator Thomas O Paine told Collins that Secretary of State William P Rogers was interested in appointing Collins to the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs After the crew returned to the U.S in November, Collins sat down with Rogers and accepted the position on the urgings of President Nixon [107] He was an unusual choice for the role, as he was neither a journalist nor a career diplomat Nor, unlike some of his predecessors, did he act as the department spokesperson Instead, as the head of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs, his role was that of managing relations with the public at large He had a staff of 115 and a budget of $2.5 million, [108] but this was small compared with the 6,000 public affairs staff at the United States Department of Defense [109]\n\n\nAssistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs\nNASA Administrator Thomas O Paine told Collins that Secretary of State William P Rogers was interested in appointing Collins to the position of Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs After the crew returned to the U.S in November, Collins sat down with Rogers and accepted the position on the urgings of President Nixon [107] He was an unusual choice for the role, as he was neither a journalist nor a career diplomat Nor, unlike some of his predecessors, did he act as the department spokesperson Instead, as the head of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs, his role was that of managing relations with the public at large He had a staff of 115 and a budget of $2.5 million, [108] but this was small compared with the 6,000 public affairs staff at the United States Department of Defense [109]\n\n\nDirector of the National Air and Space Museum\nOn August 12, 1946, Congress passed an authorization bill for a National Air Museum, to be administered by the Smithsonian Institution, and located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C [117] Under the U.S legislative system, authorization is insufficient; Congress also has to pass an appropriation bill allocating funding Since this was not done, there was no money for the museum building [118]\n\n\nOther activities\nCollins completed the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program in 1974, and in 1980 became vice president of LTV Aerospace in Arlington County, Virginia [134] He resigned in 1985 to start his own consulting firm, Michael Collins Associates [135] He wrote an autobiography in 1974 entitled Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut's Journeys The New York Times writer John Wilford wrote that it is \"generally regarded as the best account of what it is like to be an astronaut.\" [136]\n\n\nDeath\nOn April 28, 2021, Collins died of cancer at his home in Naples, Florida, at the age of 90 [140] [141]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nCollins was a long-time trustee of the National Geographic Society and served as Trustee Emeritus [136] He was also a fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics [144] [145]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nCollins is one of the astronauts featured in the 2007 documentary In the Shadow of the Moon [170] He had a small part as \"Old Man\" in the 2009 movie Youth in Revolt [171] In the 1996 TV movie Apollo 11, he was played by Jim Metzler, [172] and in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, he was played by Cary Elwes [173] In the 2009 TV movie Moon Shot, he was played by Andrew Lincoln [174] In the 2018 film First Man, he was portrayed by Lukas Haas, [175] and he is featured in the 2019 documentary film Apollo 11 For contributions to the television industry, the Apollo 11 astronauts were honored with round plaques on the Hollywood Walk of Fame [176] In For All Mankind he is portrayed by Ryan Kennedy [177] In The Crown he is portrayed by Andrew-Lee Potts [178]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Buffalo_Bills", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League led by head coach Buster Ramsey and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 [18] In the first two seasons, the Bills went 5–8–1 and 6–8 under Ramsey [19] [20] The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965 with quarterback Jack Kemp and coach Lou Saban, but the club has yet to win a league championship since [21] [22]\n\n\nSean McDermott era (2017–present)\nUnder head coach Sean McDermott, [49] the Bills broke the playoff drought, appearing in the playoffs for six of the next seven seasons [50] The team drafted Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft [51] The team earned its first division championship and playoff wins since 1995 during the 2020 season, aided by Brady's departure to Tampa Bay and out of the AFC East, as well as the Bills' own development of a core of talent including Allen, Stefon Diggs, Matt Milano, and Tre'Davious White [52] [53] In the 2020 season, the Bills reached the AFC Championship for the first time since the 1993 season [54] However, their run ended with a 38–24 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs [55] The Bills won the AFC East with a 11–6 record in the 2021 season [56] The Bills defeated the Patriots 47–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs 42–36 in overtime [57] [58] In the 2022 season, the Bills won the AFC East with a 13–3 record [59] The season saw a cancelled game against the Bengals due to a near-fatal medical episode with Damar Hamlin, who eventually recovered and returned to football activities the following season [60] [61] The team defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round 34–31 before falling to the Cincinnati Bengals 27–10 in the Divisional Round [62] [63] In the 2023 season, the Bills won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive season [64] In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round 27–24 [65] [66] The Buffalo Bills have also announced the plans to build a new stadium to replace Highmark Stadium in 2026 [67]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nFor their first two seasons, the Bills wore uniforms based on those of the Detroit Lions at the time Ralph Wilson had been a minority owner of the Lions before founding the Bills, and the Bills' predecessors in the AAFC had also worn blue and silver uniforms [4] [68]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe Bills have rivalries with their three AFC East opponents (the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, and New York Jets) and also have rivalries with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (a former divisional opponent), Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, [80] and Dallas Cowboys [81] They also play an annual preseason game against the Detroit Lions.\n\n\nDivisional\nThis is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team, while the Bills were one of the original eight AFL teams [83] The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first match-up of the 1980s) [84] Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of Jim Kelly as Buffalo's franchise quarterback Though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival, [85] and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win–loss records Miami leads the overall series 62–58–1 as of 2023, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4–1, including a win in the 1992 AFC Championship Game [86]\n\n\nMiami Dolphins\nThis is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team, while the Bills were one of the original eight AFL teams [83] The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first match-up of the 1980s) [84] Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of Jim Kelly as Buffalo's franchise quarterback Though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival, [85] and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win–loss records Miami leads the overall series 62–58–1 as of 2023, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4–1, including a win in the 1992 AFC Championship Game [86]\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nThe rivalry with the New England Patriots began when both teams were original franchises in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the NFL–AFL merger, but did not gain notability until the emergence of New England quarterback Tom Brady in 2001 [87] The teams were very competitive prior to the 2000s However, Brady's arrival in the early 2000s led to the Patriots dominating the AFC East, including the Bills, for two decades [88] [89] As a result, New England replaced the Dolphins as Buffalo's most hated rival [85] [90] The Bills have taken a 7–2 edge since Brady's departure in 2020, which included consecutive AFC East titles from 2020 to 2022 and a season sweep of the Patriots in two of the three years In 2021, the Bills dominated in a 47–17 victory against the Patriots in the two teams' first playoff match-up in 59 years, which saw the Bills score a touchdown on every offensive drive throughout the entire game and, as such, is the only \"perfect offensive game\" in NFL history [91] [92] [93] Overall, the Patriots lead the series 78–50–1 as of 2023, but trail the Bills by a 47–46–1 margin without Brady on the field [94]\n\n\nNew York Jets\nThe Bills and Jets were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of New York, though the Jets have played their home games in East Rutherford, New Jersey since 1984 While the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Western New York, it has historically not been as intense as Buffalo's rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots When not playing one another, the teams' fan bases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other (stemming more from the broader upstate-downstate tensions than the teams or sport) The Bills-Jets rivalry has often become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became the Bills' head coach for two seasons and had become notable again as Bills quarterback Josh Allen and former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold, both drafted in the same year, maintained a friendly rivalry with one another [96] [97] Buffalo leads the series 69–58 as of 2023, including a playoff win in 1981 [98]\n\n\nConference\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, another original franchise in the AFL, have a long history against the Bills, despite the two teams never being in the same division Buffalo currently leads the series 29–24–1, which has included five playoff meetings, three of which were AFL/AFC Championship Games; [99] Kansas City won the 1966 AFL Championship Game that determined the AFL's representative in the first Super Bowl against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers, [100] in addition to the 2020 AFC Championship Game that saw the team advance to its second straight Super Bowl appearance, [101] while Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC Championship Game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance [102] However, after each victory in the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs or the Bills went on to lose the ensuing Super Bowl Despite a lull in the series in the 2000s and 2010s, the rivalry gained attention as the Bills and Chiefs met in nine of ten years from 2008 to 2017 [103] [104] After a two-year hiatus in the series, four high-profile match-ups occurred between the Bills and Chiefs in 2020 and 2021, including the aforementioned 2020 Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional round game, the latter of which is now considered one of the greatest playoff games of all time, but was also controversial due to the league's overtime rules [105] [106] A rivalry between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has also developed, drawing comparisons to Jim Kelly's rivalry with Dan Marino as well as the rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [107]\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, another original franchise in the AFL, have a long history against the Bills, despite the two teams never being in the same division Buffalo currently leads the series 29–24–1, which has included five playoff meetings, three of which were AFL/AFC Championship Games; [99] Kansas City won the 1966 AFL Championship Game that determined the AFL's representative in the first Super Bowl against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers, [100] in addition to the 2020 AFC Championship Game that saw the team advance to its second straight Super Bowl appearance, [101] while Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC Championship Game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance [102] However, after each victory in the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs or the Bills went on to lose the ensuing Super Bowl Despite a lull in the series in the 2000s and 2010s, the rivalry gained attention as the Bills and Chiefs met in nine of ten years from 2008 to 2017 [103] [104] After a two-year hiatus in the series, four high-profile match-ups occurred between the Bills and Chiefs in 2020 and 2021, including the aforementioned 2020 Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional round game, the latter of which is now considered one of the greatest playoff games of all time, but was also controversial due to the league's overtime rules [105] [106] A rivalry between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has also developed, drawing comparisons to Jim Kelly's rivalry with Dan Marino as well as the rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [107]\n\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nA new rivalry emerged between the Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars after former Bills head coach Doug Marrone, who had quit the team after the 2014 season, was hired as a coaching assistant for Jacksonville and eventually rose to become the Jaguars' head coach [80] The first game between the Marrone-led Jaguars was a London game in week 7 of the 2015 season, which saw the Jaguars' win 34–31 [108] The most important game of this series was an ugly, low-scoring Wild Card game in 2017 that saw the Jaguars win 10–3 This game is notable as it was the first Bills playoff appearance in 17 seasons [109] Prior to this, Jacksonville had handed Buffalo its first playoff loss in Bills Stadium in 1996 [110] Following the 2017 wild card game the Bills and Jaguars have met three additional times The first was a \"rematch\" game in week 12 of the 2018 season, which saw the Bills win 24–21 During this game, trash talk from former Jaguars players such as Jalen Ramsey resulted in a brawl between the teams [111] [112] [113] The second time was in week 9 of the 2021 season By now, the \"point\" of the rivalry, Marrone's feud with the Bills organization, and the personal drama between Bills and Jaguars players no longer applied as Marrone had been fired and replaced by Urban Meyer and all the players from the 2017 Jaguars team have since moved on to other teams or retired Regardless, this game was the seventh largest upset at the time in NFL history, which saw the 15.5-point favorite Bills lose 9–6 [114] The next time the teams would play would be a monday-night game in 2024 where the bills \"annihilated\" the Jaguars 47-10 [115] The series is currently tied at 10–10 [116]\n\n\nHouston Oilers/Tennessee Titans\nThe Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger Match-ups were intense in the 1990s, with quarterback Warren Moon leading the Oilers against Jim Kelly's Bills [117] After both teams failed to meet the same success in the late 2000s to early 2010s, they have returned to consistent playoff contention since 2017, resulting in several high-profile games as of late [118] Memorable playoff moments between the teams include The Comeback, in which the Frank Reich-led Bills overcame a 35–3 deficit to stun the Oilers 41–38 in 1992, [117] and the Music City Miracle, in which the now-Titans scored on a near-last-minute kickoff return with a controversial lateral pass ruling to beat the Bills 22–16 in 1999 [119] The Music City Miracle was notable for being Buffalo's last playoff appearance until 2017 [120] The Titans currently lead the series 30–20 [121]\n\n\nNotable players\nThe Buffalo Bills have retired three numbers in franchise history: No 12 for Jim Kelly, No 34 for Thurman Thomas, and No 78 for Bruce Smith Although the Bills have retired only three jersey numbers, other numbers are no longer issued or are in reduced circulation [122] [123]\n\n\nRetired numbers\nThe Buffalo Bills have retired three numbers in franchise history: No 12 for Jim Kelly, No 34 for Thurman Thomas, and No 78 for Bruce Smith Although the Bills have retired only three jersey numbers, other numbers are no longer issued or

about \"Buffalo_Bills\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League led by head coach Buster Ramsey and joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 [18] In the first two seasons, the Bills went 5–8–1 and 6–8 under Ramsey [19] [20] The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965 with quarterback Jack Kemp and coach Lou Saban, but the club has yet to win a league championship since [21] [22]\n\n\nSean McDermott era (2017–present)\nUnder head coach Sean McDermott, [49] the Bills broke the playoff drought, appearing in the playoffs for six of the next seven seasons [50] The team drafted Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft [51] The team earned its first division championship and playoff wins since 1995 during the 2020 season, aided by Brady's departure to Tampa Bay and out of the AFC East, as well as the Bills' own development of a core of talent including Allen, Stefon Diggs, Matt Milano, and Tre'Davious White [52] [53] In the 2020 season, the Bills reached the AFC Championship for the first time since the 1993 season [54] However, their run ended with a 38–24 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs [55] The Bills won the AFC East with a 11–6 record in the 2021 season [56] The Bills defeated the Patriots 47–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs 42–36 in overtime [57] [58] In the 2022 season, the Bills won the AFC East with a 13–3 record [59] The season saw a cancelled game against the Bengals due to a near-fatal medical episode with Damar Hamlin, who eventually recovered and returned to football activities the following season [60] [61] The team defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round 34–31 before falling to the Cincinnati Bengals 27–10 in the Divisional Round [62] [63] In the 2023 season, the Bills won the AFC East for the fourth consecutive season [64] In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round 27–24 [65] [66] The Buffalo Bills have also announced the plans to build a new stadium to replace Highmark Stadium in 2026 [67]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nFor their first two seasons, the Bills wore uniforms based on those of the Detroit Lions at the time Ralph Wilson had been a minority owner of the Lions before founding the Bills, and the Bills' predecessors in the AAFC had also worn blue and silver uniforms [4] [68]\n\n\nRivalries\nThe Bills have rivalries with their three AFC East opponents (the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, and New York Jets) and also have rivalries with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (a former divisional opponent), Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, [80] and Dallas Cowboys [81] They also play an annual preseason game against the Detroit Lions.\n\n\nDivisional\nThis is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team, while the Bills were one of the original eight AFL teams [83] The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first match-up of the 1980s) [84] Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of Jim Kelly as Buffalo's franchise quarterback Though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival, [85] and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win–loss records Miami leads the overall series 62–58–1 as of 2023, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4–1, including a win in the 1992 AFC Championship Game [86]\n\n\nMiami Dolphins\nThis is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team, while the Bills were one of the original eight AFL teams [83] The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first match-up of the 1980s) [84] Fortunes

2023, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 4–1, including a win in the 1992 AFC Championship Game [86]\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nThe rivalry with the New England Patriots began when both teams were original franchises in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the NFL–AFL merger, but did not gain notability until the emergence of New England quarterback Tom Brady in 2001 [87] The teams were very competitive prior to the 2000s However, Brady's arrival in the early 2000s led to the Patriots dominating the AFC East, including the Bills, for two decades [88] [89] As a result, New England replaced the Dolphins as Buffalo's most hated rival [85] [90] The Bills have taken a 7–2 edge since Brady's departure in 2020, which included consecutive AFC East titles from 2020 to 2022 and a season sweep of the Patriots in two of the three years In 2021, the Bills dominated in a 47–17 victory against the Patriots in the two teams' first playoff match-up in 59 years, which saw the Bills score a touchdown on every offensive drive throughout the entire game and, as such, is the only \"perfect offensive game\" in NFL history [91] [92] [93] Overall, the Patriots lead the series 78–50–1 as of 2023, but trail the Bills by a 47–46–1 margin without Brady on the field [94]\n\n\nNew York Jets\nThe Bills and Jets were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of New York, though the Jets have played their home games in East Rutherford, New Jersey since 1984 While the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Western New York, it has historically not been as intense as Buffalo's rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots When not playing one another, the teams' fan bases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other (stemming more from the broader upstate-downstate tensions than the teams or sport) The Bills-Jets rivalry has often become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became the Bills' head coach for two seasons and had become notable again as Bills quarterback Josh Allen and former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold, both drafted in the same year, maintained a friendly rivalry with one another [96] [97] Buffalo leads the series 69–58 as of 2023, including a playoff win in 1981 [98]\n\n\nConference\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, another original franchise in the AFL, have a long history against the Bills, despite the two teams never being in the same division Buffalo currently leads the series 29–24–1, which has included five playoff meetings, three of which were AFL/AFC Championship Games; [99] Kansas City won the 1966 AFL Championship Game that determined the AFL's representative in the first Super Bowl against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers, [100] in addition to the 2020 AFC Championship Game that saw the team advance to its second straight Super Bowl appearance, [101] while Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC Championship Game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance [102] However, after each victory in the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs or the Bills went on to lose the ensuing Super Bowl Despite a lull in the series in the 2000s and 2010s, the rivalry gained attention as the Bills and Chiefs met in nine of ten years from 2008 to 2017 [103] [104] After a two-year hiatus in the series, four high-profile match-ups occurred between the Bills and Chiefs in 2020 and 2021, including the aforementioned 2020 Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional round game, the latter of which is now considered one of the greatest playoff games of all time, but was also controversial due to the league's overtime rules [105] [106] A rivalry between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has also developed, drawing comparisons to Jim Kelly's rivalry with Dan Marino as well as the rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [107]\n\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, another original franchise in the AFL, have a long history against the Bills, despite the two teams never being in the same division Buffalo currently leads the series 29–24–1, which has included five playoff meetings, three of which were AFL/AFC Championship Games; [99] Kansas City won the 1966 AFL Championship Game that determined the AFL's representative in the first Super Bowl against the NFL champion Green Bay Packers, [100] in addition to the 2020 AFC Championship Game that saw the team advance to its second straight Super Bowl appearance, [101] while Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC Championship Game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance [102] However, after each victory in the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs or the Bills went on to lose the ensuing Super Bowl Despite a lull in the series in the 2000s and 2010s, the rivalry gained attention as the Bills and Chiefs met in nine of ten years from 2008 to 2017 [103] [104] After a two-year hiatus in the series, four high-profile match-ups occurred between the Bills and Chiefs in 2020 and 2021, including the aforementioned 2020 Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional round game, the latter of which is now considered one of the greatest playoff games of all time, but was also controversial due to the league's overtime rules [105] [106] A rivalry between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has also developed, drawing comparisons to Jim Kelly's rivalry with Dan Marino as well as the rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning [107]\n\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nA new rivalry emerged between the Bills and the Jacksonville Jaguars after former Bills head coach Doug Marrone, who had quit the team after the 2014 season, was hired as a coaching assistant for Jacksonville and eventually rose to become the Jaguars' head coach [80] The first game between the Marrone-led Jaguars was a London game in week 7 of the 2015 season, which saw the Jaguars' win 34–31 [108] The most important game of this series was an ugly, low-scoring Wild Card game in 2017 that saw the Jaguars win 10–3 This game is notable as it was the first Bills playoff appearance in 17 seasons [109] Prior to this, Jacksonville had handed Buffalo its first playoff loss in Bills Stadium in 1996 [110] Following the 2017 wild card game the Bills and Jaguars have met three additional times The first was a \"rematch\" game in week 12 of the 2018 season, which saw the Bills win 24–21 During this game, trash talk from former Jaguars players such as Jalen Ramsey resulted in a brawl between the teams [111] [112] [113] The second time was in week 9 of the 2021 season By now, the \"point\" of the rivalry, Marrone's feud with the Bills organization, and the personal drama between Bills and Jaguars players no longer applied as Marrone had been fired and replaced by Urban Meyer and all the players from the 2017 Jaguars team have since moved on to other teams or retired Regardless, this game was the seventh largest upset at the time in NFL history, which saw the 15.5-point favorite Bills lose 9–6 [114] The next time the teams would play would be a monday-night game in 2024 where the bills \"annihilated\" the Jaguars 47-10 [115] The series is currently tied at 10–10 [116]\n\n\nHouston Oilers/Tennessee Titans\nThe Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger Match-ups were intense in the 1990s, with quarterback Warren Moon leading the Oilers against Jim Kelly's Bills [117] After both teams failed to meet the same success in the late 2000s to early 2010s, they have returned to consistent playoff contention since 2017, resulting in several high-profile games as of late [118] Memorable playoff moments between the teams include The Comeback, in which the Frank Reich-led Bills overcame a 35–3 deficit to stun the Oilers 41–38 in 1992, [117] and the Music City Miracle, in which the now-Titans scored on a near-last-minute kickoff return with a controversial lateral pass ruling to beat the Bills 22–16 in 1999 [119] The Music City Miracle was notable for being Buffalo's last playoff appearance until 2017 [120] The Titans currently lead the series 30–20 [121]\n\n\nNotable players\nThe Buffalo Bills have retired three numbers in franchise history: No 12 for Jim Kelly, No 34 for Thurman Thomas, and No 78 for Bruce Smith Although the Bills have retired only three jersey numbers, other numbers are no longer issued or are in reduced circulation [122] [123]\n\n\nRetired numbers\nThe Buffalo Bills have retired three

{"title": "Thermobaric_weapon", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe term thermobaric is derived from the Greek words for 'heat' and 'pressure': thermobarikos (θερμοβαρικός), from thermos (θερμός) 'hot' + baros (βάρος) 'weight, pressure' + suffix -ikos (-ικός) '-ic'.\n\n\nMechanism\nMost conventional explosives consist of a fuel–oxidiser premix, but thermobaric weapons consist only of fuel and as a result are significantly more energetic than conventional explosives of equal weight [7] Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use under water, at high altitude, and in adverse weather They are, however, considerably more effective when used in enclosed spaces such as tunnels, buildings, and non-hermetically sealed field fortifications (foxholes, covered slit trenches, bunkers) [8] [9]\n\n\nFuel–air explosive\nA fuel–air explosive (FAE) device consists of a container of fuel and two separate explosive charges After the munition is dropped or fired, the first explosive charge bursts open the container at a predetermined height and disperses the fuel in a cloud that mixes with atmospheric oxygen (the size of the cloud varies with the size of the munition) The cloud of fuel flows around objects and into structures The second charge then detonates the cloud and creates a massive blast wave The blast wave can destroy reinforced buildings, equipment, and kill or injure people The antipersonnel effect of the blast wave is more severe in foxholes and tunnels and in enclosed spaces, such as bunkers and caves.\n\n\nEffects\nConventional countermeasures such as barriers (sandbags) and personnel armour are not effective against thermobaric weapons [24] A Human Rights Watch report of 1 February 2000 [25] quotes a study made by the US Defense Intelligence Agency:\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe first attempts occurred during the First World War when incendiary shells (in German 'Brandgranate') used a slow but intense burning material, such as tar impregnated tissue and gunpowder dust These shells burned for approximately 2 minutes after the shell exploded and spread the burning elements in every direction [27]\nIn World War II, the German Wehrmacht attempted to develop a vacuum bomb, [28] under the direction of the Austrian physicist Mario Zippermayr [29]\n\n\nGerman\nThe first attempts occurred during the First World War when incendiary shells (in German 'Brandgranate') used a slow but intense burning material, such as tar impregnated tissue and gunpowder dust These shells burned for approximately 2 minutes after the shell exploded and spread the burning elements in every direction [27]\nIn World War II, the German Wehrmacht attempted to develop a vacuum bomb, [28] under the direction of the Austrian physicist Mario Zippermayr [29]\n\n\nUnited States\nFAEs such as first-generation CBU-55 fuel–air weapons saw extensive use in the Vietnam War [32] A second generation of FAE weapons were based on those, and were used by the United States in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm [76] A total of 254 CBU-72s were dropped by the United States Marine Corps, mostly from A-6Es They were targeted against mine fields and personnel in trenches, but were more useful as a psychological weapon.\n\n\nSoviet, later Russian\nFollowing FAEs developed by the United States for use in the Vietnam War, [31] Soviet Union scientists quickly developed their own FAE weapons Since Afghanistan, research and development has continued, and Russian forces now field a wide array of third-generation FAE warheads, [37] such as the RPO-A [38] [39] The Russian armed forces have developed thermobaric ammunition variants for several of their weapons, such as the TBG-7V thermobaric grenade with a lethality radius of 10 m (33 ft), which can be launched from a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) RPG-7 The GM-94 is a 43 mm (1.7 in) pump-action grenade launcher designed mainly to fire thermobaric grenades for close combat The grenade weighed 250 g (8.8 oz) and contained 160 g (5.6 oz) of explosive, its lethality radius is 3 m (9.8 ft), but due to the deliberate \"fragmentation-free\" design of the grenade, a distance of

is derived from the Greek words for 'heat' and 'pressure': thermobarikos (θερμοβαρικός), from thermos (θερμός) 'hot' + baros (βάρος) 'weight, pressure' + suffix -ikos (-ικός) '-ic'.\n\nMechanism\nThermobaric weapons rely on the principle of creating a large amount of heat and pressure by igniting a fuel source, usually a hydrocarbon-based substance, in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. This process creates a massive explosion, often with a blast wave that can cause significant damage to structures and living organisms. Unlike conventional explosives, thermobaric weapons do not require a pre-mix of fuel and oxidizer, making them more energetic and potentially more destructive.\n\nFuel–air explosive\nA fuel–air explosive (FAE) device consists of a container of fuel and two separate explosive charges. After the munition is dropped or fired, the first explosive charge bursts open the container at a predetermined height and disperses the fuel in a cloud that mixes with atmospheric oxygen. The cloud of fuel flows around objects and into structures, increasing the effectiveness of the blast. The second charge then detonates the cloud and creates a massive blast wave, which can destroy reinforced buildings, equipment, and kill or injure people.\n\nEffects\nConventional countermeasures such as barriers (sandbags) and personnel armor are not effective against thermobaric weapons. The use of thermobaric munitions in enclosed spaces, such as tunnels, bunkers, and caves, can have devastating effects on personnel and equipment. The blast wave from a thermobaric explosion can cause significant damage to structures, including reinforced buildings, and can also start fires.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first attempts at developing thermobaric weapons occurred during World War I, when incendiary shells were used to spread fire and create chaos. In World War II, the German Wehrmacht attempted to develop a vacuum bomb, but it was not successful. After the war, the Soviet Union began developing FAE weapons, which were later adopted by other countries, including the United States.\n\nUnited States\nThe United States developed its first FAE weapon, the CBU-55, during the Vietnam War. The CBU-55 was a fuel-air explosive bomb that was used to attack enemy troops and fortifications. The second generation of FAE weapons, the CBU-72, was developed in the 1980s and was used during Operation Desert Storm. The CBU-72 was a more advanced version of the CBU-55 and was capable of creating a larger explosion.\n\nSoviet, later Russian\nThe Soviet Union developed its first FAE weapon, the RPO-A Shmel, in the 1960s. The RPO-A Shmel was a portable thermobaric rocket launcher that was used to attack enemy troops and fortifications. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the Russian military continued to develop and improve thermobaric weapons, including the RPO-A Shmel and the TOS-1 heavy MLRS.\n\nIraq\nIraq was alleged to possess the technology for thermobaric weapons as early as 1990. However, there is no concrete evidence to confirm this claim.\n\nIsrael\nIsrael has been accused of using thermobaric weaponry in the past, including the 2008-2009 conflict in Gaza. However, Israel has not officially confirmed the use of thermobaric munitions.\n\nSpain\nSpain developed its first thermobaric bomb, the BEAC, in the 1980s. The BEAC was a fuel-air explosive bomb that was tested in a foreign location due to safety concerns.\n\nChina\nChina developed its first thermobaric rocket launcher, the PF-97, in the 1990s.

The 120 mm thermobaric round is a fuel-air explosive round that is designed to attack enemy troops and fortifications.\n\nSerbia\nSerbia developed its first thermobaric hand grenade, the TG-1, in the 2010s. The TG-1 is a fuel-air explosive hand grenade that is designed to attack enemy troops and fortifications.\n\nUkraine\nUkraine developed its first thermobaric hand grenade, the RGT-27S2, in the 2010s. The RGT-27S2 is a fuel-air explosive hand grenade that is designed to attack enemy troops and fortifications.\n\nHistory\nMexico, Switzerland, and Sweden presented a joint motion to the United Nations in 1980 to prohibit the use of thermobaric weapons, but it was not successful.\n\nMilitary use\nThermobaric weapons have been used in various military conflicts, including the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the War in Afghanistan. Thermobaric munitions have been used to attack enemy troops and fortifications, as well as to create chaos and destruction.\n\nNon-state actor use\nThermobaric and fuel-air explosives have been used in guerrilla warfare since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing in Lebanon.

aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County [355] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties [356]\n\n\nCrime\nWashington has historically endured high crime, particularly violent offences The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s [361] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but then began to decline, [362] reaching a historic low of 88 in 2012, the lowest total since 1961 [363] In 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015 [364] By 2019, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes declined from their most recent highs in the mid-1990s [365] [better source needed] However, both 2021 and 2022 saw over 200

the District of Columbia, is the capital of the United States of America. It is a federal district located on the east coast of the country, within the District of Columbia. The city is a separate entity from the states and is not part of any state or county. Its unique status is established by Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution.\n\n**History**\n\nThe area now known as Washington, D.C. has been inhabited by various Native American tribes, including the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people, for thousands of years. The Nacotchtank, also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries, maintained settlements around the Anacostia River in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately displaced the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.\n\n**Founding**\n\nNine cities served as capitals to the Continental Congress and under the Articles of Confederation. New York City was the first capital upon the adoption of the Constitution, succeeded by Philadelphia, which was capital from 1790 to 1800. The federal government officially moved to its new capital in 1800, with the city being named in honor of President George Washington.\n\n**Burning during War of 1812**\n\nOn August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, British forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force at Bladensburg. In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas, the British set fire to government buildings in the city, gutting the United States Capitol, the Treasury Building, and the White House in what became known as the burning of Washington. However, a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours. Most government buildings were repaired quickly, but the Capitol, which was largely under construction at the time, would not be completed in its current form until 1868.\n\n**Retrocession and the Civil War**\n\nIn the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria declined economically, due in part to its neglect by Congress. Alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to retake the land it had donated to form the district, a process known as retrocession. In 1846, Congress approved the retrocession, and Alexandria officially became part of Virginia.\n\n**Growth and redevelopment**\n\nBy 1870, the district's population had grown 75% in a decade to nearly 132,000 people, yet the city still lacked paved roads and basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President Ulysses S Grant refused to consider the proposal. The city's infrastructure continued to improve, with the construction of the Washington Aqueduct, which provided a reliable source of water, and the development of the city's street grid.\n\n**Civil rights and home rule era**\n\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president. However, the district still did not have an elected local government, with Congress retaining the power to review and overturn laws created by the council. In 1973, the Home Rule Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia.\n\n**Statehood movement**\n\nSince the 1980s, the D.C statehood movement has grown in prominence. In 2016, a referendum on D.C statehood resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C, voters for it to become the nation's 51st state. The bill would have made D.C into a state with one representative and two senators, with the name Washington, Douglas Commonwealth (thus keeping the same abbreviation Washington, D.C.). The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in 2019 and 2021, but it did not progress in the Senate.\n\n**Geography**\n\nWashington, D.C., is located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S East Coast. The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water. The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland, to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland, to the east; Arlington County, Virginia, to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia, to the south.\n\n**Climate**\n\nWashington's climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: Cfa), or oceanic (Trewartha: Do bordering Cf downtown). Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.\n\n**Cityscape**\n\nWashington, D.C., was a planned city, and many of the city's street grids were developed in that initial plan. In 1791, President George Washington commissioned Pierre Charles L'Enfant, a French-born military engineer and artist, to design the new capital. He enlisted the help of Isaac Roberdeau, Étienne Sulpice Hallet, and Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan. The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThe architecture of Washington, D.C., varies greatly and is generally popular among tourists and locals. Six of the top ten buildings in the American Institute of Architects' ranking of America's Favorite Architecture are in the city: the White House, Washington National Cathedral, the Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, Gothic, and Modern styles are reflected among these six structures and many other prominent edifices in the city.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nThe U.S Census Bureau estimates that the district's population was 705,749 as of July 2019, up more than 100,000 people since the 2010 United States Census. Washington was the 24th-most populous place in the United States as of 2010. According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs boost the district's daytime population past one million. If the district were a state, it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.\n\n**Economy**\n\nAs of 2023, the Washington metropolitan area, including the District of Columbia as well as parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, was one of the nation's largest metropolitan economies. Its growing and diversified economy has an increasing percentage of professional and business service jobs in addition to more traditional jobs rooted in tourism, entertainment, and government.\n\n**Federal government**\n\nAs of July 2022, 25% of people employed in Washington, D.C., were employed by the federal government. Many of the region's residents are employed by companies and organizations that do work for the federal government, seek to influence federal policy, or are otherwise related to its work, including law firms, defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations, many of which have their headquarters in or near the city for proximity to the federal government.\n\n**Diplomacy**\n\nAs the national capital, Washington, D.C hosts about 185 foreign missions, including embassies, ambassador's residences, and international cultural centers. Many are concentrated along a stretch of Massachusetts Avenue known informally as Embassy Row. D.C is consequently one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world; it hosts a number of internationally themed festivals and events, often in collaboration with foreign missions or delegations.\n\n**Research and non-profit organizations**\n\nWashington, D.C, is a prominent center for national and international media. The Washington Post, founded in 1877, is the city's most-read local daily newspaper and one of the preeminent newspapers in the United States. It had the sixth-highest readership of all news dailies in the country in 2011.\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nThere are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district. Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit rail system. The system serves Washington, D.C and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines (each one color coded), 98 stations, and 129 miles (208 km) of track.\n\n**Utilities**\n\nThe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as WASA or D.C Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n**Crime**\n\nWashington has historically endured high crime, particularly violent offenses. The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s. The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but then began to decline, reaching a historic low of 88 in 2012, the lowest total since 1961.\n\n**Sister cities**\n\nWashington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family. Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of cities in the United States by population\n* List of metropolitan areas in the United States\n* List of United States cities by population density\n* List of United States state capitals\n* List of United States cities by area\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the District of Columbia Government\n* Washington, D.C. at Curlie\n* Washington, D.C. travel guide from Wikivoyage\n* Washington, D.C. at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes a neutral, encyclopedic tone.

achievement [298] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development [299]\n\n\nHigher education\nThe University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education [303] Federally chartered universities include American University (AU), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GWU), Georgetown University (GU), and Howard University (HU) Other private universities include the Catholic University of America (CUA), the Johns Hopkins University Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), and Trinity Washington University The Corcoran College of Art and Design, the oldest art school in the capital, was absorbed into the George Washington University in 2014, now serving as its college of arts [304]\n\n\nLibraries\nWashington, D.C., has dozens of public and private libraries and library systems, including the District of Columbia Public Library system [citation needed] Folger Shakespeare Library, a research library and museum located in the

newspaper [citation needed] and one of the preeminent newspapers in the United States [309] It had the sixth-highest readership of all news dailies in the country in 2011 [310] The Post previously also published the Spanish-language newspaper El Tiempo Latino, which it sold to El Planeta Media in 2016 [311]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nThere are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district [322] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead [323] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city [324]\n\n\nTransportation\nThere are 1,500

a 60 percent increase from 2015 Of those miles, 24 miles (39 km) were protected bike lanes It also boasted 62 miles (100 km) of bike trails [328] As of March 2023 [update], the city has 108 miles (174 km) of bike lanes, with 30 miles (48 km) of them protected bike lanes [329]\n\n\nWalkability\nA 2021 study by Walk Score ranked Washington, D.C the fifth-most walkable city in the country According to the study, the most walkable neighborhoods are U Street, Dupont Circle, and Mount Vernon Square [332] In 2013, the Washington Metropolitan Area had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit [333]\n\n\nRiver crossings\nThere are multiple transportation methods to cross the city's two rivers, the Potomac River and the Anacostia River There are numerous bridges that take cars, trains, pedestrians, and bikers across the rivers Among these are Arlington Memorial Bridge, the 14th Street Bridges, Francis Scott Key Bridge, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and Frederick Douglass Bridge [334]\n\n\nRail\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit rail system The system serves Washington, D.C and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines (each one color coded), 98 stations, and 129 miles (208 km) of track [336] Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country and fifth-busiest in North America [337] It operates mostly as a deep-level subway in more densely populated parts of the D.C metropolitan area (including most of the District itself), while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated Metro is known for its iconic brutalist-style vaulted ceilings in the interior stations It is also known for having long escalators in some of its underground stations The longest single-tier escalator in the Western Hemisphere, spanning 230 feet (70 m), is located at Metro's Wheaton station in Maryland [338]\n\n\nBus\nTwo main public bus systems operate in Washington, D.C Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is the primary public bus system in Washington, D.C Serving more than 400,000 riders each weekday, it is one of the nation's largest bus systems by annual ridership [342] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial and touristic areas within central Washington [343] The DC Circulator costs only $1 to ride and is composed of six distinct routes that cover central D.C and suburban Rosslyn, Virginia The DC Circulator is run via a public-private partnership between the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, WMATA, and DC Surface Transit, Inc (DCST) The bus system services each stop approximately every 10 minutes [344]\n\n\nAir\nThree major airports serve the district, though none are within the city's borders Two of these major airports are located in suburban Northern Virginia and one in suburban Maryland The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is located in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the Potomac River about 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Washington, D.C This airport provides primarily domestic flights and has the lowest number of passengers of the three airports in the region The busiest by number of total passengers is Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the city [347] The busiest by international flights and the largest by land size and amount of facilities is Washington Dulles International Airport, located in Dulles, Virginia, about 24 miles (39 km) west of the city [348] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region [349] Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan National Airport is a hub for American Airlines, [350] Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners, [351] and BWI is an operating base for Southwest Airlines [352] In 2018, the Washington, D.C area was the 18th-busiest airport system in the world by passenger traffic, accumulating over 74 million passengers between its three main commercial airports; by 2022 it had climbed to 13th-busiest for passenger traffic, even though passenger numbers decreased to less than 69 million [citation needed]\n\n\nUtilities\nThe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as WASA or D.C Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County [355] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties [356]\n\n\nCrime\nWashington has historically endured high crime, particularly violent offences The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s [361] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but then began to decline, [362] reaching a historic low of 88 in 2012, the lowest total since 1961 [363] In 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015 [364] By 2019, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes declined from their most recent highs in the mid-1990s [365] [better source needed] However, both 2021 and 2022 saw over 200 homicides each, reflecting an upward trends from prior decades [366] In 2023, D.C recorded 274 homicides, a 20-year high and the fifth-highest murder rate among the nation's largest cities [367]\n\n\nSister cities\nWashington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family [377] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy [378] Listed in the order each

His most famous work, \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\" is a masterpiece of modern art that continues to captivate audiences with its serene and enigmatic beauty.\n\n## Biography\n\nGeorges Seurat was born on December 2, 1859, in Paris, France, to Antoine Chrysostome Seurat and Ernestine Faivre. His father was a former legal official who had become wealthy through speculation in property, and his mother was from a middle-class family in Paris. Seurat's family moved to 136 Boulevard de Magenta in 1862 or 1863, where he spent most of his childhood. He had an older brother, Émile Augustin, and an older sister, Marie-Berthe.\n\n## Family and Education\n\nSeurat's father lived in Le Raincy and visited his wife and children once a week at Boulevard de Magenta. Seurat's early education was at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he showed a keen interest in drawing and painting. He later attended the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under the tutelage of Charles Gleyre, a Swiss painter who was a friend of Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\n## Bathers at Asnières\n\nIn 1883, Seurat began working on his first major painting, \"Bathers at Asnières,\" a monumental work that showcased young men relaxing by the Seine in a working-class suburb of Paris. Although influenced by Impressionism, the painting's smooth, simplified textures and carefully outlined, sculptural figures showed the impact of his neoclassical training. The critic Paul Alexis described it as a \"faux Puvis de Chavannes,\" highlighting its departure from the Impressionist ideal.\n\n## A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\n\nIn the summer of 1884, Seurat began working on \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\" a painting that would become his masterpiece. The work showcases a serene and enigmatic scene of Parisians enjoying a leisurely afternoon on an island in the Seine. The painting's innovative use of pointillism created a sense of depth and dimensionality, drawing the viewer's eye into the scene.\n\n## Later Career and Personal Life\n\nSeurat concealed his relationship with Madeleine Knobloch, an artist's model whom he portrayed in his painting \"Jeune femme se poudrant.\" In 1889, she moved in with Seurat in his studio on the seventh floor of 128 bis Boulevard de Clichy. Seurat's later work was characterized by a growing interest in science and technology, particularly in the field of color theory.\n\n## Color Theory\n\nDuring the 19th century, scientist-writers such as Michel Eugène Chevreul, Ogden Rood, and David Sutter wrote treatises on color, optical effects, and perception. These works adapted the scientific research of Hermann von Helmholtz and Isaac Newton into a form accessible to laypeople. Artists followed new discoveries in perception with great interest.\n\n## Language of Color\n\nSeurat took to heart the color theorists' notion of a scientific approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art in the same way that a musician uses counterpoint and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law and set out to prove this conjecture.\n\n## Influence\n\nSeurat's innovative use of pointillism and his emphasis on the scientific application of color had a significant influence on the development of modern art. His work captivated the attention of the Cubists, who were drawn to its flat, linear structures and its use of contrast and irradiation.\n\n## Paintings\n\nFrom 1883 until his death, Seurat exhibited his work at the Salon, the Salon des Indépendants, Les XX in Brussels, the eighth Impressionist exhibition, and other exhibitions in France and abroad. His paintings include \"Bathers at Asnières,\" \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\" and \"The Circus,\" which was left unfinished at the time of his death.\n\n## Drawings\n\nSeurat also exhibited his drawings at various exhibitions during his lifetime. His drawings showcased his skill in capturing the subtleties of human expression and the nuances of everyday life.\n\n## Exhibitions\n\nSeurat's work was exhibited at numerous exhibitions during his lifetime, including the Salon, the Salon des Indépendants, Les XX in Brussels, the eighth Impressionist exhibition, and other exhibitions in France and abroad.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Post-Impressionism\n* Pointillism\n* Color Theory\n* Cubism\n\n## References\n\n* \"Georges Seurat.\" Encyclopedia Britannica.

investigated by both the German police and U.S military police An autopsy at the time of her death concluded Ratliff died from an intra-cerebral hemorrhage secondary to the blood coagulation disorder Von Willebrand's disease, based on blood in her cerebrospinal fluid and reports that she had been suffering severe, persistent headaches in the weeks leading up to her death [citation needed] The coroner determined that the hemorrhage resulted in immediate death, followed by Ratliff falling down the stairs after collapsing The Petersons had dinner with Ratliff and her daughters, and Peterson had stayed and helped Ratliff put the children to bed before going home The children's nanny, Barbara, discovered the body when she arrived the next morning Peterson was the last known person to see her alive.\n\n\nVerdict\nOn October 10, 2003, after one of the longest trials in North Carolina history, a Durham County jury found Peterson guilty of the murder of Kathleen, and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole [12] Denial of parole requires premeditation Despite the jury accepting the murder as a \"spur-of-the-moment\" crime, they also found it was premeditated As one juror explained it, premeditated meant not only planning hours or days ahead but could also mean planning in the seconds before committing a spur-of-the-moment crime [citation needed] Peterson was housed at the Nash Correctional Institution near Rocky Mount until he was released on December 16, 2011 [13]\n\n\nAppeal\nPeterson's appeal was filed by his defense counsel, with Thomas Maher now serving as his court-appointed attorney, and was argued before the North Carolina Court of Appeals on April 18, 2006 On September 19, the Court of Appeals rejected Peterson's arguments that he did not get a fair trial because of repeated judicial mistakes [14] The Appeals' ruling said the evidence was fairly admitted The judges did find defects in a search warrant, but said they had no ill effect on the defense [15] [16] Because the ruling was not unanimous, under North Carolina law, Peterson had the right to appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, which accepted the case An oral argument was heard on September 10, 2007 On November 9, 2007, the Court announced that it affirmed the decision of the appeals Absent a reconsideration of the ruling or the raising of a federal issue, Peterson had exhausted his appeals of the verdict.\n\n\nOwl theory\nIn late 2003, a new theory of Kathleen's death was raised: that she had been attacked by a barred owl outside, had fallen after rushing inside, and had been knocked unconscious after hitting her head on the first tread of the stairs [17] The owl theory was raised by Durham attorney T Lawrence Pollard, a neighbor of the Petersons who was not involved in the case but had been following the public details He approached the police suggesting an owl might have been responsible after viewing the autopsy photographs of Kathleen's head wounds [18]  Later, when reading the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) evidence list, he found a feather listed as found in Kathleen's hair (despite having previously been informed by the District Attorney's office that no feathers had been found during the investigation) [19]  The SBI crime lab report listed a microscopic feather and a wooden sliver from a tree limb entangled in a clump of hair that had been pulled out by the roots found clutched in Kathleen's left hand [20] [21] A re-examination of the hair in September 2008 had found another microscopic feather [22]\n\n\nRetrial hearing\nIn August 2010, following a series of newspaper articles critical of the SBI, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper led an investigation that resulted in the suspension of SBI analyst Duane Deaver, one of the principal witnesses against Peterson, after the report found his work among the worst done on scores of flawed criminal cases Pollard subsequently filed affidavits [a] to support a motion that Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson order the state Medical Examiner's Office to turn over all documentation related to Kathleen's autopsy to Peterson's attorneys However, Judge Hudson barred Pollard from filing further motions on behalf of Peterson because he did not represent him A new motion was filed in August 2010 by David Rudolf, one of Peterson's original attorneys, who acted pro bono in proceedings challenging the SBI testimony [21] [28] [29]\n\n\nAlford plea\nOn February 24, 2017, Peterson entered an Alford plea to the voluntary manslaughter of Kathleen, asserting his innocence but agreeing there was enough evidence to likely result in a guilty verdict [38] The judge sentenced him to a maximum of 86 months in prison, with credit for time previously served Because Peterson had already served more time than the sentence (98.5 months), he did not face additional prison time.\n\n\nMedia\nThe court case

{"title": "Oliver_Cromwell", "content": "\nBiography\nCromwell was born in Huntingdon on 25 April 1599 [5] to Robert Cromwell and his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of William Steward [6] The family's estate derived from Oliver's great-great-grandfather Morgan ap William, a brewer from Glamorgan, Wales, who settled at Putney and married Katherine Cromwell (born 1482), the sister of Thomas Cromwell, who would become the famous chief minister to Henry VIII The Cromwells acquired great wealth as occasional beneficiaries of Thomas's administration of the Dissolution of the Monasteries [7] Morgan ap William was a son of William ap Yevan of Wales The family line continued through Richard Williams (alias Cromwell), (c 1500–1544), Henry Williams (alias Cromwell), (c 1524 – 6 January 1604), [b] then to Oliver's father Robert Williams, alias Cromwell (c 1560–1617), who married Elizabeth Steward (c 1564–1654), probably in 1591 They had ten children, but Oliver, the fifth child, was the only boy to survive infancy [8]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nCromwell married Elizabeth Bourchier (1598–1665) on 22 August 1620 at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street, London [11] Elizabeth's father, Sir James Bourchier, was a London leather-merchant who owned extensive lands in Essex and had strong connections with Puritan gentry families there The marriage brought Cromwell into contact with Oliver St John and leading members of London's merchant community, and behind them the influence of the Earls of Warwick and Holland A place in this influential network proved crucial to Cromwell's military and political career The couple had nine children: [16]\n\n\nCrisis and recovery\nLittle evidence exists of Cromwell's religion in his early years His 1626 letter to Henry Downhall, an Arminian minister, suggests that he had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism [18] But there is evidence that Cromwell underwent a personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the Huntingdonshire county town of Huntingdon Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including valde melancholicus (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor Théodore de Mayerne In 1629, Cromwell became involved in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon involving a new charter for the town As a result, he was called before the Privy Council in 1630 [19]\n\n\nMember of Parliament: 1628–29 and 1640–42\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Parliament of 1628–1629, as a client of the Montagu family of Hinchingbrooke House He made little impression: parliamentary records show only one speech (against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile), which was poorly received [23] After dissolving this Parliament, Charles I ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion in the Bishops' Wars, lack of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640 Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for Cambridge, but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the Short Parliament Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640 [24]\n\n\nEnglish Civil War begins\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the English Civil War Before he joined Parliament's forces, Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642 The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642–43, making up part of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester Cromwell gained experience in successful actions in East Anglia in 1643, notably at the Battle of Gainsborough on 28 July [27] He was subsequently appointed governor of the Isle of Ely [28] and a colonel in the Eastern Association [22]\n\n\nMarston Moor, 1644\nBy the time of the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of lieutenant general of horse in Manchester's army His cavalry's success in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment but returning to help secure the victory [29] After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor, he wrote a famous letter to his brother-in-law Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians but failed to end Royalist resistance [30]\n\n\nBattle of Naseby, 1645\nAt the critical Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry At the Battle of Langport on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress Basing House, later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender [34] He also took part in successful sieges at Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, Devizes, and Winchester, then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in Devon and Cornwall Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the First English Civil War Cromwell and Fairfax took the Royalists' formal surrender at Oxford in June [22]\n\n\nPolitics: 1647–49\nIn February 1647, Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month By the time he recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a Presbyterian settlement of the church Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another The New Model Army, radicalised by Parliament's failure to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in Saffron Walden to negotiate with them, but failed to agree [35]\n\n\nSecond Civil War & King's execution\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by Rowland Laugharne, winning back Chepstow Castle on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of Tenby The castle at Carmarthen was destroyed by burning; the much stronger castle at Pembroke fell only after an eight-week siege Cromwell dealt leniently with ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had formerly been members of the parliamentary army, John Poyer eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots [40]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Commonwealth: 1649\nAfter the King's execution, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller Council of State also having some executive functions Cromwell remained a member of the Rump and was appointed a member of the council In the early months after Charles's execution, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648 Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of civil war in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s Only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament The Royalists, meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as Confederate Catholics In March, the Rump chose Cromwell to command a campaign against them Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied him in the subsequent months In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the New Model Army The Leveller or Agitator movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance These sentiments were expressed in the 1647 manifesto: Agreement of the People Cromwell and the rest of the \"Grandees\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should extend only to the landowners In the Putney Debates of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England Rebellions and mutinies followed the debates, and in 1649, the Bishopsgate mutiny resulted in Leveller Robert Lockyer's execution by firing squad The next month, the Banbury mutiny occurred with similar results Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at Andover and Burford in May, he departed for Ireland from Bristol at the end of July [51]\n\n\nIrish campaign: 1649–50\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649 to 1650 Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649) The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\" [52]\n\n\nScottish campaign: 1650–51\nCromwell left Ireland in May 1650 and several months later invaded Scotland after the Scots had proclaimed Charles I's son Charles II as King Cromwell was much less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War, than he was to Irish Catholics He described the Scots as a people \"fearing His  [God's] name, though deceived\" [64] He made a famous appeal to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, urging them to see the error of the royal alliance—\"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\" [65] The Scots' reply was robust: \"would you have us to be sceptics in our religion?\" This decision to negotiate with Charles II led Cromwell to believe that war was necessary [66]\n\n\nScots proclaim Charles II as king\nCromwell left Ireland in May 1650 and several months later invaded Scotland after the Scots had proclaimed Charles I's son Charles II as King Cromwell was much less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War, than he was to Irish Catholics He described the Scots as a people \"fearing His  [God's] name, though deceived\" [64] He made a famous appeal to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, urging them to see the error of the royal alliance—\"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\" [65] The Scots' reply was robust: \"would you have us to be sceptics in our religion?\" This decision to negotiate with Charles II led Cromwell to believe that war was necessary [66]\n\n\nBattle of Dunbar\nHis appeal rejected, Cromwell's veteran troops went on to invade Scotland At first, the campaign went badly, as Cromwell's men were short of supplies and held up at fortifications manned by Scottish troops under David Leslie Sickness began to spread in the ranks Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from Dunbar However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar, killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of Edinburgh [67] The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us  [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\" [67]\n\n\nBattle of Worcester\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made an attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland Cromwell followed them south and caught them at Worcester on 3 September 1651, and his forces destroyed the last major Scottish Royalist army at the Battle of Worcester Charles II barely escaped capture and fled to exile in France and the Netherlands, where he remained until 1660 [68]\n\n\nReturn to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651–53\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their \"common cause\" Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement According to the parliamentarian lawyer Bulstrode Whitelocke, Cromwell began to contemplate taking the Crown for himself around this time, though the evidence for this is retrospective and problematic [73] Ultimately, he demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government [74] Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\" [75] At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away [76] His troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace [77]\n\n\nEstablishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a \"sanhedrin\" of saints Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs—which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth—he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials In his speech during the assembly on 4 July, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\" [78] The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called Barebone's Parliament after one of its members, Praise-God Barebone, was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined) However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly [79]\n\n\nThe Protectorate: 1653–58\nAfter Barebone's Parliament was dissolved, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals This made Cromwell undertake the \"chief magistracy and the administration of government\" Later he was sworn as Lord Protector on 16 December, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia [80] Cromwell also changed his signature to 'Oliver P', with the P being an abbreviation for Protector, and soon others started to address Cromwell as \"Your Highness\" [81] As Protector, he had to secure a majority vote in the Council of State As the Lord Protector he was paid £100,000 a year (equivalent to £20,500,000 in 2023) [82]\n\n\nDeath and posthumous execution\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and kidney stone disease In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, and it is thought that he may have rejected the only known treatment, quinine, because it had been discovered by Catholic Jesuit missionaries [102] This was followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the Doge of Venice in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death [103] The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter Elizabeth Claypole in August He died at age 59 at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester [104] The night of his death, a great storm swept England and all over Europe [105] The most likely cause of death was sepsis (blood poisoning) following his urinary infection He was buried with great ceremony, at what is now the RAF Chapel, with an elaborate funeral at Westminster Abbey based on that of James I, [106] his daughter Elizabeth also being buried there [107]\n\n\nCharacter assessment\nDuring his lifetime, some tracts painted Cromwell as a hypocrite motivated by power For example, The Machiavilian Cromwell and The Juglers Discovered are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the Levellers after 1647, and both present him as a Machiavellian figure [117] John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in A Warning Piece Discharged, comparing him to Moses rescuing the English by taking them safely through the Red Sea of the civil wars [118] Poet John Milton called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his Sonnet XVI [119]\n\n\nIrish campaign controversy\nThe extent of Cromwell's brutality [132] [133] in Ireland has been strongly debated Some historians argue that Cromwell never accepted responsibility for the killing of civilians in Ireland, claiming that he had acted harshly but only against those \"in arms\" [134] Other historians cite Cromwell's contemporary reports to London, including that of 27 September 1649, in which he lists the slaying of 3,000 military personnel, followed by the phrase \"and many inhabitants\" [135] In September 1649, he justified his sacking of Drogheda as revenge for the massacres of Protestant settlers in Ulster in 1641, calling the massacre \"the righteous judgement of God on these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands with so much innocent blood\" [55] But the rebels had not held Drogheda in 1641; many of its garrison were in fact English royalists On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to Bermuda and Barbados, were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England [136] Some point to his actions on entering Ireland Cromwell demanded that no supplies be seized from civilian inhabitants and that everything be fairly purchased; \"I do hereby warn .. all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy .. as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.\" [137]\n\n\nMilitary assessment\nCromwell was credited for the formation of the New Model Army Partly in response to the failure to capitalise on their victory at Marston Moor, Parliament passed the Self-Denying Ordinance in early 1645 This forced members of the House of Commons and the Lords, such as Manchester, to choose between civil office and military command All of them—except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament—chose to renounce their military positions The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms In April 1645 the New Model Army finally took to the field, with Sir Thomas Fairfax in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command [22]\n\n\nMonuments and posthumous honours\nDuring the opening of the American Revolutionary War in 1776, the Connecticut State Navy commissioned a corvette named the Oliver Cromwell, as one of the first American naval vessels, before being captured in battle in 1779 being renamed HMS Restoration, before being commissioned as HMS Loyalist [163] [164] [165]\n\n\nSee also\n [The Act of Settlement of Ireland], and the parliamentary legislation which

Cromwell\n\nOliver Cromwell was a prominent English politician, military leader, and lawyer who served as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England from 1653 to 1658. He is best known for his role in the English Civil War and his execution of King Charles I in 1649. Cromwell's life and legacy have been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some viewing him as a hero and others as a tyrant.\n\n**Biography**\n\nOliver Cromwell was born on 25 April 1599 in Huntingdon, England, to Robert Cromwell and Elizabeth Steward. His family was of Welsh descent and had acquired significant wealth through their involvement in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Cromwell's great-great-grandfather, Morgan ap William, was a brewer from Glamorgan, Wales, who settled in Putney and married Katherine Cromwell, the sister of Thomas Cromwell, who would become the famous chief minister to Henry VIII.\n\nCromwell's early life was marked by a strong sense of Puritanism, and he was educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He later became a lawyer and was elected to Parliament in 1628, where he served as a client of the Montagu family. However, he made little impression in Parliament, and his only notable speech was against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile.\n\nIn 1640, Cromwell was re-elected to Parliament as a member for Cambridge, but it was short-lived, as the Long Parliament was dissolved. Cromwell then joined the New Model Army, where he quickly rose through the ranks and became a lieutenant general of horse. He played a key role in the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644 and later led the cavalry at the Battle of Naseby in 1645.\n\n**Marriage and Family**\n\nCromwell married Elizabeth Bourchier in 1620, and the couple had nine children together. Elizabeth's father, Sir James Bourchier, was a London leather-merchant who owned extensive lands in Essex and had strong connections with Puritan gentry families. The marriage brought Cromwell into contact with influential networks, which proved crucial to his military and political career.\n\n**Crisis and Recovery**\n\nIn the late 1620s and early 1630s, Cromwell underwent a personal crisis, which some historians attribute to his growing sense of Puritanism. He sought treatment for physical and emotional ailments, including depression, from the Swiss-born doctor Théodore de Mayerne. Cromwell also became involved in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon involving a new charter for the town. He was called before the Privy Council in 1630, but his involvement in the dispute ultimately led to his downfall.\n\n**Member of Parliament: 1628–29 and 1640–42**\n\nCromwell became a member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628–29 and later for Cambridge in 1640–42. He made little impression in Parliament, with only one notable speech against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile. However, his involvement in the New Model Army and his later leadership in the English Civil War would make him a prominent figure in English politics.\n\n**English Civil War begins**\n\nThe failure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the English Civil War. Before he joined Parliament's forces, Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire and later became a full regiment in the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester.\n\n**Marston Moor, 1644**\n\nBy the time of the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of lieutenant general of horse in Manchester's army. His cavalry's success in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory.\n\n**Battle of Naseby, 1645**\n\nAt the critical Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. The Battle of Langport on 10 July saw Cromwell participate in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army.\n\n**Politics: 1647–49**\n\nIn February 1647, Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month. By the time he recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King. A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a Presbyterian settlement of the church. Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism and advocated for a more radical approach.\n\n**Second Civil War & King's execution**\n\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648. Cromwell put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales and later forced the surrender of Pembroke Castle. He dealt leniently with ex-Royalist soldiers but less so with those who had formerly been members of the parliamentary army. John Poyer, a former parliamentary soldier, was eventually executed in London after the drawing of lots.\n\n**Establishment of the Commonwealth: 1649**\n\nAfter the King's execution, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England. The Rump Parliament exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller Council of State also having some executive functions. Cromwell remained a member of the Rump and was appointed a member of the Council.\n\n**Irish campaign: 1649–50**\n\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649 to 1650, where he faced opposition from the Confederate Catholics and English royalists. He was less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War. Cromwell described the Scots as a people \"fearing His name, though deceived.\"\n\n**Battle of Dunbar**\n\nCromwell's veteran troops went on to invade Scotland, and he smashed the main Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar in September 1650. The victory was of such magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us and one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people.\"\n\n**Battle of Worcester**\n\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made an attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland. Cromwell followed them south and caught them at Worcester on 3 September 1651, and his forces destroyed the last major Scottish Royalist army.\n\n**Return to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651–53**\n\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves. Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections and uniting the three kingdoms under one polity. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and Cromwell demanded that they establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army. The Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government, and Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653.\n\n**Establishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653**\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a \"sanhedrin\" of saints. Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs but was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. The Nominated Assembly, or Barebone's Parliament, was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement.\n\n**The Protectorate: 1653–58**\n\nAfter Barebone's Parliament was dissolved, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals. Cromwell was sworn as Lord Protector on 16 December, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia. As Protector, he had to secure a majority vote in the Council of State.\n\n**Death and posthumous execution**\n\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and kidney stone disease. He died at age 59 on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester. The night of his death, a great storm swept England and all over Europe. The most likely cause of death was sepsis (blood poisoning) following his urinary infection.\n\n**Character assessment**\n\nDuring his lifetime, some tracts painted Cromwell as a hypocrite motivated by power. John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in A Warning Piece Discharged, comparing him to Moses rescuing the English by taking them safely through the Red Sea of the civil wars. Poet John Milton called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his Sonnet XVI.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Oliver_Cromwell\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nCromwell was born in Huntingdon on 25 April 1599 [5] to Robert Cromwell and his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of William Steward [6] The family's estate derived from Oliver's great-great-grandfather Morgan ap William, a brewer from Glamorgan, Wales, who settled at Putney and married Katherine Cromwell (born 1482), the sister of Thomas Cromwell, who would become the famous chief minister to Henry VIII The Cromwells acquired great wealth as occasional beneficiaries of Thomas's administration of the Dissolution of the Monasteries [7] Morgan ap William was a son of William ap Yevan of Wales The family line continued through Richard Williams (alias Cromwell), (c 1500–1544), Henry Williams (alias Cromwell), (c 1524 – 6 January 1604), [b] then to Oliver's father Robert Williams, alias Cromwell (c 1560–1617), who married Elizabeth Steward (c 1564–1654), probably in 1591 They had ten children, but Oliver, the fifth child, was the only boy to survive infancy [8]\n\n\nMarriage and family\nCromwell married Elizabeth Bourchier (1598–1665) on 22 August 1620 at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street, London [11] Elizabeth's father, Sir James Bourchier, was a London leather-merchant who owned extensive lands in Essex and had strong connections with Puritan gentry families there The marriage brought Cromwell into contact with Oliver St John and leading members of London's merchant community, and behind them the influence of the Earls of Warwick and Holland A place in this influential network proved crucial to Cromwell's military and political career The couple had nine children: [16]\n\n\nCrisis and recovery\nLittle evidence exists of Cromwell's religion in his early years His 1626 letter to Henry Downhall, an Arminian minister, suggests that he had yet to be influenced by radical Puritanism [18] But there is evidence that Cromwell underwent a personal crisis during the late 1620s and early 1630s In 1628 he was elected to Parliament from the Huntingdonshire county town of Huntingdon Later that year, he sought treatment for a variety of physical and emotional ailments, including valde melancholicus (depression), from the Swiss-born London doctor Théodore de Mayerne In 1629, Cromwell became involved in a dispute among the gentry of Huntingdon involving a new charter for the town As a result, he was called before the Privy Council in 1630 [19]\n\n\nMember of Parliament: 1628–29 and 1640–42\nCromwell became the Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in the Parliament of 1628–1629, as a client of the Montagu family of Hinchingbrooke House He made little impression: parliamentary records show only one speech (against the Arminian Bishop Richard Neile), which was poorly received [23] After dissolving this Parliament, Charles I ruled without a Parliament for the next 11 years When Charles faced the Scottish rebellion in the Bishops' Wars, lack of funds forced him to call a Parliament again in 1640 Cromwell was returned to this Parliament as member for Cambridge, but it lasted for only three weeks and became known as the Short Parliament Cromwell moved his family from Ely to London in 1640 [24]\n\n\nEnglish Civil War begins\nFailure to resolve the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed conflict between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, the beginning of the English Civil War Before he joined Parliament's forces, Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that was meant for the King Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642 The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642–43, making up part of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester Cromwell gained experience in successful actions in East Anglia in 1643, notably at the Battle of Gainsborough on 28 July [27] He was subsequently appointed governor of the Isle of Ely [28] and a colonel in the Eastern Association [22]\n\n\nMarston Moor, 1644\nBy the time of the Battle of Marston Moor in July 1644, Cromwell had risen to the rank of lieutenant general of horse in Manchester's army His cavalry's success in breaking the ranks of the Royalist cavalry and then attacking their infantry from the rear at Marston Moor was a major factor in the Parliamentarian victory Cromwell fought at the head of his troops in the battle and was slightly wounded in the neck, stepping away briefly to receive treatment but returning to help secure the victory [29] After Cromwell's nephew was killed at Marston Moor, he wrote a famous letter to his brother-in-law Marston Moor secured the north of England for the Parliamentarians but failed to end Royalist resistance [30]\n\n\nBattle of Naseby, 1645\nAt the critical Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry At the Battle of Langport on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England In October 1645, Cromwell besieged and took the wealthy and formidable Catholic fortress Basing House, later to be accused of killing 100 of its 300-man Royalist garrison after its surrender [34] He also took part in successful sieges at Bridgwater, Sherborne, Bristol, Devizes, and Winchester, then spent the first half of 1646 mopping up resistance in Devon and Cornwall Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646, effectively ending the First English Civil War Cromwell and Fairfax took the Royalists' formal surrender at Oxford in June [22]\n\n\nPolitics: 1647–49\nIn February 1647, Cromwell suffered from an illness that kept him out of political life for over a month By the time he recovered, the Parliamentarians were split over the issue of the King A majority in both Houses pushed for a settlement that would pay off the Scottish army, disband much of the New Model Army, and restore Charles I in return for a Presbyterian settlement of the church Cromwell rejected the Scottish model of Presbyterianism, which threatened to replace one authoritarian hierarchy with another The New Model Army, radicalised by Parliament's failure to pay the wages it was owed, petitioned against these changes, but the Commons declared the petition unlawful In May 1647 Cromwell was sent to the army's headquarters in Saffron Walden to negotiate with them, but failed to agree [35]\n\n\nSecond Civil War & King's execution\nThe failure to conclude a political agreement with the King led eventually to the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648, when the King tried to regain power by force of arms Cromwell first put down a Royalist uprising in south Wales led by Rowland Laugharne, winning back Chepstow Castle on 25 May and six days later forcing the surrender of Tenby The castle at Carmarthen was destroyed by burning; the much stronger castle at Pembroke fell only after an eight-week siege Cromwell dealt leniently with ex-Royalist soldiers, but less so with those who had formerly been members of the parliamentary army, John Poyer eventually being executed in London after the drawing of lots [40]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Commonwealth: 1649\nAfter the King's execution, a republic was declared, known as the Commonwealth of England The \"Rump Parliament\" exercised both executive and legislative powers, with a smaller Council of State also having some executive functions Cromwell remained a member of the Rump and was appointed a member of the council In the early months after Charles's execution, Cromwell tried but failed to unite the original \"Royal Independents\" led by St John and Saye and Sele, which had fractured during 1648 Cromwell had been connected to this group since before the outbreak of civil war in 1642 and had been closely associated with them during the 1640s Only St John was persuaded to retain his seat in Parliament The Royalists, meanwhile, had regrouped in Ireland, having signed a treaty with the Irish known as Confederate Catholics In March, the Rump chose Cromwell to command a campaign against them Preparations for an invasion of Ireland occupied him in the subsequent months In the latter part of the 1640s, Cromwell came across political dissidence in the New Model Army The Leveller or Agitator movement was a political movement that emphasised popular sovereignty, extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance These sentiments were expressed in the 1647 manifesto: Agreement of the People Cromwell and the rest of the \"Grandees\" disagreed with these sentiments in that they gave too much freedom to the people; they believed that the vote should extend only to the landowners In the Putney Debates of 1647, the two groups debated these topics in hopes of forming a new constitution for England Rebellions and mutinies followed the debates, and in 1649, the Bishopsgate mutiny resulted in Leveller Robert Lockyer's execution by firing squad The next month, the Banbury mutiny occurred with similar results Cromwell led the charge in quelling these rebellions After quelling Leveller mutinies within the English army at Andover and Burford in May, he departed for Ireland from Bristol at the end of July [51]\n\n\nIrish campaign: 1649–50\nCromwell led a Parliamentary invasion of Ireland from 1649 to 1650 Parliament's key opposition was the military threat posed by the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649) The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged to be the biggest single threat facing the Commonwealth However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the Royalist alliance, and Protestant Royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament Cromwell said in a speech to the army Council on 23 March that \"I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and I think of all this is the most dangerous\" [52]\n\n\nScottish campaign: 1650–51\nCromwell left Ireland in May 1650 and several months later invaded Scotland after the Scots had proclaimed Charles I's son Charles II as King Cromwell was much less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War, than he was to Irish Catholics He described the Scots as a people \"fearing His  [God's] name, though deceived\" [64] He made a famous appeal to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, urging them to see the error of the royal alliance—\"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\" [65] The Scots' reply was robust: \"would you have us to be sceptics in our religion?\" This decision to negotiate with Charles II led Cromwell to believe that war was necessary [66]\n\n\nScots proclaim Charles II as king\nCromwell left Ireland in May 1650 and several months later invaded Scotland after the Scots had proclaimed Charles I's son Charles II as King Cromwell was much less hostile to Scottish Presbyterians, some of whom had been his allies in the First English Civil War, than he was to Irish Catholics He described the Scots as a people \"fearing His  [God's] name, though deceived\" [64] He made a famous appeal to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, urging them to see the error of the royal alliance—\"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\" [65] The Scots' reply was robust: \"would you have us to be sceptics in our religion?\" This decision to negotiate with Charles II led Cromwell to believe that war was necessary [66]\n\n\nBattle of Dunbar\nHis appeal rejected, Cromwell's veteran troops went on to invade Scotland At first, the campaign went badly, as Cromwell's men were short of supplies and held up at fortifications manned by Scottish troops under David Leslie Sickness began to spread in the ranks Cromwell was on the brink of evacuating his army by sea from Dunbar However, on 3 September 1650, unexpectedly, Cromwell smashed the main Scottish army at the Battle of Dunbar, killing 4,000 Scottish soldiers, taking another 10,000 prisoner, and then capturing the Scottish capital of Edinburgh [67] The victory was of such a magnitude that Cromwell called it \"A high act of the Lord's Providence to us  [and] one of the most signal mercies God hath done for England and His people\" [67]\n\n\nBattle of Worcester\nThe following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made an attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland Cromwell followed them south and caught them at Worcester on 3 September 1651, and his forces destroyed the last major Scottish Royalist army at the Battle of Worcester Charles II barely escaped capture and fled to exile in France and the Netherlands, where he remained until 1660 [68]\n\n\nReturn to England and dissolution of the Rump Parliament: 1651–53\nCromwell was away on campaign from the middle of 1649 until 1651, and the various factions in Parliament began to fight amongst themselves with the King gone as their \"common cause\" Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and to put in place a broad-brush, tolerant national church However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, but it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or to dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement According to the parliamentarian lawyer Bulstrode Whitelocke, Cromwell began to contemplate taking the Crown for himself around this time, though the evidence for this is retrospective and problematic [73] Ultimately, he demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government in April 1653 of 40 members drawn from the Rump and the army, and then abdicate; but the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government [74] Cromwell was so angered by this that he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force on 20 April 1653, supported by about 40 musketeers Several accounts exist of this incident; in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said \"you are no Parliament, I say you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting\" [75] At least two accounts agree that he snatched up the ceremonial mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the \"bauble\" be taken away [76] His troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace [77]\n\n\nEstablishment of Barebone's Parliament: 1653\nAfter the dissolution of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a \"sanhedrin\" of saints Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs—which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth—he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials In his speech during the assembly on 4 July, Cromwell thanked God's providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: \"truly God hath called you to this work by, I think, as wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time.\" [78] The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called Barebone's Parliament after one of its members, Praise-God Barebone, was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined) However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly [79]\n\n\nThe Protectorate: 1653–58\nAfter Barebone's Parliament was dissolved, John Lambert put forward a new constitution known as the Instrument of Government, closely modelled on the Heads of Proposals This made Cromwell undertake the \"chief magistracy and the administration of government\" Later he was sworn as Lord Protector on 16 December, with a ceremony in which he wore plain black clothing, rather than any monarchical regalia [80] Cromwell also changed his signature to 'Oliver P', with the P being an abbreviation for Protector, and soon others started to address Cromwell as \"Your Highness\" [81] As Protector, he had to secure a majority vote in the Council of State As the Lord Protector he was paid £100,000 a year (equivalent to £20,500,000 in 2023) [82]\n\n\nDeath and posthumous execution\nCromwell is thought to have suffered from malaria and kidney stone disease In 1658, he was struck by a sudden bout of malarial fever, and it is thought that he may have rejected the only known treatment, quinine, because it had been discovered by Catholic Jesuit missionaries [102] This was followed directly by illness symptomatic of a urinary or kidney complaint The Venetian ambassador wrote regular dispatches to the Doge of Venice in which he included details of Cromwell's final illness, and he was suspicious of the rapidity of his death [103] The decline may have been hastened by the death of his daughter Elizabeth Claypole in August He died at age 59 at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester [104] The night of his death, a great storm swept England and all over Europe [105] The most likely cause of death was sepsis (blood poisoning) following his urinary infection He was buried with great ceremony, at what is now the RAF Chapel, with an elaborate funeral at Westminster Abbey based on that of James I, [106] his daughter Elizabeth also being buried there [107]\n\n\nCharacter assessment\nDuring his lifetime, some tracts painted Cromwell as a hypocrite motivated by power For example, The Machiavilian Cromwell and The Juglers Discovered are parts of an attack on Cromwell by the Levellers after 1647, and both present him as a Machiavellian figure [117] John Spittlehouse presented a more positive assessment in A Warning Piece Discharged, comparing him to Moses rescuing the English by taking them safely through the Red Sea of the civil wars [118] Poet John Milton called Cromwell \"our chief of men\" in his Sonnet XVI [119]\n\n\nIrish campaign controversy\nThe extent of Cromwell's brutality [132] [133] in Ireland has been strongly debated Some historians argue that Cromwell never accepted responsibility for the killing of civilians in Ireland, claiming that he had acted harshly but only against those \"in arms\" [134] Other historians cite Cromwell's contemporary reports to London, including that of 27 September 1649, in which he lists the slaying of 3,000 military personnel, followed by the phrase \"and many inhabitants\" [135] In September 1649, he justified his sacking of Drogheda as revenge for the massacres of Protestant settlers in Ulster in 1641, calling the massacre \"the righteous judgement of God on these barbarous wretches, who have imbrued their hands with so much innocent blood\" [55] But the rebels had not held Drogheda in 1641; many of its garrison were in fact English royalists On the other hand, the worst atrocities committed in Ireland, such as mass evictions, killings and deportation of over 50,000 men, women and children as prisoners of war and indentured servants to Bermuda and Barbados, were carried out under the command of other generals after Cromwell had left for England [136] Some point to his actions on entering Ireland Cromwell demanded that no supplies be seized from civilian inhabitants and that everything be fairly purchased; \"I do hereby warn .. all Officers, Soldiers and others under my command not to do any wrong or violence toward Country People or any persons whatsoever, unless they be actually in arms or office with the enemy .. as they shall answer to the contrary at their utmost peril.\" [137]\n\n\nMilitary assessment\nCromwell was credited for the formation of the New Model Army Partly in response to the failure to capitalise on their victory at Marston Moor, Parliament passed the Self-Denying Ordinance in early 1645 This forced members of the House of Commons and the Lords, such as Manchester, to choose between civil office and military command All of them—except Cromwell, whose commission was given continued extensions and was allowed to remain in parliament—chose to renounce their military positions The Ordinance also decreed that the army be \"remodelled\" on a national basis, replacing the old county associations; Cromwell contributed significantly to these military reforms In April 1645 the New Model Army finally took to the field, with Sir Thomas Fairfax in command and Cromwell as Lieutenant-General of cavalry and second-in-command [22]\n\n\nMonuments and posthumous honours\nDuring the opening of the American Revolutionary War in 1776, the Connecticut State Navy commissioned a corvette named the Oliver Cromwell, as one of the first American naval vessels, before being captured in battle in 1779 being renamed HMS Restoration, before being commissioned as HMS Loyalist [163] [164] [165]\n\n\nSee also\n [The Act of Settlement of Ireland], and the parliamentary legislation which succeeded it the

Deadpool films \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool [65] In May 2018, Reynolds said a third Deadpool film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force [66] Reese and his writing partner Paul Wernick said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film

was meeting with Marvel Studios [81] At that time, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and mutants in general would be added to the franchise Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film, [82] including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the Sundance Film Festival, [7] and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\" by Elton John [83] Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a Rashomon–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives [7] [82] He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film [74] [82] In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a Deadpool film at Marvel Studios [84]\n\n\nPre-production\nPre-production work began by October 2022, [120] less than two months after Jackman decided to join the film Jacobson said this was one of the fastest turnarounds she had seen for a big production [82] Filming was expected to begin in January 2023 in Vancouver [121] In mid-October, the film's release date was pushed back to November 8, 2024 [122] Reynolds said the next month that filming would begin in mid-2023, [123] and Levy confirmed in December that filming was set to begin that May He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career, citing the film's self-awareness, violence, and foul language [124] Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise's DNA from the prior films and called the new film \"raw, audacious,  [and] very much R-rated\", comparing it to the buddy comedy films Midnight Run (1988), 48 Hrs., and Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) [125]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on May 22, 2023, in London and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, [144] [145] [146] under the working title Tidal Wave [147] George Richmond served as the cinematographer after working with Levy and Reynolds on Free Guy [148] Reynolds lobbied Marvel Studios to film in Vancouver, where he is from and the previous Deadpool films were made, but conceded that \"they have their  [established] infrastructure, and you just have to sort of fall in line\" [149] However, a United States Copyright Office filing for the film indicated that some filming did occur in Vancouver [150] Levy worked with Marvel Studios and the producers of the Netflix series Stranger Things (2016–present), on which he was an executive producer, to allow him to direct for that series' final season since the schedules for the two projects were expected to overlap [151] [152] Filming was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began in early May, outside of Reynolds being unable to contribute to the script during filming as he had done for the previous films Marvel Studios was reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the film's already scheduled reshoots [153] The film was shot on location where possible, to create a more grounded feeling than can be achieved with soundstages [125] [139] [154] In June, the film's release date was moved forward to May 3, 2024 [155] Filming for a car crash scene took place in London in early July 2023 [156] Shortly after, Jennifer Garner was revealed to be appearing in the film as Elektra Natchios after portraying a version of that character in the Fox-produced film Daredevil (2003) and its spin-off Elektra (2005); [39] Garner denied her involvement [157]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe teaser trailer released in February 2024 revealed that Macfadyen was portraying TVA agent Mr Paradox, [5] [190] Randal Reeder and Lewis Tan were reprising their respective roles as Buck and Rusty / Shatterstar from the previous Deadpool films, [191] [192] and Stanford was returning as Pyro [19] [26] The copyright filing for the film confirmed that Garner was appearing as Elektra and revealed Corrin's role to be Cassandra Nova [19] [150] In March, Vinnie Jones said he was asked to reprise his role as Cain Marko / Juggernaut from The Last Stand in the film, but a deal could not be agreed upon, and Jones said there was not enough budget to create the Juggernaut suit for him to wear on set [193] Juggernaut was subsequently confirmed to appear in the film, being portrayed by Aaron W Reed [5] In addition to Reed's Juggernaut, there were plans to feature a female variant of the character that ultimately did not appear in the film [194] The first official trailer was released the following month and revealed that the creature Alioth from Loki was appearing in the film, along with the characters Lady Deathstrike and Azazel The latter two resembled Kelly Hu and Jason Flemyng, who portrayed those characters in X2 and X-Men: First Class (2011), respectively [14] Lady Deathstrike and Azazel were played by uncredited Jade Lye and Eduardo Gago Munoz in the film [10]\n\n\nMusic\nRob Simonsen was hired to compose the film's score by mid-July 2023 He previously worked with Levy on The Adam Project (2022) and the fourth season of Stranger Things [216] The soundtrack album, also known as Deadpool & Wolverine: Van Jamz, was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 24, 2024, with a physical release on July 26 It includes 17 songs featured in, or inspired by, the film along with \"LFG\" which is Simonsen's main theme for Deadpool & Wolverine [217] [218] Simonsen's score was released digitally on July 24 with a regular album and a deluxe edition that also includes the songs from the soundtrack album [217] An EP, titled Deadpool & Wolverine: Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" EP, featuring \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna as well as remixed versions of the song featured in the film, was released by Warner Records on August 9, 2024 [219] [220]\n\n\nMarketing\nA teaser trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024 Nick Romano from Entertainment Weekly said the trailer confirmed the film's R rating and the fact that Deadpool would be \"infiltrating\" the MCU [117] Austin Goslin of Polygon also highlighted the use of MCU elements and questioned whether Reynolds was playing the same version of Deadpool as he did in the previous films, due to how happy he is at the start of the trailer [221] Wired's Angela Wattercutter noted a sexually explicit pegging joke in the trailer, a first for the MCU Wattercutter speculated that the film could expand upon queer themes previously explored in Loki and the MCU Thor films [222] The trailer's inclusion of the Secret Wars (2015) #5 comic book issue was also discussed, given that Marvel Studios had announced the film Avengers: Secret Wars (2027) [223] [224] [225] Shortly after the trailer's premiere, Jackman posted a tongue-in-cheek jab at Reynolds with a modified logo displaying \"Wolverine & Asshole\" [226] The trailer had 365 million global views in its first 24 hours, surpassing the record of Spider-Man: No Way Home (355.5 million views) to become the most-viewed trailer in that time period [109] The reported views included the 123 million Super Bowl viewers who saw a 30-second version of the trailer [227] Reynolds and Jackman were later presented with Guinness World Records certificates commemorating the achievement during an interview on ITV's This Morning [228]\n\n\nRelease\nDeadpool & Wolverine premiered at the David H Koch Theater in New York City on July 22, 2024 [273] It was released in France, Germany, Italy,

developing two sequels The third film was set to include the superhero team X-Force [61] Deadpool director Tim Miller chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star Ryan Reynolds, and David Leitch was hired to direct Deadpool 2 (2018) in November 2016 Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film [62] In March 2017, Deadpool and Deadpool 2 co-writer Rhett Reese said X-Force would be introduced in Deadpool 2 before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch \"something bigger\", separate from the third Deadpool film, which would be more personal [63] When the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Reynolds's Wade Wilson / Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) This was despite those films being rated PG-13 and the Deadpool films being R-rated [64] Iger said Disney was willing to make R-rated Deadpool films \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\" and said a \"Marvel-R brand\" could be created for characters like Deadpool [65] In May 2018, Reynolds said a third Deadpool film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force [66] Reese and his writing partner Paul Wernick said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was released, similar to the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012) being released between Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013) [67]\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the success of Deadpool (2016), 20th Century Fox began developing

crossover film The Avengers (2012) being released between Iron Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013) [67]\n\n\nDevelopment\nReynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios [81] At that time, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X-Men and mutants in general would be added to the franchise Feige described Reynolds as an \"idea machine\" who pitched many different approaches for the film, [82] including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the Sundance Film Festival, [7] and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to \"I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\" by Elton John [83] Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a Rashomon–style team-up film with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives [7] [82] He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film [74] [82] In December, Reynolds confirmed that the \"whole team\" was actively developing a Deadpool film at Marvel Studios [84]\n\n\nPre-production\nPre-production work began by October 2022, [120] less than two months after Jackman decided to join the film Jacobson said this was one of the fastest turnarounds she had seen for a big production [82] Filming was expected to begin in January 2023 in Vancouver [121] In mid-October, the film's release date was pushed back to November 8, 2024 [122] Reynolds said the next month that filming would begin in mid-2023, [123] and Levy confirmed in December that filming was set to begin that May He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career, citing the film's self-awareness, violence, and foul language [124] Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise's DNA from the prior films and called the new film \"raw, audacious,  [and] very much R-rated\", comparing it to the buddy comedy films Midnight Run (1988), 48 Hrs., and Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987) [125]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on May 22, 2023, in London and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England, [144] [145] [146] under the working title Tidal Wave [147] George Richmond served as the cinematographer after working with Levy and Reynolds on Free Guy [148] Reynolds lobbied Marvel Studios to film in Vancouver, where he is from and the previous Deadpool films were made, but conceded that \"they have their  [established] infrastructure, and you just have to sort of fall in line\" [149] However, a United States Copyright Office filing for the film indicated that some filming did occur in Vancouver [150] Levy worked with Marvel Studios and the producers of the Netflix series Stranger Things (2016–present), on which he was an executive producer, to allow him to direct for that series' final season since the schedules for the two projects were expected to overlap [151] [152] Filming was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began in early May, outside of Reynolds being unable to contribute to the script during filming as he had done for the previous films Marvel Studios was reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the film's already scheduled reshoots [153] The film was shot on location where possible, to create a more grounded feeling than can be achieved with soundstages [125] [139] [154] In June, the film's release date was moved forward to May 3, 2024 [155] Filming for a car crash scene took place in London in early July 2023 [156] Shortly after, Jennifer Garner was revealed to be appearing in the film as Elektra Natchios after portraying a version of that character in the Fox-produced film Daredevil (2003) and its spin-off Elektra (2005); [39] Garner denied her involvement [157]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe teaser trailer released in February 2024 revealed that Macfadyen was portraying TVA agent Mr Paradox, [5] [190] Randal Reeder and Lewis Tan were reprising their respective roles as Buck and Rusty / Shatterstar from the previous Deadpool films, [191] [192] and Stanford was returning as Pyro [19] [26] The copyright filing for the film confirmed that Garner was appearing as Elektra and revealed Corrin's role to be Cassandra Nova [19] [150] In March, Vinnie Jones said he was asked to reprise his role as Cain Marko / Juggernaut from The Last Stand in the film, but a deal could not be agreed upon, and Jones said there was not enough budget to create the Juggernaut suit for him to wear on set [193] Juggernaut was subsequently confirmed to appear in the film, being portrayed by Aaron W Reed [5] In addition to Reed's Juggernaut, there were plans to feature a female variant of the character that ultimately did not appear in the film [194] The first official trailer was released the following month and revealed that the creature Alioth from Loki was appearing in the film, along with the characters Lady Deathstrike and Azazel The latter two resembled Kelly Hu and Jason Flemyng, who portrayed those characters in X2 and X-Men: First Class (2011), respectively [14] Lady Deathstrike and Azazel were played by uncredited Jade Lye and Eduardo Gago Munoz in the film [10]\n\n\nMusic\nRob Simonsen was hired to compose the film's score by mid-July 2023 He previously worked with Levy on The Adam Project (2022) and the fourth season of Stranger Things [216] The soundtrack album, also known as Deadpool & Wolverine: Van Jamz, was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 24, 2024, with a physical release on July 26 It includes 17 songs featured in, or inspired by, the film along with \"LFG\" which is Simonsen's main theme for Deadpool & Wolverine [217] [218] Simonsen's score was released digitally on July 24 with a regular album and a deluxe edition that also includes the songs from the soundtrack album [217] An EP, titled Deadpool & Wolverine: Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" EP, featuring \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna as well as remixed versions of the song featured in the film, was released by Warner Records on August 9, 2024 [219] [220]\n\n\nMarketing\nA teaser trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024 Nick Romano from Entertainment Weekly said the trailer confirmed the film's R rating and the fact that Deadpool would be \"infiltrating\" the MCU [117] Austin Goslin of Polygon also highlighted the use of MCU elements and questioned whether Reynolds was playing the same version of Deadpool as he did in the previous films, due to how happy he is at the start of the trailer [221] Wired's Angela Wattercutter noted a sexually explicit pegging joke in the trailer, a first for the MCU Wattercutter speculated that the film could expand upon queer themes previously explored in Loki and the MCU Thor films [222] The trailer's inclusion of the Secret Wars (2015) #5 comic book issue was also discussed, given that Marvel Studios had announced the film Avengers: Secret Wars (2027) [223] [224] [225] Shortly after the trailer's premiere, Jackman posted a tongue-in-cheek jab at Reynolds with a modified logo displaying \"Wolverine & Asshole\" [226] The trailer had 365 million global views in its first 24 hours, surpassing the record of Spider-Man: No Way Home (355.5 million views) to become the most-viewed trailer in that time period [109] The reported views included the 123 million Super Bowl viewers who saw a 30-second version of the trailer [227] Reynolds and Jackman were later presented with Guinness World Records certificates commemorating the achievement during an interview on ITV's This Morning [228]\n\n\nRelease\nDeadpool &

same.\" [5] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but he turned out to be one of the most difficult characters to cast Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role

sixth grade teacher, Miss Bliss, and had long wanted to make a show about someone like her The series would focus on Miss Carrie Bliss, a recently married sixth grade teacher at the fictional John F Kennedy Junior High School in Indianapolis Though Sandy Duncan was originally considered for the titular role, the series ultimately became a vehicle for British former child star Hayley Mills Veteran

to Good Morning, Miss Bliss and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach The elements featuring the kids had been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens NBC had been losing the high end of their animated audience, kids from ten to twelve, so the idea was to create a live action comedy to air on Saturday mornings, a new idea at the time [15] [8] [16]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe theme song for Saved by the Bell was written by composer Scott Gayle against the implicit instructions of Engel Though Engel had not been able to keep the show from being named Saved by the Bell, he was determined to prevent the phrase from showing up in the theme He gave explicit orders to his team of

Grossman signed Lightfoot to a management contract and secured a recording contract with United Artists. In 1965, Lightfoot's version of \"I'm Not Sayin'\" was released as a single, gaining him exposure and recognition.\n\n**1960s**\n\nThe release of Lightfoot's debut album, \"Lightfoot!,\" in 1966 marked a significant turning point in his career. The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me,\" \"Early Mornin' Rain,\" \"Steel Rail Blues,\" and \"Ribbon of Darkness.\" The album's success led to appearances at the Newport Folk Festival, The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, and New York's Town Hall, further bolstering his reputation.\n\nLightfoot also recorded in the Nashville, Tennessee area at Forest Hills Music Studio during the 1960s. His association with this studio and its owner, Owen Bradley, would lead to a distinctive country-folk sound that would become a hallmark of his music.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s saw Lightfoot sign with Warner Bros./Reprise and score a major hit in the United States with \"If You Could Read My Mind,\" which sold over one million copies by early 1971. The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album \"Sit Down Young Stranger.\" After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title \"If You Could Read My Mind,\" reaching No. 5 nationally and representing a major turning point in Lightfoot's career.\n\n**1980s and 1990s**\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: \"Dream Street Rose\" (1980), \"Shadows\" (1982), \"Salute\" (1983), \"East of Midnight\" (1986), \"Gord's Gold Volume II\" (1988), \"Waiting for You\" (1993), and \"A Painter Passing Through\" (1998).\n\n**2000s**\n\nIn April 2000, Lightfoot taped a live concert in Reno, Nevada, which was broadcast by CBC in October and as a PBS special across the United States. The concert was released as a videotape and DVD in 2001 in Europe and North America, marking the first Lightfoot concert video released.\n\n**2010s and Final Work**\n\nIn February 2010, Lightfoot was the victim of a death hoax originating from Twitter, when then-CTV journalist David Akin posted on Twitter and Facebook that Lightfoot had died. Lightfoot was at a dental appointment at the time the rumors spread and found out when listening to the radio on his drive home.\n\nIn 2012, Lightfoot continued to tour, telling a sold-out crowd at Ottawa's National Arts Centre that he still performs sixty times a year. Lightfoot played two shows at the NAC after his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n**Sound and Legacy**\n\nLightfoot's sound, both in the studio and on tour, was centered on his baritone voice and folk-based twelve-string acoustic guitar. From 1965 to 1970, lead guitarist Red Shea was an important supporting player, with bassists Paul Wideman and John Stockfish filling out the arrangements.\n\nLightfoot's music has had a lasting impact on the folk and country genres, with his poetic lyrics and distinctive sound influencing countless artists. His legacy extends beyond his music, as he has become an iconic figure in Canadian culture, representing the country's rich musical heritage.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nLightfoot was married three times, with his first marriage in April 1963 to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part due to his infidelity.\n\n**Honours and Awards**\n\nAs an individual, apart from various awards associated with his albums and singles, Gordon Lightfoot received sixteen Juno Awards, including top folk singer in 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, top male vocalist in 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, and composer of the year in 1972 and 1976.\n\nLightfoot also received ASCAP awards for songwriting in 1971, 1974, 1976, and 1977, and was nominated for five Grammy Awards. In 1974, Lightfoot's song \"Sundown\" was named pop record of the year by the Music Operators of America. In 1980, he was named Canadian male recording artist of the decade, for his work during the 1970s.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* \"Lightfoot!\" (1966)\n* \"Did She Mention My Name?\" (1968)\n* \"Sunday Concert\" (1969)\n* \"Sit Down Young Stranger\" (1970)\n* \"If You Could Read My Mind\" (1971)\n* \"Old Dan's Records\" (1972)\n* \"Don Quixote\" (1972)\n* \"Summertime Dream\" (1974)\n* \"Cold on the Shoulder\" (1975)\n* \"For You\" (1978)\n* \"Dream Street Rose\" (1980)\n* \"Shadows\" (1982)\n* \"Salute\" (1983)\n* \"East of Midnight\" (1986)\n* \"Gord's Gold Volume II\" (1988)\n* \"Waiting for You\" (1993)\n* \"A Painter Passing Through\" (1998)\n* \"Harmony\" (2004)\n* \"Songs of Gordon Lightfoot\" (2005)\n* \"Live at the Golden 2\" (2007)\n* \"Solo\" (2011)\n* \"Touch the Sky\" (2014)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gordon_Lightfoot\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life, family and education\nLightfoot was born in Orillia, Ontario, on November 17, 1938, [10] [11] to Jessie Vick Trill Lightfoot and Gordon Lightfoot Sr., [10] who owned a local dry cleaning business [12] He was of Scottish descent [13] He had an older sister, Beverley (1935–2017) [14] His mother recognized Lightfoot's musical talent early on and schooled him to become a successful child performer He first performed publicly in grade four, singing the Irish-American lullaby \"Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral\", which was broadcast over his school's public address system [12] during a parents' day event [15]\n\n\nCareer\nTo support himself while in California, Lightfoot sang on demonstration records and wrote, arranged, and produced commercial jingles Among his influences was the folk music of Pete Seeger, Bob Gibson, Ian & Sylvia Tyson, and The Weavers [22] He lived in Los Angeles for a time, but he missed Toronto and returned there in 1960, [23] living in Canada thereafter, though he did much work in the United States, under an H-1B visa [24]\n\n\nBeginnings\nTo support himself while in California, Lightfoot sang on demonstration records and wrote, arranged, and produced commercial jingles Among his influences was the folk music of Pete Seeger, Bob Gibson, Ian & Sylvia Tyson, and The Weavers [22] He lived in Los Angeles for a time, but he missed Toronto and returned there in 1960, [23] living in Canada thereafter, though he did much work in the United States, under an H-1B visa [24]\n\n\n1960s\nIn 1965, Lightfoot signed a management contract with Albert Grossman, [32] who also represented many prominent American folk performers, and signed a recording contract with United Artists who released his version of \"I'm Not Sayin'\" as a single Appearances at the Newport Folk Festival, The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, and New York's Town Hall increased his following and bolstered his reputation 1966 marked the release of his debut album Lightfoot!, which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me\", \"Early Mornin' Rain\", \"Steel Rail Blues\", and \"Ribbon of Darkness\" On the strength of the Lightfoot!

for release in 2008 as the final part of the Rebuild series under the working title Evangelion: Final After delays of the first three films, production on Evangelion: Final formally started in 2009,

smoothly [16]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAnno was very reluctant to return to work on the film in 2016 [25] In 2018, Anno had asked for the opinion of voice actors like Megumi Ogata (Shinji) on how to move the plot forward after 3.0, [26] [27] as he felt he could no longer understand Shinji, and by now, his current self was closer to Gendo than Shinji, and needed Ogata's input on how Shinji could recover after the events of 3.0 Anno felt that at that point the only people who could understand Shinji's feelings were Ogata herself and his personal assistant, Ikki Todoroki [28] Anno himself had intended to go to Paris for Japan Expo 2019, but the film's continuing delays in production prevented him Anno had often visited the film's music composer Shirō Sagisu, who lives half the year in Paris, and wished to pay homage to the city in the opening 10 minutes of the movie, [29] entitled AVANT1 (\"before\" in French), seeking to surpass his earlier depiction in Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water [27] At the event, Ogata also recounted Anno had asked what ending she preferred \"as Shinji\" [27] AVANT1+2, including a further 2 minutes of the opening sequence, was also streamed on Khara's YouTube channel and Japanese Amazon Prime Video for free for two weeks [30]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's theme song is \"One Last Kiss\" The song, performed by Hikaru Utada and co-produced by Utada and A G Cook, was scheduled to be released for digital download on January 24, 2021, and as an extended play CD and LP record featuring remastered versions of the previous Rebuild of Evangelion theme songs on January 27 [93] It was released alongside the film on March 9, 2021, and internationally in the summer [94] Utada noted this was the first time they wrote the song's lyrics based on reading a finished version of the film's script, instead of simply skimming over early rough drafts [95] Anno also directed the music video for the song [96]\n\n\nRelease\nOn July 6, 2019, Khara screened the first ten minutes of the film on Japan Expo in Paris, Anime Expo in Los Angeles and CCG Expo 2019 in Shanghai [102] The film was originally scheduled for release on June 27, 2020 [103]\n\n\nUpdated release\nAn updated version of the film, titled Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, was released in Japanese theaters on June 12, 2021 This version features updated cuts of various scenes while not changing the overall story of the film [113] It also accompanied the distribution of a 36-page booklet called Eva-Extra-Extra, including non-canon illustrations by staff and a prequel manga set before the events of the previous film, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, called Evangelion: 3.0 (-120min.), written by director Kazuya Tsurumaki under Anno's supervision [114] The manga was Anno's initiative, and began production on April 11 [115]\n\n\nHome media\nOn October 4, 2022, Khara announced a home media release for March 8, 2023, on the film's two-year anniversary, titled 3.0+1.11 [122] Its limited edition includes several bonus materials, like a copy of the script signed by Hideaki Anno All editions also accompany a bonus feature short video called Evangelion: 3.0 (-46h), along with a re-release of the manga Evangelion 3.0 (-120 min.) in video format in full color and voiced by the original cast [123] In North America, GKIDS also acquired home media rights to the film, [119] with a

"**Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEvangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time is a 2021 Japanese science fiction film directed by Hideaki Anno, serving as the final installment in the Rebuild of Evangelion series. The film is a culmination of Anno's vision for the series, weaving together the threads of the previous films to create a narrative that is both a standalone story and a fitting conclusion to the Evangelion saga.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn Paris, young crewmembers from the WILLE organization, led by Maya Ibuki, work to restore the city and its defensive systems. Upon being attacked by NERV forces, they are defended by the Wunder fleet and Mari Illustrious Makinami in Unit-08. Mari defeats the attackers, and WILLE restores Paris. The film's plot explores the aftermath of the events of Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, delving into the complexities of Shinji's emotional state and his relationships with those around him.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film boasts an ensemble cast, including Megumi Ogata as Shinji Ikari, Motomu Oyama as Katsuragi, and Ayane Kurose as Mari Illustrious Makinami. The cast's performances bring depth and nuance to the characters, helping to drive the story forward.\n\n**Production**\n\nProduction on Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time formally started in 2009, with a release date expected in 2015. However, the production was plagued by delays, with director and producer Hideaki Anno becoming depressed and announcing that the film would be further delayed to an unknown date. Anno's struggles during this time period were marked by a decline in his mental health, which he has spoken about publicly.\n\n**Development**\n\nAnno was hesitant to return to work on the film in 2016, citing his struggles with depression and anxiety. However, he eventually began working on the film again, seeking input from voice actors like Megumi Ogata on how to move the plot forward. Anno felt that he could no longer understand Shinji's emotions and needed Ogata's input to help him get back into the character's mindset.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's theme song, \"One Last Kiss,\" was performed by Hikaru Utada and co-produced by Utada and A G Cook. The song was released alongside the film on March 9, 2021, and features remastered versions of the previous Rebuild of Evangelion theme songs.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for release on June 27, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was eventually released in Japan on March 8, 2021, earning ¥802,774,200 ($7,387,198) on its first day, outdoing its predecessor by 23.8%. The film grossed ¥3,338,422,400 ($30,596,851) in its first week, ranking No 1 in Japan in its opening week.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nThe film became a major box office success, grossing ¥10.28 billion ($93.67 million) in Japan. The film's box office performance was a significant milestone for the Evangelion franchise, marking the first time that a Japanese film has exceeded ¥10 billion in box office sales.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nJapanese reception has been highly positive, with Japanese academics and critics praising the film as a \"grand masterpiece.\" The film's portrayal of its female characters was also praised by critics, with some considering it a highlight of the film.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nIn February 2022, a collaborative project titled \"Shin Japan Heroes Universe\" was announced, uniting films that Anno had worked on that bear the katakana title \"Shin\" (シン・), such as Shin Godzilla and Shin Ultraman.\n\n**Collaborative Projects**\n\nThe \"Shin Japan Heroes Universe\" project is a joint venture between Khara, Toei Company, Toho Co., Ltd., and Tsuburaya Productions, with the goal of creating a shared universe for the \"Shin\" films. The project is intended for merchandising purposes and will likely involve the creation of new characters and storylines.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEvangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time is a culmination of Hideaki Anno's vision for the Rebuild of Evangelion series, weaving together the threads of the previous films to create a narrative that is both a standalone story and a fitting conclusion to the Evangelion saga.

working title Evangelion: Final After delays of the first three films, production on Evangelion: Final formally started in 2009, [2] with a release date expected in 2015 [6] However, in 2014, following the troubled production of the third film, director and producer Hideaki Anno became depressed and announced that the film would be further delayed to an unknown date, stating publicly in 2015 that he could not work on another film [7] [8] As part of his recovery, Anno had also worked on Studio Ghibli's The Wind Rises under his mentor Hayao Miyazaki [9] [10] Toho (which co-distributes the film in Japan with Toei) also approached Anno with an offer to direct a reboot of its Godzilla film series, Shin Godzilla, which also contributed to the delay on 3.0+1.0 [11] Getting Toei and Toho in the same film had been a long-standing dream of Anno's [12] After Anno formally apologized, animation director Takeshi Honda stated that the last film had resumed development after the production of Shin Godzilla ended in late 2016, [13] [14] [15] with Studio Khara tweeting on April 5, 2017, that development was going smoothly [16]\n\n\nEarly development and delays\nThe film was announced

April 5, 2017, that development was going smoothly [16]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAnno was very reluctant to return to work on the film in 2016 [25] In 2018, Anno had asked for the opinion of voice actors like Megumi Ogata (Shinji) on how to move the plot forward after 3.0, [26] [27] as he felt he could no longer understand Shinji, and by now, his current self was closer to Gendo than Shinji, and needed Ogata's input on how Shinji could recover after the events of 3.0 Anno felt that at that point the only people who could understand Shinji's feelings were Ogata herself and his personal assistant, Ikki Todoroki [28] Anno himself had intended to go to Paris for Japan Expo 2019, but the film's continuing delays in production prevented him Anno had often visited the film's music composer Shirō Sagisu, who lives half the year in Paris, and wished to pay homage to the city in the opening 10 minutes of the movie, [29] entitled AVANT1 (\"before\" in French), seeking to surpass his earlier depiction in Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water [27] At the event, Ogata also recounted Anno had asked what ending she preferred \"as Shinji\" [27] AVANT1+2, including a further 2 minutes of the opening sequence, was also streamed on Khara's YouTube channel and Japanese Amazon Prime Video for free for two weeks [30]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's theme song is \"One Last Kiss\" The song, performed by Hikaru Utada and co-produced by Utada and A G Cook, was scheduled to be released for digital download on January 24, 2021, and as an extended play CD and LP record featuring remastered versions of the previous Rebuild of Evangelion theme songs on January 27 [93] It was released alongside the film on March 9, 2021, and internationally in the summer [94] Utada noted this was the first time they wrote the song's lyrics based on reading a finished version of the film's script, instead of simply skimming over early rough drafts [95] Anno also directed the music video for the song [96]\n\n\nRelease\nOn July 6, 2019, Khara screened the first ten minutes of the film on Japan Expo in Paris, Anime Expo in Los Angeles and CCG Expo 2019 in Shanghai [102] The film was originally

Tsurumaki under Anno's supervision [114] The manga was Anno's initiative, and began production on April 11 [115]\n\n\nHome media\nOn October 4, 2022, Khara announced a home media release for March 8,

Her early interest in acting led her to pursue a career in the performing arts, and she began to develop her skills through various roles in local theater productions.\n\n**Career**\n\nHahn's first appearance on television was in **Hickory Hideout**, a local puppet show for children that aired on WKYC, an NBC owned-and-operated station in Cleveland. This early experience was a significant stepping stone for Hahn, as it introduced her to the world of television and provided her with valuable experience in front of the camera. While attending a festival, she was introduced to creator-producer Tim Kring, who was so impressed with her that he created the character of Lily Lebowski in **Crossing Jordan** specifically for her. The series aired from 2001 to 2007, and Hahn has spoken highly of the opportunity to work on the show, citing it as a significant break in her career.\n\nHahn's experience in **Crossing Jordan** led to further opportunities in television, and she began to appear in guest roles on various shows. Her talent and versatility caught the attention of casting directors, and she soon found herself landing leading roles in film and television. In 2013, Hahn played her first leading role in the comedy-drama film **Afternoon Delight**, which was written and directed by Joey Soloway. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and Hahn's performance earned her a nomination for the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor.\n\n**1999–2012: Early Work**\n\nHahn's early work in television and film was marked by a series of guest roles and small parts. However, her talent and dedication to her craft soon began to pay off, and she landed her first major role in **Crossing Jordan**. This experience proved to be a turning point in her career, as it introduced her to a wider audience and provided her with valuable experience in front of the camera.\n\nIn addition to her work in **Crossing Jordan**, Hahn appeared in a number of other television shows, including **The Office** and **Parks and Recreation**. She also began to make a name for herself in film, appearing in a number of independent movies, including **The Dilemma** and **Bridesmaids**.\n\n**2013–2017: Film and Television Breakthrough**\n\nHahn's breakthrough in film came in 2013 with her starring role in **Afternoon Delight**. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hahn's performance earned her widespread recognition. She followed this up with a number of other notable roles, including **We're the Millers** and **The Secret Life of Walter Mitty**.\n\nIn 2014, Hahn appeared in a number of films, including **Bad Words** and **This Is Where I Leave You**. These roles cemented her position as a leading lady in Hollywood, and she continued to appear in a wide range of films throughout the 2010s.\n\n**2018–present: Focus on Television**\n\nIn 2018, Hahn starred in the drama film **Private Life**, directed by Tamara Jenkins. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and Hahn's performance earned her critical acclaim. She has since appeared in a number of other television shows and films, including **Good Boys** and **The Addams Family**.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHahn is married to actor Ethan Sandler, whom she met at Northwestern University. The couple has two children together, and they currently reside in Los Angeles. Hahn has spoken highly of her husband and children, citing them as a source of inspiration and support throughout her career.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ **Afternoon Delight** (2013)\n\t+ **We're the Millers** (2013)\n\t+ **The Secret Life of Walter Mitty** (2013)\n\t+ **Bad Words** (2014)\n\t+ **This Is Where I Leave You** (2014)\n\t+ **Private Life** (2018)\n* **Television**\n\t+ **Crossing Jordan** (2001-2007)\n\t+ **The Office** (2009)\n\t+ **Parks and Recreation** (2010)\n\t+ **Good Boys** (2019)\n* **Theater**\n\t+ **The Addams Family** (2010)\n* **Discography**\n\t+ **Kathryn Hahn** (2015)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* **Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor** (2013)\n* **Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy** (2014)\n* **Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture** (2014)\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kathryn_Hahn\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nKathryn Marie Hahn was born in Westchester, Illinois, the daughter of Karen (née Bunker) and Bill Hahn [5] [6]\n\n\nCareer\nHahn's first appearance on television was in Hickory Hideout, a local puppet show for children for then-NBC owned-and-operated station WKYC in Cleveland [13] While attending a festival, she was introduced to creator-producer Tim Kring Hahn impressed Kring so favorably that he created the character of Lily Lebowski in Crossing Jordan specifically for her [14] The series aired from 2001 to 2007 Hahn has said of meeting Kring, \"NBC and Tim Kring took a huge leap of faith in casting me To be worked into a show that was in production and on the schedule is an amazing stroke of luck.\" On October 21, 2008, TV Guide reported that Hahn had signed a talent holding deal with Fox [15]\n\n\n1999–2012: Early work\nHahn's first appearance on television was in Hickory Hideout, a local puppet show for children for then-NBC owned-and-operated station WKYC in Cleveland [13] While attending a festival, she was introduced to creator-producer Tim Kring Hahn impressed Kring so favorably that he created the character of Lily Lebowski in Crossing Jordan specifically for her [14] The series aired from 2001 to 2007 Hahn has said of meeting Kring, \"NBC and Tim Kring took a huge leap of faith in casting me To be worked into a show that was in production and on the schedule is an amazing stroke of luck.\" On October 21, 2008, TV Guide reported that Hahn had signed a talent holding deal with Fox [15]\n\n\n2013–2017: Film and television breakthrough\nIn 2013, Hahn played her first leading role, in the comedy-drama film Afternoon Delight, which was written and directed by Joey Soloway The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival [21] For her role, she was nominated for the Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor [22] Later that year, Hahn appeared in the box-office hit We're the Millers, and co-starred in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty In 2014 she starred in the comedy film Bad Words, and the ensemble comedy-drama film This Is Where I Leave You.\n\n\n2018–present: Focus on television\nIn 2018, Hahn starred in the drama film Private Life, directed by Tamara Jenkins She received critical acclaim for her performance [38] [39] [40] She began appearing in television commercials for Chrysler [41]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHahn is married to actor Ethan Sandler, whom she met at Northwestern University [59] They reside in Los Angeles and have two children [14]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTheater\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

they meant for the characters [65] Shakman and Schaeffer watched all the existing MCU footage of Wanda and Vision, including footage that did not make it into the previous MCU films such as unused dailies [98] While exploring this footage, Schaeffer was drawn to mundane character moments such as Wanda and Vision cooking paprikash in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and the two enjoying their time together in Scotland in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) [10]: 29  [83] Schaeffer said there was a wonder and sincerity to the pair, and felt their family dynamic within a sitcom setting would result in a calm, warm feeling despite the ridiculous premise of the series [66]: 45  She found the pair appealing because they are both outsiders who \"find each other They're both different with capital Ds.\" [2]\n\n\nSitcom influences\nShakman and Schaeffer said the series was a \"love letter to the golden age of television\", [2] [65] though it pays tribute to sitcoms from many eras of American television [111] They chose to focus on family sitcoms over other types, such as workplace sitcoms, because the family aspect kept the series centered, [78] and because Wanda is searching for a family after losing her loved ones in the films [101] Schaeffer and Shakman studied past sitcoms to learn their \"trappings and styles\", [2] while avoiding tropes from older sitcoms that would not be acceptable in a modern series [78] Schaeffer, Shakman, and Feige spoke with Dick Van Dyke, the star of the eponymous 1960s sitcom, to learn about the making of that series [2] [65] Other sitcoms that inspired the series include I Love Lucy, My Three Sons, Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Bewitched, [66]: 45  The Brady Bunch, Family Ties, [27] Out of This World, [112] Malcolm in the Middle, [113] Modern Family, and The Office [8] Meta references are made to Full House, which starred Olsen's older sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley [66]: 45  Before they decided to focus on family sitcoms, an episode of the series was developed based on The Mary Tyler Moore Show that would have explored Wanda's work-life balance [40] Olsen said the sitcom decade being explored in each episode, and the tropes from that decade that were highlighted, were chosen to connect to where the characters were in the larger story [83] Each episode was meant to capture key elements of the chosen time period while showing the evolution of sitcoms over time [102] For example, the first episode pays homage to The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Love Lucy from the 1950s and early 1960s, and was meant to have a general 1950s time period [114] The changes between decades are explained in the series by changes within the fictional WandaVision program, which Wanda is initially doing subconsciously when something goes wrong in that reality She later makes these changes consciously Part of Schaeffer's initial pitch for the series was to link the decade changes to xenophobia from the couple's neighbors, as was seen in some of the characters' comic book appearances, with the neighbors becoming more aggressive each decade until they chase Wanda and Vision out of town The relationship with the neighbors was ultimately portrayed in a more subtle way that Schaeffer felt was creepier, with elements of psychological horror [25]\n\n\nCasting\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their respective roles of Wanda and Vision [3] Bettany agreed to join the project after meeting with Feige and D'Esposito, who pitched an \"exciting and bonkers\" idea for his character's return [65] Feige pitched the series to Olsen during negotiations for her to return in Endgame after Wanda's temporary death in Infinity War [119] She was initially hesitant about the move to television, [65] wondering if it was a \"demotion\" from the films, [119] but was excited when she learned of Schaeffer's involvement as well as the comic book storylines that inspired the series [65] Olsen came to see it as her \"wildest screen opportunity yet\" [119]\n\n\nDesign\nWandaVision was the first production to have its digital intermediate (DI) work completed at Marvel Studios' new color department, run by Evan Jacobs Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall began working with that group before filming to determine the look of each sitcom period that the series was trying to replicate [128] Shakman and Hall put together a collection of images from existing shows that influenced the framing, composition, and color of each sitcom setting, [129] and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for each episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color of each episode\", a process that he had previously used for the film Ghost in the Shell (2017) Hall worked with Josh Pines of Technicolor SA to create 23 different lookup tables for translating colors into the final look during the DI process, and worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for each episode matched with his color palettes Shakman said there was a progression of color between each episode of the series, and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Wanda and Vision [129]\n\n\nColors and sets\nWandaVision was the first production to have its digital intermediate (DI) work completed at Marvel Studios' new color department, run by Evan Jacobs Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall began working with that group before filming to determine the look of each sitcom period that the series was trying to replicate [128] Shakman and Hall put

and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Wanda and Vision [129]\n\n\nCostumes\nRubeo said it was rare for a singular piece of media to progress through so many different decades without its characters aging, [67]: 6  and noted that the costumes of the various sitcoms being emulated by the series were not necessarily what was being worn at the time so she was replicating the looks of those series rather than the decades themselves [133] Around 80 percent of the period costumes were made for the series to fit the actors, with the rest bought or rented from \"special  [costume] houses\" and collections that knew of the fabrics used in the 1950s and 1960s and how garments were constructed then [134] Olsen enjoyed exploring how women were viewed in society in each decade through Wanda's costumes [11] Hair stylist Karen Bartek created 22 wigs for the series to represent the different eras from the 1950s to the 1980s, [135] [136] which allowed these different eras to be filmed in one day without needing to re-style the actors' hair [136] Rubeo added an element of teal to each of Dennings' costumes to match the color of the actress's eyes [137]\n\n\nTitles\nThe series' main title sequence was created by Perception, and starts with a \"please stand by\" visual in the style of the episode's sitcom era This is followed by close-ups of footage from the episode on a television screen, which the camera then pushes through to show the RGB pixels that form television images The pixels are rendered as hexagons, as a reference to Wanda's hex abilities and the informal name \"The Hex\" that is given to the sitcom reality The pixels form various elements from the series including Wanda and Vision's house, the baby mobile from the third episode, and the Westview water tower, [143] which is reminiscent of the art style in \"House of M\" [144] [145] [146] The pixels are then disrupted by a single red pixel that represents Wanda's \"world falling apart around her\", before forming two wedding rings at the end of the sequence since the series is \"at its core a love story\" [143] Charles Pulliam-Moore at io9 felt the credits were \"undeniably Marvel in the big screen sense\", despite WandaVision otherwise attempting to embrace its streaming series format [145]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in early November 2019, [148] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, [149] with Shakman directing, [70] and Hall serving as cinematographer [111] [150] The series was filmed under the working title Big Red [149] The actors went through sitcom \"boot camp\" before filming, watching episodes of past sitcoms to help learn the tone and style of each era, [66]: 50  as well as the different approaches to comedy [11] Dialect coach Courtney Young helped the actors speak like people from each era, [98] even noting the manners of each decade [11] Bettany felt the approach to the series was clever since it had to make six hours of content on a budget similar to a two-and-a-half-hour MCU film This included filming content from different episodes at the same time, [111] though Shakman did try to shoot chronologically to aid the actors with the progression through the sitcom eras [10]: 34 \n\n\nEditing\nWhen the production shut down due to the pandemic, Marvel took around a month to figure out the logistics of remote work Post-production then continued on existing footage, [164] which informed Shakman of how to approach a few things differently once filming began again, [10]: 34  though the series was not creatively altered by this [27] Post-production continued after filming resumed, and Shakman said working on every step of the process at once felt \"schizophrenic\" [10]: 34  Tim Roche, Zene Baker, and Nona Khodai served as editors for the series, [67]: 20  [165] and each brought different experience to the project: Baker previously edited Thor: Ragnarok; Khodai previously worked on the superhero series The Boys; and Roche came from a background editing comedy series with no visual effects The editors agreed to treat the series like an MCU film since they knew Marvel Studios would not \"resort to  [standard television series] money-saving tactics for a show like this\", and Baker said editing the series was no different from editing Ragnarok [164]\n\n\nVisual effects\nTara DeMarco served as the visual effects supervisor for WandaVision, with visual effects vendors for the series including Digital Domain, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (MARZ), RISE, Rodeo FX, SSVFX, The Yard VFX, and Zoic Studios [168] The series has 3,010 visual effects shots, [169] more than the 2,496 in Avengers: Endgame, [170] though DeMarco noted that the series is longer than Endgame and that film had a lot of effects that were much more complex than many of those seen in WandaVision [171] The creatives tried to keep the number of visual effects in each episode to a minimum until the 2000s-set episodes where it made sense to allow more prevalent visual effects due to the technology available at the time; [172] each episode has more visual effects shots than the previous one, building up to the \"big Marvel finale\" in the last episode [173] For the first three episodes, contemporary visual effects were used to augment on-set practical effects and replicate other period-specific effects [67]: 8 \n\n\nMusic\nIn January 2020, Christophe Beck announced that he would compose the score for the series, after previously scoring Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp [186] He paid homage to the sitcoms in each time period through his instrumentation, compositional style, and period-specific recording and mixing techniques Earlier episodes feature small orchestral ensembles, with later episodes having more of a rock-pop style, and the music becoming more pervasive as the series progresses [67]: 9  He had hoped to match the spotting of each sitcom era as well, but found that this would not always work due to modern audiences expecting more music than older sitcoms would have included [187] Beck's frequent collaborator Michael Paraskevas composed additional music, as did Alex Kovacs, [188] with Kovacs hired due to his experience with older orchestration techniques and jazz music which Beck found helpful when writing for the series' early episodes Beck was more comfortable once the episodes required music inspired by the 1980s and 1990s [187] To connect the music for the different sitcom eras, as well as the more traditional music for outside the sitcom reality, he composed several themes that are used in the different styles, which was possible since he knew where the series and characters were going from the beginning [67]: 9  [187] He was most excited for the opportunity to write a definitive theme for Wanda that is heard during the series' end credits, which he hoped other composers would reprise for the character's future MCU appearances Beck also wrote a love theme for Wanda and Vision that he said would convey feelings of love, tragedy, and sadness, which he compared to the romance music he composed for the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer [187]\n\n\nMarketing\nDisney's marketing team conceived its campaign for the series roughly a year-and-a-half before its release [206] At the 2019 D23, Olsen confirmed that the series would mix elements of classic sitcoms with the MCU, which was shown in a teaser that combined footage of Wanda and Vision from previous MCU films with images from old sitcoms The Dick Van Dyke Show and Father Knows Best [7] [70] The series was promoted as part of Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019 [63] In December, Feige debuted the first image from the series at Comic Con Experience Vinnie Mancuso of Collider said it was \"very interesting\", highlighting the \"old-school black and white\" coloring [207] A commercial for the series and fellow Marvel Studios Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki was shown during Super Bowl LIV [208] Inverse's Dais Johnston found visual references to past sitcoms in the commercial, including The Dick Van Dyke Show, Leave It to Beaver, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, Roseanne, and Full House They thought the series would be a \"must-see\" for Marvel fans as well as \"anyone looking for a hit of nostalgia: the era-spanning framework means anyone can relive the shows of their childhood\" [209] Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\" [210] Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's \"stole the whole show\" She was most excited by the \"utterly strange and unpredictable looking\" WandaVision footage [211]\n\n\nRelease\nWandaVision premiered on Disney+ on January 15, 2021, with its first two episodes [234] The other seven episodes were released weekly until March 5 [74] [234] Marvel Studios originally planned to release the first three episodes at once, but decided against this because the final episode would not have been completed in time for that release schedule [96] They also considered releasing the entire series at once, but chose weekly releases after seeing the success that the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian had with that approach The episodes were subsequently structured with the weekly release in mind, with Feige explaining that they wanted viewers to try to \"guess what happens next, to have a week speculating or rewatching and building that anticipation\" He felt binge-watching the series after all the episodes were released would be an \"equally fun experience\"

by the series premiere of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in March 2021 [244] When compared to other streaming series in each week of its release, WandaVision did not have the highest number of minutes viewed using Nielsen Media Research's measurements Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt that this could be attributed to WandaVision's weekly release schedule, and opined that Disney accepted this in exchange for the continued discussions and coverage that the weekly release had given to event series such as Game of Thrones and The Mandalorian [245] According to analytics provider TVision, who count U.S viewers on connected televisions who have watched at least two minutes within a session of watching content for at least five minutes, WandaVision was the most viewed title of January 2021

series would have been better suited releasing its episodes all at once as opposed to weekly [249] William Hughes of The A.V Club agreed, believing that the slowly-revealed \"mystery-box\" format was \"in direct opposition to the MCU ethos, which can tolerate a mystery for exactly as long as it takes its antsiest audience member to start to squirm To withhold information—to withhold anything—is counter to what turned these films into a pop culture institution, and that necessity to provide gives WandaVision the sense of a show being pulled in even more directions than its already bifurcated premise might suggest.\" Hughes also felt that the less subtle mystery clues, such as changes in cinematography style, were distracting from the \"legitimately wonderful work  [that the series'] leads are doing in their homage to classic comedy styles\" [263] Miles Surrey, writing for The Ringer, disagreed with Hughes, thinking the series understood the expectations of the audience by explaining the mysteries that the audience was likely already deducing in the fourth episode Surrey added that WandaVision \"isn't really trying to hide what it's about, but that works to the show's advantage The series is getting better—and way creepier—the more it draws the curtain..  [paving] the way for Marvel to make a concerted effort to dabble with horror; at least by the MCU's standards.\" [264]\n\n\nTheories and speculation\nAfter the first three episodes, Iannucci questioned if the series would have been better suited releasing its episodes all at once as opposed to weekly [249] William Hughes of The A.V Club agreed, believing that the slowly-revealed \"mystery-box\" format was \"in direct opposition to the MCU ethos, which can tolerate a mystery for exactly as long as it takes its antsiest audience member to start to squirm To withhold information—to withhold anything—is counter to what turned these films into a pop culture institution, and that necessity to provide gives WandaVision the sense of a show being pulled in even more directions than its already bifurcated premise might suggest.\" Hughes also felt that the less subtle mystery clues, such as changes in cinematography style, were distracting from the \"legitimately wonderful work  [that the series'] leads are doing in their homage to classic comedy styles\" [263] Miles Surrey, writing for The Ringer, disagreed with Hughes, thinking the series understood the expectations of the audience by explaining the mysteries that the audience was likely already deducing in the fourth episode Surrey added that WandaVision \"isn't really trying to hide what it's about, but that works to the show's advantage The series is getting better—and way creepier—the more it draws the curtain..

Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films who had not starred in their own films, such as Wanda Maximoff Actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series, including Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda The series for Disney+ were expected to be six to eight episodes each, have a \"hefty  [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\", and be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, which produced previous MCU television series Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each limited series' development, [55] focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films [56] Brian Chapek, a director of production & development and creative executive at Marvel Studios, began initial work on a Wanda series before co-executive producer Mary Livanos joined the project in mid-2018 and took over the series' development [25] [57] By the end of October, Paul Bettany's Vision was expected to play a significant role in the series, which would focus on the relationship between Wanda and Vision [58] In the following months, the titles Vision and the Scarlet Witch and The Vision and Scarlet Witch were both reported [59] [60] [61]\n\n\nDevelopment\nBy September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for its parent company Disney's streaming service, Disney+, to be centered on supporting

fictional sitcom called WandaVision [78] Schaeffer received comics material and an outline of what Marvel Studios hoped to accomplish so she could help shape their ideas [10]: 28  Feige was visually inspired by Mike del Mundo's \"Norman Rockwell meets Leave it to Beaver\" covers for the comic book series The Vision by Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta, [79] [80] [81] and pitched the series to Olsen and Bettany as a combination of that comic book and the \"House of M\" storyline by Brian Michael Bendis and Olivier Coipel [65] [82] Other inspiration was taken from the Scarlet Witch: Witches' Road trade paperback, [83] the \"Avengers Disassembled\" storyline by Bendis and David Finch that preceded \"House of M\", [81] the \"Vision Quest\" storyline from West Coast Avengers by John Byrne, [84] and the comic book runs of The Vision and the Scarlet Witch by Bill Mantlo and Rick Leonardi, [81] [85] and by Steve Englehart and Richard Howell [81] [86]\n\n\nInception and structure\nMuch of

[86]\n\n\nCharacters and universe\nAfter receiving Marvel Studios' initial ideas for the series, Schaeffer helped figure out what they meant for the characters [65] Shakman and Schaeffer watched all the existing MCU footage of Wanda and Vision, including footage that did not make it into the previous MCU films such as unused dailies [98] While exploring this footage, Schaeffer was drawn to mundane character moments such as Wanda and Vision cooking paprikash in Captain America: Civil War (2016) and the two enjoying their time together in Scotland in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) [10]: 29  [83] Schaeffer said there was a wonder and sincerity to the pair, and felt their family dynamic within a sitcom setting would result in a calm, warm feeling despite the ridiculous premise of the series [66]: 45  She found the pair appealing because they are both outsiders who \"find each other They're both different with capital Ds.\" [2]\n\n\nSitcom influences\nShakman and Schaeffer said the series was a \"love letter to the golden age of television\", [2] [65] though it pays tribute to sitcoms from many eras of American television [111] They chose to focus on family sitcoms over other types, such as workplace sitcoms, because the family aspect kept the series centered, [78] and because Wanda is searching for a family after losing her loved ones in the films [101] Schaeffer and Shakman studied past sitcoms to learn their \"trappings and styles\", [2] while avoiding tropes from older sitcoms that would not be acceptable in a modern series [78] Schaeffer, Shakman, and Feige spoke with Dick Van Dyke, the star of the eponymous 1960s sitcom, to learn about the making of that series [2] [65] Other sitcoms that inspired the series include I Love Lucy, My Three Sons, Father Knows Best, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Bewitched, [66]: 45  The Brady Bunch, Family Ties, [27] Out of This World, [112] Malcolm in the Middle, [113] Modern Family, and The Office [8] Meta references are made to Full House, which starred Olsen's older sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley [66]: 45  Before they decided to focus on family sitcoms, an episode of the series was developed based on The Mary Tyler Moore Show that would have explored Wanda's work-life balance [40] Olsen said the sitcom decade being explored in each episode, and the tropes from that decade that were highlighted, were chosen to connect to where the characters were in the larger story [83] Each episode was meant to capture key elements of the chosen time period while showing the evolution of sitcoms over time [102] For example, the first episode pays homage to The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Love Lucy from the 1950s and early 1960s, and was meant to have a general 1950s time period [114] The changes between decades are explained in the series by changes within the fictional WandaVision program, which Wanda is initially doing subconsciously when something goes wrong in that reality She later makes these changes consciously Part of Schaeffer's initial pitch for the series was to link the decade changes to xenophobia from the couple's neighbors, as was seen in some of the characters' comic book appearances, with the neighbors becoming more aggressive each decade until they chase Wanda and Vision out of town The relationship with the neighbors was ultimately portrayed in a more subtle way that Schaeffer felt was creepier, with elements of psychological horror [25]\n\n\nCasting\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their respective roles of Wanda and Vision [3] Bettany agreed to join the project after meeting with Feige and D'Esposito, who pitched an \"exciting and bonkers\" idea for his character's return [65] Feige pitched the series to Olsen during negotiations for her to return in Endgame after Wanda's temporary death in Infinity War [119] She was initially hesitant about the move to television, [65] wondering if it was a \"demotion\" from the films, [119] but was excited when she learned of Schaeffer's involvement as well as the comic book storylines that inspired the series [65] Olsen came to see it as her \"wildest screen opportunity yet\" [119]\n\n\nDesign\nWandaVision was the first production to have its digital intermediate (DI) work completed at Marvel Studios' new color department, run by Evan Jacobs Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall began working with that group before filming to determine the look of each sitcom period that the series was trying to replicate [128] Shakman and Hall put together a collection of images from existing shows that influenced the framing, composition, and color of each sitcom setting, [129] and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for each episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color of each episode\", a process that he had previously used for the film Ghost in the Shell (2017) Hall worked with Josh Pines of Technicolor SA to create 23 different lookup tables for translating colors into the final look during the DI process, and worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for each episode matched with his color palettes Shakman said there was a progression of color between each episode of the series, and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Wanda and Vision [129]\n\n\nColors and sets\nWandaVision was the first

episode matched with his color palettes Shakman said there was a progression of color between each episode of the series, and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Wanda and Vision [129]\n\n\nCostumes\nRubeo said it was rare for a singular piece of media to progress through so many different decades without its characters aging, [67]: 6  and noted that the costumes of the various sitcoms being emulated by the series were not necessarily what was being worn at the time so she was replicating the looks of those series rather than the decades themselves [133] Around 80 percent of the period costumes were made for the series to fit the actors, with the rest bought or rented from \"special  [costume] houses\" and collections that knew of the fabrics used in the 1950s and 1960s and how garments were constructed then [134] Olsen enjoyed exploring how women were viewed in society in each decade through Wanda's costumes [11] Hair stylist Karen Bartek created 22 wigs for the series to represent the different eras from the 1950s to the 1980s, [135] [136] which allowed these different eras to be filmed in one day without needing to re-style the actors' hair [136] Rubeo added an element of teal to each of Dennings' costumes to match the color of the actress's eyes [137]\n\n\nTitles\nThe series' main title sequence was created by Perception, and starts with a \"please stand by\" visual in the style of the episode's sitcom era This is followed by close-ups of footage from the episode on a television screen, which the camera then pushes through to show the RGB pixels that form television images The pixels are rendered as hexagons, as a reference to Wanda's hex abilities and the informal name \"The Hex\" that is given to the sitcom reality The pixels form various elements from the series including Wanda and Vision's house, the baby mobile from the third episode, and the Westview water tower, [143] which is reminiscent of the art style in \"House of M\" [144] [145] [146] The pixels are then disrupted by a single red pixel that represents Wanda's \"world falling apart around her\", before forming two wedding rings at the end of the sequence since the series is \"at its core a love story\" [143] Charles Pulliam-Moore at io9 felt the credits were \"undeniably Marvel in the big screen sense\", despite WandaVision otherwise attempting to embrace its streaming series format [145]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in early November 2019, [148] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, [149] with Shakman directing, [70] and Hall serving as cinematographer [111] [150] The series was filmed under the working title Big Red [149] The actors went through sitcom \"boot camp\" before filming, watching episodes of past sitcoms to help learn the tone and style of each era, [66]: 50  as well as the different approaches to comedy [11] Dialect coach Courtney Young helped the actors speak like people from each era, [98] even noting the manners of each decade [11] Bettany felt the approach to the series was clever since it had to make six hours of content on a budget similar to a two-and-a-half-hour MCU film This included filming content from different episodes at the same time, [111] though Shakman did try to shoot chronologically to aid the actors with the progression through the sitcom eras [10]: 34 \n\n\nEditing\nWhen the production shut down due to the pandemic, Marvel took around a month to figure out the logistics of remote work Post-production then continued on existing footage, [164] which informed Shakman of how to approach a few things differently once filming began again, [10]: 34  though the series was not creatively altered by this [27] Post-production continued after filming resumed, and Shakman said working on every step of the process at once felt \"schizophrenic\" [10]: 34  Tim Roche, Zene Baker, and Nona Khodai served as editors for the series, [67]: 20  [165] and each brought different experience to the project: Baker previously edited Thor: Ragnarok; Khodai previously worked on the superhero series The Boys; and Roche came from a background editing comedy series with no visual effects The editors agreed to treat the series like an MCU film since they knew Marvel Studios would not \"resort to  [standard television series] money-saving tactics for a show like this\", and Baker said editing the series was no different from editing Ragnarok [164]\n\n\nVisual effects\nTara DeMarco served as the visual effects supervisor for WandaVision, with visual effects vendors for the series including Digital Domain, Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies (MARZ), RISE, Rodeo FX, SSVFX, The Yard VFX, and Zoic Studios [168] The series has 3,010 visual effects shots, [169] more than the 2,496 in Avengers: Endgame, [170] though DeMarco noted that the series is longer than Endgame and that film had a lot of effects that were much more complex than many of those seen in WandaVision [171] The creatives tried to keep the number of visual effects in each episode to a minimum until the 2000s-set episodes where it made sense to allow more prevalent visual effects due to the technology available at the time; [172] each episode has more visual effects shots than the previous one, building up to the \"big Marvel finale\" in the last episode [173] For the first three episodes, contemporary visual effects were used to augment on-set practical effects and replicate other period-specific effects [67]: 8 \n\n\nMusic\nIn January 2020, Christophe Beck announced that he would compose the score for the series, after previously scoring Ant-Man (2015) and Ant-Man and the Wasp [186] He paid homage to the sitcoms in each time period through his instrumentation, compositional style, and period-specific recording and mixing techniques Earlier episodes feature small orchestral ensembles, with later episodes having more of a rock-pop style, and the music becoming more pervasive as the series progresses [67]: 9  He had hoped to match the spotting of each sitcom era as well, but found that this would not always work due to modern audiences expecting more music than older sitcoms would have included [187] Beck's frequent collaborator Michael Paraskevas composed additional music, as did Alex Kovacs, [188] with Kovacs hired due to his experience with older orchestration techniques and jazz music which Beck found helpful when writing for the series' early episodes Beck was more comfortable once the episodes required music inspired by the 1980s and 1990s [187] To connect the music for the different sitcom eras, as well as the more traditional music for outside the sitcom reality, he composed several themes that are used in the different styles, which was possible since he knew where the series and characters were going from the beginning [67]: 9  [187] He was most excited for the opportunity to write a definitive theme for Wanda that is heard during the series' end credits, which he hoped other composers would reprise for the character's future MCU appearances Beck also wrote a love theme for Wanda and Vision that he said would convey feelings of love, tragedy, and sadness, which he compared to the romance music he composed for the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer [187]\n\n\nMarketing\nDisney's marketing team conceived its campaign for the series roughly a year-and-a-half before its release [206] At the 2019 D23, Olsen confirmed that the series would mix elements of classic sitcoms with the MCU, which was shown in a teaser that combined footage of Wanda and Vision from previous MCU films with images from old sitcoms The Dick Van Dyke Show and Father Knows Best [7] [70] The series was promoted as part of Expanding the Universe, a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019 [63] In December, Feige debuted the first image from the series at Comic Con Experience Vinnie Mancuso of Collider said it was \"very interesting\", highlighting the \"old-school black and white\" coloring [207] A commercial for the series and fellow Marvel Studios Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki was shown during Super Bowl LIV [208] Inverse's Dais Johnston found visual references to past sitcoms in the commercial, including The Dick Van Dyke Show, Leave It to Beaver, Bewitched, The Brady Bunch, Roseanne, and Full House They thought the series would be a \"must-see\" for Marvel fans as well as \"anyone looking for a hit of nostalgia: the era-spanning framework means anyone can relive the shows of their childhood\" [209] Julia Alexander of The Verge said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\" [210] Haleigh Foutch at Collider felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's \"stole the whole show\" She was most excited by the \"utterly strange and unpredictable looking\" WandaVision footage [211]\n\n\nRelease\nWandaVision premiered on Disney+ on January 15, 2021, with its first two episodes [234] The other seven episodes were released weekly until March 5 [74] [234] Marvel Studios originally planned to release the first three episodes at once, but decided against this because the final episode would not have been completed in time for that release schedule [96] They also considered releasing the entire series at once, but chose weekly releases after seeing the success that the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian had with that approach The episodes were subsequently structured with the weekly release in mind, with Feige explaining that they wanted viewers to try to \"guess what happens next, to have a week speculating or rewatching and building that anticipation\" He felt binge-watching the series after all the episodes were released would be an \"equally fun experience\" [235]\n\n\nStreaming\nWandaVision premiered on Disney+ on

its opening weekend, ahead of the second season of The Mandalorian, until Disney+ announced that it had been surpassed by the series premiere of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier in March 2021 [244] When compared to other streaming series in each week of its release, WandaVision did not have the highest number of minutes viewed using Nielsen Media Research's measurements Scott Mendelson of Forbes felt that this could be attributed to WandaVision's weekly release schedule, and opined that Disney accepted this in exchange for the continued discussions and coverage that the weekly release had given to event series such as Game of Thrones and The Mandalorian [245] According to analytics provider TVision, who count U.S viewers on connected televisions who have watched at least two minutes within a session of watching content for at least five minutes, WandaVision was the most viewed title of January 2021 across all major U.S streaming and advertising video on demand services The series had an 8,127 indexed audience size, which was 81 times more views than the average series measured by the service [246]\n\n\nAudience viewership\nWandaVision was Disney+'s most-watched series premiere

tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes [247]\n\n\nAnalysis\nAfter the first three episodes, Iannucci questioned if the series would have been better suited releasing its episodes all at once as opposed to weekly [249] William Hughes of The A.V Club agreed, believing that the slowly-revealed \"mystery-box\" format was \"in direct opposition to the MCU ethos, which can tolerate a mystery for exactly as long as it takes its antsiest audience member to start to squirm To withhold information—to withhold anything—is counter to what turned these films into a pop culture institution, and that necessity to provide gives WandaVision the sense of a show being pulled in even more directions than its already bifurcated premise might suggest.\" Hughes also felt that the less subtle mystery clues, such as changes in cinematography style, were distracting from the \"legitimately wonderful work  [that the series'] leads are doing in their homage to classic comedy styles\" [263] Miles Surrey, writing for The Ringer, disagreed with Hughes, thinking the series understood the expectations of the audience by explaining the mysteries that the audience was likely already deducing in the fourth episode Surrey added that WandaVision \"isn't really trying to hide what it's about, but that works to the show's advantage The series is getting better—and way creepier—the more it draws the

[paving] the way for Marvel to make a concerted effort to dabble with horror; at least by the MCU's standards.\" [264]\n\n\nGrief and nostalgia\nTrauma therapist Erin Qualey felt WandaVision was a positive representation of complex mental health issues in media, stating the exploration of Wanda's grief in the series made her \"quickly become one of the most relatable characters on television\" in the COVID-19 era, in which many were living with similar traumas Qualey added, \"By exploring how the process of admitting weakness can become an inherent strength, Wanda's story marks a refreshing, if temporary, departure from the usual comic book formula\", and enjoyed that the series was exploring a person's internal struggles that people could relate to, rather than relying on a catastrophic event or fighting villains for spectacle Speaking to a moment in the eighth episode when Vision likens grief to love persevering, Qualey said it was fantastic that Marvel \"took an earnest pause to convey this sentiment\" [276]\n\n\nAccolades\nWandaVision was nominated for eight Primetime Emmy Awards and fifteen Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards (winning three Creative Arts Emmys), [204] [280] as well as one American Film Institute Award (won), [281] one Annie Award, [282] one Art Directors Guild Award (won), [283] four Critics' Choice Television Awards, [284] one Directors Guild of America Award, [285] two Golden Globe Awards, [286] one Grammy Award, [287] one Hugo Award, [288] one Nebula Award (won), [289] four People's Choice Awards, [290] one Producers Guild of America Award, [291] four TCA Awards, [292] three Visual Effects Society Awards, [293] and one Writers Guild of America Award, among others [294]\n\n\nDocumentary special\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced [300] The series' first special, \"The Making of WandaVision\", explores the making of the series, with Schaeffer, Shakman, Olsen, Bettany, Rupp, Hahn, Parris, Park, Dennings, Peters, and others discussing the classic sitcoms that inspired the series, how the crew emulated the production processes of early sitcoms, and the experience of filming in front of a live studio audience The special was released on Disney+ on March 12, 2021, [301] and will be included as part of the series' home media release on November 28, 2023 [242]\n\n\nFuture\nIn January 2021, Schaeffer said she was unable to talk about any potential plans for a second season, but said the series would feel complete [302] Shakman said there were no plans for a second season and one would only be made if a specific story came about that would warrant it [303] In June 2021, Olsen said WandaVision was a limited series [104]\n\n\nContinuation\nIn January 2021, Schaeffer said she was unable to talk about any potential plans for a second season, but said the series would feel complete [302] Shakman said there were no plans for a second season and one would only be made if a specific story came about that would warrant it [303] In June 2021, Olsen said WandaVision was a limited series [104]\n\n\nSpin-offs\nWandaVision is intended to serve as the start of a trilogy of series that includes Agatha All Along and the untitled Vision series [308]\n\n\nAgatha All Along\nBy October 2021, a \"dark comedy\" spin-off series was in development with Hahn returning to reprise her role as Agatha Harkness and Schaeffer returning as writer and executive producer [309] Schaeffer, who serves as showrunner, [310] also directed episodes of the series, along with Gandja Monteiro and Rachel Goldberg [311] Hahn's involvement was part of a larger deal with Marvel Studios to reprise her role in series and films [312] Marvel Studios officially announced the series in November 2021 [313] Other actors reprising their WandaVision roles include Ford, [314] Rupp, [315] Payton, Lengel, Ali, Glick, Brian Brightman, and Forbes, [311] starring alongside Joe Locke, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, Maria Dizzia, Paul Adelstein, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Okwui Okpokwasili, Patti LuPone, and Aubrey Plaza [310] Rupp described the series as the second season of WandaVision [316] Agatha All Along premiered in September 2024 [317]\n\n\nUntitled Vision series\nBy October 2022, a second spin-off series centered on Bettany's Vision was in development, titled Vision Quest, with Bettany starring and Schaeffer set as head writer [318] [319] Schaeffer was no longer developing Vision Quest by May 2024, due to her focus on Agatha All Along, and Marvel Studios hired Terry Matalas to redevelop the series and serve as its showrunner; Bettany was confirmed to still be reprising his role [320] James Spader reprises his role as Ultron from Avengers: Age of Ultron [308] The series is scheduled to premiere in 2026 [320]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

effects The studio was hired after attempts to create a convincing monster (including Jean-Claude Van Damme wearing a much different body suit) had failed Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on The Terminator [3]\n\n\nFilm portrayals\nJean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast as the Predator; the idea was that the star's abilities in martial arts would make the Predator an agile, ninja-esque hunter.\nWith this first mantis-like costume, Van Damme had to walk on stilts because it had backward-bent reptilian legs and extended arms However, this proved impossible on the muddy slopes of the Mexican jungle [5]\n\n\nSpecial and make-up effects\nThe Predator's blood was made from a combination of the liquid from glow sticks mixed with K-Y Jelly The mixture loses its glow quickly, so new batches had to be quickly made between takes The technique was used in all five films featuring the Predator.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nAs the film series has progressed, the creature's design has been modified in many ways, including differences in skin color and pattern and variations in the design of the masks and armor.\n\n\nAppearance\nBroad concept's the same The difference is, this is a different individual A different individual of the same species As is a snake is a snake, but different snakes are different Their colorings are different, different parts of their characteristics, their facial structures, subtle differences.\n\n\nCulture and history\nThe Predator society builds sophisticated spaceships, yet they should not look as sleek and hi-tech as a Star Wars stormtrooper They are a tribal culture, yet their look should not be as primitive as the orcs from Lord of the Rings They are also a warrior culture, so the ornate cannot conflict with the practical.\n\n\nLanguage\nThe script of the Predators is expressed in the films and other media through written patterns of dashes These written symbols appear on the creatures' gauntlet displays, their helmets, architecture, and many other surfaces The most common vocalizations of the Predators consists of a series of clicks, roars, snarls, and growls which consist of recorded vocalizations of animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, snow leopards, black bears, grizzly bears, dolphins, alligators, camels, and elephants Predators will mimic human language on occasion, and have been shown to use their helmets to understand and speak human languages; [7] [16] some have also learned to speak human languages, even without the use of their helmets as well Author Steve Perry designed a constructed language set for the Aliens vs Predator novel series [24]\n\n\nHistory\nFirst appearing in the 1987 film of the same name, the Predator arrives on Earth via starship to \"hunt\" armed and dangerous human quarry Having landed in a Central American jungle that has had prior visitations, the creature has already killed a squad of U.S Special Forces soldiers before beginning to hunt an elite paramilitary team sent to rescue what they were told are presidential cabinet ministers kidnapped by guerrilla forces The Predator dispatches the team members one by one with its array of weaponry until Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the last one left, unable to escape the area Dutch eventually confronts the creature, after making preparations by covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's thermal imaging, and setting up numerous booby traps Though he manages to disable the Predator's cloaking ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of honor, discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually gets it into a position allowing him to use one of his traps to crush and mortally wound the creature After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator mimics his question and sets off his self-destruct device before imitating Billy Sole's (Sonny Landham) laugh, though Dutch manages to escape the explosion [16]\n\n\nFilm anthology\nFirst appearing in the 1987 film of the same name,

(1990)\nSet in 1997, ten years after the events of the first film, the 1990 sequel follows a new Predator who sets his sights on Los Angeles during the summer due to the heat and fierce, deadly drug wars between Jamaican and Colombian cartels, as well as the L.A.P.D attempting to fight both gangs (promotional material for the film said that this Predator was young and chose a densely populated urban area for a more ambitious hunt) Eliminating gang members from enforcers to leaders, the Predator also targets the L.A.P.D officers attempting to investigate his handiwork, specifically Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) and his three partners (Rubén Blades, María Conchita Alonso and Bill Paxton) Special agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), purportedly sent by the DEA to investigate cartels, but actually part of the secretive Outworld Life Forms task force, attempts to capture the Predator alive for government study, but he and most of his OWLF team are outsmarted and slaughtered by their quarry Towards the end of the movie, the Predator is ultimately confronted by Harrigan in his own ship and killed when Harrigan uses one of his own weapons against him The

north of Antarctica, giving off a \"heat bloom\", attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries Their investigation unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid These events have all been orchestrated by Predators on a Predator mothership arriving in Earth orbit, as the pyramid is an ancient Predator training ground, where three Predators are to now fulfill a rite of passage Descending down to the planet and entering the structure, they kill all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly-formed Aliens, while the explorers inside the pyramid are scattered, those who aren't killed by the Predators being captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos from the eggs of the Alien Queen Two of the Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien As the Aliens threaten to breed out of control, the remaining Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa \"Lex\" Woods (Sanaa Lathan), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb On the surface, they find the Alien Queen has survived and escaped, and are forced to battle against her They defeat the Queen by chaining her to a water tower they topple into the ocean, dragging her down into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator The Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien Chestburster was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.\n\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the Predalien hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of Gunnison, Colorado The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a veteran Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to \"clean up\" the infestation When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures in the sewer, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above, and the Predalien finds an opportunity to breed more drones at a hospital The Predator hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process Over the course of several confrontations with Aliens and subsequently human survivors, the Predator ends up with one working plasma caster that cannot be fired The Predator fixes this by fashioning it into a plasma pistol before losing it, after which human survivors find and use it to help them escape The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US Air Force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the Alien films.\n\n\nPredators (2010)\nIn Predators (which deliberately distances itself from the prior Alien vs Predator films), [25] it is revealed that there are two warring Predator tribes: a group of larger Predators who also make use of quadrupedal hunting beasts and elaborate traps to hunt, and the other group of regular size who hunt traditionally An international group of soldiers and dangerous criminals from different locations on Earth are dropped by the large Predators onto a forested planet they use as a game reserve After numerous skirmishes resulting in the deaths of two Predators and all but two of the group of humans, the last Predator manages to kill a member of his kind from his rival tribe, but is defeated in combat by the human survivors The survivors then head off to seek a way off the planet and back to Earth, just in time to witness more people be dropped.\n\n\nThe Predator (2018)\nContinuing the existence of two Predator species, the film opens with a 'standard' Predator, being pursued through space, coming to Earth After being forced to land in an escape pod it is captured by a government research division known as 'Operation Stargazer' However, it soon escapes to find missing parts of its armor that were taken by army sniper Captain Quinn MacKenna, who encountered the Predator when it landed, and had mailed the items to himself before being detained by the same government program as part of covering the incident up When these parts are discovered by Quinn's autistic son Rory, Rory is able to figure out how to translate the Predator language, just as MacKenna discovers the Predator has escaped and, finding where the armor pieces are, is now hunting his son Joining forces with Doctor Casey Bracket—an evolutionary biologist brought in to study the Predator—and a group of soldiers suffering from various PTSD symptoms that he was being escorted with, MacKenna is able to rescue his son, only to discover the first Predator was being pursued when its pursuer, an alien from its rival tribe, arrives The subsequent fighting results in the death of the first Predator, most of the Stargazer staff and the other soldiers in MacKenna's makeshift unit, but MacKenna, Rory and Casey are able to kill the giant Predator The evidence throughout the film indicates the Predators have begun adapting themselves with human DNA, turning them into the new giant Predators, and intend to take Earth once humanity dies from climate change, and the first Predator was a traitor who came to Earth with a cybernetic suit that would allow humanity to more easily stand up to the Predators.\n\n\nPrey (2022)\nIn the 2022 prequel Prey, a Predator visits Earth in 1719 This Predator relies more on brute force and hand-to-hand combat when engaging its prey, rather than the stealth-based attacks of its later kin Its technology and weaponry reflect this approach, with the alien using more primitive versions of several weapons featured in previous films It eschews plasma-based projectiles in favor of metal spear tips and arrows, and its face mask is of a more bone-like material rather than the smooth steel of later examples of its species The mask functions similarly to those worn by the later visitors to Earth Like its kin, the Predator still adheres to the established honor code, sparing those it doesn't deem a threat.\n\n\nExpanded universe\nIn the Aliens vs Predator novel series (based on the Dark Horse Comics) by David Bischoff, Steve and Stephani Perry, the Predators are

mammals It is also revealed that their blood has the capacity of partially neutralizing the acidity of Alien blood Their religion is partially explored in the series, showing that they are

following this outline:\n\n\nConcept and creation\nThe Predator design is credited to special effects artist Stan Winston While flying to Japan with Aliens director James Cameron, Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, \"I always wanted to see something with mandibles.\" Winston then included them in his designs [3] Stan Winston's studio created all of the physical effects for Predator and Predator 2, creating the body suit for actor Kevin Peter Hall and the mechanical facial effects The studio was hired after attempts to create a convincing monster (including Jean-Claude Van Damme wearing a much different body suit) had failed Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on The Terminator [3]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Predator design is credited to special effects artist Stan Winston While flying to Japan with Aliens director James Cameron, Winston, who had been hired

attempts to create a convincing monster (including Jean-Claude Van Damme wearing a much different body suit) had failed Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on The Terminator [3]\n\n\nFilm portrayals\nJean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast as the Predator; the idea was that the star's abilities in martial arts would make the Predator an agile, ninja-esque hunter.\nWith this first mantis-like costume, Van Damme had to walk on stilts because it had backward-bent reptilian legs and extended arms However, this proved impossible on the muddy slopes of the Mexican jungle [5]\n\n\nSpecial and make-up effects\nThe Predator's blood was made from a combination of the liquid from glow sticks mixed with K-Y Jelly The mixture loses its glow quickly, so new batches had to be quickly made between takes The technique was used in all five films featuring the Predator.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nAs the film series has progressed, the creature's design has been modified in many ways, including differences in skin color and pattern and variations in the design of the masks and armor.\n\n\nAppearance\nBroad concept's the same The difference is, this is a different individual A different individual of the same species As is a snake is a snake, but different snakes are different Their colorings are different, different parts of their characteristics, their facial structures, subtle differences.\n\n\nCulture and history\nThe Predator society builds sophisticated spaceships, yet they should not look as sleek and hi-tech as a Star Wars stormtrooper They are a tribal culture, yet their look should not be as primitive as the orcs from Lord of the Rings They are also a warrior culture, so the ornate cannot conflict with the practical.\n\n\nLanguage\nThe script of the Predators is expressed in the films and other media through written patterns of dashes These written symbols appear on the creatures' gauntlet displays, their helmets, architecture, and many other surfaces The most common vocalizations of the Predators consists of a series of clicks, roars, snarls, and growls which consist of recorded vocalizations of animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, snow leopards, black bears, grizzly bears, dolphins, alligators, camels, and elephants Predators will mimic human language on occasion, and have been shown to use their helmets to understand and speak human languages; [7] [16] some have also learned to speak human languages, even without the use of their helmets as well Author Steve Perry designed a constructed language set for the Aliens vs Predator novel series [24]\n\n\nHistory\nFirst appearing in the 1987 film of the same name, the Predator arrives on Earth via starship to \"hunt\"

of weaponry until Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the last one left, unable to escape the area Dutch eventually confronts the creature, after making preparations by covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's thermal imaging, and setting up numerous booby traps Though he manages to disable the Predator's cloaking ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of honor, discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually gets it into a position allowing him to use one of his traps to crush and mortally wound the creature After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator mimics his question and sets off his self-destruct device before

years after the events of the first film, the 1990 sequel follows a new Predator who sets his sights on Los Angeles during the summer due to the heat and fierce, deadly drug wars between Jamaican and Colombian cartels, as well as the L.A.P.D attempting to fight both gangs (promotional material for the film said that this Predator was young and chose a densely populated urban area for a more ambitious hunt) Eliminating gang members from enforcers to leaders, the Predator also targets the L.A.P.D officers attempting to investigate his handiwork, specifically Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) and his three partners (Rubén Blades, María Conchita Alonso and Bill Paxton) Special agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), purportedly sent by the DEA to investigate cartels, but actually part of the secretive Outworld Life Forms task force, attempts to capture the Predator alive for government study, but he and most of his OWLF team are outsmarted and slaughtered by their quarry Towards the end of the movie, the Predator is ultimately confronted by Harrigan in his own ship and killed when Harrigan uses one of his own weapons against him The Predator's clan-mates de-cloak and

He was of Irish descent, with the majority of his family still residing in Ireland. Cloud had two younger twin sisters, Molly and Fiona. He attended the School of Production Design at Oakland School for the Arts, where he was a classmate of his future Euphoria co-star Zendaya. Cloud said that he suffered \"minor brain damage\" after falling into a construction pit in a poorly-lit street in the downtown area of Oakland in 2013. The accident resulted in a scar on the left side of his head.\n\nCloud's childhood was marked by a creative and artistic upbringing. His parents encouraged his passion for art and music, and he spent much of his free time drawing and painting. Cloud's love for the arts was evident from an early age, and he went on to pursue a career in the field.\n\n## Career\n\nWhile working at Woodlands restaurant close to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, Cloud was scouted by Euphoria casting director Jennifer Venditti. He initially thought she was trying to scam him, but Venditti saw something in Cloud that others did not - a raw talent and a unique charm. Cloud landed the role of Fezco, a kindhearted drug dealer who often provided moral guidance to some of the main characters in the series. The Wall Street Journal described the character as a \"lovable drug dealer.\"\n\nCloud's portrayal of Fezco earned him critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base. He had never acted prior to his role on Euphoria, and his only experience in the field had been when he built sets and worked on lighting and sound for his high school's theatre department. Cloud's transition to acting was seamless, and he quickly became a fan favorite on the show.\n\n## Death\n\nCloud was found dead in his family's house in Oakland, California, on July 31, 2023, at the age of 25. The cause of death was an accidental multiple drug overdose, a lethal mix of methamphetamine, fentanyl, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau told NBC News in September 2023 that Cloud's death was a tragic accident, and that he had been struggling with addiction for some time.\n\nCloud's mother said his last words before his death were \"I love you, mama.\" The news of Cloud's passing sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, and fans and co-stars alike took to social media to pay their respects to the talented young actor.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n* No films have been released featuring Angus Cloud as of yet.\n\n### Television\n\n* Euphoria (2019-2022) - Fezco\n\n### Music Videos\n\n* No music videos have been released featuring Angus Cloud as of yet.\n\n## References\n\nThis article has no references.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Angus Cloud on IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Angus_Cloud\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nConor Angus Cloud Hickey was born on July 10, 1998, and grew up in Oakland, California [1] [2] [3] He was of Irish descent, with the majority of his family still residing in Ireland [2] [4] He had two younger twin sisters, Molly and Fiona [3] [5] [6] He attended the School of Production Design at Oakland School for the Arts, [3] where he was a classmate of his future Euphoria co-star Zendaya [7] Cloud said that he suffered \"minor brain damage\" after falling into a construction pit in a poorly-lit street in the downtown area of Oakland in 2013 The accident resulted in a scar on the left side of his head [8]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile working at Woodlands restaurant close to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, Cloud was scouted by Euphoria casting director Jennifer Venditti; he initially thought she was trying to scam him [9] In the series, he portrayed Fezco, a kindhearted drug dealer who often provided moral guidance to some of the main characters in the series [10] The Wall Street Journal described the character as a \"lovable drug dealer\" [10] His role was expanded in the second season [11] He had never acted prior to his role on Euphoria, his only experience in the field having been when he built sets and worked on lighting and sound for his high school's theatre department [12]\n\n\nDeath\nCloud was found dead in his family's house in Oakland, California, on July 31, 2023 at the age of 25 [11] [15] The cause of death was an accidental multiple drug overdose, [22] a lethal mix of methamphetamine, fentanyl, cocaine, and benzodiazepines, the Alameda County Coroner's Bureau told NBC News in September 2023 His mother said his last words before his death were “I love you, mama.\" [23]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life has been marked by a series of crimes, including murder, theft, and deception, which have made him the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nCharles Sobhraj was born on 6 April 1944, in Saigon, within the Indochinese Union, to an Indian Sindhi father and a Vietnamese mother. His birthplace being a French colonial territory made him eligible for French citizenship. However, Sobhraj's parents were never married, and his father denied paternity. He was taken in by his mother's new husband, a French Army lieutenant stationed in French Indochina. In 1959, his name was entered as Charles Gurmukh Sobhraj in church records. In his new family, he felt neglected in favor of the couple's later children. Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between Southeast Asia and France with the family.\n\n**Murders**\n\nSobhraj's life of crime began in the 1970s, when he started posing as either a gem salesman or a drug dealer to impress and befriend tourists, whom he would defraud. In India, he met Marie-Andrée Leclerc, a tourist from Quebec, Canada, who was looking for adventure. Dominated by Sobhraj, Leclerc became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women. The couple's relationship was marked by a series of crimes, including the murder of two French students, Stefan Rauch and Jayne Seckinger, whom Sobhraj had befriended in Bangkok. Sobhraj and Leclerc were arrested in 1976 and charged with the murders.\n\n**Imprisonment in India**\n\nSobhraj and Leclerc were tried and convicted of the murders of Rauch and Seckinger. Sobhraj was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while Leclerc was sentenced to life imprisonment. During their imprisonment, Sobhraj and Leclerc attempted to extort money from their families by threatening to reveal the location of Sobhraj's hidden treasure. Sobhraj also attempted to bribe his way out of prison by offering gifts to the guards. However, his plan was foiled when one of the guards discovered the hidden gems in Sobhraj's body.\n\n**Imprisonment in Nepal**\n\nSobhraj was released from prison in 1997 and retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris. However, his crimes did not go unnoticed, and he was arrested in Nepal in 2003 on charges of murder and attempted murder. Sobhraj was sentenced to life imprisonment in Nepal, but his sentence was later commuted to 19 years in prison. During his imprisonment, Sobhraj was known for his charm and charisma, and he was even married to an Indian-Nepali interpreter, Nihita Biswas, who was 44 years his junior.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nSobhraj's personal life has been marked by a series of controversies and scandals. In 2010, he married Nihita Biswas, who was 20 years old at the time. The marriage was widely criticized, with many questioning the age difference between the couple. However, Sobhraj's charm and charisma have been known to captivate people, and Biswas has been quoted as saying that his gaze and eyes were mesmerizing. In 2017, Biswas donated blood to save Sobhraj during an open-heart operation.\n\n**Portrayal**\n\nSobhraj has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries, including the 1979 book \"Serpentine\" by Thomas Thompson, the 1980 book \"The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj\" by Richard Neville and Julie Clarke, and the 1989 made-for-TV film \"Shadow of the Cobra\". Sobhraj's charisma and charm have made him a fascinating subject for true crime enthusiasts, and his story has captivated audiences around the world.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj\" by Richard Neville and Julie Clarke\n* \"Serpentine\" by Thomas Thompson\n* \"Great Cases of Interpol\" by Noel Barber\n* \"Shadow of the Cobra\" (1989 made-for-TV film)\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Face of Evil: The True Story of Charles Sobhraj\" by Paul Harrison\n* \"The Charles Sobhraj Story: A True Crime Biography\" by Sudhir Samar\n* \"Charles Sobhraj: The Man Behind the Myth\" by Andrew Lamb\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Charles Sobhraj on Wikipedia\n* Charles Sobhraj on IMDB\n* Charles Sobhraj on True Crime Wiki", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Charles_Sobhraj\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nHotchand Bhawnani Gurmukh Sobhraj was born on 6 April 1944 in Saigon, within the Indochinese Union, to an Indian Sindhi father and Vietnamese mother [12] [13] Sobhraj's birthplace being a French colonial territory made him eligible for French citizenship [14] His parents were never married and his father denied paternity [14] Sobhraj was taken in by his mother's new husband, a French Army lieutenant stationed in French Indochina His name was entered as Charles Gurmukh Sobhraj in church records in 1959 [13] In his new family, he felt neglected in favour of the couple's later children Sobhraj continued to move back and forth between Southeast Asia and France with the family.\n\n\nMurders\nOn the run, Sobhraj financed his lifestyle by posing as either a gem salesman or drug dealer to impress and befriend tourists, whom he defrauded In India, Sobhraj met Marie-Andrée Leclerc from Lévis, Quebec, a tourist looking for adventure Dominated by Sobhraj, Leclerc became his most devoted follower, turning a blind eye to his crimes and his philandering with local women.\n\n\nImprisonment in India\nSmith and Eather attempted suicide in prison during the two years before their trial Sobhraj, who had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in bribing captors, was living comfortably in jail He turned his trial into a spectacle, hiring and firing lawyers at will, bringing in his recently paroled brother André to assist, and eventually going on a hunger strike He was sentenced to 12 years in prison Leclerc was found guilty of drugging the French students but was later paroled and returned to Canada when she developed ovarian cancer She was still claiming her innocence and was reportedly still loyal to Sobhraj when she died at her home in April 1984 She was 38 [17] [13]\n\n\nImprisonment in Nepal\nSobhraj retired to a comfortable life in suburban Paris He charged large sums of money for interviews and photographs The rights to a film based on his life were sold for over US$15 million [14]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, he married his Indian-Nepali interpreter, Nihita Biswas, in prison The daughter of his lawyer, she was 20 years old and 44 years his junior One of the prison staff told Paris Match in 2021: \"It's a legend; there is no proof of their union\" She told the media that his gaze and his eyes were mesmerizing and that his French charm had done everything In 2017, she donated blood to save him during an open-heart operation [41]\n\n\nPortrayal\nSobhraj has been the subject of three non-fiction books, Serpentine (1979) by Thomas Thompson, [42] The Life and Crimes of Charles Sobhraj (1980) by Richard Neville and Julie Clarke, [43] and the section titled \"The Bikini Murders\" by Noel Barber in the Reader's Digest collection Great Cases of Interpol (1982) Neville and Clarke's book was the basis for a 1989 made-for-TV film, Shadow of the Cobra [44]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Warren_Buffett", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nWarren Edward Buffett was born on August 30, 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, as the second of three children and the only son of Leila (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett [11] He began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and graduated from what was then Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: \"likes math; a future stockbroker\" [12] After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business but was overruled by his father [13] [14]\n\n\nBusiness career\nBuffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at his father's firm, Buffett-Falk & Co., as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at several investment partnerships as the general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\n\nEarly business career\nBuffett worked from 1951 to 1954 at his father's firm, Buffett-Falk & Co., as an investment salesman; from 1954 to 1956 at Graham-Newman Corp as a securities analyst; from 1956 to 1969 at several investment partnerships as the general partner; and from 1970 as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\n\nAssuming Berkshire\nIn 1962, Buffett became a millionaire with the success of his partnerships, which by then had grown to 11 entities and held in excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett At the start of the year, he merged the various partnerships into the single entity Buffett Partnership, Ltd., which would be his primary investment vehicle for the remainder of the decade [37] Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing company, Berkshire Hathaway He began buying shares in Berkshire from Seabury Stanton, the owner, whom he later fired Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had working capital of $19 per share This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment) Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade [38] He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold.\n\n\nAs a billionaire\nIn 1998 Buffett acquired General Re (Gen Re) as a subsidiary in a deal that presented difficulties — according to the Rational Walk investment website, \"underwriting standards proved to be inadequate\", while a \"problematic derivatives book\" was resolved after numerous years and a significant loss [46] Gen Re later provided reinsurance after Buffett became involved with Maurice R Greenberg at AIG in 2002 [47]\n\n\n2007–08 financial crisis\nBuffett ran into criticism during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, part of the Great Recession starting in 2007, that he had allocated capital too early resulting in suboptimal deals [52] \"Buy American I am.\" he wrote for an opinion piece published in the New York Times in 2008 [53] Buffett called the downturn in the financial sector that started in 2007 \"poetic justice\" [54] Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway suffered a 77% drop in earnings during Q3 2008 and several of his later deals suffered large mark-to-market losses [55]\n\n\nA capitalized Berkshire\nIn 2009, Buffett invested $2.6 billion as a part of Swiss Re's campaign to raise equity capital [68] [69] Berkshire Hathaway already owned a 3% stake, with rights to own more than 20% [70] Also in 2009, Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp for $34 billion in cash and stock Alice Schroeder, author of Snowball, said that a key reason for the purchase was to diversify Berkshire Hathaway from the financial industry [71] Measured by market capitalization in the Financial Times Global 500, Berkshire Hathaway was the eighteenth largest corporation in the world as of June 2009 [72]\n\n\nInvestment philosophy\nBuffett's writings include his annual reports and various articles Buffett is recognized by communicators [90] as a great story-teller, as evidenced by his annual letters to shareholders He has warned about the pernicious effects of inflation: [91]\n\n\nIndex funds vis-à-vis active management\nBuffett has been a supporter of index funds for people who are either not interested in managing their own money or do not have the time Buffett is skeptical that active management can outperform the market in the long run, and has advised both individual and institutional investors to move their money to low-cost index funds that track broad, diversified stock market indices Buffett said in one of his letters to shareholders that \"when trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients\" [94] In 2007, Buffett made a bet with numerous managers that a simple S&P 500 index fund will outperform hedge funds that charge exorbitant fees By 2017, the index fund was outperforming every hedge fund that made the bet against Buffett [94]\n\n\nUsing investment banks\nBuffet has a long-standing aversion to using the services of investment banks via Berkshire Hathaway [95] This dynamic was also reported in Barron's, [96] Insider, [97] and Seeking Alpha, [98] among others.\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1949, Buffett developed a crush on a young woman whose boyfriend had a ukulele In an attempt to compete, he bought one of the instruments and has been playing it ever since Though the attempt to capture her attention was unsuccessful, his music interest became a key part of his becoming a part of Susan Thompson's life, and led to their marriage Buffett often plays the instrument at stockholder meetings and other opportunities His love of the instrument led to the commissioning of two custom Dairy Queen ukuleles by Dave Talsma, one of which was auctioned for charity [99]\n\n\nHealth\nBuffett is a teetotaler [142] On April 11, 2012, Buffett was diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer during a routine test [143] He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said he felt \"great—as if I were in my normal excellent health—and my energy level is 100 percent\" [143] On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying \"it's a great day for me\" and \"I am so glad to say that's over\" [144]\n\n\nWealth and philanthropy\n In 2008, Buffett was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of approximately $62 billion [145] In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, he was ranked as the second richest man in the United States with a net worth of $37 billion [146] [147] with only Bill Gates ranked higher than Buffett His net worth had risen to $58.5 billion as of September 2013 [148]\n\n\nPolitical and public policy views\nIn addition to political contributions over the years, Buffett endorsed and made campaign contributions to Barack Obama's presidential campaign On July 2, 2008, Buffett attended a $28,500 per plate fundraiser for Obama's campaign in Chicago [182] Buffett intimated that John McCain's views on social justice were so far from his own that McCain would need a \"lobotomy\" for Buffett to change his endorsement [183] During the second 2008 U.S presidential debate, McCain and Obama, after being asked first by presidential debate mediator Tom Brokaw, both mentioned Buffett as a possible future Secretary of the Treasury [184] Later, in the third and final presidential debate, Obama mentioned Buffett as a potential economic advisor [185] Buffett was also a financial advisor to Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 2003 California gubernatorial election [186]\n\n\nHealth care\nBuffett described the health care reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage [194] Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs [194] Buffett said in 2010 that it was not sustainable for the U.S to devote 17% of its GDP to healthcare expenditure, noting that many other nations spent a much

events and training while allowing additional facilities to be added [35] [36]\n\n\nReception\nSupporters of the project have disputed labelling transformation as an erasure, but rather recognition of the sentiment that India can no longer be defined by colonial symbols Colonial symbols will neither be destroyed nor appropriated but simply remain The engaged architect Bimal Patel called the project a triumph of \"common sense\" with a simple and functional design [37] [6] [38] He has also stated that the existing listed heritage buildings will be integrated into the project, with any new buildings will be \"aesthetically harmonious\" with existing buildings [39]\n\n\nApprovals\nThe project construction requires approval from the local body, which is New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) in this case The NDMC was bypassed for the redevelopment project as that would require project to be adhered to municipal building laws NDMC was replaced by Central Public Works Department (CPWD) A colonial law (The Government Building Act, 1899) was activated to empower CPWD This law gives central government power to build anywhere without approval of the urban local body Other bodies like Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) were notified to treat CPWD as local body As the CPWD was empowered, no technical drawings for any part of the project were sent to other authorities for approval including the independent environmental impact assessment as the project did not require clearance for environment, as mandated by Environment Ministry's 2006 notification on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) [43]\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

new Arista head Clive Davis was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project His work paid off, as in late 1975 the Rollers reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 with \"Saturday Night\" \"Saturday Night\" had missed the UK chart completely two years earlier [18] The Rollers gave the track their American debut, via a satellite-link performance on Saturday Night Live, with Howard Cosell In Canada, it fared equally well, hitting No. 1 on the RPM national singles chart on 10 January 1976 [22] The Bay City Rollers (1975) album (North American release only) hit No. 1 in the same chart on 7 February [22]\n\n\nDecline and line–up changes: 1977–1979\nAs the Rollers' popularity waned, the shuffling of personnel continued; Mitchell quit the band He was replaced by guitarist Pat McGlynn Further struggles involved the direction of their sound, as the members wished to pursue more sophisticated styles They settled on David Bowie's producer, Harry Maslin, and in August 1977 released It's a Game as a four-piece group, comprising McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir The It's a Game tour was recorded in 1977 at Japan's Budokan Hall, and was later released in 2001 as Rollerworld: Live at the Budokan 1977.\n\n\nThe Rollers: 1979–1980\nAt the end of 1978, the band had split with McKeown, then fired manager Tam Paton shortly after, and decided to continue in a more new wave, rock-oriented sound Their name was now The Rollers South African-born Duncan Faure joined the band as new lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter With Faure, the line-up produced three albums: Elevator (1979), Voxx (1980) and Ricochet (1981) [18] Following the expiry of the band's Arista contract, none of the releases sold as well as expected, and they stopped touring by late 1981.\n\n\nBreakout and touring: 1980–1990\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, there were a few short tours Seven past members played Japan in 1982, and again in 1983 A reunion album, Breakout, was released in Japan and Australia in 1985, and added drummer George Spencer Breakout was written primarily by McKeown and McGlynn with minor contributions from Faulkner, Wood, and Mitchell In the late 1980s, a version of the band called the New Rollers was formed featuring Faulkner on lead vocals, Karen Prosser on vocals, Jason Medvec on guitar, Andy Boakes on bass, and Mark Roberts on drums The band toured extensively throughout the US and Canada as well as tours of the UK and Australia This group also released an independent four-song EP titled Party Harty.\n\n\nRe–union: 1996–2000\nIn 1996, the classic line-up reunited and performed \"Saturday Night\" on a Japanese television show to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rollermania [29] [30]\n\n\nSpin–off and financial dispute: 2000–2015\nDuring the late 2000s, Ian Mitchell led his own Bay City Rollers band, which included lead vocalist Kyle Vincent  Mitchell was the only ex-Roller involved Members of the Bay City Rollers have accused former manager Tam Paton of sexual abuse In 2003, McGlynn accused Paton of trying to rape him in a hotel room in 1977 [32] However, the police decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Paton Paton had previous arrests for sexual misconduct with underage boys [33] In 2009, McKeown accused Paton of raping him [34]  In the 2023 documentary Secrets of the Bay City Rollers, potential band member Gert Magnus claimed that Paton offered him a place in the band in exchange for sex [35]\n\n\nSecond re–union: 2015–2018\nOn 22 September 2015, the Bay City Rollers, including McKeown, Wood, and Alan Longmuir, announced they were reforming and would play a show at the Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 December [41] [42] [43] Eric Faulkner was unable to contribute because of health concerns, almost dying in February 2015 after contracting viral encephalitis [44] The band released one new single, \"Boomerang\", and discussed plans for a new album The reunion continued into 2016 before Wood ended the reunited line-up on 9 July 2016 because no shows were being booked for the so-called reunion After the 2015 Christmas shows Les was booking shows only for himself and his band during 2016 (except T In The Park) which caused the reunion to end [45] Plans for a new album and various tours that were hoped to take place in 2017 never materialised [45] [46] Prior to the reunion and after the end of the tour, McKeown continued to tour as \"Les McKeown's Bay City Rollers\".\n\n\nRecent history: 2018–present\nOn 27 February 2018, Stuart 'Woody' Wood announced that a \"new generation\" Bay City Rollers would be performing in Tokyo, Japan in June of the same year The band comprises the original classic five members Stuart 'Woody' Wood on guitar, Ian Thomson on lead vocals and guitar, Marcus Cordock on bass (later replaced by Mikey Smith) and Jamie McGrory on drums [47] Bassist Alan Longmuir died on 2 July 2018 after falling ill while on holiday with his wife in Mexico [48] His autobiography I Ran with the Gang: My Life in and Out of The Bay City Rollers was published posthumously in November 2018; the book was written with Martin Knight In his book, Alan Longmuir mentioned his hope for McKeown and Wood to put aside their differences and reunite one more time [49] In 2019, after rumors related to Alan Longmuir's wishes, both McKeown and Wood denied any chance of another reunion and did not want to work with each other, [49] [50] though McKeown did mention his desire to work with Faulkner [46]\n\n\nMembers\nCurrent\n\n\nTimeline\n\nSources:

Journalist Brad Stone revealed in his book The Everything Store that Bezos issued remarks to his employees such as \"I'm sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?\", \"Are you lazy or just incompetent?\", and \"Why are you ruining my life?\" Additionally, Bezos reportedly pitted Amazon teams against each other, and once refused to give Amazon employees city bus passes in order to discourage them from leaving the office.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1992, while Bezos was working for D E Shaw in Manhattan, he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later. In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon. Bezos and his now ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and a daughter adopted from China.\n\n**Politics**\n\nAccording to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S senators from Washington. He has also supported Democrats U.S representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Republican Spencer Abraham, U.S senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues. Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5 million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state. Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for \"top earners.\" In 2012, he donated to Amazon's political action committee (PAC), which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.\n\n**Saudi Hacking Claim**\n\nIn March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030. In March 2019, Bezos's security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos's phone. According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, \"linked the hack to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\" Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident, was employed as a writer at the Washington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018 in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader. In January 2020, The Guardian reported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the Washington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it \"highly probable\" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018. Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nBezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017. In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee. In September 2018, Business Insider reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages wealthy people to give away a majority of their wealth. That same month, Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos's new Day 1 Fund, including the fund's structure and how

on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle [49] [50] With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially [51] Prior to settling in Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes [52] Bezos initially named his new company Cadabra but later changed the name to Amazon after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter A, which is at the beginning of the alphabet [53] At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with \"A\" would appear sooner when

welfare [140] [141] Journalist Mark O'Connell criticized Bezos's relentless customer focus as \"very small\" in terms of impact on humanity as a whole, [142] a sentiment technologist Tim O'Reilly

sixth round The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent The ruling was \"adjusted\" to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that

and he was the favorite to win the heavyweight unification series, a tournament designed to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson defended his title against James Smith on March 7, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada He won by unanimous decision and added Smith's World Boxing Association (WBA) title to his existing belt [52] \"Tyson-mania\" in the media was becoming rampant [53]\n\n\nTyson vs.

decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including Ring magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion [61] The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles, with Tyson's aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks's skillful

championship to Douglas in Tokyo [71] Tyson was a huge betting favorite; indeed, the Mirage, the only casino to put out odds for the fight, made Tyson a 42/1 favorite Tyson failed to find a way past Douglas's quick jab that had a 12-inch (30 cm) reach advantage over his own [72] Tyson did catch Douglas with an uppercut in the eighth round and knocked him to the floor, but Douglas recovered sufficiently to hand Tyson a heavy beating in the subsequent two rounds After the fight, the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get back on his feet [73] Just 35 seconds into the tenth round, Douglas unleashed a brutal uppercut, followed by a four-punch combination of hooks that knocked Tyson down for the first time in his career He was counted out by referee Octavio Meyran [71]\n\n\nReturn to the ring\nDespite the shocking loss, Tyson has said that losing to Douglas was the greatest moment of his career: \"I needed that fight to make me a better person and fighter I have a broader perspective of myself and boxing.\" [75]\n\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock\nTyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee Richard Steele controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience The referee had to be escorted from the ring [79]\n\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock II\nTyson and Ruddock met again on June 28 that year, with Tyson knocking down Ruddock twice

youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20. Born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York, Tyson's life and career have been marked by both triumph and tragedy.\n\nEarly Life\nTyson was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, to Lorna Mae (Smith) Tyson and Purcell Tyson. He has an older brother, Rodney, and an older sister, Denise, who died of a heart attack at the age of 24 in February 1990. Tyson's mother was a promiscuous woman who might have been a prostitute, and his biological father is listed as Purcell Tyson on his birth certificate. However, Tyson had known his father as Jimmy Kirkpatrick, a pimp from Grier Town, North Carolina, who was one of the neighborhood's top baseball players. Kirkpatrick abandoned the Tyson family around the time Mike was born, leaving Tyson's mother to care for the children on her own.\n\nAmateur Career\nAs an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating Kelton Brown in 1982. Brown's corner threw in the towel in the first round of their second meeting. In 1984, Tyson won the gold medal at the Nation Golden Gloves held in New York, beating Jonathan Littles. He fought Henry Tillman twice as an amateur, losing both bouts by decision. Tillman went on to win the heavyweight gold at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nProfessional Career\nTyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in Albany, New York, defeating Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO. He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional, winning 26 of his first 28 fights by KO or TKO, with 16 of those coming in the first round. Tyson's win streak attracted media attention, and he was billed as the next great heavyweight champion.\n\nRise up the Ranks\nTyson's first nationally televised bout took place on February 16, 1986, at Houston Field House in Troy, New York, against journeyman heavyweight Jesse Ferguson. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that broke Ferguson's nose. During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to box, the referee stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent, but the ruling was \"adjusted\" to a win by technical knockout (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories.\n\nWBC Heavyweight Champion\nOn November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by TKO in the second round, becoming the youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20 years and 4 months. He added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987.\n\nUnified Heavyweight Champion\nTyson's dominant performance brought many accolades, and he was hailed as the next great heavyweight champion. He was the favorite to win the heavyweight unification series, a tournament designed to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. Tyson defended his title against James Smith on March 7, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada, winning by unanimous decision and adding Smith's World Boxing Association (WBA) title to his existing belt.\n\nTyson vs. Smith, Thomas\nTyson's next fight was against Tony Tucker, whom he defeated by unanimous decision on August 1, 1987, to become the first heavyweight to own all three major belts – WBA, WBC, and IBF – at the same time. He then faced Tyrell Biggs, beating him by TKO in the seventh round in October of that year.\n\nTyson vs. Spinks\nOn June 27, 1988, Tyson faced Michael Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes via fifteen-round decision in 1985. Spinks had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round, ending the fight after just 91 seconds. Many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson's fame and boxing ability.\n\nTyson vs. Bruno\nIn 1989, Tyson had only two fights amid personal turmoil. He faced Frank Bruno in February, managing to stun Tyson at the end of the first round, although Tyson went on to knock Bruno out in the fifth round. Tyson then knocked out Carl \"The Truth\" Williams in the first round in July.\n\nTyson vs. Douglas\nBy 1990, Tyson seemed to have lost direction, and his personal life was in disarray. He lost the undisputed championship to Buster Douglas in Tokyo on February 11, 1990. Tyson was a huge betting favorite, and the Mirage, the only casino to put out odds for the fight, made Tyson a 42/1 favorite. Tyson failed to find a way past Douglas's quick jab that had a 12-inch (30 cm) reach advantage over his own. After the fight, the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get back on his feet.\n\nReturn to the Ring\nTyson has said that losing to Douglas was the greatest moment of his career, stating that he needed the fight to make him a better person and fighter. He has also said that he has a broader perspective on himself and boxing.\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock\nTyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas. Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights. The fight was stopped in the seventh round in favor of Tyson, but the decision was highly controversial.\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock II\nTyson and Ruddock met again on June 28, 1991, with Tyson winning a twelve-round unanimous decision 113–109, 114–108, and 114–108.\n\nComeback\nTyson was convicted of the rape charge on February 10, 1992, and was released in 1995. After being paroled from prison, Tyson easily won his comeback bouts against Peter McNeeley and Buster Mathis Jr.\n\nSecond Reign as Unified Heavyweight Champion\nTyson regained one belt by easily winning the WBC title against Frank Bruno in March 1996. He then added the WBA belt by defeating champion Bruce Seldon in the first round in September 1996.\n\nTyson vs. Holyfield\nTyson attempted to defend the WBA title against Evander Holyfield, who was in the fourth fight of his own comeback. Holyfield had retired in 1994 following the loss of his championship to Michael Moorer. Tyson and Holyfield fought again on June 28, 1997, and the highly anticipated rematch, dubbed The Sound and the Fury, was held at the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nTyson vs. Lewis\nTyson once again had the opportunity to fight for a heavyweight championship in 2002. Lennox Lewis held the WBC, IBF, IBO, and Lineal titles at the time. As promising fighters, Tyson and Lewis had sparred at a training camp in 1984. Tyson sought to fight Lewis in Nevada for a more lucrative box-office venue, but the Nevada Boxing Commission refused him a license to box as he was facing possible sexual assault charges at the time.\n\nRetirement\nOn June 11, 2005, Tyson quit before the start of the seventh round in a close bout against journeyman Kevin McBride. Tyson stated that he fought McBride for a payday, that he did not anticipate winning, that he was in poor physical condition, and that he was fed up with taking boxing seriously. After losing three of his last four fights, Tyson said he would quit boxing because he felt he had lost his passion for the sport.\n\nExhibition Bouts\nTo help pay off his debts, Tyson announced he would be doing a series of exhibition bouts, calling it Tyson's World Tour. For his first bout, Tyson returned to the ring in 2006 for a four-round exhibition against journeyman heavyweight Corey Sanders in Youngstown, Ohio. Tyson appeared to be \"holding back\" in the exhibition to prevent an early end to the \"show.\" After the bout was poorly received by fans, the remainder of the tour was canceled.\n\nTyson vs. Jones\nIt was announced in July 2020 that Tyson had signed a contract to face former four-division world champion, Roy Jones Jr., in an eight-round exhibition fight. The bout was officially sanctioned by the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) and was held on November 28, 2020.

Smith on March 7, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada He won by unanimous decision and added Smith's World Boxing Association (WBA) title to his existing belt [52] \"Tyson-mania\" in the media was becoming rampant [53]\n\n\nUndisputed heavyweight champion\nOn August 1 he took the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title from Tony Tucker in a twelve-round unanimous decision 119–111, 118–113, and

round [56]\n\n\nTyson vs. Spinks\nOn June 27, 1988, Tyson faced Michael Spinks Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes via fifteen-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including Ring magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion [61] The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles, with Tyson's aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks's skillful out-boxing and footwork The fight ended after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson's fame and boxing ability [62] [63]\n\n\nTyson vs. Bruno, Carl Williams\nIn 1989, Tyson had only two fights amid personal turmoil He faced the British boxer Frank Bruno in February Bruno managed to stun Tyson at the end of the first round, [68] although Tyson

and his personal life was in disarray amidst reports of less vigorous training prior to the Buster Douglas match [70] In a fight on February 11, 1990, he lost the undisputed championship to Douglas in Tokyo [71] Tyson was a huge betting favorite; indeed, the Mirage, the only casino to put out odds for the fight, made Tyson a 42/1 favorite Tyson failed to find a way past Douglas's quick jab that had a 12-inch (30 cm) reach advantage over his own [72] Tyson did catch Douglas with an uppercut in the eighth round and knocked him to the floor, but Douglas recovered sufficiently to hand Tyson a heavy beating in the subsequent two rounds After the fight, the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get back on his feet [73] Just 35 seconds into the tenth round, Douglas unleashed a brutal uppercut, followed by a four-punch combination of hooks that knocked Tyson down for the first time in his career He was counted out by referee Octavio Meyran [71]\n\n\nReturn to the ring\nDespite the shocking loss, Tyson has said that losing to Douglas was the greatest moment of his career: \"I needed that fight to make me a better person and fighter I have a broader perspective of myself and boxing.\" [75]\n\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock\nTyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee Richard Steele controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience The referee had to be escorted from the ring [79]\n\n\nTyson vs. Ruddock II\nTyson and Ruddock met again on June 28 that year, with Tyson knocking down Ruddock twice and winning a twelve-round

Lewis then accepted $4 million from Don King to step aside and allow Tyson to fight Bruce Seldon for an expected $30 million instead with the intention that if Tyson defeated Seldon, he would fight Lewis next [86] Tyson added the WBA belt by defeating champion Seldon in the first round in September that year Seldon was severely criticized and mocked in the popular press for seemingly collapsing to innocuous punches from Tyson [87]\n\n\nTyson vs. Bruno II, Seldon\nTyson regained one belt by easily winning the WBC title against Frank Bruno in March 1996 It was the second fight between the two,

washed-up fighter [88]\n\n\nPost-title career\nTyson and Holyfield fought again on June 28, 1997 Originally, Halpern was supposed to be the referee, but after Tyson's camp protested, Halpern stepped

{"title": "Bluebird_K7", "content": "\nDesign and engineering\nDonald Campbell began his record-breaking career in 1949 following the death of his father, Sir Malcolm Campbell Initially, he had been using his father's 1939-built Rolls-Royce 'R' type powered propeller-driven hydroplane Blue Bird K4 for his attempts, but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks In 1951, K4, which had been modified to a prop-rider configuration to increase its performance potential, was destroyed after suffering a structural failure, when its V-drive gearbox sheared its mountings which were punched through the floor of the hull.\n\n\nBluebird K7 records\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964 The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of 202.15 mph (324 km/h) but only after many months of trials, changes to the inlet splash guards, and a major redesign of Bluebird's forward sponson attachments points by the raising of her front spar Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of 216 mph (348 km/h) in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the later half of the fifties, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then BP Campbell made an unsuccessful attempt in 1957 at Canandaigua in New York state in the summer of 1957, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions It was reported in the New York Times of 17 August 1957 that \"Bluebird Leaves Water for 200 Feet When It Strikes Swell at 240 M.P.H.\" [6] Bluebird K7 became a well known attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, K7 was displayed extensively in the UK, USA, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell's prolonged attempt on the land speed record in 1963–64.\n\n\nDonald Campbell's water speed records\nDonald Campbell had two Metrovick Beryl engines that were interchangeable during K7's life These were used in achieving all of his seven K7 records The Beryl engines were used from 1955 until 1966 [9]\n\n\nFinal record attempt and death of Donald Campbell\nIn June 1966, Campbell decided to once more try for a water speed record with K7: his target, 300 mph (480 km/h).\n\n\nFinal runs\nOn 4 January 1967, Campbell mounted his record attempt Bluebird had completed an initial north–south run at an average of 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h), and Campbell used the new water brake to slow K7 from a peak speed of 311 mph (501 km/h) when he left the measured kilometre Instead of coming to a stop and opting to refuel, he decided to perform a quick turnaround and immediately head back up the course before the wash of his first run had time to be reflected back towards the centre of the lake Both options had been discussed in the pre attempt briefing.\n\n\nAccident analysis\nThere are varying theories about the cause of the crash Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake; however, the wash had not had time to reflect back to the centre of the course, and Campbell had used the water brake well to the south The still photographs taken of the latter part of the final run clearly show that the water brake was not deployed then, and also that when K7 became airborne, the jet engine was no longer functioning; the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water The engine had therefore flamed out It is impossible to be certain why; fuel starvation, damage to a structural element during the bouncing, disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during pitching, or a combination of causes are all possible The most likely ultimate cause is that Bluebird exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, with loss of engine thrust, damage to the port spar fairing, and the then little understood ground-effect lift enhancement [16] all adding to the instability [13]\n\n\nRecovery\nThe wreckage of Bluebird was discovered on the lake bed on 5 January 1967 A 10-man Royal Navy diving team arrived at Coniston late on the day of the accident They set off for their first attempt to locate Campbell and Bluebird at 12.30pm the next day Some calculations had been made to guide the dive team to the boat's likely resting point [citation needed]\n\n\nRestoration and rebuilding of Bluebird K7\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3 His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on 7 September 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners On behalf of the Campbell family, Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at the premises of Smith in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending the court's decision on K7's future ownership The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it\" [35]\n\n\nConsent for the works to proceed\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3 His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on 7 September 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners On behalf of the Campbell family, Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at the premises of Smith in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending the court's decision on K7's future ownership The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it\" [35]\n\n\nScope of restoration works\nGina Campbell described the rebuilding of Bluebird K7 as \"nothing short of a miracle\" [43] The restoration continued throughout a number of phases, using the Norris Brothers' original drawings together with access to Neil Sheppard's collection of photographs and illustrations.\n\n\nRe-floating\n\nOn 20 March 2018 the restoration was featured on the BBC's The One Show [49]\n\nCivil litigation\nIn a legal case study response to the publication of a 2019 BBC News website article, [57] Richard Skene of Aberdeen University School of Law commented: \".. A reading of the report indicates that Smith, perhaps unwittingly, is resting an ownership case on accessio (that is to say, joining corporeal things together, with the old title of any less significant, accessory items being subsumed into the title of the main, principal item), or could it be specificatio (manufacturing an entirely new thing)? [58]\n\n\nBluebird K7 at The Ruskin Museum\nIn December 2022, The Ruskin Museum announced Lancashire-based WEC Group Ltd [66] as its chosen engineering partners to maintain Bluebird K7 once she is returned to Coniston [67] Three Orpheus engines have also been donated to the Museum as The Ruskin Museum plan to run K7 on Coniston Water once it is returned [68] \"The models of Orpheus the Ruskin have been gifted to date are two 803's and a single 101 803's were made for the Fiat G91 aircraft and the 101's for the Folland Gnat aircraft [69]\"\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Bluebird K7**\n\nBluebird K7, also known as Bluebird K.7, was a jet-powered hydroplane designed by Briton Donald Campbell, son of Sir Malcolm Campbell, to break the world water speed record. The boat was built in the early 1950s and went on to set seven world water speed records between 1955 and 1964. Tragically, during a final attempt to break the 300 mph (480 km/h) barrier on January 4, 1967, Bluebird K7 crashed on Coniston Water in Cumbria, England, resulting in the death of Donald Campbell.\n\n**Design and Engineering**\n\nDonald Campbell began his record-breaking career in 1949 following the death of his father, Sir Malcolm Campbell. Initially, he had been using his father's 1939-built Rolls-Royce 'R' type powered propeller-driven hydroplane Blue Bird K4 for his attempts, but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks. In 1951, K4, which had been modified to a prop-rider configuration to increase its performance potential, was destroyed after suffering a structural failure, when its V-drive gearbox sheared its mountings which were punched through the floor of the hull.\n\nCampbell then designed and built Bluebird K7, a jet-powered hydroplane that would become his most successful and iconic boat. The design of K7 was a significant departure from previous hydroplanes, featuring a sleek and streamlined hull, a pair of Metrovick Beryl jet engines, and a innovative water brake system. The boat's performance potential was immense, and Campbell was confident that it would be able to break the 300 mph (480 km/h) barrier.\n\n**Bluebird K7 Records**\n\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964. The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of 202.15 mph (324 km/h) but only after many months of trials, changes to the inlet splash guards, and a major redesign of Bluebird's forward sponson attachments points by the raising of her front spar. Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of 216 mph (348 km/h) in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada. Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the later half of the fifties, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then BP.\n\n**Donald Campbell's Water Speed Records**\n\nDonald Campbell had two Metrovick Beryl engines that were interchangeable during K7's life. These were used in achieving all of his seven K7 records. The Beryl engines were used from 1955 until 1966.\n\n**Final Record Attempt and Death of Donald Campbell**\n\nIn June 1966, Campbell decided to once more try for a water speed record with K7: his target, 300 mph (480 km/h). The final attempt was to be made on Coniston Water, a lake in Cumbria, England, where Campbell had set several previous records. The attempt was to be made with a specially designed water brake system, which would allow the boat to slow down quickly and safely after reaching the top speed.\n\n**Final Runs**\n\nOn January 4, 1967, Campbell mounted his record attempt. Bluebird had completed an initial north–south run at an average of 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h), and Campbell used the new water brake to slow K7 from a peak speed of 311 mph (501 km/h) when he left the measured kilometre. Instead of coming to a stop and opting to refuel, he decided to perform a quick turnaround and immediately head back up the course before the wash of his first run had time to be reflected back towards the centre of the lake.\n\n**Accident Analysis**\n\nThere are varying theories about the cause of the crash. Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter. The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake; however, the wash had not had time to reflect back to the centre of the course, and Campbell had used the water brake well to the south. The still photographs taken of the latter part of the final run clearly show that the water brake was not deployed then, and also that when K7 became airborne, the jet engine was no longer functioning; the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThe wreckage of Bluebird was discovered on the lake bed on January 5, 1967. A 10-man Royal Navy diving team arrived at Coniston late on the day of the accident and set off for their first attempt to locate Campbell and Bluebird at 12.30pm the next day.\n\n**Restoration and Rebuilding of Bluebird K7**\n\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC. His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3. His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on September 7, 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners.\n\nOn behalf of the Campbell family, Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at the premises of Smith in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending the court's decision on K7's future ownership. The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it.\"\n\n**Consent for the Works to Proceed**\n\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC. His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3. His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on September 7, 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners.\n\n**Scope of Restoration Works**\n\nGina Campbell described the rebuilding of Bluebird K7 as \"nothing short of a miracle.\" The restoration continued throughout a number of phases, using the Norris Brothers' original drawings together with access to Neil Sheppard's collection of photographs and illustrations.\n\n**Re-floating**\n\nOn March 20, 2018, the restoration was featured on the BBC's The One Show.\n\n**Civil Litigation**\n\nIn a legal case study response to the publication of a 2019 BBC News website article, Richard Skene of Aberdeen University School of Law commented: \"..

Three Orpheus engines have also been donated to the Museum as The Ruskin Museum plan to run K7 on Coniston Water once it is returned. \"The models of Orpheus the Ruskin have been gifted to date are two 803's and a single 101 803's were made for the Fiat G91 aircraft and the 101's for the Folland Gnat aircraft.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bluebird_K7\" following this outline:\n\n\nDesign and engineering\nDonald Campbell began his record-breaking career in 1949 following the death of his father, Sir Malcolm Campbell Initially, he had been using his father's 1939-built Rolls-Royce 'R' type powered propeller-driven hydroplane Blue Bird K4 for his attempts, but he met with little success and suffered a number of frustrating setbacks In 1951, K4, which had been modified to a prop-rider configuration to increase its performance potential, was destroyed after suffering a structural failure, when its V-drive gearbox sheared its mountings which were punched through the floor of the hull.\n\n\nBluebird K7 records\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between July 1955 and December 1964 The first of these marks was set at Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he achieved a speed of 202.15 mph (324 km/h) but only after many months of trials, changes to the inlet splash guards, and a major redesign of Bluebird's forward sponson attachments points by the raising of her front spar Campbell achieved a steady series of subsequent speed-record increases with the boat during the rest of the decade, beginning with a mark of 216 mph (348 km/h) in 1955 on Lake Mead in Nevada Subsequently, four new marks were registered on Coniston Water, where Campbell and Bluebird became an annual fixture in the later half of the fifties, enjoying significant sponsorship from the Mobil oil company and then BP Campbell made an unsuccessful attempt in 1957 at Canandaigua in New York state in the summer of 1957, which failed due to lack of suitable calm water conditions It was reported in the New York Times of 17 August 1957 that \"Bluebird Leaves Water for 200 Feet When It Strikes Swell at 240 M.P.H.\" [6] Bluebird K7 became a well known attraction, and as well as her annual Coniston appearances, K7 was displayed extensively in the UK, USA, Canada and Europe, and then subsequently in Australia during Campbell's prolonged attempt on the land speed record in 1963–64.\n\n\nDonald Campbell's water speed records\nDonald Campbell had two Metrovick Beryl engines that were interchangeable during K7's life These were used in achieving all of his seven K7 records The Beryl engines were used from 1955 until 1966 [9]\n\n\nFinal record attempt and death of Donald Campbell\nIn June 1966, Campbell decided to once more try for a water speed record with K7: his target, 300 mph (480 km/h).\n\n\nFinal runs\nOn 4 January 1967, Campbell mounted his record attempt Bluebird had completed an initial north–south run at an average of 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h), and Campbell used the new water brake to slow K7 from a peak speed of 311 mph (501 km/h) when he left the measured kilometre Instead of coming to a stop and opting to refuel, he decided to perform a quick turnaround and immediately head back up the course before the wash of his first run had time to be reflected back towards the centre of the lake Both options had been discussed in the pre attempt briefing.\n\n\nAccident analysis\nThere are varying theories about the cause of the crash Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake;

the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water The engine had therefore flamed out It is impossible to be certain why; fuel starvation, damage to a structural element during the bouncing, disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during pitching, or a combination of causes are all possible The most likely ultimate cause is that Bluebird exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, with loss of engine thrust, damage to the port spar fairing, and the then little understood ground-effect lift enhancement [16] all adding to the instability [13]\n\n\nRecovery\nThe wreckage of Bluebird was discovered on the lake bed on 5 January 1967 A 10-man Royal Navy diving team arrived at Coniston late on the day of the accident They set off for their first attempt to locate Campbell and Bluebird at 12.30pm the next day Some calculations had been made to guide the dive team to the boat's likely resting point [citation needed]\n\n\nRestoration and rebuilding of Bluebird K7\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3 His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on 7 September 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners On behalf of the Campbell family, Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at the premises of Smith in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending the court's decision on K7's future ownership The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it\" [35]\n\n\nConsent for the works to proceed\nAs the work to recover K7 and the body of Donald Campbell from the lakebed was underway, Paul Foulkes-Halbard, a former business associate of Campbell and owner of Filching Manor Motor Museum in Polegate, had claimed he acquired ownership of the boat in the course of business dealings with DMC His museum already had an extensive collection of Campbell-related exhibits including Bluebird K3 His claim was rejected by a consent order lodged at the High Court in London on 7 September 2001, which declared Tonia Bern-Campbell and the executors of Campbell's will as the rightful owners On behalf of the Campbell family, Gina Campbell directed that the wreckage raised in March 2001 should be kept at the premises of Smith in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from the March date pending the court's decision on K7's future ownership The Argus also reported in September 2001: \"It is the family's intention that the boat will be displayed at the Ruskin Museum in Coniston, which will now have to be extended to accommodate it\" [35]\n\n\nScope of restoration works\nGina Campbell described the rebuilding of Bluebird K7 as \"nothing short of a miracle\" [43] The restoration continued throughout a number of phases, using the Norris Brothers' original drawings together with access to Neil Sheppard's collection of photographs and illustrations.\n\n\nRe-floating\n\nOn 20 March 2018 the restoration was featured on the BBC's The One Show [49]\n\nCivil litigation\nIn a legal case study response to the publication of a 2019 BBC News website article, [57] Richard Skene of Aberdeen University School of Law commented: \"..

He is best known for his record-breaking winning streak on the game show Jeopardy!, where he won $4,522,700, and for his subsequent hosting gigs on the show.\n\n**Early and Personal Life**\n\nKen Jennings was born on May 23, 1974, in Edmonds, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. His father was an international lawyer, and the family moved to South Korea when Ken was in the first grade. He spent 11 years living in Korea and also Singapore, and graduated from the Seoul Foreign School. His mother was a school teacher, and worked for the Department of Defense in that capacity overseas. Jennings grew up viewing Jeopardy! on the American Forces Network.\n\n**Jeopardy!**\n\nBefore 2003, Jeopardy! contestants were limited to five consecutive wins. At the beginning of the show's 20th season in 2003, the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win. After this rule change, and until Jennings's run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004. Jennings took the contestant exam for Jeopardy! in 2003, but did not hear back from the show for a year. He was given three weeks to prepare for his taping, and he prepared extensively, using a couch as a podium, his young child's toy as a buzzer, and having his wife use flash cards and keep score.\n\n**Impact and Television Ratings**\n\nIt took a span of 182 calendar days to broadcast Jennings's 75 matches. His run on the show brought significant media attention and television ratings. According to the Nielsen TV National People Meter, Jeopardy!'s ratings were 22 percent higher during Jennings's run than they were during the same period the previous year. For several weeks of the winnings' streak, Jeopardy! was ranked as TV's highest-rated syndicated program, with ratings 30 percent higher than before his appearance. By the end of Jeopardy!'s 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed sister program Wheel of Fortune in the ratings, though Wheel still benefited from the streak in markets where Jeopardy! is its lead-in in the common scheduling tactic for both shows. Jennings was credited with boosting the program's popularity as a whole, which at that point had been on the air for two decades but primarily attracted an older demographic.\n\n**Tournaments**\n\nJennings returned to the program several times over the years as a contestant in its tournaments. He first rejoined the show for the 15-week, 75-show Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions in 2005. The field totaled 145 players, including Jennings, who, unlike the other competitors, was automatically placed in the finals. In the final round, Brad Rutter decisively defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered, with respective final scores of $62,000, $34,599, and $20,600. Jennings won the $500,000 prize for second place, but as a result of the Ultimate Tournament, Rutter temporarily displaced him as the highest overall winner of money on game shows.\n\n**Hosting**\n\nIn September 2020, Jennings signed on as a consulting producer of Jeopardy! for the show's 37th season, a job that included reading on-air categories. Alex Trebek, the longtime host of Jeopardy!, had been diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer the previous year. Trebek taped his final episode of the program on October 29, 2020. Contingency plans were made for him to miss the next taping, scheduled for November 9–10, as he planned to have a surgery. Supervising producers Lisa Broffman and Rock Schmidt had named Ken Jennings the interim host for the taping, and Jennings had a final conversation with Trebek days before the rehearsal was set to commence. The rehearsal was scheduled for November 8, 2020, but was subsequently cancelled when Schmidt gave the staff the news that Trebek had died that day from his cancer.\n\n**Writing Career**\n\nAfter his initial success on Jeopardy!, Jennings secured a book deal, and left his career as a programmer to pursue his original love of writing. Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs details his experiences on Jeopardy! and his research into trivia culture conducted after the completion of his run, and was published in 2006. Ken Jennings' Trivia Almanac: 8,888 Questions in 365 Days, a hardcover book, is a compilation of trivia questions—with three categories and about 20 questions per day of the year. Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks explores the world of map and geography enthusiasts. Because I Said So! is a humorous examination of \"the myths, tales & warnings every generation passes down to its kids.\" He also has written five books for his children's series, Junior Genius Guides.\n\n**Other Television and Game Show Appearances**\n\nIn the aftermath of his Jeopardy! fame, Jennings signed with the United Talent Agency, which hoped to expand him into a commercial pitchman or TV host. In 2005 and 2006, he engaged in several endorsements, including a deal with Microsoft to promote its Encarta encyclopedia software, and Cingular Wireless (now AT&T) featured Jennings in commercials portraying him as having lots of \"friends and family\" (coming out of the woodwork once he began winning on Jeopardy!). He was also involved in speaking deals through the Massachusetts-based speakers' agency American Program Bureau. University Games produced a Can You Beat Ken? board game, in which players vie against each other and Jennings in an attempt to earn $2.6 million first. Each question in the game was asked to Jennings, and his answers, both correct and incorrect, are recorded on the cards.\n\n**Records**\n\nHe is the highest-earning American game show contestant, having won money on five different game shows, including $4,522,700 on the U.S game show Jeopardy!. From 2021 to 2023, Jennings and Mayim Bialik alternated as hosts of that show, as well as Celebrity Jeopardy!. In 2023, Jennings received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Game Show. In December 2023, Jennings was announced as Jeopardy!’s permanent main host.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nOn March 3, 2020, the Washington State Legislature approved Senate Resolution 8704, congratulating Jennings for his achievements on game shows.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nJennings was an active Twitter user, and some of his tweets have been subjects of controversy. On September 22, 2014, Jennings received criticism after tweeting, \"Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair.\" The tweet reignited controversy after resurfacing in 2020, which led to condemnation from noted disability rights activists such as Rebecca Cokley.\n\n**2023 Writers Guild of America Strike**\n\nIn May 2023, the Writers Guild of America announced that its unionized writers would go on strike, as part of negotiations largely related to increases in pay, benefits, and protections against artificial intelligence. Jennings's then co-host on Jeopardy!, Mayim Bialik, refused to participate in the show's final week of filming as a result. Jennings was reportedly brought in as the host for filming \"as a result of Bialik's decision\"; some assumed this meant he had crossed the Writers Guild of America West picket line, but a rep from SAG-AFTRA clarified that since Jeopardy! is a Network Television Code show, it was not under the same contract as other shows on strike and therefore Jennings was not crossing the picket line and was clear to work. The show returned for season 40 in late 2023, using a mix of recycled material and newly-written questions made before the strike; the program had also made a similar move during the 2007-08 strike.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ken_Jennings\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly and personal life\nKenneth Wayne Jennings III was born on May 23, 1974, [2] in Edmonds, Washington, a suburb of Seattle [3] [4] His father was an international lawyer, and moved the family to South Korea when Ken was in the first grade [5] [6] His mother was a school teacher, and worked for the Department of Defense in that capacity overseas [7] Jennings grew up viewing Jeopardy! on the American Forces Network [5] Jennings spent 11 years living in Korea and also Singapore, and graduated from the Seoul Foreign School [5]\n\n\nJeopardy!\nBefore 2003, Jeopardy! contestants were limited to five consecutive wins At the beginning of the show's 20th season in 2003, the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win [14] After this rule change, and until Jennings's run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004 [15] Jennings took the contestant exam for Jeopardy! in 2003, but did not hear back from the show for a year He was given three weeks to prepare for his taping, and he prepared extensively, using a couch as a podium, his young child's toy as a buzzer, and having his wife use flash cards and keep score [16] [17]\n\n\nOriginal streak\nBefore 2003, Jeopardy! contestants were limited to five consecutive wins At the beginning of the show's 20th season in 2003, the rules were changed to allow contestants to remain on the show as long as they continued to win [14] After this rule change, and until Jennings's run, the record winning streak was set by Tom Walsh, who won $186,900 in eight games in January 2004 [15] Jennings took the contestant exam for Jeopardy! in 2003, but did not hear back from the show for a year He was given three weeks to prepare for his taping, and he prepared extensively, using a couch as a podium, his young child's toy as a buzzer, and having his wife use flash cards and keep score [16] [17]\n\n\nImpact and television ratings\nIt took a span of 182 calendar days to broadcast Jennings's 75 matches His run on the show brought significant media attention and television ratings According to the Nielsen TV National People Meter, Jeopardy!'s ratings were 22 percent higher during Jennings's run than they were during the same period the previous year [23] For several weeks of the winnings' streak, Jeopardy! was ranked as TV's highest-rated syndicated program, [24] with ratings 30 percent higher than before his appearance [15] By the end of Jeopardy!'s 20th season several weeks later, the show had surpassed sister program Wheel of Fortune in the ratings, though Wheel still benefited from the streak in markets where Jeopardy! is its lead-in in the common scheduling tactic for both shows [25] Jennings was credited with boosting the program's popularity as a whole, which at that point had been on the air for two decades but primarily attracted an older demographic [21]\n\n\nTournaments\nJennings returned to the program several times over the years as a contestant in its tournaments He first rejoined the show for the 15-week, 75-show Jeopardy!

{"title": "God_Save_the_King", "content": "\nHistory\nThe text first appeared in England in the late 1590s, with the publication of William Shakespeare's Richard III In Act IV, Scene I, Lady Anne says to Queen Elizabeth: \"Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains! Anointed let me be with deadly venom, And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen.'\" [10]\n\n\nUse in the United Kingdom\nLike many aspects of British constitutional life, \"God Save the King\" derives its official status from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament [16] The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the King\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied over time.\n\n\nLyrics in the UK\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible [21] A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, \"And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung and proclaimed at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973 [22] Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\" [23] [24] He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the Gunpowder Plot includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the former standard verse \"Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices\".\n\n\nStandard version in the United Kingdom\nAs the reigning monarch is currently Charles III, the male version of the anthem is used.\n\n\nStandard version of the music\nThe standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short crescendo into \"Send him victorious\", and then is another crescendo at \"over us:\" into the final words \"God save the King\".\n\n\nAlternative British versions\nThere have been several attempts to rewrite the words In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem as verse two was considered by some to be slightly offensive in its use of the phrase \"scatter her enemies\" Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her enemies\" to \"our enemies\"; others questioned the theology and proposed \"thine enemies\" instead Sydney G R Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F K Harford [36]\n\n\nO Lord Our God Arise\nAn additional stanza sung second was previously considered part of the standard lyrics in the UK:\n\n\nWilliam Hickson's alternative version\nIn 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote an alternative version, of which the first, third, and fourth verses gained some currency when they were appended to the national anthem in The English Hymnal (1906) The fourth Hickson verse was sung after the traditional first verse at Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002, and during the raising of the Union Flag during the 2008 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony, in which London took Paralympic flag from Beijing to host the 2012 Summer games This verse is currently used as the final verse by the Church of Scotland [38]\n\n\nSamuel Reynolds Hole's alternative version\nTo mark the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, a modified version of the second verse was written by the Dean of Rochester, the Very Reverend Samuel Reynolds Hole A four-part harmony setting was then made by Frederick Bridge, and published by Novello.\n\n\nOfficial peace version\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book Songs of Praise in 1925 [43] This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919 [26] However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today [44]\n\n\nHistoric Jacobite and anti-Jacobite alternative verses\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 Gentleman's Magazine This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1814, [46] and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1836 Therein, it is presented as an \"additional verse.. though being of temporary application only.. stored in the memory of an old friend.. who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung\", the lyrics given being: [47]\n\n\nHistoric republican alternative\nA version from 1794 composed by the American republican and French citizen Joel Barlow [59] celebrated the power of the guillotine to liberate: [60] [61]\n\n\nPerformance in the UK\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it) An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\" The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52 [62] In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier tempo.\n\n\nPerformance in Lancashire\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom –  at an international sporting event, for instance –  an alternative song is used:\n\n\nOther British anthems\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom –  at an international sporting event, for instance –  an alternative song is used:\n\n\nUse in media\nOn 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (the practice had been dropped in 1997, due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), [77] to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain's subsequent withdrawing from the European Union At the evening of the same day, BBC Two's Newsnight programme ended its nightly broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were \"incredibly happy to oblige\" Rosindell's request, and then played a clip of the Sex Pistols' similarly named song, much to Rosindell's discontent [78]\n\n\nUse in other Commonwealth countries\n\"God Save the King\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent In New Zealand, it remains one of the official national anthems [81]\n\n\nAustralia\nIn Australia, \"God Save the King\" was declared as the royal anthem on 27 October 2022, replacing the previous declaration of \"God Save the Queen\" as the royal anthem on 19 April 1984 [82] It declares that the song is to played when the monarch or a member of the royal family is present The Australian Government also advises that when the King is in Australia, the royal anthem is played at the beginning of an event and the national anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\", is to be played at the end [83]\n\n\nBelize\n\"God Save the King\" is the royal anthem of Belize [85] The Vice-Regal Salute to the Belizean governor general is composed of the first verse of \"God Save the King\" and the chorus of National Anthem, \"Land of the Free\" [86]\n\n\nCanada\nBy convention, [87] \"God Save the King\" (French: Dieu Sauve le Roi, Dieu Sauve la Reine when a Queen) is the royal anthem of Canada [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] The governor general and provincial lieutenant governors are accorded the \"Viceregal Salute\", comprising the first three lines of \"God Save the King\", followed by the first and last lines of \"O Canada\" [98]\n\n\nLyrics in Canada\n\"God Save the King\" has been translated into French, [102] but this translation

whereas Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales have unofficial anthems—\"Flower of Scotland\", \"Londonderry Air\", and \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\"—while England tends to use \"God Save the King\" exclusively and also unofficially.\n\n\nSee also\nNotes\n\n\nNotes and references\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "God Save the King\n\nGod Save the King is the national anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It has a long and complex history, with various versions and adaptations being used over the years.\n\n# History\n\nThe text first appeared in England in the late 1590s, with the publication of William Shakespeare's Richard III. In Act IV, Scene I, Lady Anne says to Queen Elizabeth: \"Were red-hot steel to sear me to the brains! Anointed let me be with deadly venom, And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen.'\" This phrase was later adapted and modified to become the basis for the modern national anthem.\n\n# Use in the United Kingdom\n\nLike many aspects of British constitutional life, \"God Save the King\" derives its official status from custom and use, not from Royal Proclamation or Act of Parliament. The variation in the UK of the lyrics to \"God Save the King\" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied over time.\n\n# Lyrics in the UK\n\nThe phrase \"God Save the King\" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the King James Bible. A text based on the 1st Book of Kings Chapter 1: verses 38–40, \"And all the people rejoiced, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen\", has been sung and proclaimed at every coronation since that of King Edgar in 973. Scholes says that as early as 1545 \"God Save the King\" was a watchword of the Royal Navy, with the response being \"Long to reign over us\".\n\n# Standard version in the United Kingdom\n\nAs the reigning monarch is currently Charles III, the male version of the anthem is used. The standard version of the music and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs.\n\n# Alternative British versions\n\nThere have been several attempts to rewrite the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem as verse two was considered by some to be slightly offensive in its use of the phrase \"scatter her enemies\". Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change \"her enemies\" to \"our enemies\"; others questioned the theology and proposed \"thine enemies\" instead.\n\n# O Lord Our God Arise\n\nAn additional stanza sung second was previously considered part of the standard lyrics in the UK: \"O Lord our God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall. Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On Thee our hopes we fix, God save us all.\"\n\n# William Hickson's alternative version\n\nIn 1836, William Edward Hickson wrote an alternative version, of which the first, third, and fourth verses gained some currency when they were appended to the national anthem in The English Hymnal (1906). The fourth Hickson verse was sung after the traditional first verse at Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002, and during the raising of the Union Flag during the 2008 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony, in which London took Paralympic flag from Beijing to host the 2012 Summer games. This verse is currently used as the final verse by the Church of Scotland.\n\n# Samuel Reynolds Hole's alternative version\n\nTo mark the celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, a modified version of the second verse was written by the Dean of Rochester, the Very Reverend Samuel Reynolds Hole. A four-part harmony setting was then made by Frederick Bridge, and published by Novello.\n\n# Official peace version\n\nA less militaristic version of the song, titled \"Official peace version, 1919\", was first published in the hymn book Songs of Praise in 1925. This was \"official\" in the sense that it was approved by the British Privy Council in 1919. However, despite being reproduced in some other hymn books, it is largely unknown today.\n\n# Historic Jacobite and anti-Jacobite alternative verses\n\nAround 1745, anti-Jacobite sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of Field Marshal George Wade's army then assembling at Newcastle. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 Gentleman's Magazine. This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by Richard Clark in 1814, and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1836.\n\n# Historic republican alternative\n\nA version from 1794 composed by the American republican and French citizen Joel Barlow celebrated the power of the guillotine to liberate.\n\n# Performance in the UK\n\nThe style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the \"proper interpretation\" by King George V, who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening \"six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars\". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52.\n\n# Performance in Lancashire\n\nFrequently, when an anthem is needed for one of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom - at an international sporting event, for instance - an alternative song is used.\n\n# Use in media\n\nOn 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (the practice had been dropped in 1997, due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain's subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, BBC Two's Newsnight programme ended its nightly broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were \"incredibly happy to oblige\" Rosindell's request, and then played a clip of the Sex Pistols' similarly named song, much to Rosindell's discontent.\n\n# Use in other Commonwealth countries\n\n\"God Save the King\" was exported around the world via the expansion of the British Empire, serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the Empire's evolution into the Commonwealth of Nations, the song declined in use in most states which became independent.\n\n# Australia\n\nIn Australia, \"God Save the King\" was declared as the royal anthem on 27 October 2022, replacing the previous declaration of \"God Save the Queen\" as the royal anthem on 19 April 1984. It declares that the song is to be played when the monarch or a member of the royal family is present. The Australian Government also advises that when the King is in Australia, the royal anthem is played at the beginning of an event and the national anthem, \"Advance Australia Fair\", is to be played at the end.\n\n# Belize\n\n\"God Save the King\" is the royal anthem of Belize. The Vice-Regal Salute to the Belizean governor general is composed of the first verse of \"God Save the King\" and the chorus of National Anthem, \"Land of the Free\".\n\n# Canada\n\nBy convention, \"God Save the King\" (French: Dieu Sauve le Roi, Dieu Sauve la Reine when a Queen) is the royal anthem of Canada. It is sometimes played or sung together with the national anthem, \"O Canada\", at private and public events organised by groups such as the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Legion, police services, and loyal groups.\n\n# Channel Islands\n\n\"God Save the King\" is used by both Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands as an alternative to their respective national anthems. Its use case and popular version is generally similar to how it is used in the United Kingdom. However, the anthem has been translated in Jèrriais.\n\n# New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand inherited \"God Save the King\" as its anthem, which served as the sole national anthem until 1977, when \"God Defend New Zealand\" was introduced as a second.

Since the internationally recognised independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe in April 1980, \"God Save the King\" has had no official status there.\n\n# Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n\n\"God Save the King\" is the royal anthem of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is played on royal and vice-regal occasions. The Vice-Regal Salute to the governor general is composed of the chorus of \"God Save the King\" and followed by that of the National Anthem, \"Saint Vincent, Land so Beautiful\".\n\n# South Africa\n\n\"God Save the King\" (Afrikaans: God Red die Koning, God Red die Koningin when a Queen) was a co-national anthem of South Africa from 1938 until 1957, when it was formally replaced by \"Die Stem van Suid-Afrika\" as the sole national anthem.

exclusively and also unofficially.\n\n\nSee also\nNotes\n\n\nNotes and references\nNotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Ten_Commandments", "content": "\nTerminology\nThe Ten Commandments, called \nעֲשֶׂרֶת הַדְּבָרִים‎ \n(transliterated aséret haddevarím) in Biblical Hebrew, are mentioned at Exodus 34:28, [4] Deuteronomy 4:13 [5] and Deuteronomy 10:4 [6] In all sources, the terms are translatable as \"the ten words\", \"the ten sayings\", or \"the ten matters\" [7] In Mishnaic Hebrew they are called עֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת, aséret haddiberót, a precise equivalent [a]\n\n\nBiblical narrative\nThe biblical narrative of the revelation at Sinai begins in Exodus 19 after the arrival of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai (also called Horeb) On the morning of the third day of their encampment, \"there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud\", and the people assembled at the base of the mount After \"the LORD [9] came down upon mount Sinai\", Moses went up briefly and returned to prepare the people, and then in Exodus 20 \"God spoke\" to all the people the words of the covenant, that is, the \"ten commandments\" [10] as it is written Modern biblical scholarship differs as to whether Exodus 19–20 describes the people of Israel as having directly heard all or some of the decalogue, or whether the laws are only passed to them through Moses [11]\n\n\nCommandments text and numbering\nAlthough both the Masoretic Text and the Dead Sea Scrolls have the passages of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 divided into ten specific commandments formatted with space between them corresponding to the Lutheran counting in the chart below, [26] [27] many Modern English Bible translations give the appearance of more than ten imperative statements in each passage.\n\n\nReligious traditions\nAlthough both the Masoretic Text and the Dead Sea Scrolls have the passages of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 divided into ten specific commandments formatted with space between them corresponding to the Lutheran counting in the chart below, [26] [27] many Modern English Bible translations give the appearance of more than ten imperative statements in each passage.\n\n\nCategorization\nThere are two major approaches to categorizing the commandments One approach distinguishes the prohibition against other gods (verse 3) from the prohibition against images (verses 4–6):\n\n\nReligious interpretations\nThe Ten Commandments concern matters of fundamental importance in Judaism and Christianity: the greatest obligation (to worship only God), the greatest injury to a person (murder), the greatest injury to family bonds (adultery), the greatest injury to commerce and law (bearing false witness), the greatest inter-generational obligation (honour to parents), the greatest obligation to community (truthfulness), the greatest injury to movable property (theft) [59]\n\n\nJudaism\nThe Ten Commandments form the basis of Jewish Rabbinic law, [64] stating God's universal and timeless standard of right and wrong – unlike the rest of the 613 commandments which Jewish interpretative tradition claims are in the Torah, which include, for example, various duties and ceremonies such as various halachich kashrut dietary laws, and the rituals to be performed by priests in the Holy Temple [65] Jewish tradition considers the Ten Commandments the theological basis for the rest of the commandments Philo, in his four-book work The Special Laws, treated the Ten Commandments as headings under which he discussed other related commandments [66] Similarly, in The Decalogue he stated that \"under  [the \"commandment… against adulterers\"] many other commands are conveyed by implication, such as that against seducers, that against practisers of unnatural crimes, that against all who live in debauchery, that against all men who indulge in illicit and incontinent connections.\" [67] Others, such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, have also made groupings of the commandments according to their links with the Ten Commandments [68]\n\n\nTwo tablets\nThe arrangement of the commandments on the two tablets is interpreted in different ways in the classical Jewish tradition Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says that each tablet contained five commandments, \"but the Sages say ten on one tablet and ten on the other\", that is, that the tablets were duplicates [71] This can be compared to diplomatic treaties of the ancient Near East, in which a copy was made for each party [72]\n\n\nUse in Jewish ritual\nThe Mishna records that during the period of the Second Temple, the Ten Commandments were recited daily, [75] before the reading of the Shema Yisrael (as preserved, for example, in the Nash Papyrus, a Hebrew manuscript fragment from 150 to 100 BC found in Egypt, containing a version of the Ten Commandments and the beginning of the Shema); but that this practice was abolished in the synagogues so as not to give ammunition to heretics who claimed that they were the only important part of Jewish law, [76] [77] or to dispel a claim by early Christians that only the Ten Commandments were handed down at Mount Sinai rather than the whole Torah [75]\n\n\nSamaritan\nThe Samaritan Pentateuch varies in the Ten Commandments passages, both in that the Samaritan Deuteronomical version of the passage is much closer to that in Exodus, and in that Samaritans count as nine commandments what others count as ten The Samaritan tenth commandment is on the sanctity of Mount Gerizim.\n\n\nChristianity\nMost traditions of Christianity hold that the Ten Commandments have divine authority and continue to be valid, though they have different interpretations and uses of them [84] The Apostolic Constitutions, which implore believers to \"always remember the ten commands of God,\" reveal the importance of the Decalogue in the early Church [85] Through most of Christian history the decalogue was considered a summary of God's law and standard of behaviour, central to Christian life, piety, and worship [86]\n\n\nReferences in the New Testament\nDuring his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explicitly referenced the prohibitions against murder and adultery In Matthew 19:16–19 Jesus repeated five of the Ten Commandments, followed by that commandment called \"the second\" (Matthew 22:34–40) after the first and great commandment.\n\n\nAnglicanism\nIn Anglicanism, the Articles of the Church of England, revised and altered by the Assembly of Divines, at Westminster, in the year 1643 state that \"no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral By the moral law, we understand all the Ten Commandments taken in their full extent.\" [88]\n\n\nBaptists\nBaptists believe The Ten Commandments are a summary of the requirements of a works covenant (called the \"Old Covenant\"), given on Mount Sinai to the nascent nation of Israel [89] The Old Covenant is fulfilled by Christ at the cross Unbelievers are still under the Law The law reveals man's sin and need for the salvation that is Jeshua Repentance from sin and faith in Christ for salvation is the point of the entire Bible [90] They do reflect the eternal character of God, and serve as a paragon of morality [91]\n\n\nCatholicism\nIn Catholicism it is believed that Jesus freed Christians from the rest of Jewish religious law, but not from their obligation to keep the Ten Commandments [92] It has been said that they are to the moral order what the creation story is to the natural order [92]\n\n\nLutheranism\nThe Lutheran division of the commandments follows the one established by St Augustine, following the then current synagogue scribal division The first three commandments govern the relationship between God and humans, the fourth through eighth govern public relationships between people, and the last two govern private thoughts See Luther's Small Catechism [98] and Large Catechism [58]\n\n\nMethodist\nThe moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, according to the founder of the Methodist movement John Wesley, was instituted from the beginning of the world and is written on the hearts of all people [99]\nAs with the Reformed view, [100] Wesley held that the moral law, which is contained in the Ten Commandments, stands today: [101]\n\n\nOrthodox\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church holds its moral truths to be chiefly contained in the Ten Commandments [102] A confession begins with the Confessor reciting the Ten Commandments and asking the penitent which of them he has broken [103]\n\n\nPentecostalism\nThe Pentecostal Christianity believes the Ten Commandments were given directly from God summarizing the absolutes of spiritual and moral living that God intended for his people They also attach a specific significance observing that the Feast of Pentecost commemorates the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses This view, admitted by several founders of the Pentecostal Church has passed into modern Christian ethic, where the feast is also celebrated as “the day of the giving of the Law” or Shavuot as observed by Judaic liturgical books and Jewish Christianity Pentecostals believe giving of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai fifty days after Passover and the disciples of Jesus Christ receiving the Holy Spirit of God, as foretold by Him, [104] fifty days after His Resurrection on Day of Pentecost was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah [105] symbolizing God giving His Church the gift of the Holy Spirit, where law is written, not on tablets of stone, but in their hearts Pentecostal Christianity believes that through Jesus Christ and with the exception of the Ten Commandments, they are not bound by the 613 Commandments of the Old Testament [106] and any adherence to Judaic Halakha.\n\n\nPresbyterianism\nThe Westminster Confession, held by Presbyterian Churches, holds that the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments \"does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof\" [107]\n\n\nProtestantism\nProtestantism, under which there are several denominations of Christianity, in general gives more importance to biblical law and the gospel, rejecting the moral theology of Roman Catholicism Early Protestant theologians continued to take the Ten Commandments as the starting point of Christian moral life [108] Different versions of Christianity have varied in how they have translated the bare principles into the specifics that make up a full Christian ethic [108]\n\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nAccording to the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jesus completed rather than rejected the Mosaic law [111] The Ten Commandments are considered eternal gospel principles necessary for exaltation [112] They appear in the Book of Mosiah 12:34–36, [113] 13:15–16, [114] 13:21–24 [115] and Doctrine and Covenants [112] According to the Book of Mosiah, a prophet named Abinadi taught the Ten Commandments in the court of King Noah and was martyred for his righteousness [116] Abinadi knew the Ten Commandments from the brass plates [117]\n\n\nIslam\nThe receiving of the Ten Commandments by Prophet Musa (Moses) is dealt with in much detail in Islamic tradition [122] with the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai described in Surah A'raf (7:142-145) The Revealing of the Tablets on which were the Commandments of God is described in the following verse:\n\n\nMoses and the Tablets\nThe receiving of the Ten Commandments by Prophet Musa (Moses) is dealt with in much detail in Islamic tradition [122] with the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai described in Surah A'raf (7:142-145) The Revealing of the Tablets on which were the Commandments of God is described in the following verse:\n\n\nClassical views\nThree verses of Surah An'am (6:151–153) are widely taken to be a reinstatement (or revised version) of the Ten Commandments [125] [126] [127] either as revealed to Moses originally or as they are to be taken by Muslims now: [128]\n\n\nOther views\nThe Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk) In Christianity, it is sometimes observed on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all (non-Sabbatarianism) Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the Jewish-Roman wars onward [citation needed] The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety\" [133] Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: \"Christians must not judaize by resting on the  [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.\" [133]\n\n\nMain points of interpretative difference\nThe Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk) In Christianity, it is sometimes observed on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all (non-Sabbatarianism) Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the

Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.\" [133]\n\n\nKilling or murder\nMultiple translations exist of the fifth/sixth commandment; the Hebrew words לא תרצח‎ (lo tirtzach) are variously translated as \"thou shalt not kill\" or \"thou shalt not murder\" [134]\n\n\nTheft\nGerman Old Testament scholar Albrecht Alt: Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog (1953), suggested that the commandment translated as \"thou shalt not steal\" was originally intended against stealing people, against abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as \"thou shalt not kidnap\" (Sanhedrin 86a) \n\n\nIdolatry\nIn Judaism there is a prohibition against making or worshipping an idol or a representation of God, but there is no restriction on art or simple depictions unrelated to God Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning not just representations of God, but also in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.\n\n\nAdultery\nThis commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery [142] This concept of adultery stems from a society that was not strictly monogamous, where the patriarchal economic aspect of Israelite marriage gave the husband an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband [143] [144]\n\n\nCritical historical analysis\nCritical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.\n\n\nEarly theories\nCritical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.\n\n\n20th century discussion\nBy the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times This means that there is no longer any a priori reason to believe that Exodus 20:2–17 and Exodus 34:10–28 were composed during different stages of Israelite history.\n\n\n21st century scholarship\nScholars disagree about when the Ten Commandments were written and by whom, with some modern scholars suggesting that they were likely modeled on Hittite and Mesopotamian laws and treaties [3]: 140 \n\n\nThe Ritual Decalogue\nExodus 34:28 [161] identifies a different list, that of Exodus 34:11–27, [162] as the Ten Commandments Since this passage does not prohibit murder, adultery, theft, etc., but instead deals with the proper worship of Yahweh, some scholars call it the \"Ritual Decalogue\", and disambiguate the Ten Commandments of traditional understanding as the \"Ethical Decalogue\" [163] [164] [165] [166]\n\n\nPolitical importance\nAccording to some scholars, certain interpretations of the Commandments were allegedly problematic for people living in those respective societies during their time, [170] like capital punishment for blasphemy, idolatry, apostasy, adultery, cursing one own's parents, and Sabbath-breaking [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] [176]\n\n\nUnited States debate over display on public property\nEuropean Protestants replaced some visual art in their churches with plaques of the Ten Commandments after the Reformation In England, such \"Decalogue boards\" also represented the English monarch's emphasis on rule of royal law within the churches The United States Constitution forbids establishment of religion by law; however images of Moses holding the tablets of the Decalogue, along other religious figures including Solomon, Confucius, and Muhammad holding the Quran, are sculpted on the north and south friezes of the pediment of the Supreme Court building in Washington [181] Images of the Ten Commandments have long been contested symbols for the relationship of religion to national law [182]\n\n\nIn public schools\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court in Stone v Graham ruled unconstitutional a Kentucky statute that required the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments on the wall of each public classroom in the state, because the statute lacked a nonreligious, legislative purpose [187]\n\n\nCultural references\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by Cecil B DeMille: a 1923 silent film which stars Theodore Roberts as Moses, and a 1956 version filmed in VistaVision starring Charlton Heston as Moses.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en",

for each party [72]\n\n\nUse in Jewish ritual\nThe Mishna records that during the period of the Second Temple, the Ten Commandments were recited daily, [75] before the reading of the Shema Yisrael (as preserved, for example, in the Nash Papyrus, a Hebrew manuscript fragment from 150 to 100 BC found in Egypt, containing a version of the Ten Commandments and the beginning of the Shema); but that this practice was abolished in the synagogues so as not to give ammunition to heretics who claimed that they were the only important part of Jewish law, [76] [77] or to dispel a claim by early Christians that only the Ten Commandments were handed down at Mount Sinai rather than the whole Torah [75]\n\n\nSamaritan\nThe Samaritan Pentateuch varies in the Ten Commandments passages, both in that the Samaritan Deuteronomical version of the passage is much closer to that in Exodus, and in that Samaritans count as nine commandments what others count as ten The Samaritan tenth commandment is on the sanctity of Mount Gerizim.\n\n\nChristianity\nMost traditions of Christianity hold that the Ten Commandments have divine authority and continue to be valid, though they have different interpretations and uses of them [84] The Apostolic Constitutions, which implore believers to \"always remember the ten commands of God,\" reveal the importance of the Decalogue in the early Church [85] Through most of Christian history the decalogue was considered a summary of God's law and standard of behaviour, central to Christian life, piety, and worship [86]\n\n\nReferences in the New Testament\nDuring his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explicitly referenced the prohibitions against murder and adultery In Matthew 19:16–19 Jesus repeated five of the Ten Commandments, followed by that commandment called \"the second\" (Matthew 22:34–40) after the first and great commandment.\n\n\nAnglicanism\nIn Anglicanism, the Articles of the Church of England, revised and altered by the Assembly of Divines, at Westminster, in the year 1643 state that \"no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral By the moral law, we understand all the Ten Commandments taken in their full extent.\" [88]\n\n\nBaptists\nBaptists believe The Ten Commandments are a summary of the requirements of a works covenant (called the \"Old Covenant\"), given on Mount Sinai to the nascent nation of Israel [89] The Old Covenant is fulfilled by Christ at the cross Unbelievers are still under the Law The law reveals man's sin and need for the salvation that is Jeshua Repentance from sin and faith in Christ for salvation is the point of the entire Bible [90] They do reflect the eternal character of God, and serve as a paragon of morality [91]\n\n\nCatholicism\nIn Catholicism it is believed that Jesus freed Christians from the rest of Jewish religious law, but not from their obligation to keep the Ten Commandments [92] It has been said that they are to the moral order what the creation story is to the natural order [92]\n\n\nLutheranism\nThe Lutheran division of the commandments follows the one established by St Augustine, following the then current synagogue scribal division The first three commandments govern the relationship between God and humans, the fourth through eighth govern public relationships between people, and the last two govern private thoughts See Luther's Small Catechism [98] and Large Catechism [58]\n\n\nMethodist\nThe moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, according to the founder of the Methodist movement John Wesley, was instituted from the beginning of the world and is written on the hearts of all people [99]\nAs with the Reformed view, [100] Wesley held that the moral law, which is contained in the Ten Commandments, stands today: [101]\n\n\nOrthodox\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church holds its moral truths to be chiefly contained in the Ten Commandments [102] A confession begins with the Confessor reciting the Ten Commandments and asking the penitent which of them he has broken [103]\n\n\nPentecostalism\nThe Pentecostal Christianity believes the Ten Commandments were given directly from God summarizing the absolutes of spiritual and moral living that God intended for his people They also attach a specific significance observing that the Feast of Pentecost commemorates the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses This view, admitted by several founders of the Pentecostal Church has passed into modern Christian ethic, where the feast is also celebrated as “the day of the giving of the Law” or Shavuot as observed by Judaic liturgical books and Jewish Christianity Pentecostals believe giving of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai fifty days after Passover and the disciples of Jesus Christ receiving the Holy Spirit of God, as foretold by Him, [104] fifty days after His Resurrection on Day of Pentecost was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah [105] symbolizing God giving His Church the gift of the Holy Spirit, where law is written, not on tablets of stone, but in their hearts Pentecostal Christianity believes that through Jesus Christ and with the exception of the Ten Commandments, they are not bound by the 613 Commandments of the Old Testament [106] and any adherence to Judaic Halakha.\n\n\nPresbyterianism\nThe Westminster Confession, held by Presbyterian Churches, holds that the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments \"does forever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof\" [107]\n\n\nProtestantism\nProtestantism, under which there are several denominations of Christianity, in general gives more importance to biblical law and the gospel, rejecting the moral theology of Roman Catholicism Early Protestant theologians continued to take the Ten Commandments as the starting point of Christian moral life [108] Different versions of Christianity have varied in how they have translated the bare principles into the specifics that make up a full Christian ethic [108]\n\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nAccording to the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jesus completed rather than rejected the Mosaic law [111] The Ten Commandments are considered eternal gospel principles necessary for exaltation [112] They appear in the Book of Mosiah 12:34–36, [113] 13:15–16, [114] 13:21–24 [115] and Doctrine and Covenants [112] According to the Book of Mosiah, a prophet named Abinadi taught the Ten Commandments in the court of King Noah and was martyred for his righteousness [116] Abinadi knew the Ten Commandments from the brass plates [117]\n\n\nIslam\nThe receiving of the Ten Commandments by Prophet Musa (Moses) is dealt with in much detail in Islamic tradition [122] with the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai described in Surah A'raf (7:142-145) The Revealing of the Tablets on which were the Commandments of God is described in the following verse:\n\n\nMoses and the Tablets\nThe receiving of the Ten Commandments by Prophet Musa (Moses) is dealt with in much detail in Islamic tradition [122] with the meeting of Moses with God on Mount Sinai described in Surah A'raf (7:142-145) The Revealing of the Tablets on which were the Commandments of God is described in the following verse:\n\n\nClassical views\nThree verses of Surah An'am (6:151–153) are widely taken to be a reinstatement (or revised version) of the Ten Commandments [125] [126] [127] either as revealed to Moses originally or as they are to be taken by Muslims now: [128]\n\n\nOther views\nThe Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk) In Christianity, it is sometimes observed on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all (non-Sabbatarianism) Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the Jewish-Roman wars onward [citation needed] The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety\" [133] Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: \"Christians must not judaize by resting on the  [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.\" [133]\n\n\nMain points of interpretative difference\nThe Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk) In Christianity, it is sometimes observed on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all (non-Sabbatarianism) Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the Jewish-Roman wars onward [citation needed] The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety\" [133] Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: \"Christians must not judaize by resting on the  [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.\" [133]\n\n\nSabbath day\nThe Abrahamic religions observe the Sabbath in various ways In Judaism it is observed on Saturday (reckoned from dusk to dusk) In Christianity, it is sometimes observed on Saturday, sometimes on Sunday, and sometimes not at all (non-Sabbatarianism) Observing the Sabbath on Sunday, the day of resurrection, gradually became the dominant Christian practice from the Jewish-Roman wars onward [citation needed] The Church's general repudiation of Jewish practices during this period is apparent in the Council of Laodicea (4th century AD) where Canons 37–38 state: \"It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them\" and \"It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety\" [133] Canon 29 of the Laodicean council specifically refers to the sabbath: \"Christians must not judaize by resting on the  [Jewish] Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honouring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians But if any shall be found to be judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.\" [133]\n\n\nKilling or murder\nMultiple translations exist of the fifth/sixth commandment; the Hebrew words לא תרצח‎ (lo tirtzach) are variously translated as \"thou shalt not kill\" or \"thou shalt not murder\" [134]\n\n\nTheft\nGerman Old Testament scholar Albrecht Alt: Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog (1953), suggested that the commandment translated as \"thou shalt not steal\" was originally intended against stealing people, against abductions and slavery, in agreement with the Talmudic interpretation of the statement as \"thou shalt not kidnap\" (Sanhedrin 86a) \n\n\nIdolatry\nIn Judaism there is a prohibition against making or worshipping an idol or a representation of God, but there is no restriction on art or simple depictions unrelated to God Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning not just representations of God, but also in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.\n\n\nAdultery\nThis commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery [142] This concept of adultery stems from a society that was not strictly monogamous, where the patriarchal economic aspect of Israelite marriage gave the husband an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband [143] [144]\n\n\nCritical historical analysis\nCritical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.\n\n\nEarly theories\nCritical scholarship is divided over its interpretation of the ten commandment texts.\n\n\n20th century discussion\nBy the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times This means that there is no longer any a priori reason to believe that Exodus 20:2–17 and Exodus 34:10–28 were composed during different stages of Israelite history.\n\n\n21st century scholarship\nScholars disagree about when the Ten Commandments were written and by whom, with some modern scholars suggesting that they were likely modeled on Hittite and Mesopotamian laws and treaties [3]: 140 \n\n\nThe Ritual Decalogue\nExodus 34:28 [161] identifies a different list, that of Exodus 34:11–27, [162] as the Ten Commandments Since this passage does not prohibit murder, adultery, theft, etc., but instead deals with the proper worship of Yahweh, some scholars call it the \"Ritual Decalogue\", and disambiguate the Ten Commandments of traditional understanding as the \"Ethical Decalogue\" [163] [164] [165] [166]\n\n\nPolitical importance\nAccording to some scholars, certain interpretations of the Commandments were allegedly problematic for people living in those respective societies during their time, [170] like capital punishment for blasphemy, idolatry, apostasy, adultery, cursing one own's parents, and Sabbath-breaking [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] [176]\n\n\nUnited States debate over display on public property\nEuropean Protestants replaced some visual art in their churches with plaques of the Ten Commandments after the Reformation In England, such \"Decalogue boards\" also represented the English monarch's emphasis on rule of royal law within the churches The United States Constitution forbids establishment of religion by law; however images of Moses holding the tablets of the Decalogue, along other religious figures including Solomon, Confucius, and Muhammad holding the Quran, are sculpted on the north and south friezes of the pediment of the Supreme Court building in Washington [181] Images of the Ten Commandments have long been contested symbols for the relationship of religion to national law [182]\n\n\nIn public schools\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court in Stone v Graham ruled unconstitutional a Kentucky statute that required the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments on the wall of each public classroom in the state, because the statute lacked a nonreligious, legislative purpose [187]\n\n\nCultural references\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by Cecil B DeMille: a 1923 silent film which stars Theodore Roberts as Moses, and a 1956 version filmed in VistaVision starring Charlton Heston as Moses.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on 22 July 2013, at 16:24 BST, in St Mary's Hospital, London, during the reign of his paternal great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n## Infancy\n\nPrince George was the first child of Prince William and Catherine, then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. His birth was announced by press release and followed by the display of a traditional easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. Celebrations were staged in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms, and the newborn was widely hailed as a future king in the majority of British newspapers. His name was announced as George Alexander Louis on 24 July.\n\nAs the first child of a future king, George's birth was a significant event for the British monarchy and the Commonwealth. The British media closely followed the developments surrounding his birth, with many outlets speculating on the potential impact he would have on the monarchy and the country as a whole. The announcement of his birth also triggered a surge in interest in British royal family and its traditions, with many people around the world taking notice of the significant role that George would play in the future of the monarchy.\n\n## Upbringing\n\nGeorge spent his first months in Anglesey, Wales, before his family relocated to Kensington Palace in 2014. In April 2014, he embarked on his first royal tour with his parents, during which they spent three weeks in New Zealand and Australia. Although George appeared only twice, the BBC described the \"nine-month-old future king\" as \"the star of the show\". The then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott predicted in the Parliament House, Canberra, that George would one day be welcomed there as King of Australia. Australian media called him \"the republican slayer\", after polls showed the lowest support for republicanism in the country for 35 years.\n\nIn June 2015, George made his first public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour parade. This marked a significant milestone in his life as a member of the royal family, as he began to take on more public roles and responsibilities.

[66] His first film of the year was P Madhavan's Shankar Salim Simon, in which he was among the three leads Following that, he co-starred alongside Vishnuvardhan in the Kannada film Kiladi Kittu He played the second lead in Annadammula Savaal, which starred Krishna; Rajinikanth reprised his role from the Kannada original He then played an important role in the supernatural thriller Aayiram Jenmangal In Maathu Tappada Maga, he was the main antagonist Bairavi, directed by M Bhaskar, was the first Tamil film to cast Rajinikanth as a solo hero [67] [68] It was for this film that he earned the sobriquet \"Superstar\" [68] S Thanu, one of the film's distributors, set up a 35 feet (11 m) high cut-out of Rajinikanth [69] His next appearance Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, a quadrangular love story written and directed by C V Sridhar, saw him play the role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan The film's success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, Vayasu Pilichindi, which retained the original cast of the Tamil film [70]\n\n\n1990–2010: superstardom\nRajinikanth began the new decade with a mega blockbuster in Panakkaran (1990), which was a remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1981 film Laawaris [96] The film earned him his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil His next two Tamil films, the fantasy comedy Athisaya Piravi, (a remake of Chiranjeevi's 1988 film Yamudiki Mogudu) which also released in 1990 and the family drama Dharmadorai (1991), did above-average business at the box office His stint with Bollywood

his eleventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the action-drama Uzhaippali.\n\n\n2011-present: career fluctuations and return to success\nIn January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K S Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time [81] During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion [135] He was treated at St Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged [136] Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever [137] He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week,

Indian actor, screenwriter, and film producer who has been active in the Indian film industry for over four decades. Born as Shivaji Rao Gaikwad on December 12, 1950, in Bangalore, Karnataka, he rose to fame with his distinctive acting style and has since become one of the most popular actors in Indian cinema.\n\nEarly Life and Background\nRajinikanth was born to a Marathi Hindu family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present-day Karnataka). His father, Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, was a police constable, and his mother was a homemaker. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers and a sister. After his father's retirement from work in 1956, the family moved to the suburb of Hanumantha Nagar in Bangalore and built a house there. Rajinikanth lost his mother at the age of nine.\n\nActing Career\n1974-1977: Early Career\nRajinikanth began his acting career in the 1970s, working as a bus conductor in Bangalore.

He took up an offer to join the Adyar Film Institute and proceeded with his acting career, although he has since lost contact with Nirmala.\n\n1978-1989: Experimentation and Breakthrough\nIn 1978, Rajinikanth had 20 releases across Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. His first film of the year was P Madhavan's Shankar Salim Simon, in which he was among the three leads. He co-starred alongside Vishnuvardhan in the Kannada film Kiladi Kittu and played the second lead in Annadammula Savaal, which starred Krishna. Rajinikanth reprised his role from the Kannada original and then played an important role in the supernatural thriller Aayiram Jenmangal. In Maathu Tappada Maga, he was the main antagonist. Bairavi, directed by M Bhaskar, was the first Tamil film to cast Rajinikanth as a solo hero and was the first to earn him the sobriquet \"Superstar.\" S Thanu, one of the film's distributors, set up a 35 feet high cut-out of Rajinikanth. His next appearance Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu, a quadrangular love story written and directed by C V Sridhar, saw him play the role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan. The film's success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, Vayasu Pilichindi, which retained the original cast of the Tamil film.\n\n1990-2010: Superstardom\nRajinikanth began the new decade with a mega blockbuster in Panakkaran (1990), which was a remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1981 film Laawaris. The film earned him his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. His next two Tamil films, the fantasy comedy Athisaya Piravi, (a remake of Chiranjeevi's 1988 film Yamudiki Mogudu) which also released in 1990 and the family drama Dharmadorai (1991), did above-average business at the box office. His stint with Bollywood continued since the past decade as he went on to star in more Hindi films. Hum released in 1991 saw him doing the second main lead with Amitabh Bachchan became an inspiration for Baashha. In 1991, he worked with Mani Ratnam in Thalapathi, which was heavily inspired by the Mahabharata in which he co-starred with actor Mammooty; the film dealt with the friendship between two unknown characters based on Karna and Duryodhana, respectively, and was set in a more contemporary milieu and was both critically acclaimed and successful upon release. He received his ninth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the film. He went on to appear in remakes of films from other languages, mostly from Hindi and Telugu. Annamalai, which released in 1992, was yet another friendship-centric film and was loosely based on the 1987 Bollywood film Khudgarz. The film was the first to have the Superstar graphic title card. He received his tenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the film Mannan, directed by P Vasu, a remake of Kannada actor Rajkumar's 1986 blockbuster Anuraga Aralithu, also was released in 1992 and became a box office success.

slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K S Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time [81] During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion [135] He was treated at St Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged [136] Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever [137] He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit [138] Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating [139] Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems [140] The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment [139] It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush

[193]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIt was speculated that Rajinikanth would enter politics in 1995 He decided against it and declared that if he entered politics now, it would result in a lot of confusion and that he would not be able to serve the people and fulfil their expectations However, he added that if Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa's party returns to power in the 1996 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, \"even God cannot save the people of the State\" [194] Rajinikanth went on to wholeheartedly support the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Tamil Maanila Congress alliance and

elections [195]\n\n\nPublic image\nRajinikanth is widely regarded as one of the most popular actors in the history of Indian cinema His popularity has been attributed to his distinctively delivered dialogue and eccentricities showcased in his movies, alongside his political pronouncements and charitable work [206] Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life [207] Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in a distinctive style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film's antagonists [208] [209]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile he was working as a bus conductor in Bangalore, Rajinikanth met a medical student named Nirmala and started a relationship After seeing him perform in a stage play, she encouraged him to pursue an acting career and

Andhra Pradesh before the release of Kuselan the following year [219] He also occasionally leaves for pilgrimage to the Himalayas [220]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nAccording to Naman Ramachandran, the author of Rajinikanth: The Definitive Biography, most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic activities went unpublicised because he chose to keep them undisclosed In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs in Tamil Nadu created a stigma towards eye donation, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches [224] In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his

Alvi and Mitra to write a new climax and invited Kumari for another day's filming The next day, while they were discussing the unexpected changes, Dutt decided to maintain it, and instead removed the Chhoti Bahu scene and \"Sahil Ki Taraf\", saying he did not mind if the film became a box-office disappointment He added it was not possible to create another scene because the changes would the audience would be confused about the film's plot [48]\n\n\nRelease\nPosters for Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam were printed by Dutt and Alvi [14] When the film was released on 29 July 1962, [45] [46] the initial audience response was negative A day after its premiere, Dutt went to Bombay's Minerva Cinema [47] and observed audiences were disappointed by the scene in which Chhoti Bahu asks for a last sip of alcohol and the song \"Sahil Ki Taraf\" that made the relationship between Chhoti Bahu and Bhoothnath ambiguous He visited the director K Asif's house and was suggested to make Chhoti Bahu

was not possible to create another scene because the changes would the audience would be confused about the film's plot [48]\n\n\nCritical response\nSahib Bibi Aur Ghulam received positive feedback from both contemporaneous and modern critics, [55] who praised the cast's performances—particularly that of Kumari—the cinematography, the costumes and the art direction [9] [56] Reviewers panned the way Chhoti Bahu is unconventionally depicted as an alcoholic woman [49] In a review dated 24 June 1962, a writer for The Times of India said the film is excellent because of its well-written screenplay that makes an effective balance between the characters and emotional sequences, and \"provides a neat dramatic pattern\" Calling the film \"a classic in celluloid\", he said it does \"a specially successful job\" though it is based on Mitra's novel, which the reviewer called untidy and with a wordy writing style [57] Kabir, who collected Dutt's handwritten letters for a book titled Yours Guru Dutt (2006), reported it is one of few reviews Dutt read during his lifetime [58]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe film won a National Film Award in the category Best Feature Film in Hindi, and at the 10th Filmfare Awards, it won Best Film, Best Director (Alvi), and Best Actress (Kumari) [65] [66] The Film Federation of India chose Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam to represent India in the Best Foreign Language Film award at the 35th Academy Awards over the Tamil-language romantic drama Nenjil Or Aalayam (1962) [67] Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam, however, failed to be nominated and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences wrote to Dutt telling him according to American culture, it was inappropriate for a woman to be an alcoholic [68] [69]\n\n\nLegacy\n\"It must have been in 1961 or 1962 I don’t remember the exact date, but it was during the filming of the final scene in Sahib Bibi  [Aur Ghulam] Jabba is waiting for Bhoothnath in a carriage in the haveli ruins That was the last time we worked together He never offered me another role after Sahib Bibi  [Aur Ghulam].\"\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Boat Service (SBS) in 2009, [20] becoming the first Gurkha to join the elite British unit [1] He served in the Special Boat Service as a cold-weather warfare specialist [1] [6] Ministry of Defence regulations prohibit Purja from discussing his activities with the SBS, however he said that he was involved in all theatres of war that Britain was involved in, and he was wounded after taking a sniper bullet that missed his neck by striking the butt of the stock of his rifle [21]\n\n\nClimbing career (2012–present)\nHe made his first major Himalayan climb in 2012, reaching the summit of Lobuche East with no previous experience as a mountaineer On 18 May 2014, he made his first ascent of an eight-thousander by summiting Dhaulagiri (8,167 metres) during a return trip of only 15 days [25] On 13 May 2016, Purja summited Mount Everest, his second eight-thousander [25]\n\n\nEarly Himalayan ascents\nHe made his first major Himalayan climb in 2012, reaching the summit of Lobuche East with no previous experience as a mountaineer On 18 May 2014, he made his first ascent of an eight-thousander by summiting Dhaulagiri (8,167 metres) during a return trip of only 15 days [25] On 13 May

Sherpa, Pem Chiri Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa and himself, joined by the team of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa (Mingma G), Dawa Tenjin Sherpa and Kilu Pemba Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa from Seven Summits Treks successfully ascended K2 at 16:58 local time in Pakistan [45] [17] [18] [19] This is the first successful K2 winter expedition after numerous attempts since 1987 Purja was the only team member to reach the summit without using supplemental oxygen, becoming the first person to do so in winter [46] [47]\n\n\nFurther achievements\nIn May 2022, Purja set a new speed record for ascending Kangchenjunga, Mount Everest, and Lhotse consecutively without oxygen, with a time of 8 days 23 hours, and 10 minutes He ascended Kangchenjunga on 7 May at 10:50 am, Mount Everest on 15 May at 8 am

{"title": "1958_Lituya_Bay_earthquake_and_megatsunami", "content": "\nEvent outline\nLituya Bay is a fjord located on the Fairweather Fault in the northeastern part of the Gulf of Alaska It is a T-shaped bay with a width of 2 miles (3 km) and a length of 7 miles (11 km) [8] Lituya Bay is an ice-scoured tidal inlet with a maximum depth of 722 feet (220 m) The narrow entrance of the bay has a depth of only 33 feet (10 m) [8] The two arms that create the top of the T-shape of the bay are the Gilbert and Crillon inlets and are a part of a trench on the Fairweather Fault [10]\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe major earthquake that struck on the Fairweather Fault had a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale The epicenter of the quake was at latitude 58.37° N, longitude 136.67° W near the Fairweather Range, 7.5 miles (12.1 km) east of the surface trace of the Fairweather fault, and 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Lituya Bay This earthquake was the strongest in over 50 years for this region, since the Cape Yakataga earthquake on September 3, 1899, which was estimated to be magnitude 8.2 on the Richter scale [6] The shock was felt in southeastern Alaskan cities over an area of 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km2), as far south as Seattle, Washington, and as far east as Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada [10]\n\n\nRockfall\nThe earthquake caused a subaerial rockfall in the Gilbert Inlet [10] Over 30 million cubic meters of rock fell from a height of several hundred meters into the bay, creating a megatsunami [8] The impact of the rockslide included the creation of wave run up that shaved up to 400m of ice off the front of the Lituya Glacier and eroded or completely eradicated its rocky deltas [13] After the earthquake it was observed that a subglacial lake, located northwest of the bend in the Lituya Glacier at the head of Lituya Bay, had dropped 100 ft (30 m) This proposed another possible cause to the production of the 100 ft (30 m) wave which caused destruction as high as 1,720 ft (520 m) above the surface of the bay as its momentum carried it upslope The wave caused damage to the vegetation up the headlands around the area where the rockfall occurred, up to a height of 524 meters, as well as along the shoreline of the bay [8] It is possible that a good amount of water drained from the glacial lake through a glacial tunnel flowing directly in front of the glacier, though neither the rate of drainage nor the volume of water drained could produce a wave of such magnitude [10] Even if a large enough drainage were to take place in front of the Gilbert Glacier, the run-off would have been projected to be on the opposite side in Crillon Inlet After these considerations it was determined that glacial drainage was not the mechanism that caused the giant wave [10]\n\n\nMegatsunami\nThe Lituya Bay megatsunami caused damage at higher elevations than any other tsunami, being powerful enough to push water up the tree covered slopes of the fjord with enough force to clear trees to a reported height of 524 m (1,719 ft) [9] A 1:675 recreation of the tsunami found the wave crest was 150 m (490 ft) tall [14] Five people were killed, many people were injured, and many homes destroyed [9] Two people on a fishing boat died from a wave in the bay Two more persons, a fishing boat captain and his seven-year-old son, were struck by the wave and lifted hundreds of feet into the air by the swell Remarkably, both survived with minimal injuries [6] In Yakutat, the only permanent settlement close to the epicenter at the time, infrastructure such as bridges, docks, and oil lines all sustained damage A wave tower collapsed and a cabin was damaged beyond repair Sand boils and fissures occurred near the coast southeast of there, and underwater cables that supported the Alaska Communication System were cut [6] Lighter damage was also reported in Pelican and Sitka It ripped limbs off trees and swept many away, decimating the shoreline's surrounding forest and leaving the high tide line barren and with few upright surviving trees except on the northern and southern edges [11] [15] The megatsunami flooded the entire bay and created a damage line up to 213 m (699 ft) around the outline of the bay, with evidence of this damage line still visible from space to this day [16]\n\n\nEyewitness accounts\nAt 22:15 hours PST on July 9, 1958, which was still daylight at that time of year, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck the Lituya Bay area The tide was ebbing at about plus 1.5 m and the weather was clear Anchored in a cove near the west side of the entrance of the bay, Bill and Vivian Swanson were on their boat fishing when the earthquake hit: [8]\n\n\nSwanson account\nAt 22:15 hours PST on July 9, 1958, which was still daylight at that time of year, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck the Lituya Bay area The tide was ebbing at about plus 1.5 m and the weather was clear Anchored in a cove near the west side of the entrance of the bay, Bill and Vivian Swanson were on their boat fishing when the earthquake hit: [8]\n\n\nUlrich account\nWhen the earthquake struck, Howard G Ulrich and his 7-year-old son were in Lituya Bay aboard their boat, the Edrie They were anchored in a small inlet on the southern side of the bay The two had gone out on the water at 20:00 hours PST and when the earthquake hit, the resulting rocking of his boat woke Ulrich up He observed the wave's formation from the deck, hearing a very loud smash at the base of Lituya Bay In his record of the wave he notes the appearance of it and how it formed: [11]\n\n\nEvidence of past events\nFour or five megatsunamis are believed to have occurred at Lituya Bay during a 150-year period: [17] [18]\n\n\nOngoing debate\nThere is an ongoing debate in scholarly circles regarding whether the megatsunami was a result of the rockfall generated

Megatsunami**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 1958 Lituya Bay earthquake and megatsunami was a devastating natural disaster that occurred on July 9, 1958, in Lituya Bay, Alaska. The event was triggered by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck the Fairweather Fault, causing a massive rockfall and subsequent megatsunami that affected the surrounding area. This article will provide an in-depth examination of the event, including its causes, effects, and aftermath.\n\n**Event Outline**\n\nLituya Bay is a fjord located on the Fairweather Fault in the northeastern part of the Gulf of Alaska. It is a T-shaped bay with a width of 2 miles (3 km) and a length of 7 miles (11 km). The bay is an ice-scoured tidal inlet with a maximum depth of 722 feet (220 m). The narrow entrance of the bay has a depth of only 33 feet (10 m).\n\nThe two arms that create the top of the T-shape of the bay are the Gilbert and Crillon inlets and are a part of a trench on the Fairweather Fault.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe major earthquake that struck on the Fairweather Fault had a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter of the quake was at latitude 58.37° N, longitude 136.67° W near the Fairweather Range, 7.5 miles (12.1 km) east of the surface trace of the Fairweather fault, and 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Lituya Bay.\n\nThis earthquake was the strongest in over 50 years for this region, since the Cape Yakataga earthquake on September 3, 1899, which was estimated to be magnitude 8.2 on the Richter scale. The shock was felt in southeastern Alaskan cities over an area of 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km2), as far south as Seattle, Washington, and as far east as Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada.\n\n**Rockfall**\n\nThe earthquake caused a subaerial rockfall in the Gilbert Inlet. Over 30 million cubic meters of rock fell from a height of several hundred meters into the bay, creating a megatsunami. The impact of the rockslide included the creation of wave run up that shaved up to 400m of ice off the front of the Lituya Glacier and eroded or completely eradicated its rocky deltas.\n\nAfter the earthquake, it was observed that a subglacial lake, located northwest of the bend in the Lituya Glacier at the head of Lituya Bay, had dropped 100 ft (30 m). This proposed another possible cause to the production of the 100 ft (30 m) wave which caused destruction as high as 1,720 ft (520 m) above the surface of the bay as its momentum carried it upslope.\n\nThe wave caused damage to the vegetation up the headlands around the area where the rockfall occurred, up to a height of 524 meters, as well as along the shoreline of the bay. It is possible that a good amount of water drained from the glacial lake through a glacial tunnel flowing directly in front of the glacier, though neither the rate of drainage nor the volume of water drained could produce a wave of such magnitude.\n\n**Megatsunami**\n\nThe Lituya Bay megatsunami caused damage at higher elevations than any other tsunami, being powerful enough to push water up the tree-covered slopes of the fjord with enough force to clear trees to a reported height of 524 m (1,719 ft). A 1:675 recreation of the tsunami found the wave crest was 150 m (490 ft) tall.\n\nFive people were killed, many people were injured, and many homes destroyed. Two people on a fishing boat died from a wave in the bay. Two more persons, a fishing boat captain and his seven-year-old son, were struck by the wave and lifted hundreds of feet into the air by the swell. Remarkably, both survived with minimal injuries.\n\nIn Yakutat, the only permanent settlement close to the epicenter at the time, infrastructure such as bridges, docks, and oil lines all sustained damage. A wave tower collapsed and a cabin was damaged beyond repair. Sand boils and fissures occurred near the coast southeast of there, and underwater cables that supported the Alaska Communication System were cut.\n\nLighter damage was also reported in Pelican and Sitka. It ripped limbs off trees and swept many away, decimating the shoreline's surrounding forest and leaving the high tide line barren and with few upright surviving trees except on the northern and southern edges.\n\nThe megatsunami flooded the entire bay and created a damage line up to 213 m (699 ft) around the outline of the bay, with evidence of this damage line still visible from space to this day.\n\n**Eyewitness Accounts**\n\nAt 22:15 hours PST on July 9, 1958, which was still daylight at that time of year, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck the Lituya Bay area. The tide was ebbing at about plus 1.5 m and the weather was clear.\n\nAnchored in a cove near the west side of the entrance of the bay, Bill and Vivian Swanson were on their boat fishing when the earthquake hit. They reported feeling the earthquake strongly and were aware of the resulting wave.\n\nHoward G. Ulrich and his seven-year-old son were in Lituya Bay aboard their boat, the Edrie, when the earthquake struck. They were anchored in a small inlet on the southern side of the bay. The two had gone out on the water at 20:00 hours PST and when the earthquake hit, the resulting rocking of his boat woke Ulrich up.\n\nUlrich observed the wave's formation from the deck, hearing a very loud smash at the base of Lituya Bay. In his record of the wave, he notes the appearance of it and how it formed, providing a valuable eyewitness account of the event.\n\n**Evidence of Past Events**\n\nFour or five megatsunamis are believed to have occurred at Lituya Bay during a 150-year period. These events demonstrate the potential for destructive megatsunamis in the area, with the 1958 event being the most well-documented.\n\n**Ongoing Debate**\n\nThere is an ongoing debate in scholarly circles regarding whether the megatsunami was a result of the rockfall generated by the earthquake, or a result of the earthquake itself. Various analyses to determine the true cause have been conducted.\n\n**1999 Analysis**\n\nThe mechanism giving rise to megatsunamis was analyzed for the Lituya Bay event in a study presented at the Tsunami Society in 1999. The study concluded that the megatsunami was likely caused by a combination of factors, including the rockfall and the earthquake.\n\n**2010 Analysis**\n\nA 2010 model examined the amount of infill on the floor of the bay, which was many times larger than that of the rockfall alone, as well as the energy and height of the waves. Scientists concluded that there had been a \"dual slide\" involving a rockfall which also triggered a release of 5 to 10 times its volume of sediment trapped by the adjacent Lituya Glacier, a ratio comparable with other events where this \"dual slide\" effect is known to have happened.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Lituya Bay\n* Fairweather Fault\n* Tsunami\n* Megatsunami\n* Earthquake\n\n**Further

and a length of 7 miles (11 km) [8] Lituya Bay is an ice-scoured tidal inlet with a maximum depth of 722 feet (220 m) The narrow entrance of the bay has a depth of only 33 feet (10 m) [8] The two arms that create the top of the T-shape of the bay are the Gilbert and Crillon inlets and are a part of a trench on the Fairweather Fault [10]\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe major earthquake that struck on the Fairweather Fault had a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale The epicenter of the quake was at latitude 58.37° N, longitude 136.67° W near the Fairweather Range, 7.5 miles (12.1 km) east of the surface trace of the Fairweather fault, and 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Lituya Bay This earthquake was the strongest in over 50 years for this region, since the Cape Yakataga earthquake on September 3, 1899, which was estimated to be magnitude 8.2 on the Richter scale [6] The shock was felt in southeastern Alaskan cities over an area of 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km2), as far south as Seattle, Washington, and as far east as Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada [10]\n\n\nRockfall\nThe earthquake caused a subaerial rockfall in the Gilbert Inlet [10] Over 30 million cubic meters of rock fell from a height of several hundred meters into the bay, creating a megatsunami [8] The impact of the rockslide included the creation of wave run up that shaved up to 400m of ice off the front of the Lituya Glacier and eroded or completely eradicated its rocky deltas [13] After the earthquake it was observed that a subglacial lake, located northwest of the bend in the Lituya Glacier at the head of Lituya Bay, had dropped 100 ft (30 m) This proposed another possible cause to the production of the 100 ft (30 m) wave which caused destruction as high as 1,720 ft (520 m) above the surface of the bay as its momentum carried it upslope The wave caused damage to the vegetation up the headlands around the area where the rockfall occurred, up to a height of 524 meters, as well as along the shoreline of the bay [8] It is possible that a good amount of water drained from the glacial lake through a glacial tunnel flowing directly in front of the glacier, though neither the rate of drainage nor the volume of water drained could produce a wave of such magnitude [10] Even if a large enough drainage were to take place in front of the Gilbert Glacier, the run-off would have been projected to be on the opposite side in Crillon Inlet After these considerations it was determined that glacial drainage was not the mechanism that caused the giant wave [10]\n\n\nMegatsunami\nThe Lituya Bay megatsunami caused damage at higher elevations than any other tsunami, being powerful enough to push water up the tree covered slopes of the fjord with enough force to clear trees to a reported height of 524 m (1,719 ft) [9] A 1:675 recreation of the tsunami found the wave crest was 150 m (490 ft) tall [14] Five people were killed, many

shoreline's surrounding forest and leaving the high tide line barren and with few upright surviving trees except on the northern and southern edges [11] [15] The megatsunami flooded the entire bay and created a damage line up to 213 m (699 ft) around the outline of the bay, with evidence of this damage line still visible from space to this day [16]\n\n\nEyewitness accounts\nAt 22:15 hours PST on

{"title": "Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "content": "\nEarly life\nVolodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy was born to Jewish parents on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, then in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic [30] [31] [32] His father, Oleksandr Zelenskyy, is a professor and computer scientist and the head of the Department of Cybernetics and Computing Hardware at the Kryvyi Rih State University of Economics and Technology; his mother, Rymma Zelenska, is a retired engineer [33] [34] [35] His grandfather, Semyon Zelenskyy  [uk], served as an infantryman, reaching the rank of colonel in the Red Army (in the 57th Guards Motor Rifle Division) during World War II; [36] [37] Semyon's father and three brothers were killed in the Holocaust [38] [39] [40] [41] In March 2022, Zelenskyy said that his great-grandparents had been killed after German troops burned their home to the ground during a massacre [42] His grandmother survived World War II after leaving Kryvyi Rih in an evacuation of Jews to Almaty, Kazakhstan, and returned to Ukraine after the war [43]\n\n\nEntertainment career\nAt age 17, he joined his local team competing in the KVN comedy competition [48] He was soon invited to join the united Ukrainian team \"Zaporizhzhia-Kryvyi Rih-Transit,\" which performed in the KVN's Major League and eventually won in 1997 [30] [49] [50] That same year, he created and headed the Kvartal 95 team, which later transformed into the comedy outfit Kvartal 95 From 1998 to 2003, Kvartal 95 performed in the Major League and the highest open Ukrainian league of KVN, and the team members spent a lot of time in Moscow and constantly toured around post-Soviet countries [30] [49] In 2003, Kvartal 95 started producing TV shows for the Ukrainian TV channel 1+1, and in 2005, the team moved to fellow Ukrainian TV channel Inter [30]\n\n\n2019 presidential campaign\nIn March 2018, members of Zelenskyy's production company Kvartal 95 registered a new political party called Servant of the People – the same name as the television program that Zelenskyy had starred in over the previous three years [66] [67] Although Zelenskyy denied any immediate plans to enter politics and said he had registered the party name only to prevent it being appropriated by others, [68] there was widespread speculation that he was planning to run As early as October 2018, three months before his campaign announcement and six months before the presidential election, he was already a frontrunner in opinion polls [69] [67] After months of ambiguous statements, [68] [67] on 31 December, less than four months from the election, Zelenskyy announced his candidacy for president of Ukraine on the New Year's Eve evening show on the TV channel 1+1 [70] His announcement up-staged the New Year's Eve address of incumbent president Petro Poroshenko on the same channel, [70] which Zelenskyy said was unintentional and attributed to a technical glitch [71]\n\n\nPresidency\nZelenskyy was inaugurated on 20 May 2019 [102] Various foreign officials attended the ceremony in Ukraine's parliament (Verkhovna Rada), including Salome Zourabichvili (Georgia), Kersti Kaljulaid (Estonia), Raimonds Vējonis (Latvia), Dalia Grybauskaitė (Lithuania), János Áder (Hungary), Maroš Šefčovič (EU), and Rick Perry (United States) [103] Zelenskyy is the first Jewish president of Ukraine; with Volodymyr Groysman as prime minister, Ukraine became the first country other than Israel to simultaneously have a Jewish head of state and head of government [32]\n\n\nCabinets and administration\nZelenskyy appointed Andriy Bohdan as head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine Before this, Bohdan had been the lawyer of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi [126] Under the rules of Lustration in Ukraine, introduced in 2014 following Euromaidan, Bohdan is not entitled to hold any state office until 2024 (because of his government post during the Second Azarov Government) [127] Bohdan, however, contended that because heading the presidential administration is not considered civil service work, lustration did not apply to him [128] A number of the members of the Presidential Administration Zelenskyy appointed were former colleagues from his former production company, Kvartal 95, [126] including Ivan Bakanov, who became deputy head of the Ukrainian Secret Service (SBU) [129] Former deputy foreign minister Olena Zerkal declined an appointment as deputy head of the presidential administration, but did agree to serve as the Ukrainian representative of the international courts concerning Russia [130] Zelenskyy's requests to replace the foreign minister, defence minister, chief prosecutor and head of Ukraine's security service were rejected by parliament [131] [132] Zelenskyy also dismissed and replaced 20 of the governors of Ukraine's 24 oblasts [133]\n\n\nHoncharuk government\nIn the 21 July 2019 parliamentary election, Zelenskyy's political party, Servant of the People, won the first single-party majority in modern Ukrainian history in parliament, with 43 percent of the party-list vote His party gained 254 of the 424 seats [134]\n\n\nShmyhal government\nIn March 2020, Honchurak resigned as prime minister following the leak of an audio recording in which he appeared to belittle Zelenskyy's economic management Honchurak was replaced as prime minister Denys Shmyhal [139] Honchurak's hasty departure caused disquiet both in Ukraine and abroad, with many economists and political observers warning it would bring instability [140] In his 4 March address to the Rada, [141] Zelenskyy recommitted to reforms domestic and financial, and remarked that he \"cannot always become a psychologist for people, a crisis manager for someone, a collector who requires honestly earned money, and a nanny of the ministry in charge.\" [citation needed] By September 2020, Zelenskyy's approval ratings had fallen to less than 32 percent [142]\n\n\nAttempts to end the Donbas conflict\nOne of Zelenskyy's central campaign promises had been to end the Russo-Ukrainian War and resolve the Russia-sponsored separatist movement there [144] On 3 June, Zelenskyy appointed former president Leonid Kuchma as Ukraine's representative in the Tripartite Contact Group for a settlement in the conflict [145] On 11 July 2019, Zelenskyy held his first telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin, during which he urged Putin to enter into talks mediated by EU [146] [147] The two leaders also discussed the exchange of prisoners held by both sides [147] In October 2019, Zelenskyy announced a preliminary deal struck with the separatists, under which the Ukrainian government would respect elections held in the region in exchange for Russia withdrawing its unmarked troops [144] The deal was met with heavy criticism and protests by both politicians and the Ukrainian public Detractors noted that elections held in Donbas were unlikely to be free and fair, that the separatists had long driven most pro-Ukrainian residents out of the region to ensure a pro-Russia majority, and that it would be impossible to ensure Russia kept its end of the agreement [144] Zelenskyy defended his negotiations, saying the elections would not be held before a Russian withdrawal [148] The agreement failed to ease the conflict, as the separatists continued their attacks and Russia continued providing them with weapons and ammunition [149] Several Ukrainian nationalist militias and former militias also refused to accept the agreement, including the far-right Azov fighters in the Luhansk region of Donbas Zelenskyy met personally with some of these groups and tried to convince them to surrender their unregistered weapons and accept the peace accord Andriy Biletsky, the leader of the far-right National Corps and first commander of Azov, accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful to army veterans and of acting on behalf of the Kremlin by leaving Ukrainians vulnerable to Russian aggression [150] [151] Ultimately, the peace deal failed to reduce the violence, much less end the war [149]\n\n\nUIA Flight 752\nOn 8 January 2020, the Presidential Office announced that Volodymyr Zelenskyy was cutting short his trip to Oman owing to the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 plane crash in nearby Iran the same day [155] Also on the same day, internet news site Obozrevatel.com released information that on 7 January 2020, Ukrainian politician of the Opposition Platform — For Life Medvedchuk – who has exclusive relations with the current president of Russia – may have arrived in Oman [156] [157] Soon, rumors began that Zelenskyy may have had some additional meetings beside the ones that were announced [158] On 14 January 2020, Yermak dismissed the rumors as speculations and baseless conspiracy theories, [159] while Medvedchuk stated that the plane was used by his older daughter's family to fly from Oman to Moscow [160] Later, Yermak contacted the on-line newspaper Ukrainian Truth and gave more details about the visit to Oman and the plane crash in Iran [161]\n\n\nForeign relations\nZelenskyy's first official trip abroad as president was to Brussels in June 2019, where he met with EU and NATO officials [165]\n\n\n2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis\nIn April 2021, in response to Russian military build-up at the Ukrainian borders, Zelenskyy spoke to American president Joe Biden and urged NATO members to speed up Ukraine's request for membership [177]\n\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\nOn the morning of 24 February, Putin announced that Russia was initiating a \"special military operation\" in the Donbas Russian missiles struck a number of military targets in Ukraine, and Zelenskyy declared martial law [192] Zelenskyy also announced that diplomatic relations with Russia were being severed, effective immediately [193] Later in the day, he announced general mobilisation [194] On 25 February, Zelenskyy said that despite Russia's claim that it was targeting only military sites, civilian sites were also being hit [195] In an early morning address that day, Zelenskyy said that his intelligence services had identified him as Russia's top target, but that he is staying in Kyiv and his family will remain in the country \"They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,\" he said [196] In the early hours of 26 February, during the most significant assault by Russian troops on the capital of Kyiv, the United States government and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged Zelenskyy to evacuate to a safer location, and both offered assistance for such an effort Zelenskyy turned down both offers and opted to remain in Kyiv with its defense forces, saying that \"the fight is here  [in Kyiv]; I need ammunition, not a ride.\" [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nPhase 1: invasion of Ukraine 2022, 24 February – 7 April\nOn the morning of 24 February, Putin announced that Russia was initiating a \"special military operation\" in the Donbas Russian missiles struck a number of military targets in Ukraine, and Zelenskyy declared martial law [192] Zelenskyy also announced that diplomatic relations with Russia were being severed, effective immediately [193] Later in the day, he announced general mobilisation [194] On 25 February, Zelenskyy said that despite Russia's claim that it was targeting only military sites, civilian sites were also being hit [195] In an early morning address that day, Zelenskyy said that his intelligence services had identified him as Russia's top target, but that he is staying in Kyiv and his family will remain in the country \"They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,\" he said [196] In the early hours of 26 February,

and both offered assistance for such an effort Zelenskyy turned down both offers and opted to remain in Kyiv with its defense forces, saying that \"the fight is here  [in Kyiv]; I need ammunition, not a ride.\" [197] [198] [199]\n\n\nPhase 2: South-Eastern front 2022, 8 April – 5 September\nIn April 2022, Zelenskyy criticized Germany's ties with Russia [246] In May 2022, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian men of conscription age had a duty to remain in Ukraine [247] As Zelenskyy ordered a general military mobilization in February 2022, he also banned men aged 18 to 60 from leaving Ukraine [248] [249]\n\n\nPhase 3: counteroffensive and annexations 2022, 6 September – 31 December\nSpeaking about the 2022 Russian mobilization, Zelenskyy called on Russians to not submit to \"criminal

Zelenskyy is a Ukrainian politician and comedian who has been serving as the President of Ukraine since 2019. He is the founder of the Kvartal 95 studio, which produced several popular TV shows and movies.\n\n**Early life**\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy was born on January 25, 1978, in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine, to Jewish parents. His father, Oleksandr Zelenskyy, is a professor and computer scientist, and his mother, Rymma Zelenska, is a retired engineer. Zelenskyy's grandfather, Semyon Zelenskyy, served as an infantryman in the Red Army during World War II and reached the rank of colonel. Zelenskyy's family has a long history of military service, with his great-grandparents and three uncles being killed in the Holocaust.\n\n**Entertainment career**\n\nAt the age of 17, Zelenskyy joined his local team competing in the KVN comedy competition. He was soon invited to join the united Ukrainian team \"Zaporizhzhia-Kryvyi Rih-Transit,\" which performed in the KVN's Major League and eventually won in 1997. Zelenskyy created and headed the Kvartal 95 team, which later transformed into the comedy outfit Kvartal 95. From 1998 to 2003, Kvartal 95 performed in the Major League and the highest open Ukrainian league of KVN, and the team members spent a lot of time in Moscow and constantly toured around post-Soviet countries.\n\n**2019 presidential campaign**\n\nIn March 2018, members of Zelenskyy's production company Kvartal 95 registered a new political party called Servant of the People, which was the same name as the television program that Zelenskyy had starred in over the previous three years. Although Zelenskyy denied any immediate plans to enter politics and said he had registered the party name only to prevent it being appropriated by others, there was widespread speculation that he was planning to run. As early as October 2018, three months before his campaign announcement and six months before the presidential election, he was already a frontrunner in opinion polls.\n\n**Presidency**\n\nZelenskyy was inaugurated on May 20, 2019.

Under the rules of Lustration in Ukraine, introduced in 2014 following Euromaidan, Bohdan is not entitled to hold any state office until 2024. Bohdan, however, contended that because heading the presidential administration is not considered civil service work, lustration did not apply to him. A number of the members of the Presidential Administration Zelenskyy appointed were former colleagues from his former production company, Kvartal 95, including Ivan Bakanov, who became deputy head of the Ukrainian Secret Service (SBU).\n\n**Honcharuk government**\n\nIn the 21 July 2019 parliamentary election, Zelenskyy's political party, Servant of the People, won the first single-party majority in modern Ukrainian history in parliament, with 43 percent of the party-list vote.

Honchurak was replaced as prime minister by Denys Shmyhal.\n\n**Attempts to end the Donbas conflict**\n\nOne of Zelenskyy's central campaign promises had been to end the Russo-Ukrainian War and resolve the Russia-sponsored separatist movement in Donbas. On 3 June, Zelenskyy appointed former president Leonid Kuchma as Ukraine's representative in the Tripartite Contact Group for a settlement in the conflict.

Volodymyr Groysman as prime minister, Ukraine became the first country other than Israel to simultaneously have a Jewish head of state and head of government [32]\n\n\nCabinets and administration\nZelenskyy appointed Andriy Bohdan as head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine Before this, Bohdan had been the lawyer of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi [126] Under the rules of Lustration in Ukraine, introduced in 2014 following Euromaidan, Bohdan is not entitled to hold any state office until 2024 (because of his government post during the Second Azarov Government) [127] Bohdan, however, contended that because heading the presidential administration is not considered civil service work, lustration did not apply to him [128] A number of the members of the

telephone conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin, during which he urged Putin to enter into talks mediated by EU [146] [147] The two leaders also discussed the exchange of prisoners held by both sides [147] In October 2019, Zelenskyy announced a preliminary deal struck with the separatists, under which the Ukrainian government would respect elections held in the region in exchange for Russia withdrawing its unmarked troops [144] The deal was met with heavy criticism and protests by both politicians and the Ukrainian public Detractors noted that elections held in Donbas were unlikely to be free and fair, that the separatists had long driven most pro-Ukrainian residents out of the region to ensure a pro-Russia majority, and that it would be impossible to ensure Russia kept

[147] [148] [149] A note at the end of the special stated that Carter has \"denied the allegations and questions his accusers' credibility.\" He also declined to be interviewed for the documentary.\n\n\nSubstance abuse\nCarter has acknowledged ongoing struggles with drug and alcohol abuse He revealed that he started drinking when he was just two years old and again at nine [151] He

The caucuses are a crucial event in the Republican presidential nomination process, and they have been a key test of candidates' viability since 1972.\n\n**Background and Electorate**\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have been characterized as the first major electoral test for Republican presidential contenders. Despite its strategic importance, between 1976 and 2016, only three out of eight winners of the Iowa caucuses went on to receive the Republican presidential nomination. This has led some to argue that the caucuses are more of a curiosity than a decisive factor in the nomination process.\n\nThe electorate in Iowa is predominantly white, with a median age of around 50 years old. According to a 2020 survey, 71% of Iowa Republicans identify as conservative, and 63% identify as born-again Christians. The state's Republican Party has historically been dominated by socially conservative elements, which has led some to argue that the Iowa caucuses effectively serve as \"referendums on who is the most socially conservative candidate\" in the Republican field.\n\n**History of the Iowa Caucus**\n\nThe Iowa caucuses have a long history dating back to 1972, when they were first held as part of the Republican Party's national convention. The caucuses were initially seen as a way to allow party activists to participate in the nomination process, and they quickly gained popularity as a way for candidates to test their viability.\n\nOver the years, the Iowa caucuses have become increasingly important in the Republican nomination process. In 1976, the winner of the Iowa caucuses, Gerald Ford, went on to win the Republican nomination. However, since then, only two other winners of the Iowa caucuses have gone on to win the nomination: George H.W. Bush in 1988 and Mike Huckabee in 2008.\n\n**Republican Electorate**\n\nThe Republican electorate in Iowa is characterized as being predominantly white, socially conservative, and overwhelmingly Christian. According to a 2020 survey, 71% of Iowa Republicans identify as conservative, and 63% identify as born-again Christians. This has led some to argue that the Iowa caucuses effectively serve as \"referendums on who is the most socially conservative candidate\" in the Republican field.\n\nThe Republican Party in Iowa is also characterized as being overwhelmingly male, with 61% of registered Republicans identifying as male. This has led some to argue that the party's leadership is out of touch with the experiences and concerns of women.\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe Iowa caucuses are a unique form of election in which party activists gather in person to vote and engage in discussions about the candidates. The process is typically divided into three stages: the preference poll, the realignment, and the final tally.\n\nIn the first stage, party activists gather in person to vote for their preferred candidate. The results of this stage are then used to determine how many delegates each candidate will receive. The second stage, the realignment, involves party activists who do not support any of the candidates who have reached the threshold of 15% of the vote. These individuals are given the option to either support a candidate who has reached the threshold or to withdraw from the process. The final stage, the final tally, involves counting the votes of all party activists who participated in the caucuses.\n\n**Campaign Developments**\n\nIn February 2023, the Trump campaign announced its Iowa campaign staff, with state representative Bobby Kaufmann and consultant Eric Branstad, the son of former Governor Terry Branstad, serving as senior advisors. In March 2023, Trump's campaign announced that it would hold an \"America First Education Policy\" event in Davenport on March 13, marking his first official campaign appearance in the state.\n\nTrump's campaign has also been actively courting endorsements from prominent Iowa Republicans, including Governor Kim Reynolds and Senator Chuck Grassley. The campaign has also been engaged in a series of television ads and social media campaigns aimed at boosting Trump's profile in the state.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral prominent Iowa Republicans have endorsed Trump for the presidency, including:\n\n* Governor Kim Reynolds: Reynolds has been a strong supporter of Trump, and has endorsed him for the presidency.\n* Senator Chuck Grassley: Grassley has also endorsed Trump, and has been a vocal supporter of his candidacy.\n* Representative Ashley Hinson: Hinson has been a strong supporter of Trump, and has endorsed him for the presidency.\n\n**Polling**\n\nAggregate polling data from Iowa shows a tight contest between Trump and his closest rival, Ron DeSantis. A recent poll conducted by CNN/SSRS found that 34% of likely Republican voters in Iowa support Trump, while 26% support DeSantis. The same poll found that 21% of likely Republican voters in Iowa are undecided.\n\n**Results**\n\nJust minutes after the caucus events started at 7 pm local time, Trump was projected to win the most votes by the Associated Press. Trump received 20 delegates, DeSantis nine, Haley eight, and Ramaswamy three. Barring any shifts in votes after the conclusion of the Iowa Republican Party's ongoing recanvass of the caucus results, Trump won all of Iowa's counties except for Johnson County, which he lost to Haley by one vote.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Iowa Democratic Presidential Caucuses\n* Republican Party (United States)\n\n**Notes**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_Iowa_Republican_presidential_caucuses\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground and electorate\nBeginning in 1972, the Iowa caucuses have been characterized as the first major electoral test for Republican presidential contenders [11] Despite its strategic importance, between 1976 and 2016, only three out of eight winners of the Iowa caucuses went on to receive the Republican presidential nomination [12]\n\n\nHistory of the Iowa caucus\nBeginning in 1972, the Iowa caucuses have been characterized as the first major electoral test for Republican presidential contenders [11] Despite its strategic importance, between 1976 and 2016, only three out of eight winners of the Iowa caucuses went on to receive the Republican presidential nomination [12]\n\n\nRepublican electorate\nIt has been argued that the Iowa Republican caucuses effectively serve as \"referendums on who is the most socially conservative candidate\" in the Republican field [12]\n\n\nProcedure\nDelegates are proportionally allocated to candidates based on the statewide vote Unlike most states, there is no minimum threshold for a candidate to be eligible for delegates [19]\n\n\nCampaign developments\nIn February 2023, the Trump campaign announced its Iowa campaign staff, with state representative Bobby Kaufmann and consultant Eric Branstad, the son of former Governor Terry Branstad, serving as senior advisors [20] In March 2023, Trump's campaign announced that it would hold an \"America First Education Policy\" event in Davenport on March 13, marking his first official campaign appearance in the state [21] [22]\n\n\nEndorsements\nGovernors\n\n\nPolling\nAggregate polls\n\n\nResults\nJust minutes after the caucus events started at 7 pm local time, Trump was projected to win the most votes by the Associated Press [129] Trump received 20 delegates, DeSantis nine, Haley eight, and Ramaswamy three [130] Barring any shifts in votes after the conclusion of the Iowa Republican Party's ongoing recanvass of the caucus results, [131] Trump won all of Iowa's counties except for Johnson County, which he lost to Haley by one vote [130]\n\n\nSee also\nPartisan clients\n\n\nNotes\nPartisan clients\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[56] a story told in flashback reveals how Maximus, using a creation called the Trikon, forced Black Bolt from Attilan Black Bolt, however, eventually defeats the Trikon and regains the throne [57] After aiding the teen super group the New Warriors, [58] the Royal Family joins forces with X-Factor to stop master villain Apocalypse [59]\n\n\n2000s\nThe character is featured—again with the Royal Family—in a third self-titled limited series that has major developments for the Inhumans Ronan the Accuser leads the Kree in a surprise attack, capturing Attilan and forcing the Royal Family into service against Kree enemies the Shi'ar Karnak, Gorgon, and Triton covertly join the Shi'ar Imperial Guard while Black Bolt and Medusa must attempt the assassination of the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the Spartoi Although the attempt fails and Black Bolt manages to defeat Ronan in personal combat, the Inhuman people choose to leave with the Kree and pursue a new future This leaves Black Bolt and the Royal Family alone to fend for themselves [76]\n\n\n2010s\nHe in fact survived the explosion It was revealed that Black Bolt likely represents the anomaly of the Kree Inhuman genetics program that had been predicted hundreds of thousands of years ago The genetic prophecy was that this anomaly would bring about the end of the Supreme Intelligence To prevent this outcome, the Kree Supreme Intelligence had ordered the destruction of all the worlds where the genetic experiments took place Only five colonies escaped, including Earth's: these were the Universal Inhumans After his return to Attilan, Black Bolt joined the Universal Inhumans and was presented with four new brides, one from each of the other colonies [93]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nBlack Bolt's Terrigen-mutated physique surpasses the superhuman physique of typical Inhumans: his strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes are well above typical human or Inhuman levels His speed and agility are highly enhanced, and he possesses superhuman senses [118] An organic mechanism in his brain's speech center produces an unknown particle that interacts with ambient electrons, enabling him to produce certain mentally-controlled phenomena The most devastating of these effects is Black Bolt's \"quasi-sonic scream\" Because his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain, any attempt to use his vocal cords triggers an uncontrollable disturbance of the particle/electron interaction field Because of this limitation, Black Bolt must be constantly vigilant of even the softest of utterances, lest he destroy anything or anyone in his path At full strength, his voice can destroy planets, [131] [132] [133] while a whisper can rock a battleship When Black Bolt was captured and experimented on by the Skrulls, it was shown that his \"Sonic Scream\" is triggered by, and at least partially dependent on, his emotional state [134]\n\n\nReception\nChase Magnett of ComicBook.com called Black Bolt \"one of the most outstanding creations from the legendary run of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee on Fantastic Four,\" writing, \"Both as a leader and individual character, he remains stacked with potential It's almost impossible to imagine any Inhumans story without referencing the Midnight King Even when

"**Black Bolt**\n\nBlack Bolt is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a member of the Inhuman royal family and the king of the Inhuman nation of Attilan. He first appeared in Fantastic Four #45 (December 1965) created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nBlack Bolt debuted in Fantastic Four #45 (December 1965), created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. He re-joined the Illuminati as part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! rebranding initiative. He appeared in the 2017 Black Bolt series, his first solo comic book series, by Saladin Ahmed and Christian James Ward. He appeared in the 2021 Darkhold: Black Bolt #1 one-shot.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nBlack Bolt's first appearance established the character as being a member of the Inhuman ruling class. The title Thor featured a back-up feature called \"Tales of the Inhumans\", which recounts the character's origin story. The son of King Agon and Queen Rynda, Black Bolt is exposed to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist while still an embryo, and eventually demonstrates the ability to manipulate electrons. To protect the Inhuman community from his devastating voice, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proof chamber and is tutored in the use of his powers. Reentering Inhuman society as a young man—having vowed never to speak—the character is attacked by his younger brother Maximus, who attempts, unsuccessfully, to goad him into speaking.\n\n**1960s**\n\nBlack Bolt's first appearance established the character as being a member of the Inhuman ruling class. The title Thor featured a back-up feature called \"Tales of the Inhumans\", which recounts the character's origin story. The son of King Agon and Queen Rynda, Black Bolt is exposed to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist while still an embryo, and eventually demonstrates the ability to manipulate electrons. To protect the Inhuman community from his devastating voice, Black Bolt is placed inside a sound-proof chamber and is tutored in the use of his powers. Reentering Inhuman society as a young man—having vowed never to speak—the character is attacked by his younger brother Maximus, who attempts, unsuccessfully, to goad him into speaking.\n\n**1970s**\n\nAfter being forced to intercede in the budding romance between his cousin Crystal and the Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm, Black Bolt and the Inhumans feature in the title Amazing Adventures, and battle villains such as the Mandarin and Magneto. A story in The Avengers, told in flashback, reveals how Black Bolt came to be ruler of the Inhumans and Maximus was driven mad. Black Bolt discovered his brother had secretly allied himself with the alien Kree—the race whose genetic experiments first created the Inhumans. In trying to stop an escaping Kree vessel, he overextended his sonic powers and caused the vessel to crash. The crash resulted in the deaths of several members of the Council of Genetics, including his parents, and Maximus was driven insane by his proximity to Black Bolt's use of his voice. Black Bolt becomes king but is haunted by the consequences of his actions.\n\n**1980s**\n\nBlack Bolt revisits his origins when he, members of the Royal Family, and Fantastic Four members Mister Fantastic and the Thing battle the villain Maelstrom. Maelstrom is revealed to be the son of a rival of Black Bolt's father, and—after his minions are defeated—attempts to destroy Attilan with a guided missile. Black Bolt, however, manages to defuse the missile and Maelstrom is defeated.\n\n**1990s**\n\nAfter another appearance in a back-up feature in the title What If?, a story told in flashback reveals how Maximus, using a creation called the Trikon, forced Black Bolt from Attilan. Black Bolt, however, eventually defeats the Trikon and regains the throne. After aiding the teen super group the New Warriors, the Royal Family joins forces with X-Factor to stop master villain Apocalypse.\n\n**2000s**\n\nThe character is featured—again with the Royal Family—in a third self-titled limited series that has major developments for the Inhumans. Ronan the Accuser leads the Kree in a surprise attack, capturing Attilan and forcing the Royal Family into service against Kree enemies the Shi'ar Karnak, Gorgon, and Triton covertly join the Shi'ar Imperial Guard while Black Bolt and Medusa must attempt the assassination of the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra at a ceremony ratifying an alliance between the Shi'ar and the Spartoi. Although the attempt fails and Black Bolt manages to defeat Ronan in personal combat, the Inhuman people choose to leave with the Kree and pursue a new future. This leaves Black Bolt and the Royal Family alone to fend for themselves.\n\n**2010s**\n\nHe in fact survived the explosion. It was revealed that Black Bolt likely represents the anomaly of the Kree Inhuman genetics program that had been predicted hundreds of thousands of years ago. The genetic prophecy was that this anomaly would bring about the end of the Supreme Intelligence. To prevent this outcome, the Kree Supreme Intelligence had ordered the destruction of all the worlds where the genetic experiments took place. Only five colonies escaped, including Earth's: these were the Universal Inhumans. After his return to Attilan, Black Bolt joined the Universal Inhumans and was presented with four new brides, one from each of the other colonies.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nBlack Bolt's Terrigen-mutated physique surpasses the superhuman physique of typical Inhumans: his strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes are well above typical human or Inhuman levels. His speed and agility are highly enhanced, and he possesses superhuman senses. An organic mechanism in his brain's speech center produces an unknown particle that interacts with ambient electrons, enabling him to produce certain mentally-controlled phenomena. The most devastating of these effects is Black Bolt's \"quasi-sonic scream\". Because his electron-harnessing ability is linked to the speech center of his brain, any attempt to use his vocal cords triggers an uncontrollable disturbance of the particle/electron interaction field. Because of this limitation, Black Bolt must be constantly vigilant of even the softest of utterances, lest he destroy anything or anyone in his path. At full strength, his voice can destroy planets, while a whisper can rock a battleship. When Black Bolt was captured and experimented on by the Skrulls, it was shown that his \"Sonic Scream\" is triggered by, and at least partially dependent on, his emotional state.\n\n**Reception**\n\nChase Magnett of ComicBook.com called Black Bolt \"one of the most outstanding creations from the legendary run of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee on Fantastic Four\", writing, \"Both as a leader and individual character, he remains stacked with potential. It's almost impossible to imagine any Inhumans story without referencing the Midnight King. Even when Medusa led the kingdom, the absence of Black Bolt was a potent element in all of their stories. He's a wonderful solo character as well, examining the balance of power and action. His inability to speak due to possessing so much destructive potential is the sort of central metaphor Kirby excelled at creating.

testing began in 2003, a year after the first flight of the second Technology Demonstrator (TD-2) [43] The first prototype aircraft, PV-1, made its maiden flight in 2003 The first trainer prototype PV-5 was rolled out in 2009 and made its first flight on 26 November 2009 [43] A total of two trainer prototypes were built and designated PV-5 and PV-06 The first naval prototype, designated NP-1, made its first flight on 27 April 2012 It was a twin-seater aircraft, while the second naval prototype, designated as NP-2, was a single seater Both naval prototypes were used extensively for various aircraft carrier-related trials at the Shore Based Test Facility in Goa NP-2 was used in the actual carrier trials, where it made an arrested recovery and ski-jump assisted take-off from the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in January 2020 [44]\n\n\nOperational clearance\nIn December 2006, the IAF announced that it would form an \"LCA Induction Team\" to manage the aircraft's service introduction [57] The Tejas was awarded initial operational clearance-I (IOC-I) in January 2011 [58] To ease up the process of FOC, an interim IOC-II was issued to Tejas in December 2013 The IOC-II expanded the g-limit, angle of attack and allowed the aircraft to carry precision guided munitions and close combat missiles The IOC-II Tejas have an operational radius of 400–500 km (250–310 mi) [59] [60] The first squadron, consisting of Tejas in IOC-II configuration, became operational in 2016 [61] The No 45 Squadron IAF based at Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore was the first to have their MiG-21s replaced by Tejas aircraft at the base [17]\n\n\nUpgrades and further development\nIn May 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) noted some shortcomings in the then-delivered Tejas Mark 1 IOC standard aircraft, which according to the CAG would limit the ability to survive and operation deployment of the aircraft in actual combat [69] A few of these shortcomings, including lack of combat endurance, were addressed in the Tejas Mark 1 FOC configuration aircraft [8] Tejas Mark 1 FOC is modified to perform in-flight refuelling from Ilyushin Il-78 and Sukhoi Su-30MKI Tejas is also undergoing butt firing trials and air-to-air firing at HAL, Nashik facility with Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 [70]\n\n\nTejas Mark 1A\nThe Tejas Mark 1A variant has more than 40 improvements over the Mark 1 variant [74] [75] Upgraded Mark 1A features a new avionic suite centred on EL/M-2052 AESA Radar and Uttam AESA Radar developed in-house DARE Unified Electronic Warfare Suite (UEWS), an externally mounted self protection jammer (SPJ) for enhanced survivability, in-flight refuelling capability, Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) for endurance and an expanded weapon suite consisting of Astra BVRAAM and ASRAAM [71] [17] Two ASRAAMs are intended for use on Tejas Mark 1A The production variant will come equipped with dual-rack pylons with weapon systems integration [76] [77] HAL will install in-house developed Combined Interrogator and Transponder (CIT) with digital map generator by Mission and Combat Systems R&D Centre which helps transfer the required mission map on pilot display, an upgraded IFF+ from older identification friend or foe system [77] To better accommodate the pilots, cockpit floor is also reshaped [70] The upgraded Tejas Mark 1A will have a reduced turnaround time [75] Tejas Mark 1A will use indigenously developed Angad electronic warfare suite and DRDO Advanced Self Protection Jammer pod [78] [79] [80]\n\n\nUpgrades\nThe Tejas Mark 1A variant has more than 40 improvements over the Mark 1 variant [74] [75] Upgraded Mark 1A features a new avionic suite centred

developed into the Tejas Mark 2, incorporating a more powerful General Electric F414 INS6 engine, canards and other design changes The Tejas Mark 2, which is expected to be rolled out in 2025, will have an increased payload carrying capacity and internal fuel capacity, more external hardpoints, improved combat range, a completely redesigned cockpit, and an integrated infrared search and track (IRST) system, in addition to the AESA radar [94] [64] The Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) is developing aircraft health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) to integrate the various sensors on board the Tejas Mark 2 [95] The first flight of Tejas Mark 2 is expected to be in 2025.\n\n\nTejas Mark 2\nThe HAL Tejas design has been further developed into the Tejas Mark 2,

[95] The first flight of Tejas Mark 2 is expected to be in 2025.\n\n\nNaval variant\nThe Naval LCA programme was commenced in 2003 [96] According to ADA, the Naval LCA (N-LCA) Programme was envisaged to be completed in two phases, under Phase-1 two naval prototypes were developed - the two-seat NP-1 and the single-seat NP-2, based on the Tejas Mark 1 design, to carryout carrier suitability certification and weapons integration Under Phase 2, two single-seat prototypes were planned to be built, based on the Tejas Mark 2 design, with further design optimisation and integration of the General Electric F414 INS6 engine [97] The first naval prototype NP-1 was rolled out in July 2010, [98] and made its first flight on 27 April 2012 [99] The naval LCA has stronger landing gear to absorb the forces generated during carrier take off and arrested recovery [96] [100]\n\n\nProgram costs\nThe Tejas is a single-engine multirole combat aircraft which has a tailless, compound delta wing design with \"relaxed static stability\" for enhanced manoeuvrability and agility The Tejas is a multi-role combat aircraft and its flexibility permits it to carry out Interception, air-to-surface and anti-shipping roles in a single mission [118] The wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics analysis have optimised the design of Tejas for minimum transonic and supersonic wave drag, as well low wing-loading [28]\n\n\nDevelopment costs\nThe Tejas is a single-engine multirole combat aircraft which has a tailless, compound delta wing design with \"relaxed

supersonic wave drag, as well low wing-loading [28]\n\n\nAirframe\nApart from aluminium-lithium alloys and titanium alloys, [123] carbon-fibre composite materials are used in the construction of the Tejas The composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, [124] the highest among contemporary aircraft [125] The upper and lower wing surfaces, wing spars and wing ribs are also made out of carbon-fibre composites, [126] while the fin tip is made out of fiberglass [127] The extensive use of composite materials in the airframe not only makes the aircraft lighter but also gives high strength This also reduces the number of joints or rivets, increases the aircraft's structural integrity and lowers its susceptibility to fatigue cracks [118] The tailfin is a monolithic honeycomb structure, reducing the manufacturing cost by 80% compared to traditional methods [128] Initially the Tejas prototypes were equipped with a radome made out of Kevlar which was replaced with a quartz radome in the production aircraft [64]\n\n\nAvionics\nThe avionics of the Tejas Mark 1 is centered around Elta EL/M-2032 radar [64] Its digital flight control computer developed by ADE and manufactured BEL [131] [132] It has an electronic warfare (EW) suite domestically developed by Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), which consists of a radar warning receiver (RWR), integrated self-protection jammer, [133] chaff and flare dispenser system [134] [135] The upgraded variant of the Tejas Mark 1, named the Tejas Mark 1A have an AESA radar, new high performance digital flight control computer (DFCC MK1A), [136] new EW suite and updated avionics [71] Some of the production Mark 1A fighters will be equipped with the Elta EL/M-2052 AESA radar, [17] while rest of the aircraft are expected to fly with the domestically developed Uttam AESA radar [39] The new EW system for the Mark 1A, developed by DARE known as the Unified Electronic Warfare suite (UEWS), will have electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, digital radio frequency memory based [137] jamming and deception capabilities [75] The Tejas Mark 1A will also carry a pod-mounted self-protection jammer [64] – the Elta ELL-8222WB [138] The Mark 1A will have software-defined radio-based secure communications and network-centric warfare capabilities [139]\n\n\nFlight control system\nThe aerodynamic configuration of Tejas is based on a delta-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings The control surfaces include three-section slats on the wing's outer leading edge while the inboard sections of the wings have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-AoA stability The wing trailing edge fits two-segment elevons to provide pitch and roll control The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the single-piece rudder and two airbrakes, located in the upper rear part of the fuselage, one each on either side of the fin [119] Since the Tejas is a relaxed static stability design, it is equipped with a NAL-developed full authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system [28] and an open architecture [146] digital flight control computer developed by BEL [131]  Its flight control surfaces are controlled by hybrid electro-hydraulic actuators through the digital flight control computer [147] The fly-by-wire flight control system of the Tejas has an advanced feature called auto low-speed recovery This enables envelope protection at low speed and high angles of attack It prevents the aircraft from entering into uncontrolled flight while maneuvering Another feature is disorientation recovery function, once engaged it will recover the aircraft to an optimal altitude, airspeed and level flight Some of the flight control laws for these features were formulated by the IIT Bombay research university [148]\n\n\nPropulsion\nDeveloping an indigenous jet engine for Tejas was one of the five self-reliance goals identified at the beginning of the LCA Programme A programme led by the Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) to design and develop an indigenous powerplant, the Kaveri, was launched as early as in 1986 [152] However Kaveri jet engine development faced some setbacks, hence the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engine was procured as an interim solution [152] The F404-F2J3 (10 units) powers the Technology Demonstrator and Prototype variants of Tejas [153] Since 2004, uprated General Electric F404-GE-IN20 engines are being used on LSP, Naval prototypes and Mark 1 variants of Tejas [154] [155]\n\n\nDelivery\nThe formation of the first Tejas-equipped squadron started in July 2011 No 45 Squadron IAF (Flying Daggers), the first Tejas squadron, was operationalised in July 2016 It is based in Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore [61] [159]\n\n\nOrders\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth Bahrain International Airshow [191]\n\nOperational history\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth

by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The aircraft is designed to replace the aging MiG-21 variants, which have been the mainstay of the IAF since 1963.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe LCA programme originated in the early 1980s, with the Government of India establishing the LCA project in 1983. The initial goal was to develop a new light combat aircraft to replace the aging IAF fighters, especially the MiG-21 variants. The programme was established with the Long Term Re-Equipment Plan 1981, which noted that most of these IAF fighters were approaching the end of their service lives by the early-1990s, and that by 1995, the IAF would be 40 percent short of the aircraft needed to fill its projected force structure requirements.\n\n**LCA Programme**\n\nThe LCA programme was a major undertaking for HAL, with the goal of developing a next-generation combat aircraft for the IAF. The programme involved the design, development, and testing of the Tejas, as well as the establishment of a production line for the aircraft. The LCA programme was a critical component of the IAF's modernization efforts, and the Tejas was seen as a key enabler of the IAF's ability to project power and defend Indian airspace.\n\n**Prototypes and Testing**\n\nPrototype testing began in 2003, a year after the first flight of the second Technology Demonstrator (TD-2). The first prototype aircraft, PV-1, made its maiden flight in 2003. The first trainer prototype, PV-5, was rolled out in 2009 and made its first flight on 26 November 2009. A total of two trainer prototypes were built and designated PV-5 and PV-06. The first naval prototype, designated NP-1, made its first flight on 27 April 2012. It was a twin-seater aircraft, while the second naval prototype, designated as NP-2, was a single seater. Both naval prototypes were used extensively for various aircraft carrier-related trials at the Shore Based Test Facility in Goa.\n\n**Operational Clearance**\n\nIn December 2006, the IAF announced that it would form an \"LCA Induction Team\" to manage the aircraft's service introduction. The Tejas was awarded initial operational clearance-I (IOC-I) in January 2011. To ease up the process of FOC, an interim IOC-II was issued to Tejas in December 2013. The IOC-II expanded the g-limit, angle of attack and allowed the aircraft to carry precision guided munitions and close combat missiles. The first squadron, consisting of Tejas in IOC-II configuration, became operational in 2016. The No 45 Squadron IAF based at Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore was the first to have their MiG-21s replaced by Tejas aircraft at the base.\n\n**Upgrades and Further Development**\n\nIn May 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) noted some shortcomings in the then-delivered Tejas Mark 1 IOC standard aircraft, which according to the CAG would limit the ability to survive and operation deployment of the aircraft in actual combat. A few of these shortcomings, including lack of combat endurance, were addressed in the Tejas Mark 1 FOC configuration aircraft. The Tejas Mark 1 FOC is modified to perform in-flight refuelling from Ilyushin Il-78 and Sukhoi Su-30MKI. Tejas is also undergoing butt firing trials and air-to-air firing at HAL, Nashik facility with Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23.\n\n**Tejas Mark 1A**\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1A variant has more than 40 improvements over the Mark 1 variant. Upgraded Mark 1A features a new avionic suite centred on EL/M-2052 AESA Radar and Uttam AESA Radar developed in-house DARE Unified Electronic Warfare Suite (UEWS), an externally mounted self protection jammer (SPJ) for enhanced survivability, in-flight refuelling capability, Onboard Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS) developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) for endurance and an expanded weapon suite consisting of Astra BVRAAM and ASRAAM. Two ASRAAMs are intended for use on Tejas Mark 1A. The production variant will come equipped with dual-rack pylons with weapon systems integration. HAL will install in-house developed Combined Interrogator and Transponder (CIT) with digital map generator by Mission and Combat Systems R&D Centre which helps transfer the required mission map on pilot display, an upgraded IFF+ from older identification friend or foe system. The upgraded Tejas Mark 1A will have a reduced turnaround time. Tejas Mark 1A will use indigenously developed Angad electronic warfare suite and DRDO Advanced Self Protection Jammer pod.\n\n**Tejas Mark 2**\n\nThe HAL Tejas design has been further developed into the Tejas Mark 2, incorporating a more powerful General Electric F414 INS6 engine, canards and other design changes. The Tejas Mark 2, which is expected to be rolled out in 2025, will have an increased payload carrying capacity and internal fuel capacity, more external hardpoints, improved combat range, a completely redesigned cockpit, and an integrated infrared search and track (IRST) system, in addition to the AESA radar.\n\n**Naval Variant**\n\nThe Naval LCA programme was commenced in 2003. According to ADA, the Naval LCA (N-LCA) Programme was envisaged to be completed in two phases, under Phase-1 two naval prototypes were developed - the two-seat NP-1 and the single-seat NP-2, based on the Tejas Mark 1 design, to carry out carrier suitability certification and weapons integration. Under Phase 2, two single-seat prototypes were planned to be built, based on the Tejas Mark 2 design, with further design optimisation and integration of the General Electric F414 INS6 engine. The first naval prototype NP-1 was rolled out in July 2010, and made its first flight on 27 April 2012.\n\n**Program Costs**\n\nThe Tejas is a single-engine multirole combat aircraft which has a tailless, compound delta wing design with \"relaxed static stability\" for enhanced manoeuvrability and agility. The Tejas is a multi-role combat aircraft and its flexibility permits it to carry out Interception, air-to-surface and anti-shipping roles in a single mission. The wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics analysis have optimised the design of Tejas for minimum transonic and supersonic wave drag, as well low wing-loading.\n\n**Airframe**\n\nApart from aluminium-lithium alloys and titanium alloys, carbon-fibre composite materials are used in the construction of the Tejas. The composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, the highest among contemporary aircraft. The upper and lower wing surfaces, wing spars and wing ribs are also made out of carbon-fibre composites, while the fin tip is made out of fiberglass. The extensive use of composite materials in the airframe not only makes the aircraft lighter but also gives high strength. This also reduces the number of joints or rivets, increases the aircraft's structural integrity and lowers its susceptibility to fatigue cracks. The tailfin is a monolithic honeycomb structure, reducing the manufacturing cost by 80% compared to traditional methods.\n\n**Avionics**\n\nThe avionics of the Tejas Mark 1 is centered around Elta EL/M-2032 radar. Its digital flight control computer developed by ADE and manufactured BEL. It has an electronic warfare (EW) suite domestically developed by Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), which consists of a radar warning receiver (RWR), integrated self-protection jammer, chaff and flare dispenser system. The upgraded variant of the Tejas Mark 1, named the Tejas Mark 1A have an AESA radar, new high performance digital flight control computer (DFCC MK1A), new EW suite and updated avionics. Some of the production Mark 1A fighters will be equipped with the Elta EL/M-2052 AESA radar, while rest of the aircraft are expected to fly with the domestically developed Uttam AESA radar. The new EW system for the Mark 1A, developed by DARE known as the Unified Electronic Warfare suite (UEWS), will have electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, digital radio frequency memory based jamming and deception capabilities. The Tejas Mark 1A will also carry a pod-mounted self-protection jammer – the Elta ELL-8222WB. The Mark 1A will have software-defined radio-based secure communications and network-centric warfare capabilities.\n\n**Flight Control System**\n\nThe aerodynamic configuration of Tejas is based on a delta-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings. The control surfaces include three-section slats on the wing's outer leading edge while the inboard sections of the wings have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-AoA stability. The wing trailing edge fits two-segment elevons to provide pitch and roll control. The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the single-piece rudder and two airbrakes, located in the upper rear part of the fuselage, one each on either side of the fin. Since the Tejas is a relaxed static stability design, it is equipped with a NAL-developed full authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system and an open architecture digital flight control computer developed by BEL. Its flight control surfaces are controlled by hybrid electro-hydraulic actuators through the digital flight control computer. The fly-by-wire flight control system of the Tejas has an advanced feature called auto low-speed recovery. This enables envelope protection at low speed and high angles of attack. It prevents the aircraft from entering into uncontrolled flight while maneuvering. Another feature is disorientation recovery function, once engaged it will recover the aircraft to an optimal altitude, airspeed and level flight. Some of the flight control laws for these features were formulated by the IIT Bombay research university.\n\n**Propulsion**\n\nDeveloping an indigenous jet engine for Tejas was one of the five self-reliance goals identified at the beginning of the LCA Programme. A programme led by the Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) to design and develop an indigenous powerplant, the Kaveri, was launched as early as in 1986. However Kaveri jet engine development faced some setbacks, hence the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engine was procured as an interim solution. The F404-F2J3 (10 units) powers the Technology Demonstrator and Prototype variants of Tejas. Since 2004, uprated General Electric F404-GE-IN20 engines are being used on LSP, Naval prototypes and Mark 1 variants of Tejas.\n\n**Delivery**\n\nThe formation of the first Tejas-equipped squadron started in July 2011. No 45 Squadron IAF (Flying Daggers), the first Tejas squadron, was operationalised in July 2016. It is based in Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore.\n\n**Orders**\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth Bahrain International Airshow. The Tejas is being offered for export to various countries. The aircraft has attracted interest from several countries, including Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n**Potential Operators**\n\nThe HAL Tejas is a highly capable aircraft, and several countries have expressed interest in purchasing the aircraft for their air forces. Some of the potential operators of the Tejas include:\n\n* Botswana Defence Force Air Wing\n* Brazilian Air Force\n* Egyptian Air Force\n* Indonesian Air Force\n* Malaysian Royal Air Force\n* Nigerian Air Force\n* Philippine Air Force\n* Sri Lanka Air Force\n* United Arab Emirates Air Force\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThere have been no major accidents or incidents involving the Tejas. However, there have been some minor incidents, including a bird strike and a technical issue with the aircraft's engine.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1A has a number of advanced features, including:\n\n* AESA radar\n* New high performance digital flight control computer (DFCC MK1A)\n* New electronic warfare (EW) suite\n* Updated avionics\n* Pod-mounted self-protection jammer (SPJ)\n* Software-defined radio-based secure communications and network-centric warfare capabilities\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1A has a maximum takeoff weight of 17,000 kg and a maximum speed of Mach 1.8. It has a range of 560 km and a service ceiling of 50,000 ft.\n\n**References**\n\n* \"HAL Tejas\". Bharat Rakshak. Retrieved 2022-02-20.\n* \"Tejas\". HAL. Retrieved 2022-02-20.\n* \"Tejas Mark 1A\".

Tejas The composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, [124] the highest among contemporary aircraft [125] The upper and lower wing surfaces, wing spars and wing ribs are also made out of carbon-fibre composites, [126] while the fin tip is made out of fiberglass [127] The extensive use of composite materials in the airframe not only makes the aircraft lighter but also gives high strength This also reduces the number of joints or rivets, increases the aircraft's structural integrity and lowers its susceptibility to fatigue cracks [118] The tailfin is a monolithic honeycomb structure, reducing the manufacturing cost by 80% compared to traditional methods [128] Initially the Tejas prototypes were equipped with a radome made out of Kevlar which was replaced with a quartz radome in the production aircraft [64]\n\n\nAvionics\nThe avionics of the Tejas Mark 1 is centered around Elta EL/M-2032 radar [64] Its digital flight control computer developed by ADE and manufactured BEL [131] [132] It has an electronic warfare (EW) suite domestically developed by Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE), which consists of a radar warning receiver (RWR), integrated self-protection jammer, [133] chaff and flare dispenser system [134] [135] The upgraded variant of the Tejas Mark 1, named the Tejas Mark 1A have an AESA radar, new high performance digital flight control computer (DFCC MK1A), [136] new EW suite and updated avionics [71] Some of the production Mark 1A fighters will be equipped with the Elta EL/M-2052 AESA radar, [17] while rest of the aircraft are expected to fly with the domestically developed Uttam AESA radar [39] The new EW system for the Mark 1A, developed by DARE known as the Unified Electronic Warfare suite (UEWS), will have electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasure capabilities, digital radio frequency memory based [137] jamming and deception capabilities [75] The Tejas Mark 1A will also carry a pod-mounted self-protection jammer [64] – the Elta ELL-8222WB [138] The Mark 1A will have software-defined radio-based secure communications and network-centric warfare capabilities [139]\n\n\nFlight control system\nThe aerodynamic configuration of Tejas is based on a delta-wing layout with shoulder-mounted wings The control surfaces include three-section slats on the wing's outer leading edge while the inboard sections of the wings have additional slats to generate vortex lift over the inner wing and high-energy air-flow along the tail fin to enhance high-AoA stability The wing trailing edge fits two-segment elevons to provide pitch and roll control The only empennage-mounted control surfaces are the single-piece rudder and two airbrakes, located in the upper rear part of the fuselage, one each on either side of the fin [119] Since the Tejas is a relaxed static stability design, it is equipped with a NAL-developed full authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire flight control system [28] and an open architecture [146] digital flight control computer developed by BEL [131]  Its flight control surfaces are controlled by hybrid electro-hydraulic actuators through the digital flight control computer [147] The fly-by-wire flight control system of the Tejas has an advanced feature called auto low-speed recovery This enables envelope protection at low speed and high angles of attack It prevents the aircraft from entering into uncontrolled flight while maneuvering Another feature is disorientation recovery function, once engaged it will recover the aircraft to an optimal altitude, airspeed and level flight Some of the flight control laws for these features were formulated by the IIT Bombay research university [148]\n\n\nPropulsion\nDeveloping an indigenous jet engine for Tejas was one of the five self-reliance goals identified at the beginning of the LCA Programme A programme led by the Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) to design and develop an indigenous powerplant, the Kaveri, was launched as early as in 1986 [152] However Kaveri jet engine development faced some setbacks, hence the General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engine was procured as an interim solution [152] The F404-F2J3 (10 units) powers the Technology Demonstrator and Prototype variants of Tejas [153] Since 2004, uprated General Electric F404-GE-IN20 engines are being used on LSP, Naval prototypes and Mark 1 variants of Tejas [154] [155]\n\n\nDelivery\nThe formation of the first Tejas-equipped squadron started in July 2011 No 45 Squadron IAF (Flying Daggers), the first Tejas squadron, was operationalised in July 2016 It is based in Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore [61] [159]\n\n\nOrders\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth Bahrain International Airshow [191]\n\nOperational history\n\nThe Tejas Mark 1 made its international debut on 21 January 2016, at the fourth Bahrain International Airshow [191]\n\nPotential operators\nHAL proposed exporting the Tejas, with preliminary talks taking place with several friendly countries [204] It was reported in March 2020 that HAL is willing to set up logistic facilities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam as part of exporting the Tejas [205]\n\n\nBotswana\nThe Botswana Defence Force Air Wing has approached HAL to procure the Tejas for potentially replacing its Canadair CF-5s due to the aircraft's age and problems of acquiring needed parts for maintenance [206] The BDFAW has previously considered acquiring Gripens, [207] the F-16, [208] KAI T-50, [209] and the Leonardo M-346 [206]\n\n\nBrazil\nIn September 2024, the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) has reportedly considered the adoption of the Tejas to replace their AMX and Northrop F-5 jets in service and complement the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, which is being done with a swap of Embraer C-390 Millennium [211] [212] [213] FAB wanted to acquire F-16 Fighting Falcon at first from the US, but it was rejected [214]\n\n\nCongo\nIn October 2024, a report suggested that the Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FAC) was interested to

2020, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had issued a tender, seeking a new jet trainer to replace its fleet of BAE Hawk 127 trainer aircraft [238] According to HAL's \"58th Annual Report\" covering 2020–2021, HAL had offered the HAL Tejas in its \"Lead in Fighter Trainer\" (LIFT) configuration to Australia's Department of Defence (DoD) in July 2020 [239] Other aircraft also reported to be participating in the tender were the Boeing-Saab T-7 Red Hawk, the Aermacchi M-346 Master and the KAI T-50 [240]\n\n\nEgypt\nDuring the Dubai Airshow 2021, Egyptian officials expressed their interest in procuring 70 LCA Tejas [244] to replace 100 Hongdu JL-8s [245] Following the Dubai Airshow 2021, HAL and Indian Air Force officials visited Cairo and discussions were going on As of June 2022, India has offered to set up local production facilities for the LCA Tejas and also for the Light Utility and Light Combat Helicopters in Egypt [246]\n\n\nMalaysia\nMalaysia had frequently indicated that it may be interested in purchasing the HAL Tejas for the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF), as part of its attempts to supplement its MiG-29 fleet; reports of Malaysian interest in procuring the aircraft date back to as early as 2019 [249]\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn May 2022, India and the Philippines signed an MOU with the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation, [264] which mentioned the consideration of purchasing the Tejas and other Indian-made aircraft [265] On July 7, 2022, the Tejas was dropped from further consideration from the multi-role fighter jet (MRF) project The F-16V Block 70/72 and the JAS-39 Gripen C/D+ are currently the main contenders for the Philippine Air Force's MRF project [266]\n\n\nSri Lanka\nIn 2018, it had been reported that Sri Lanka had shown interest in purchasing the Tejas to replace its aging fleets of IAI Kfir and Chengdu J-7 aircraft [268] The intention was for the acquisition of 8 to 12 aircraft to be pursued through a government-government basic agreement [269]\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nThe Tejas had attracted interest from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with some discussions held during a visit by UAE Minister of State and Defence, Mohammed Ahmed Al Bowardi Al Falacy, during a state visit in October 2018, as part of growing defence relations between India and UAE [271] By May 2022, Tejas had failed to gain any further interest [272] with the UAE placing an order for 80 Rafale F4s from France \n\n\nUnited States\nIn December 2020, in response to a Request for Information (RFI) from the United States Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), HAL offered the \"Lead In Fighter Trainer\" variant of the HAL Tejas — classified as the \"HAL Tejas LIFT\", to the United States Navy (USN), as part the latter's

state-of-the-art sports and entertainment complex that has become a hub for various events, including American football, soccer, and professional wrestling. The stadium has a rich history, dating back to its construction in the late 1990s, and has undergone significant renovations over the years to enhance its facilities and amenities.\n\nHistory\n\nThe concept of a new stadium in Tampa was first proposed in the mid-1990s, following the purchase of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by Malcolm Glazer. Glazer, a wealthy businessman, declared that the existing Tampa Stadium was inadequate to justify the record $192 million he paid for the NFL franchise. As a result, he began lobbying local government for a replacement, which would meet the needs of the Buccaneers and other sports teams in the area.\n\nIn 1995, the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County unveiled plans for a $168 million stadium, which would be paid for with a rental car surtax and fees on items related to stadium events, such as ticket surcharges and parking fees. However, the Glazer family rejected the plan within hours, citing concerns that it would reduce their revenue. The Glazers threatened to move the Buccaneers elsewhere, sparking a period of uncertainty and negotiations with local and state government officials.\n\nWith the Glazers' demands not being met, the city and county decided to pursue an alternative taxpayer-financed plan. However, the process was slow, and the Glazers continued to threaten relocation, meeting with officials from several other cities to explore possible relocation sites. It wasn't until 1998 that the new stadium finally broke ground, with the Glazers eventually agreeing to a deal that would allow the Buccaneers to remain in Tampa.\n\nFinancing and Construction\n\nThe construction of Raymond James Stadium was a complex process that involved significant investment from local and state government, as well as private investors. The stadium was built at a cost of $168 million, with the Glazer family contributing a significant portion of the funds. The deal also included a 13-year naming rights agreement with Raymond James Financial, which paid $32.5 million for the rights.\n\nThe stadium was designed by architect HOK and took approximately 18 months to complete. It features a unique design that includes a 103-foot replica pirate ship in the north end zone, which has become a iconic symbol of the stadium. The ship is adorned with cannons, flags, and other pirate-themed decorations, and is a major draw for fans.\n\nOpening and Further Developments\n\nRaymond James Stadium officially opened on September 20, 1998, when the Buccaneers defeated the Chicago Bears, 27-15. The stadium hosted its first Major League Soccer match on March 20, 1999, after the Tampa Bay Mutiny relocated from Houlihan's Stadium. The Mutiny went on to play their final home game at Raymond James Stadium in 2001, after facing declining revenue due to declining attendance.\n\nThe stadium has undergone several renovations over the years, including the addition of temporary bleachers in the south end zone, which increased the stadium's capacity to approximately 65,000. The renovations have also included improvements to the concourses, concessions, and amenities, making the stadium a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for fans.\n\nFeatures\n\nOne of the most recognizable features of Raymond James Stadium is the 103-foot replica pirate ship in the north end zone.

2–1 loss to the Columbus Crew [28] The team had an average attendance of 10,479 per match in their final season at Raymond James Stadium [29]\n\n\nFeatures\nOne of the most recognizable features of the stadium is a 103-foot (31 m), 43-ton steel-and-concrete replica pirate ship in the north end zone, making it stand out from other NFL stadiums [35] Each time the Buccaneers score points, enter the other team's red zone, or win a home game, the replica cannons on the ship are fired off The cannons fire once for each point scored In addition, when the Buccaneers enter their opponent's red zone, the cannons fire once, and flags are hoisted and waved around the stadium The cannons are also used during pre-game player introductions During various times throughout the game, the song \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" is played on the stadium public address system (taken from Pirates of the Caribbean), which signals patrons on board the ship to throw beads, T-shirts, and other free prizes to the spectators below The segment is also known as a \"Mini Gasparilla\" to most fans An animated parrot sits on the stern of the pirate ship Controlled by radio and remote control, the parrot picks fans out of the crowd and talks to those passing by [36] The pirate ship's sails, which for NFL games usually shows Buccaneers logos and sponsors, are often changed to suit the event that it hosts [35]\n\n\nNaming\nDuring construction, the facility was known as Tampa Community Stadium In June 1998, prior to its opening, the naming rights were bought by St Petersburg-based Raymond James Financial for $32.5 million in a 13–year agreement [41] Contract extensions signed in 2006 and 2016 have extended the naming rights deal through 2028 [42]\n\n\nNotable events\nRaymond James Stadium has hosted the Super Bowl three times: Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, and Super Bowl LV in 2021 In Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium, which they won 31–9 [44] Like previous Super Bowls, the league treated Super Bowl LV as a neutral site game, with the pirate ship's Buccaneer-logo sails replaced with Super Bowl sails [35] The league also did not allow the Buccaneers to fire the ship's cannons during the game The cannons are normally fired after every score by the Buccaneers and when their offense enters the red zone The cannons were only fired during player introductions and were fired 31 times after the end of the game to represent the Buccaneers' 31 points [45] The Buccaneers were coincidentally the designated home team for Super Bowl LV, as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually [46]\n\n\nAmerican Football\nRaymond James Stadium has hosted the Super Bowl

{"title": "Mike_Pence", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nPence was born on June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Ann Jane \"Nancy\" Cawley and Edward Joseph Pence Jr., [5] [6] who ran a group of gas stations [7] [8] His father served in the U.S Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph [9] His father was of German and Irish descent, and his mother is of Irish ancestry [10] His paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence Sr., worked in the Chicago stockyards [11] He was named after his maternal grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from Dooncastle, County Mayo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island and who became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois [12] [13] [14] [15] His maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare, Ireland [16] [17]\n\n\nEarly career and congressional campaigns\nAfter graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice [25] In 1988, he ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost [26] He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful [26] During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife\" [27] While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign [27]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (2001–2013)\nRunning for the U.S House of Representatives again in 2000, he won the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana The 2nd district (renumbered the 6th in 2002) comprised all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana As a new congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\" [42] In 2016, House speaker Paul Ryan described Pence as a \"principled conservative\" [43] While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus [44]\n\n\n2012 Indiana gubernatorial election\nIn May 2011, Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012 [71] Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited Pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels [72] [73] The Democratic nominee was former Indiana Speaker of the House John R Gregg Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of Gregg, with Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham receiving most of the remaining votes [74] It was the closest race in 50 years [75]\n\n\nGovernor of Indiana (2013–2017)\nPence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013 [76]\n\n\nFiscal and economic policy\nPence \"inherited a $2 billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state .. added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections\" [77] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2 billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14 billion annual state budget include $24 million cut from colleges and universities; $27 million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA); [78] and $12 million cut from the Department of Correction [79] During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average [80] Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend [81] In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector [82] Carrier Corp and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves [83] and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment\" [84] [85] Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received [85] [86] The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24 million in incentives to ten companies who sent jobs abroad $8.7 million had been paid out by August 2016 [83]\n\n\nEducation policy\nDuring his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools [103] [104] In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10-million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan [103] [104] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool\" [104] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80 million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding, [103] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion\" [105] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds [103] [106]\n\n\nEnergy and environment\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts\" [115] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy\", and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\" [115] [116] In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan [115] [117] Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan [115] In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions [118]\n\n\nGun policy\nIn 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property [119] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue [120] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns [121] [122] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana attorney general Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government\" [122] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana [123]\n\n\nPublic health\nIn 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency; [124] his successor Governor Eric Holcomb issued Executive Order 17–13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago [125] [126] The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997 [127]\n\n\nReligion and LGBT rights\nOn March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill or Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law [140] The move was praised by religious conservatives, [141] but criticized by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons [142] [143] [144] [145] Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with the latter's company saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state [146] [147] Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40 million expansion of their Indianapolis-based headquarters over concerns with the law The expansion would have moved 1,000 jobs into the state [148] Thousands protested against the policy [142] Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state [149]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn March 2016, as Indiana governor, Pence signed into law H.B 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state [155] [156] [157] The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome\" [156] Days after the U.S Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S district judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial [156] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit [158]\n\n\nMedia and the press\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he subsequently apologized [159]\n\n\nSyrian refugee crisis\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana [165] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence unsuccessfully appealed [165] In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S are offensive and unconstitutional\" [166]\n\n\nPublic-records requests and use of private email\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright\" [167] [168] [169] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts [170] While Pence's use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues [171] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure [171] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S secretary of state [171] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence [167]\n\n\nRe-election campaign and withdrawal\nPence ran for a second term as governor and was unopposed in the Republican primary on May 3, 2016 He was to face Democrat John R Gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate [172] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate [173] [174] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election [175]\n\n\n2016 vice presidential campaign\nShortly before the 2016 Indiana Republican presidential primary, Pence endorsed Texas U.S Senator Ted Cruz, who would lose the primary to Trump [62] Pence then endorsed Trump after the latter became the party's presumptive nominee for president of the United States [176]\n\n\nVice presidency (2017–2021)\nDefunct\n\n\nInauguration\nOn January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land,\" which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president Pence also used his personal Bible [205]\n\n\nAdvisors and staff\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security [207] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017 [208]\n\n\nTenure\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security [207] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017 [208]\n\n\nPolitical action committee\nIn May 2017, Pence filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to form Great America Committee, a political action committee (PAC) that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst [259] [260] Pence is the only vice president to have started his own PAC while still in office [261] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he would run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\" [262]\n\n\nPence and the Trump impeachment inquiry\nPence was a key player in the Trump–Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry Pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S military aid to Ukraine Pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption [263]\n\n\nDeath of Soleimani\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate the Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Qaeda attacks on the United States to Iran In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans\" Pence insisted Soleimani had \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks\", which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated [266] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, ten of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\" [267]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn February 26, 2020, President Trump named Pence as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S [268] Various public health officials and members of Congress had suggested the selection of a \"Coronavirus Czar\", though Trump said that would not be the title's name [269] As the leader of the task force, Pence coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, and White House Office [270] [271]\n\n\n2020 vice presidential election\nAhead of his presidential campaign on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump's name Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence's alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, \"I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage.\" Biden had previously referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in 2018, and Pence and Biden exchanged conversations via phone before Pence's 2017 transition into the vice presidency [282]\n\n\nVote counting and storming of the Capitol\nIn January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election As vice president, Pence presided over the January 6, 2021, congressional joint session to count the electoral votes—normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event In the days leading up to the session, Trump declared both in public and in private that Pence should use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump–Pence the winners of the election [301] Pence demurred that the United States Constitution did not give him that power, but Trump falsely insisted that \"The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.\" [302] \nAccording to The New York Times, multiple sources claim that Trump called Pence before he departed to certify the results urging him again one last time ultimately telling him, \"You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.\" [303] \nBefore the start of the Joint Session, Pence stated in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that the Constitution prevented him from deciding which electoral votes counted and which did not [304]\n\n\nPost-vice presidency (2021–present)\nPence did not have a permanent place of residence in Indiana when he left the vice presidency Official records indicated that Pence had not owned a residence in Indiana since 2013, having lived in the governor's mansion and then the vice president's residence in Washington As a result, for several months after leaving office, he and his wife stayed at residences owned by various Indiana Republican politicians It is believed that he was at one time staying in a cabin owned by his former lieutenant governor, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb [320] [321] In May 2021, the Pences bought a home in Carmel, Indiana [322]\n\n\nClassified documents investigation\nIn January 2023, after classified documents were found at the home of President Joe Biden, Pence asked his lawyer to search his home \"out of an abundance of caution\" The attorney found around a dozen documents marked as classified in Pence's Indiana home and turned over the documents to the FBI The discovery came after Pence had repeatedly said that he did not have classified documents [341] Pence has taken responsibility for the documents and said that he was unaware of his possession of them The FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division reviewed the incident Pence indicated he would \"fully cooperate\" [342] On February 10, the FBI searched his home [343] In June, the Department of Justice notified Pence that its investigation had ended and that no charges would be brought forward [344]\n\n\n2024 presidential campaign\nPolls of Republicans in 2021 regarding their preferred presidential candidate in 2024 implied that Pence could begin a campaign as a top-tier candidate if former President Trump were to forgo a run [345] [346] At the same time, said polling also foretold a precipitous decline in Pence's polling numbers if Trump were to seek the presidency again [347] In light of this, there was a widespread view among both Republican leaders and grassroots Republicans that \"Pence is dead in the early waters of 2024.\" [348]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPence and his wife, Karen (née Batten), met while he was in law school at Indiana University [14] They were married in 1985 Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother a widow with four grown children and two teenagers Mike and Karen Pence have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey [358] [359] Michael Pence is a pilot in the United States Marine Corps [360] [361] [362] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses [8] [18] During an interview in 2002, Pence told a reporter that he would not have dinner alone with a woman other than his wife [363] On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother remarried – this time to Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001 [364] [365] In 2018, Pence's oldest brother, Greg, entered and won the political race to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike) [366] [367] Greg and Mike are similar enough in appearance that Greg once successfully acted as a decoy to lure the press away from his brother when Mike Pence was being touted as a

[376] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky—as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ\" [42] [375] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister [375] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church [42] [375] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church\" [42] In 2016, Pence and his wife regularly worshiped at College Park Church, a nondenominational church in Indianapolis [14] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\", and as \"a born-again, Evangelical Catholic\" [42] [375] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve—he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\" [14]\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal

of Ann Jane \"Nancy\" Cawley and Edward Joseph Pence Jr. His father served in the U.S Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953. Pence's father was of German and Irish descent, and his mother is of Irish ancestry. Pence's paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence Sr., worked in the Chicago stockyards. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from Dooncastle, County Mayo, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island and who became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois. Pence's maternal grandmother's parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare, Ireland.\n\n**Early Career and Congressional Campaigns**\n\nAfter graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice. In 1988, he ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost. He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful. During the race, Pence used \"political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife.\" While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.\n\n**U.S. House of Representatives (2001-2013)**\n\nRunning for the U.S House of Representatives again in 2000, he won the seat in Indiana's 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent David M McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The 2nd district (renumbered the 6th in 2002) comprised all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a new congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\" In 2016, House speaker Paul Ryan described Pence as a \"principled conservative.\" While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.\n\n**2012 Indiana Gubernatorial Election**\n\nIn May 2011, Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012. Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. Pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels. The Democratic nominee was former Indiana Speaker of the House John R Gregg. Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of Gregg, with Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham receiving most of the remaining votes. It was the closest race in 50 years.\n\n**Governor of Indiana (2013-2017)**\n\nPence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013. During his tenure, he inherited a $2 billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections. The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2 billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14 billion annual state budget included $24 million cut from colleges and universities; $27 million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA); and $12 million cut from the Department of Correction. During Pence's term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average, and Indiana's job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend. In 2014, Indiana's economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector. Carrier Corp and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves, and Pence expressed \"deep disappointment.\" Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24 million in incentives to ten companies who sent jobs abroad; $8.7 million had been paid out by August 2016.\n\n**Fiscal and Economic Policy**\n\nDuring his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools. In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10-million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans to approve the plan. Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool.\" Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80 million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding, arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion.\" After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.\n\n**Energy and Environment**\n\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts. Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy,\" and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.\" In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA's Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan. Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan. In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.\n\n**Gun Policy**\n\nIn 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property. In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns. The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana attorney general Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government.\" In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in Indiana.\n\n**Public Health**\n\nIn 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency; his successor Governor Eric Holcomb issued Executive Order 17–13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago. The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.\n\n**Religion and LGBT Rights**\n\nOn March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana \"religious objections\" bill or Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law. The move was praised by religious conservatives, but criticized by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons. Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with the latter's company saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state. Angie's List announced that they would cancel a $40 million expansion of their Indianapolis-based headquarters over concerns with the law. Thousands protested against the policy. Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the \"wrong signal\" about the state.\n\n**Abortion**\n\nIn March 2016, as Indiana governor, Pence signed into law H.B 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus' race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state. The law was described as \"exceptional for its breadth\"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana \"the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome.\" Days after the U.S Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S district judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial. The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n\n**Media and the Press**\n\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he subsequently apologized.\n\n**Syrian Refugee Crisis**\n\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana. In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence unsuccessfully appealed. In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S are offensive and unconstitutional.\"\n\n**Public-Records Requests and Use of Private Email**\n\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright.\" As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts. While Pence's use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues. In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure. Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S secretary of state. In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence.\n\n**Re-election Campaign and Withdrawal**\n\nPence ran for a second term as governor and was unopposed in the Republican primary on May 3, 2016. He was to face Democrat John R Gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate. Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.\n\n**2016 Vice Presidential Campaign**\n\nShortly before the 2016 Indiana Republican presidential primary, Pence endorsed Texas U.S Senator Ted Cruz, who would lose the primary to Trump. Pence then endorsed Trump after the latter became the party's presumptive nominee for president of the United States.\n\n**Vice Presidency (2017-2021)**\n\nPence became the 48th vice president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his tenure, he performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security. He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.\n\n**Political Action Committee**\n\nIn May 2017, Pence filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to form Great America Committee, a political action committee (PAC) that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst. Pence is the only vice president to have started his own PAC while still in office.\n\n**Pence and the Trump Impeachment Inquiry**\n\nPence was a key player in the Trump–Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. Pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S military aid to Ukraine. Pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.\n\n**Death of Soleimani**\n\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate the Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Qaeda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans.\" Pence insisted Soleimani had \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks,\" which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nOn February 26, 2020, President Trump named Pence as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Various public health officials and members of Congress had suggested the selection of a \"Coronavirus Czar,\" though Trump said that would not be the title's name. As the leader of the task force, Pence coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, and White House Office.\n\n**2020 Vice Presidential Election**\n\nAhead of his presidential campaign on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump's name. Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence's alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, \"I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage.\" Biden had previously referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in 2018, and Pence and Biden exchanged conversations via phone before Pence's 2017 transition into the vice presidency.\n\n**Vote Counting and Storming of the Capitol**\n\nIn January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election. As vice president, Pence presided over the January 6, 2021, congressional joint session to count the electoral votes—normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In the days leading up to the session, Trump declared both in public and in private that Pence should use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump–Pence the winners of the election. Pence demurred that the United States Constitution did not give him that power, but Trump falsely insisted that \"The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.\" According to The New York Times, multiple sources claim that Trump called Pence before he departed to certify the results urging him again one last time, ultimately telling him, \"You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.\" Before the start of the Joint Session, Pence stated in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that the Constitution prevented him from deciding which electoral votes counted and which did not.\n\n**Post-Vice Presidency (2021-Present)**\n\nPence did not have a permanent place of residence in Indiana when he left the vice presidency. Official records indicated that Pence had not owned a residence in Indiana since 2013, having lived in the governor's mansion and then the vice president's residence in Washington. For several months after leaving office, he and his wife stayed at residences owned by various Indiana Republican politicians. It is believed that he was at one time staying in a cabin owned by his former lieutenant governor, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb. In May 2021, the Pences bought a home in Carmel, Indiana.\n\n**Classified Documents Investigation**\n\nIn January 2023, after classified documents were found at the home of President Joe Biden, Pence asked his lawyer to search his home \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The attorney found around a dozen documents marked as classified in Pence's Indiana home and turned over the documents to the FBI. The discovery came after Pence had repeatedly said that he did not have classified documents. Pence has taken responsibility for the documents and said that he was unaware of his possession of them. The FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division reviewed the incident. Pence indicated he would \"fully cooperate.\" On February 10, the FBI searched his home. In June, the Department of Justice notified Pence that its investigation had ended and that no charges would be brought forward.\n\n**2024 Presidential Campaign**\n\nPolls of Republicans in 2021 regarding their preferred presidential candidate in 2024 implied that Pence could begin a campaign as a top-tier candidate if former President Trump were to forgo a run. At the same time, said polling also foretold a precipitous decline in Pence's polling numbers if Trump were to seek the presidency again. In light of this, there was a widespread view among both Republican leaders and grassroots Republicans that \"Pence is dead in the early waters of 2024.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPence and his wife, Karen (née Batten), met while he was in law school at Indiana University. They were married in 1985. Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. Mike and Karen Pence have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey. Michael Pence is a pilot in the United States Marine Corps. During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses. On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother remarried—this time to Basil Coolidge F", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mike_Pence\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and

reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state .. added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections\" [77] The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2 billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14 billion annual state budget include $24 million cut from colleges and universities; $27 million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA); [78] and $12 million cut from the Department of Correction [79] During

$10-million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan [103] [104] Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, \"getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool\" [104] Demand for enrollment in the program \"far outstripped\" capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80 million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding, [103] arguing that \"Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion\" [105] After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds [103] [106]\n\n\nEnergy and environment\nDuring Pence's term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly \"repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana's energy efficiency efforts\" [115] Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that \"Indiana is a pro-coal state,\" expressing support for an \"all-of-the-above energy strategy\", and stating: \"we must continue to oppose the

opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property [119] In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue [120] In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary's still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns [121] [122] The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to Indiana, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana attorney general Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as \"an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government\" [122] In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer

be unlikely to prevail at trial [156] The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit [158]\n\n\nMedia and the press\nIn June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he subsequently apologized [159]\n\n\nSyrian refugee crisis\nAs governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana [165] In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence's order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence unsuccessfully appealed [165] In December 2015, Pence said that \"calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S are offensive and unconstitutional\" [166]\n\n\nPublic-records requests and use of private email\nPence \"repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright\" [167] [168] [169] As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence's contacts [170] While Pence's use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues [171] In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure [171] Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence's use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence's past attacks on Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while U.S secretary of state [171] In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence's personal AOL account email correspondence [167]\n\n\nRe-election campaign and withdrawal\nPence ran for a second term as governor and was unopposed in the Republican primary on May 3, 2016 He was to face Democrat John R Gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate [172] Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence's place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate [173] [174] Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election [175]\n\n\n2016 vice presidential campaign\nShortly before the 2016 Indiana Republican presidential primary, Pence endorsed Texas U.S Senator Ted Cruz, who would lose the primary to Trump [62] Pence then endorsed Trump after the latter became the party's presumptive nominee for president of the United States [176]\n\n\nVice presidency (2017–2021)\nDefunct\n\n\nInauguration\nOn January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas, using Reagan's Bible, opened to 2 Chronicles 7:14, \"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land,\" which is the same verse Reagan used for his swearing-ins as governor and president Pence also used his personal Bible [205]\n\n\nAdvisors and staff\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security [207] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017 [208]\n\n\nTenure\nOn the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security [207] He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017 [208]\n\n\nPolitical action committee\nIn May 2017, Pence filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to form Great America Committee, a political action committee (PAC) that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst [259] [260] Pence is the only vice president to have started his own PAC while still in office [261] Pence denied a New York Times article's allegations that he would run for president in 2020, calling them \"laughable and absurd\", and said the article was \"disgraceful and offensive\" [262]\n\n\nPence and the Trump impeachment inquiry\nPence was a key player in the Trump–Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry Pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S military aid to Ukraine Pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption [263]\n\n\nDeath of Soleimani\nPence defended Trump's decision in January 2020 to assassinate the Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Qaeda attacks on the United States to Iran In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani \"an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans\" Pence insisted Soleimani had \"assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks\", which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved Many experts responded that Pence's claims were unsubstantiated [266] Pence's spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, ten of whom \"were assisted by Soleimani\" [267]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn February 26, 2020, President Trump named Pence as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S [268] Various public health officials and members of Congress had suggested the selection of a \"Coronavirus Czar\", though Trump said that would not be the title's name [269] As the leader of the task force, Pence coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, and White House Office [270] [271]\n\n\n2020 vice presidential election\nAhead of his presidential campaign on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump's name Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence's alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, \"I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn't be given a silent reaction on the world stage.\" Biden had previously referred to Pence as a \"decent guy\" in 2018, and Pence and Biden exchanged conversations via phone before Pence's 2017 transition into the vice presidency [282]\n\n\nVote counting and storming of the Capitol\nIn January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election As vice president, Pence presided over the January 6, 2021, congressional joint session to count the electoral votes—normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event In the days leading up to the session, Trump declared both in public and in private that Pence should use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump–Pence the winners of the election [301] Pence demurred that the United States Constitution did not give him that power, but Trump falsely insisted that \"The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.\" [302] \nAccording to The New York Times, multiple sources claim that Trump called Pence before he departed to certify the results urging him again one last time ultimately telling him, \"You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.\" [303] \nBefore the start of the Joint Session, Pence stated in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that the Constitution prevented him from deciding which electoral votes counted and which did not [304]\n\n\nPost-vice presidency (2021–present)\nPence did not have a permanent place of residence in Indiana when he left the vice presidency Official records indicated that Pence had not owned a residence in Indiana since 2013, having lived in the governor's mansion and then the vice president's residence in Washington As a result, for several months after leaving office, he and his wife stayed at residences owned by various Indiana Republican politicians It is believed that he was at one time staying in a cabin owned by his former lieutenant governor, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb [320] [321] In May 2021, the Pences bought a home in Carmel, Indiana [322]\n\n\nClassified documents investigation\nIn January 2023, after classified documents were found at the home of President Joe Biden, Pence asked his lawyer to search his home \"out of an abundance of caution\" The attorney found around a dozen documents marked as classified in Pence's Indiana home and turned over the documents to the FBI The discovery came after Pence had repeatedly said that he did not have classified documents [341] Pence has taken responsibility for the documents and said that he was unaware of his possession of them The FBI and the Justice Department's National Security Division reviewed the incident Pence indicated he would \"fully cooperate\" [342] On February 10, the FBI searched his home [343] In June, the Department of Justice notified Pence that its investigation had ended and that no charges would be brought forward [344]\n\n\n2024 presidential campaign\nPolls of Republicans in 2021 regarding their preferred presidential candidate in 2024 implied that Pence could begin a campaign as a top-tier candidate if former President Trump were to forgo a run [345] [346] At the same time, said polling also foretold a precipitous decline in Pence's polling numbers if Trump were to seek the presidency again [347] In light of this, there was a widespread view among both Republican leaders and grassroots Republicans that \"Pence is dead in the early waters of 2024.\" [348]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPence and his wife, Karen (née Batten), met while he was in law school at Indiana University [14] They were married in 1985 Pence's father died in 1988, leaving his mother a widow with four grown children and two teenagers Mike and Karen Pence have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey [358] [359] Michael Pence is a pilot in the United States Marine Corps [360] [361] [362] During Pence's service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses [8] [18] During an interview in 2002, Pence told a reporter that he would not have dinner alone with a woman other than his wife [363] On May 1, 2004, Pence's mother remarried – this time to Basil Coolidge Fritsch, a widower since 2001 [364] [365] In 2018, Pence's oldest brother, Greg, entered and won the political race to represent Indiana's 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike) [366] [367] Greg and Mike are similar enough in appearance that Greg once successfully acted as a decoy to lure the press away from his brother when Mike Pence was being touted as a potential running mate to Donald Trump [368] [369]\n\n\nReligion\nPence was raised in a Catholic family, was an altar server, and attended parochial school [42] [375] He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year—and specifically \"a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978\" [376] referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky—as the moment he made a \"commitment to Christ\" [42] [375] After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister [375] Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church [42] [375] In 2013, Pence said his family was \"kind of looking for a church\" [42] In 2016, Pence and his wife regularly worshiped at College Park Church, a nondenominational church in Indianapolis [14] He has described himself as \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order\", and as \"a born-again, Evangelical Catholic\" [42] [375] As one commentator put it, \"Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve—he wears the entire Jesus jersey.\" [14]\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "M._Karunanidhi", "content": "\nEarly life and family\n\nKarunanidhi was born on 3 June 1924, in the village of Thirukkuvalai in Tanjore district (currently Nagapattinam district), Madras Presidency, to Ayyadurai Muthuvel and Anjugam He had two elder sisters, Periyanayaki and Shanmugasundari [23] [page needed] There was some misconception that his birth name was Dakshinamurthy, [24] later changed to Karunanidhi as influenced by Dravidian and rationalist movements, [25] [26] Karunanidhi himself stated that C.N Annadurai asked him to keep his birthname \"Karunanidhi\", since it is already popular among the people [27] [additional citation(s) needed] In his own writings Karunanidhi said that his family were of the Isai Vellalar, a community who had traditionally played musical instruments at ceremonial occasions; [23] [24] however his political rival M G Ramachandran and some observers contested that and said that he was of Telugu ancestry [28] Karunanidhi started his education at a local school Karunanidhi's father was eager to teach him music His music teachers were from the Isai Vellalar group, and the lessons were conducted in temples where he was not allowed to cover his upper body, wear slippers, or wear a cotton cloth around his hips as a sign of respect for the upper caste people He couldn't tolerate learning in an environment where he wasn't treated with respect, which made his father agree to stop his music classes His father also asked the local headmaster to set up special tutoring courses for Karunanidhi and paid a tuition fee of milk every morning and evening [29] [30]\n\nEntry into politics and early writing career\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the Justice Party, and participated in Anti-Hindi agitations [34] As a teenager he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders including Panagal Arasar, Periyar and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy (after whom Karunanidhi later named one of his sons) Karunanidhi joined the anti-Hindi protests sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938 organised a group of boys to hold demonstrations travelling around Tiruvarur on a cycle rickshaw The law was rescinded in 1939 The taste for activism however stuck and in the ensuing years, after a brief flirtation with Communism, Karunanidhi started following the work and speeches of leaders of Justice Party, Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam [23] According to Karunanidhi, he joined the Periyar's movement when he saw his father hurriedly rising and tied his towel to his waist from his head as a gesture of servitude when an upper caste landlord walked past him [35]\n\n\nEarly political career\nKarunanidhi along with a group of young band of Tamil enthusiasts led by Annadurai dissented from Dravidar Kazhagam and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on 17 September 1949 [50]\n\n\nKallakudi demonstration\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi demonstration in Kallakudi in 1953 when he was 29 The original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi Kallakudi was renamed as \"Dalmiapuram\" by the state administration led by Rajagopalachari to commemorate the North Indian business magnate Ram Krishan Dalmia, who owned a cement factory there [51] DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi because Ram Krishna Dalmia depicted north Indian hegemonic power and predatory businesses In the protest Karunanidhi and his companions erased the name Dalmiapuram from the railway station and lay down on the tracks blocking the course of trains Six people died in the protest and Karunanidhi was arrested and was sent to jail for six months [52] [53]\n\n\nMLA and deputy leader of opposition\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the Kulithalai seat in Tiruchirapalli during the 1957 election among the 15 DMK legislators elected and were elected as the Chief Whip [54] During the 1959 elections of the Madras Municipal Corporation, he was managing the party campaigns, the party won 45 out of the 90 contested [20] He was elected as DMK treasurer on 25 September 1960 [20] Karunanidhi was elected to the state assembly for the second time on 21 February 1962, from the Thanjavur constituency He defeated Congress candidate A.Y.S Parisutha Nadar [20] In the same year, he became the deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly [13]\n\n\n1965 Anti-Hindi Agitations and imprisonment\nAnti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu started when the Union government announced that Hindi would become the single official language The DMK, led by CN Annadurai, planned to organise a series of rallies against the action and declared 26 January to be a day of mourning Chants of 'Hindi Ozhiga, Tamil Vaazhga' (Down with Hindi, long live Tamil) were heard everywhere Violence continued across the state and several set themselves on fire [56] [20] Karunanidhi, the leader of the DMK's anti-Hindi agitation, was arrested on 16 February 1965, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Central Prison in Palayamkottai [20] He was later released at 15 April 1985 [57]\n\n\nCabinet Minister of state\nAnnadurai declared Karunnanidhi as a DMK candidate for the February 1967 Madras Legislative Assembly election, at the DMK's State-level meeting at Virugambakkam, Chennai Karunanidhi, as DMK treasurer, raised ₹11 lakh

dismissed before he even got home form the function This occurred just 50 days before his tenure ended The DMK suffered a great deal of damage once it was dismissed 25,000 members of the party including Karunanidhi's close relatives and friends were imprisoned His maternal uncle Murasoli Maran and his son M.K Stalin suffered health issues from torture and C Chittibabu died trying to save

out of 39 seats in the 1977 Indian general election [84] Top party figures such as general secretary V.R Nedunchezhiyan, K Rajaram and S Madhavan quit accusing Karunanidhi for the DMK's failure in the general elections and demanded Karunanidhi to resign as the party's leader [20] Later, DMK lost the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, Karunanidhi won from Anna Nagar consistency and became the leader of the opposition [85] [20]\n\n\nLeader of the DMK (1983–1989)\nKarunanidhi and DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly soon after the 1983 anti-Tamil

Karunanidhi**\n\nMuthuvel Karunanidhi was a prominent Indian politician who served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for five terms. He was a key figure in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party and was known for his contributions to Tamil literature and politics.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nKarunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in the village of Thirukkuvalai in Tanjore district (currently Nagapattinam district), Madras Presidency, to Ayyadurai Muthuvel and Anjugam. He had two elder sisters, Periyanayaki and Shanmugasundari. There was some misconception that his birth name was Dakshinamurthy, later changed to Karunanidhi as influenced by Dravidian and rationalist movements.\n\n**Entry into Politics and Early Writing Career**\n\nKarunanidhi entered politics at the age of 14, inspired by a speech by Alagirisamy of the Justice Party, and participated in Anti-Hindi agitations. As a teenager, he was captivated by the political writings of Tamil leaders, including Panagal Arasar, Periyar, and Pattukottai Azhagirisamy. Karunanidhi joined the anti-Hindi protests sparked by the provincial government's legislation making Hindi-education mandatory in schools, and in 1938, organized a group of boys to hold demonstrations traveling around Tiruvarur on a cycle rickshaw.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nKarunanidhi along with a group of young band of Tamil enthusiasts led by Annadurai dissented from Dravidar Kazhagam and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on September 17, 1949.\n\n**Kallakudi Demonstration**\n\nThe first major protest that aided Karunanidhi in gaining ground in Tamil politics was his involvement in the Kallakudi demonstration in Kallakudi in 1953, when he was 29. The original name of this industrial town was Kallakudi. Kallakudi was renamed as Dalmiapuram by the state administration led by Rajagopalachari to commemorate the North Indian business magnate Ram Krishan Dalmia, who owned a cement factory there. DMK wanted to change the name back to Kallakudi because Ram Krishna Dalmia depicted north Indian hegemonic power and predatory businesses.\n\n**MLA and Deputy Leader of Opposition**\n\nAt the age of 33, Karunanidhi entered the Tamil Nadu assembly by winning the Kulithalai seat in Tiruchirapalli during the 1957 election among the 15 DMK legislators elected and were elected as the Chief Whip. During the 1959 elections of the Madras Municipal Corporation, he was managing the party campaigns, the party won 45 out of the 90 contested. He was elected as DMK treasurer on September 25, 1960. Karunanidhi was elected to the state assembly for the second time on February 21, 1962, from the Thanjavur constituency and defeated Congress candidate A.Y.S Parisutha Nadar. In the same year, he became the deputy leader of opposition in the state assembly.\n\n**1965 Anti-Hindi Agitations and Imprisonment**\n\nAnti-Hindi agitations in Tamil Nadu started when the Union government announced that Hindi would become the single official language. The DMK, led by CN Annadurai, planned to organize a series of rallies against the action and declared January 26 to be a day of mourning. Chants of 'Hindi Ozhiga, Tamil Vaazhga' (Down with Hindi, long live Tamil) were heard everywhere. Violence continued across the state, and several set themselves on fire. Karunanidhi, the leader of the DMK's anti-Hindi agitation, was arrested on February 16, 1965, and sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Central Prison in Palayamkottai.\n\n**First Term as Chief Minister (1969-1971)**\n\nOn February 3, 1969, the existing chief minister Annadurai died of cancer. On February 9, 1969, the DMK's MLAs chose Karunanidhi to lead the party. He was also chosen as the DMK's legislative assembly leader. Karunanidhi was appointed chief minister on February 10, 1969, the next day, and was sworn in by Governor Sardar Ujjal Singh.\n\n**Second Term as Chief Minister (1971-1976)**\n\nIn March 1971, Karunanidhi formed an alliance with the Congress headed by Indira Gandhi, on the precondition that her party will not contest in any Assembly seats. In March 1971, the DMK contests for both the Assembly and the Lok Sabha. The DMK-Congress combination beat the Swatantra Party-Congress (Organisation) alliance led by Kamaraj and Rajagopalachari. The DMK won a landslide victory, with its candidates capturing 184 of the 234 seats on the ballot. Karunanidhi was re-elected as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the second time.\n\n**The Emergency and Government Dismissal**\n\nHe resisted letting the Emergency on Tamil Nadu for approximately seven months, until his administration was ousted on January 31, 1976. Karunanidhi was a supporter of Jayaparakash Narayan's anti-Emergency campaign and was the first one to ally with his Janata Party. During an event at Don Bosco School, Karunanidhi stated, \"Most likely, this would be my final public function as Chief Minister.\" He was dismissed before he even got home from the function. This occurred just 50 days before his tenure ended. The DMK suffered a great deal of damage once it was dismissed. 25,000 members of the party, including Karunanidhi's close relatives and friends, were imprisoned. His maternal uncle Murasoli Maran and his son M.K Stalin suffered health issues from torture, and C Chittibabu died trying to save M.K Stalin in prison.\n\n**Leader of the Opposition (1977-1983)**\n\nThe AIADMK-led alliance won 34 seats out of 39 seats in the 1977 Indian general election. Top party figures, such as general secretary V.R Nedunchezhiyan, K Rajaram, and S Madhavan, quit, accusing Karunanidhi for the DMK's failure in the general elections and demanding Karunanidhi to resign as the party's leader. Later, DMK lost the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election. Karunanidhi won from Anna Nagar constituency and became the leader of the opposition.\n\n**Leader of the DMK (1983-1989)**\n\nKarunanidhi and DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan resigned from the State Assembly soon after the 1983 anti-Tamil riots in Sri Lanka, in protest of the union government and state's failure to defend the Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka. In May 1986, Karunanidhi established the Tamil Eelam Supporters Organisation (TESO) and held a major national conclave in Madurai to promote the Tamil aspiration for self-determination in Sri Lanka.\n\n**Third Term as Chief Minister (1989-1991)**\n\nAfter a 13-year break, the DMK returned to power in 1989. Following MGR's death from a heart attack, the AIADMK split into two. The late Chief Minister MG Ramachandran's wife Janaki Ramachandran led one faction, while J Jayalalithaa led another that helped the DMK. With about 33% of the vote, the DMK was able to secure a solid majority of 151 seats. Karunanidhi was elected Chief Minister for the third time from Chennai's Harbour constituency.\n\n**Leader of the DMK (1991-1996)**\n\nAssassination of Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE took place during the electoral campaign for the 1991 Indian general elections. The DMK was accused in the incident, and mobs vandalized the properties of DMK members and functionaries. The AIADMK-Congress coalition won a decisive win in the Assembly elections on June 24, 1991, and Jayalalithaa was elected Chief Minister for the first time. Except for Karunanidhi, Parithi Ilamvazhuthi was the only DMK candidate elected in the elections, so Karunanidhi resigned from his seat immediately.\n\n**Fourth Term as Chief Minister (1996-2001)**\n\nIn 1996, Karunanidhi formed an alliance with the Tamil Maanila Congress, led by G.K Moopanar, and was elected Chief Minister for the fourth time. At the centre, he joined the Deve Gowda-led United Front government. Karunanidhi's party, which had only two seats in the 1991 elections, got 173 MPs, nine more than the AIADMK had the year before.\n\n**Thiruvalluvar Statue**\n\nOn December 31, 1975, during a state cabinet meeting led by Karunanidhi, a plan was authorized to erect a statue for Thiruvalluvar at Kanyakumari. The DMK administration was dismissed a month later, and the state was placed under President's Rule. During his next term from 1989 to 1991, he resurrected the project. In March 1990, when presenting the Budget, he stated that a 133-foot-tall monument of Thiruvalluvar will be erected in Kanyakumari. He launched the project six months later. The project was restarted once he reclaimed power in May 1996. He unveiled the monument on New Year's Day, 2000.\n\n**2001 State Elections**\n\nJayalalithaa, who was aligned with the Tamil Maanila Congress, the Congress, the Pattali Makkal Katchi, the Communist Party of India, and other parties in 2001 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections, received 49.89% of the vote, defeating the ruling DMK-led alliance by a large majority. Karunanidhi's assumption that the DMK will be re-elected on the grounds of its government's good performance proved incorrect. His government's performance was praised by voters, but it was not transferred into votes. Karunanidhi was elected from Chepauk constituency.\n\n**Leader of the DMK (2001-2006)**\n\nKarunanidhi served as the president of the DMK. K Anbazhagan was made the leader of opposition.\n\n**Arrest and Release**\n\nIn the midnight of June 30, 2001, he was arrested on the orders of J Jayalalithaa as an act of vendetta, based on a First Information report over alleged losses of ₹12 crore on construction of flyovers filed by Commissioner J C T Acharyalu, who Karunanidhi had earlier kept under suspension. He was arrested after a few hours, with no time for investigation. Sun TV broadcast these images live across the state, the cops stormed in, busted open his bedroom door, and hauled him out. The images of Karunanidhi falling, being dragged, being lifted up, and pushed by the police created a sympathy wave for him. T R Baalu and Murasoli Maran, two Union ministers, were also detained. Karunanidhi told reporters, \"They didn't have a summons. They didn't have an arrest warrant. They claimed that these were unnecessary. They dragged me. They pushed me. They ripped my shirt. We treated her with respect when we arrested her.\" Union Law Minister Arun Jaitley claimed it was a case of 'personal agenda.' The Union ministers were freed, and the allegations against them were dismissed. Karunanidhi was later released on humanitarian grounds. The police later dropped the case in 2006, citing it was a \"mistake of facts.\"\n\n**Fifth Term as Chief Minister (2006-2011)**\n\nOn May 8, 2006, Karunanidhi's administration became the first minority administration in Tamil Nadu's history. Soon after, he declared a price cut for rice and the waiver of cooperative farmer loans, two of the DMK's main electoral promises. The DMK won 96 of the 234 seats and emerged as the single-largest party in the Assembly with the alliance of CPI-M, Congress, and CPI. Karunanidhi won from Chepauk constituency.\n\n**Sixth and Seventh Terms as Chief Minister (2011-2016)**\n\nIn the 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the AIADMK alliance won 203 seats, and the DMK alliance won 31. Karunanidhi won by a huge margin of 50,249 votes from Tiruvarur Assembly constituency. Following his defeat, M Karunanidhi said, \"People have given me proper rest,\" before congratulating the people of the state.\n\n**Awards and Titles**\n\nKarunanidhi contested and won in all Tamil Nadu Assembly general elections (then Madras) since 1957 except 1984 when he didn't contest the election. He resigned immediately after being elected in 1991, due to the routing of his party (only 2 seats out of 234).\n\n**Elections Contested and Positions Held**\n\nIn September 2007, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed Sethusamudram Canal project, stating that it will demolish limestone shoals the party claimed to be remains of a bridge built by Rama to get to Lanka to save his wife Sita. He replied, \"It is said that there was a God thousands of years ago called Ram. Do not touch the bridge built by him. I ask who is this Ram? Which engineering college did he graduate from?\" BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad accused Karunanidhi of religious discrimination when noting, \"We would like to know from Karunanidhi if he would make a similar statement against the head of any other religion.\" CPM general secretary Prakash Karat came to his support and said, \"in this country, there are individuals with religious views and people like us. It is not wrong to voice an opinion.\" Later, Karunanidhi clarified his remarks by saying, \"I'm not against Ram, my conscience is my God.\"\n\n**Connections with LTTE**\n\nIn an April 2009 interview to NDTV, Karunanidhi made a controversial remark stating that \"Prabhakaran is my good friend\" and also said, \"India could not forgive the LTTE for assassinating Rajiv Gandhi.\" An interim report of Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the investigation into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, had indicted Karunanidhi for abetting Rajiv Gandhi's murderers, who belonged to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but the final report contained no such allegations.\n\n**Allegations of Nepotism**\n\nKarunanidhi has been accused by opponents, by some members of his party, and by other political observers of trying to promote nepotism. Many political opponents and DMK party senior leaders have been critical of the rise of M K Stalin in the party. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own. Stalin was jailed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during the Emergency that a fellow DMK party prisoner died trying to save him.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKarunanidhi married three times. His parents were eager to marry him off to Padma, the sister of C S Jayaraman. He made one condition that the bride side must accept a reformist wedding. He hoped they would call off the marriage as he was not earning and the bride's father was religious. But their family agreed to their marriage also held the marriage of their son C.S Jayaraman the same day. He married Padmavathi Ammal on September 13, 1944, under the Dravidian movement's Self-Respect form of marriage where the bride and groom exchanged garlands, without a thaali (mangalsutra), and specifically without Brahmin priests presiding. They had a son M K Muthu, who was briefly active in Tamil films and politics. Padmavathi died in 1948 soon after childbirth. In September of that year, Karunanidhi's marriage was arranged with Dayalu Ammal, with whom he had three sons, M K Alagiri, M K Stalin, and M K Tamilarasu, and a daughter, M K Selvi. Alagiri and Stalin are active in state politics and competed to be their father's political successors, before Stalin prevailed. Tamilarasu is a businessman and film-producer and campaigner for his father and his party; Selvi campaigned for Karunanidhi elections too. With his third marriage with Rajathi Ammal, Karunanidhi had a daughter, Kanimozhi.\n\n**Illness, Death, and Reactions**\n\nDue to a drug-induced allergy, Karunanidhi became unwell in October 2016. He was hospitalized in the first week of December 2016 for \"optimization of nutrition and hydration\" and subsequently for a throat and lung infections. He went through a tracheostomy surgery to improve his breathing. He has stayed out of politics since then, making just a few public appearances.

eager to teach him music His music teachers were from the Isai Vellalar group, and the lessons were conducted in temples where he was not allowed to cover his upper body, wear slippers, or wear a cotton cloth around his hips as a sign of respect for the upper caste people He couldn't tolerate learning in an environment where he wasn't treated with respect, which made his father agree to stop

and Tatum [13] Soderbergh was hired to direct after getting fired from Moneyball [14] In 2010, Tatum told an Australian newspaper that he would like to make a movie about his experiences as a male stripper, saying: \"I've already got the director picked out I'd like Nicolas Refn, who did the film Bronson, to do it because he's insane for it.\" [15] Refn initially agreed on doing the film because he and Tatum were going to do another movie together However, since that project did not get off the ground and due to his busy schedule, Tatum, who was then working with Soderbergh on Haywire, brought him the idea [16] After Soderbergh cast Tatum and Pettyfer in the lead roles, Carolin spent time revising the screenplay [7] He wrote the first draft in a month [17] Soderbergh

actor said: \"I knew that I was just going to be able to fly It was really fun to play someone so committed, in many ways.\" [16] [27] Joe Manganiello accepted the role of Big Dick Richie after talking to What to Expect When You're Expecting co-star Chris Rock, who convinced him to do it [28] Cody Horn gave her insight on how she got the part of Brooke:\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography

She was the eldest of three children, with two younger brothers. Her father, Mohinder Singh, was an officer in the Indian Army, which meant that Chopra had to be educated at several army schools due to her father's postings in remote locations all over India.\n\nChopra's family had strong connections to the film industry, as her father's sister, Darshi Garewal, was married to the film actor Prem Chopra. This made Pamela a cousin of the actress Simi Garewal, who is known for her work in several Bollywood films.\n\n**Career**\n\nPamela Chopra dabbled in various fields related to film, including singing and producing. She sang several film songs, including the popular numbers \"Kabhi Kabhie\" (1976) and \"Mujhse Dosti Karoge!\" (2002).

She also co-wrote the script of \"Dil To Pagal Hai\" along with her husband, son Aditya Chopra, and professional writer Tanuja Chandra.\n\nIn addition to her work behind the camera, Chopra made a brief appearance on screen in the opening song \"Ek Duje Ke Vaaste\" of \"Dil To Pagal Hai,\" where she and her husband appeared together. As a schoolgirl, Pamela had learned Bharatanatyam, but she never performed in public.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPamela Chopra married Yash Chopra in 1970, in a traditional Indian arranged marriage. The two families had a common friend, the mother of film-maker Romesh Sharma, who suggested that Pamela would be the ideal bride for Yash Chopra. \"She was not wrong because we had a wonderful marriage,\" Chopra said in an interview forty years later.\n\nThe couple met each other for the first time in a formal setting and found each other agreeable.

the film [16] [17] Burg and Koules said that Rock's treatment of Saw was comparable to what Eddie Murphy had done for buddy cop films in 48 Hrs., giving the Saw series a \"completely fresh perspective\" [5] Likewise, Bousman stated that in comparison to previous entries, Spiral included less violence and gore, expressing the conviction that the gore and violence were the gimmick for him back when he started working in the Saw films, but that both elements now serve the story, which focuses more on character, tension and fear [18] Stolberg also confirmed that the ninth installment

confirmed as scriptwriters [5] With the announcement, Rock stated, \"I've been a fan of Saw since the first film in 2004 I am excited by the opportunity to take this to a really intense and twisted new place\" [5] Bousman, who refused to direct another entry after Saw IV, turned down the chance to direct a Broadway show in New York City after Rock insisted he direct the film [16] [17] Burg and Koules said that Rock's treatment of Saw was comparable to what Eddie Murphy had done for buddy cop films in 48 Hrs., giving the Saw series a \"completely fresh perspective\" [5] Likewise, Bousman stated that in comparison to previous entries, Spiral included less violence and gore, expressing the conviction that the gore and violence were the gimmick for him back when he started working in the Saw films, but that both elements now serve the story, which focuses more on character, tension and fear [18] Stolberg also confirmed that the ninth installment would exist in the same canon as the previous eight films, and would not be a reboot or a direct sequel to Jigsaw [19]\n\n\nCasting\nRock starred as Detective Zeke Banks [20] The character was conceived by Rock, Stolberg and Goldfinger from the conversations they had before writing the screenplay, with Rock musing about what he would do if he were the original Saw protagonist Dr Lawrence Gordon and be forced to cut off his own foot, until they decided that it would be interesting if Rock played a cop ostracized by his colleagues [7]\n\n\nFilming\nOn a production budget of $20 million, [25] principal photography began on July 8, 2019, in Toronto, Ontario [26]  Rock provided rewrites while on set, and completely overhauled the introduction scene for his character [14] According to Bousman, a scene featuring a trap had to be cut from the film due to it being \"too gnarly\" [27] On August 28, 2019, filming officially wrapped up [28] During post-production, editing was completed by Dev Singh [29]\n\n\nRelease\nSpiral was originally scheduled to be released by Lionsgate Films on October 23, 2020 In July 2019, it was moved up to May 15, 2020 [30] As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's release was delayed to

Producers took advantage of Dow's popularity and scripted episodes delving into Wally's dating life, his after-school jobs, his friends, and his car.\n\n## Stage Career\n\nIn 1978, Dow and Jerry Mathers starred in a production of the comedy play Boeing, Boeing, which ran for 10 weeks in Kansas City, Missouri. Dow and Mathers then toured the dinner theater circuit in a production of So Long, Stanley, written specifically for the TV brother duo, for 18 months. This marked a new chapter in Dow's career, as he transitioned from television to the stage, exploring new creative outlets and challenges.\n\n## Art Career\n\nIn addition to acting, directing, producing, and writing, Dow was a sculptor, creating abstract bronze sculptures. He said about his work: \"The figures are abstract and not meant to represent reality, but rather the truth of the interactions as I see and feel them. I find the wood in the hills of Topanga Canyon and each piece evolves from my subconscious. I produce limited editions of nine bronzes using the lost wax process from molds of the original burl sculpture.\" Reuters wrote of Dow's work that it \"features humanlike forms devoid of expression or detail; they are widely open to the viewer's interpretation.\" Dow's art career was a testament to his creativity and versatility, as he explored different mediums and styles, pushing the boundaries of his artistic expression.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nDow married Carol Marlow in June 1969 and their marriage ended in 1980. They had one child, who was born in 1973. In June 1980, Dow married Lauren Shulkind. This marked a new chapter in Dow's personal life, as he navigated new relationships and parenthood.\n\n## Death\n\nIn May 2022, Dow was diagnosed with liver cancer. He died on July 27, 2022, a day after his death was widely misreported. This marked the end of a long and storied career, as well as a personal life filled with love, creativity, and adventure.\n\n## Selected Filmography\n\n* Leave It to Beaver (1957-1963)\n* Boeing, Boeing (1978)\n* So Long, Stanley (1978-1979)\n* Various art exhibitions and sculptures\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list of Tony Dow's filmography, but rather a selection of his most notable works.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tony_Dow\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nDow was born in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, the son of Muriel Virginia (Montrose), a stuntwoman in westerns, and John Stevens Dow, a designer and contractor [3] In his youth, he trained as a swimmer and was a Junior Olympics diving champion [4]\n\n\nScreen career\nWith a little stage acting and two television pilots as his only acting experience, Dow's career began when he went on an open casting call and landed the role of Wally Cleaver in Leave It to Beaver [5] [4] [6] With the exception of the television pilot, for the show's entire run, from 1957 to 1963, he played the older son of June (played by Barbara Billingsley) and Ward (played by Hugh Beaumont) Cleaver, and the older brother of protagonist Theodore \"Beaver\" Cleaver (played by Jerry Mathers) As played by Dow, Wally was the \"all-American\" boy—an intelligent, polite teenager, trusted by his parents, popular with his peers, and liked by his teachers (Wally was based on the series writer Joe Connelly's son, Jay.)

Born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, Williams is the youngest of five daughters to Oracene Price and Richard Williams. She is a member of the tennis family that includes her older sister Venus, who is also a professional tennis player.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nWilliams's parents initially wanted her to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments. In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as a wild-card entry in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California, but was denied due to age-eligibility restrictions. She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the WTA, but withdrew it at her parents' request. Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.\n\n**1995–1998: Professional Debut**\n\nWilliams's parents initially wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments. In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as a wild-card entry in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California, but was denied due to age-eligibility restrictions. She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the WTA, but withdrew it at her parents' request. Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules. Williams lost in the first qualifying round to 18-year-old American Annie Miller.\n\n**1999: First Major and Becoming a Top-5 Player**\n\nIn February 1999, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France in Paris. In March, Williams won her first WTA 1000 event at the Evert Cup in California, defeating Steffi Graf in the final. At the Miami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history. In the doubles event at the French Open, she and Venus won the title after defeating Hingis and Anna Kournikova in the final.\n\n**2000–2001: Olympic Gold, US Open Final, and Indian Wells Boycott**\n\nIn 2000, Williams failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the Faber Grand Prix in Germany. Soon afterwards, she missed the French Open due to injury. She recovered and played at the Wimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals; however, the pair won the doubles title. Her defense of the US Open title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams and her sister won the gold medal in doubles at the Sydney Olympics that September, and Williams ended the year by winning the Toyota Princess Cup and finishing at No.6.\n\n**2002–2003: \"Serena Slam\"**\n\nEarly in 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the Medibank International Sydney and later withdraw from the Australian Open. After recovering, Williams won her first title of the year in Scottsdale, Arizona, defeating No.2 Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time after beating No.3 Hingis in the quarterfinals, No.2 Venus in the semifinals, and No.1 Capriati in the final, becoming only the second player in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at the same event.\n\n**2004–2007: Injuries and Comeback**\n\nAfter eight months away from tennis, Williams began her comeback at the NASDAQ-100 Open in March 2004, where she won the title for the third consecutive year. Although ranked No.7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. A few weeks later, Williams was seeded first at Wimbledon, even though her ranking had dropped to No.10. She won six matches en route to the final, where Maria Sharapova defeated her. The loss caused her to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport.\n\n**2008–2010: Injuries, Controversy, and Return to No. 1**\n\nWilliams started 2008 by winning the Hopman Cup for the US, with Mardy Fish. At the Australian Open, she lost in the quarterfinals to Janković, her fourth straight loss in the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament. In the women's doubles event, she and Venus were defeated in the quarterfinals. Williams withdrew from her next three scheduled tournaments because of an urgent need for dental surgery. She then won three consecutive singles titles at Bangalore and her fifth Miami title, tying Graf for the most singles titles at this tournament. She claimed victory at the Family Circle Cup, her first clay-court title since 2002. Her 17-match winning streak was ended by Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals in Berlin. Williams withdrew in Rome in the quarterfinals due to a back injury, and lost in the third round of the French Open to Katarina Srebotnik.\n\n**2011–2013: Return to Dominance, Career Golden Slam**\n\nWilliams made her first appearance on the WTA tour in almost a year in Eastbourne, where she lost in round two to Zvonareva. In June, she attempted to defend her title at Wimbledon, but was eliminated in the round of 16, which dropped her ranking to No.169. Later in the summer, she won titles in both Stanford and Toronto. Williams played the Western & Southern Open, but withdrew due to injury. She reached the final at the US Open, where she faced Stosur. During the match, Williams became angry with umpire Eve Asderaki and made gestures and unflattering comments towards her, including calling her \"a hater.\" Williams eventually lost the match, and then declined to offer Asderaki the customary handshake. A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams did not violate the terms of her probation (on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst), since she did not use profanity when addressing the umpire. In the end, Williams was fined $2,000, but was not barred from competing. The US Open was Williams's final event of 2011, and she ended the year ranked No.12, with two titles and a 22–3 record for the season. She only played in six tournaments during the season.\n\n**2014–2015: Second \"Serena Slam\"**\n\nWilliams defended her title at the Brisbane International by defeating No.2 Azarenka in the final. At the Australian Open, she fell in the fourth round to Ana Ivanovic. In Dubai, Williams lost her semifinal match to Alizé Cornet in straight sets. Williams then played in the Miami Open, where she won her record seventh title with a straight-sets victory over No.2 Li Na. At the Family Circle Cup, she lost to Jana Čepelová in the second round. She made it to the quarterfinals at the Madrid Open before withdrawing with a thigh injury. In Rome, Williams won her third title of the season. She suffered the worst loss of her Grand Slam career in the second round of the French Open when Garbiñe Muguruza defeated her while losing just four games in two sets. Cornet defeated Williams in the third round of Wimbledon, handing Williams her earliest Wimbledon elimination since 2005. During the doubles event with Venus, Serena hit four consecutive doubles faults. She appeared disoriented and unsteady on her feet, and withdrew from the tournament. The official cause of withdrawal was \"viral illness.\"\n\n**2016: Equalling the records of Steffi Graf**\n\nWilliams was the No.1 seed and defending champion at the Australian Open. She reached the final without dropping a set, and faced first-time Grand Slam finalist Angelique Kerber. Williams was considered the heavy favorite, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semifinal, and had dominated in past matches against Kerber, losing only once to her in six meetings. However, Williams lost the final in three sets, marking her first-ever three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam. It was also her first-ever Grand Slam final loss since the 2009 US Open.\n\n**2017: Australian Open victory and pregnancy**\n\nWilliams started 2017 by playing in the WTA Auckland Open for the first time in her career. In the second round, she lost to Madison Brengle. She then won the Australian Open for an Open Era record seventh time, defeating Venus in the final. It was her 23rd Open Era Grand Slam singles title, pushing her past Graf's record of 22. It was the first time in the Open Era that two players aged 35 or older had competed in the final of a Grand Slam tournament. The win ensured Williams's return to the No.1 ranking.\n\n**2018: Return to tennis, Wimbledon, and controversies**\n\nOn January 5, 2018, Williams withdrew from the upcoming Australian Open, citing a lack of sufficient preparation in the wake of her pregnancy. In February, after overcoming pregnancy-related health problems, she returned to the tennis court with Venus. The pair lost to Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs of the Netherlands in the first round of the Fed Cup. Williams then suffered back-to-back early exits in Indian Wells and Miami. Williams made her return to Grand Slam tennis at the 2018 French Open, playing singles and doubles with her sister. In the first round, she defeated Kristýna Plíšková in two sets, then overcame Ashleigh Barty in the second round. She then defeated 11th seed Julia Görges to set up a fourth-round match against Sharapova, whom she had bested 18 consecutive times since 2004. However, Williams withdrew from the match due to an injury.\n\n**2019: Return to the top 10**\n\nWilliams started her 2019 season at the Australian Open, her first appearance at the tournament since winning it in 2017. Seeded 16th, she defeated Tatjana Maria, Eugenie Bouchard, and Dayana Yastremska in the first three rounds, then bested top seed Halep in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met Karolína Plíšková, who won the match after Williams twisted her ankle. Despite the loss, Williams's ranking climbed to No.11.\n\n**2020–2022: Final years**\n\nIn January 2020, Williams won her first singles title as a mother at the ASB Classic, defeating Jessica Pegula in the final. At the Australian Open, Williams lost in the third round to Wang in three sets. Williams then entered the Top Seed Open as the No.1 seed, defeating Venus in the second round before losing to Shelby Rogers in the quarterfinals. At the US Open, Williams defeated Stephens in the third round before losing to Azarenka in the semifinals. Williams withdrew from the delayed French Open in October, citing an Achilles injury she had sustained during the US Open. She failed to reach a Grand Slam final in 2020.\n\n**Farewell tour**\n\nIn the September 2022 issue of Vogue, Williams announced her plans to \"evolve away\" from tennis after the 2022 US Open, indicating retirement. She stated her intention to focus on her family and her venture capital firm. Williams began her farewell tour by entering the Canadian Open in Toronto using a protected ranking. She beat Nuria Párrizas Díaz in straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing to Belinda Bencic. After her elimination, tournament organizers gave Williams gifts to remember the city. Williams subsequently entered the Cincinnati Masters, where she fell to reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the first round.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nWilliams played her older sister Venus in 31 professional matches starting in 1998. Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister. The pair played 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals). They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times. Beginning with the 2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had faced off in four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.\n\n**Against other notable players**\n\nWilliams has notable rivalries with Martina Hingis, Jennifer Capriati, Justine Henin, Victoria Azarenka, Maria Sharapova, and Angelique Kerber.\n\n**Player profile**\n\nWilliams was an aggressive baseliner whose game was centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hit a large number of winners and a large number of unforced errors. Williams's serve—which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis—is known for its speed and accurate placement, which allowed her to deliver numerous aces. At the 2013 Australian Open, she delivered the third-fastest serve in WTA recorded history, a 128.6 mph ace against Ayumi Morita. Williams possessed an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this made it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke. Williams also possessed effective and accurate kick and slice serves. She deployed these as second serves, minimizing double faults and preventing opponents from scoring free points.\n\n**Coaches**\n\nWilliams had five coaches during her career: Richard Williams, Oracene Price, Patrick Mouratoglou, Eric Hechtman, and Rennae Stubbs.\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nWilliams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999, and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma. In 2004, she signed a five-year deal with Nike for $40 million, and has been sponsored by the company ever since. During Williams's tennis career, Nike designed custom clothing and footwear for her The largest building on Nike's Portland campus is the one-million-square-foot Serena Williams Building, which features many references to the athlete's career and long partnership with Nike According to John Hoke, Nike's Chief Design Officer, Williams assisted with the design of the building.\n\n**Rackets**\n\nWilliams used the Wilson Hammer Stretch range of rackets when she won her first Grand Slam title in 1999. She switched to the Hyper Hammer range before switching to the Wilson nCode briefly in 2005. She has used various iterations of the Wilson Blade since 2008. Her racket is typically oversized, with a head size of 104 square inches. Since 2017, Wilson has manufactured a signature racket, the Wilson Blade SW104, which is designed to Williams's specifications. Since 2020, Williams has used a smaller variant of this racket, the Wilson Blade SW102 Autograph.\n\n**Singles: 33 (23-10)**\n- 1999: 1 (Open Gaz de France)\n- 2000: 1 (Faber Grand Prix)\n- 2001: 1

{"title": "Star_Wars_(film)", "content": "\nPlot\nAmid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans  to the Death Star, a colossal space station built by the Galactic Empire that is capable of destroying entire planets Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a Rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby planet of Tatooine.\n\n\nCast\nPhil Brown and Shelagh Fraser appear as Luke's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, respectively, [20] [21] and Jack Purvis portrays the Chief Jawa [22] Rebel leaders include Alex McCrindle as General Dodonna and Eddie Byrne as General Willard Imperial commanders include Don Henderson as General Taggi, [b] Richard LeParmentier as General Motti, and Leslie Schofield as Commander #1 Rebel pilots are played by Drewe Henley (Red Leader, mistakenly credited as Drewe Hemley), [25] Denis Lawson (Red Two/Wedge, credited as Dennis Lawson), Garrick Hagon (Red Three/Biggs), Jack Klaff (Red Four/John \"D\"), William Hootkins (Red Six/Porkins), Angus MacInnes (Gold Leader, credited as Angus McInnis), Jeremy Sinden (Gold Two), and Graham Ashley (Gold Five) [26] Uncredited actors include Paul Blake as the bounty hunter Greedo, [27] Alfie Curtis as the outlaw who confronts Luke in the cantina, [c] [30] and Peter Geddis as the Rebel officer who is strangled by Darth Vader [d] [33] Heavily synthesized audio recordings of John Wayne (from his earlier films) were used for the voice of Garindan, an Imperial spy [34]\n\n\nProduction\nLucas had the idea for a space opera prior to 1971 [35] According to Mark Hamill, he wanted to make it before his 1973 coming-of-age film American Graffiti [36] His original plan was to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into films, having been fascinated by them since he was young [37] Lucas attempted to purchase the rights, but they had already been acquired by producer Dino De Laurentiis [38] Lucas then discovered that Flash Gordon was inspired by the John Carter of Mars book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the author of Tarzan Burroughs, in turn, had been influenced by Gulliver on Mars, a 1905 science fantasy written by Edwin Arnold Lucas took the science fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a \"space fantasy\" [37]\n\n\nDevelopment\nLucas had the idea for a space opera prior to 1971 [35] According to Mark Hamill, he wanted to

fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a \"space fantasy\" [37]\n\n\nWriting\nIt's the flotsam and jetsam from the period when I was twelve years old All the books and films and comics that I liked when I was a child The plot is simple—good against evil—and the film is designed to be all the fun things and fantasy things I remember The word for this movie is fun.\n\n\nCasting\nLucas had a preference for casting unknown (or relatively unknown) actors, [48] which led him to select Hamill and Fisher for leading roles Hamill was cast as Luke over Robby Benson, William Katt, Kurt Russell, and Charles Martin Smith, [78] [79] while Fisher was cast as Leia over Karen Allen, Amy Irving, Terri Nunn, Cindy Williams, and Linda Purl [80] [81] Jodie Foster was offered the role, but turned it down because she was under contract with Disney [82] Koo Stark was also considered for Leia, but was instead cast as Luke's friend Camie Marstrap, a character that did not make the final cut of the film [83] [84]\n\n\nDesign\nDuring pre-production, Lucas recruited several conceptual designers: Colin Cantwell, who visualized the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis, who created storyboard sketches from early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie, who created conceptual images of characters, costumes, props, and scenery [37] McQuarrie's paintings helped the studio visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project [108] [109] His artwork also set the visual tone for Star Wars and the rest of the original trilogy [37]\n\n\nFilming\nIn 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) after discovering that Fox's visual effects department had been shut down ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras The technology is now known as the Dykstraflex system [48] [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nPost-production\nStar Wars was originally slated for release on December 25, 1976, but production delays pushed it back to mid-1977 [139] Editor John Jympson began cutting the film while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an \"impossible position\" because Lucas had not explained any of the film's material to him When Lucas viewed Jympson's rough cut, he felt the editor's selection of takes was questionable [140] He felt Jympson did not fully understand the film nor Lucas's style of filmmaking, and he continued to disapprove of Jympson's editing as time went by [141] Halfway through production, Lucas fired Jympson and replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and his then-wife, Marcia Lucas The new editing team felt Jympson's cut lacked excitement, and they sought to inject more dynamism into the film [48] [142]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nLucas initially planned to use pre-existing music for Star Wars, rather than an original score Since the film portrayed alien worlds, he believed recognizable music was needed to create a sense of familiarity He hired John Williams as a music consultant, and showed him a collection of orchestral pieces he intended to use for the soundtrack [157] After Williams convinced Lucas that an original score would be preferable, Lucas tasked him with creating it A few of the composer's finished pieces were influenced by Lucas's initial orchestral selections The \"Main Title Theme\" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row (scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold), and the \"Dune Sea of Tatooine\" was influenced by the music of Bicycle Thieves (scored by Alessandro Cicognini) Lucas later denied he ever considered using pre-existing music for the film [158] [159]\n\n\nCinematic and literary allusions\nBefore creating Star Wars, Lucas had hoped to make a Flash Gordon film, but was unable to obtain the rights Star Wars features many elements ostensibly derived from Flash Gordon, such as the conflict between rebels and imperial forces; the fusion of mythology and futuristic technology; the wipe transitions between scenes; and the text crawl at the beginning of the film [165] [better source needed] Lucas also reportedly drew from Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress [38] [165] [166] Robey has also suggested that the Mos Eisley cantina brawl was influenced by Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), and that the scene in which Luke and his friends hide in the floor of the Millenium Falcon was derived from that film's sequel, Sanjuro (1962) [165]\n\n\nMarketing\nWhile the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976) Perri created a logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and leaning towards a vanishing point The graphic was designed to follow the same perspective as the opening text crawl Ultimately, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely in pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees [174] [175]\n\n\nRelease\nWhen Star Wars was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG In an unusual move, Fox requested the stricter PG rating, in part because it believed the film was too scary for young children, but also because it feared teenagers would perceive the G rating as \"uncool\" Lucasfilm marketer Charley Lippincott supported Fox's position after witnessing a five-year-old at the film's preview become upset by a scene in which Darth Vader chokes a Rebel captain Although the board initially opted for the G rating, it reneged after Fox's request and applied the PG rating [180]\n\n\nMPAA rating\nWhen Star Wars was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG In an unusual move, Fox

initially opted for the G rating, it reneged after Fox's request and applied the PG rating [180]\n\n\nFirst public screening\nOn May 1, 1977, the first public screening of Star Wars was held at Northpoint Theatre in San Francisco, [181] [182] where American Graffiti had been test-screened four years earlier [183] [184]\n\n\nPremiere and initial release\nLucas wanted the film released in May, on the Memorial Day weekend According to Fox executive Gareth Wigan, \"Nobody had ever opened a summer film before school was out.\" Lucas, however, hoped the school-term release would build word-of-mouth publicity among children [185] Fox ultimately decided on a release date of May 25, the Wednesday before the holiday weekend Very few theaters, however, wanted to show Star Wars To encourage exhibitors to purchase the film, Fox packaged it with The Other Side of Midnight, a film based on a bestselling book If a theater wanted to show Midnight, it was required to show Star Wars as well [48]\n\n\nBox office\nStar Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time It earned over $2.5 million in its first six days ($12.9 million in 2023 dollars) [196] According to Variety's weekly box office charts, it was number one at the US box office for its first three weeks It was dethroned by The Deep, but gradually added screens and returned to number one in its seventh week, building up to $7-million weekends as it entered wide release ($35.2 million in 2023 dollars) and remained number one for the next 15 weeks [3] It replaced Jaws as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release, [197] eventually grossing over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($1.11 billion in 2023 dollars) [198] Star Wars entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one, [199] earning $314.4 million in total [3] Its biggest international market was Japan, where it grossed $58.4 million [200]\n\n\nReception\nStar Wars received many positive reviews upon its release Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"an out-of-body experience\" [215] Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as \"the most elaborate .. most beautiful movie serial ever made\" [216] A. D Murphy of Variety called the film \"magnificent\" and said Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the \"biggest possible adventure fantasy\" based on the serials and action epics of his childhood [105] Writing for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler.\" [217] Star Wars was not without its detractors, however Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said \"there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism\", and no \"emotional grip\" [218] John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film, writing, \"Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality.\" [219]\n\n\nCritical response\nStar Wars received many positive reviews upon its release

[219]\n\n\nAccolades\nStar Wars won many awards after its release, including six Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, one Golden Globe Award, three Grammy Awards, one Hugo Award, and thirteen Saturn Awards Additionally, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave a Special Achievement Academy Award to Ben Burtt, and granted a Scientific and Engineering Award to John Dykstra, Alvah J Miller, and Jerry Jeffress for the development of the Dykstraflex camera system [243] [244]\n\n\nPost-release\nStar Wars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982 [273] The subtitles Episode IV and A New Hope were added for the 1981 re-release [274] [275] [j] The subtitles brought the film into line with its 1980 sequel, which was released as Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back [276] Lucas claims the subtitles were intended from the beginning, but were dropped for Star Wars to avoid confusing audiences [277] Kurtz said they considered calling the first film Episode III, IV, or V [278] Hamill claims that Lucas's motivation for starting with Episode IV was to give the audience \"a feeling that they'd missed something\" Another reason Lucas began with Episodes IV–VI, according to Hamill, was because they were the most \"commercial\" sections of the larger overarching story [279] [71] Michael Kaminski, however, points out that multiple early screenplay drafts of Star Wars carried an \"Episode One\" subtitle, and that early drafts of Empire were called \"Episode II\" [71]\n\n\nTheatrical re-releases\nStar Wars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982 [273] The subtitles Episode IV and A New Hope were added for the 1981 re-release [274] [275] [j] The subtitles brought the film into line with its 1980 sequel, which was

however, points out that multiple early screenplay drafts of Star Wars carried an \"Episode One\" subtitle, and that early drafts of Empire were called \"Episode II\" [71]\n\n\nSpecial Edition\nAfter ILM began to create CGI for Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park, Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his \"original vision\" for Star Wars [48] For the film's 20th anniversary in 1997, Star Wars was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, under the campaign title Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition This version of Star Wars runs 124 minutes.\n\n\nHome media\nIn the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan, parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8 [292] Clips were also released for the Movie Viewer toy projector by Kenner Products in cassettes featuring short scenes [293] [294]\n\n\nMerchandising\nLittle Star Wars merchandise was available for several months after the film's debut, as only Kenner Products had accepted marketing director Charles Lippincott's licensing offers Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its \"empty box\" Christmas campaign Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers contained in a \"Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package\" could be redeemed for four action figures between February and June 1978 [48] Jay West of the Los Angeles Times said that the boxes in the campaign \"became the most coveted empty box [es] in the history of retail.\" [314] In 2012, the Star Wars action figures were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame [315]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nFord, who subsequently starred in the Indiana Jones series (1981–2023), Blade Runner (1982), and Witness (1985), told the Daily Mirror that Star Wars \"boosted\" his career [321] [better source needed] The film also spawned the Star Wars Holiday Special, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978, and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it [322] The special was never aired again after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video However, many bootleg copies exist, and it has consequently become something of an underground legend [323]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nStar Wars and its subsequent film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media Hardware Wars, released in 1978, was one of the first fan films to parody Star Wars It received positive critical reaction, earned over $1 million, and is one of Lucas's favorite Star Wars spoofs [324] [325] [326] [327] Writing for The New York Times, Frank DeCaro said, \"Star Wars littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk.\" [328] He cited Quark (a short-lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre) [328] and Donny & Marie (a 1970s variety show that featured a 10-minute musical adaptation of Star Wars guest starring Daniels and Mayhew) [329] as \"television's two most infamous examples.\" [328] Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, a satirical comic science-fiction parody, was released in 1987 to mixed reviews [330] Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under \"one incredibly big restriction: no action figures.\" [331] In the 1990s and 2000s, animated comedy TV series Family Guy, [332] Robot Chicken, [333] and The Simpsons [334] produced episodes satirizing the film series A Nerdist article published in 2021 argues that \"Star Wars is the most influential film of all time\" partly on the basis that \"if all copies .. suddenly vanished, we could more or less recreate the film .. using other media,\" including parodies [335]\n\n\nCinematic influence\nIn his book The Great Movies, Roger Ebert called Star Wars \"a technical watershed\" that influenced many subsequent films It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon [111] Along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws,

It is the first film in the Star Wars franchise and tells the story of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker who joins a group of rebels to fight against the evil Empire and its dark lord, Darth Vader.\n\nPlot\nThe film takes place in a galaxy far, far away, where a group of rebels are fighting against the evil Empire, led by the dark lord Darth Vader. The story follows Luke Skywalker, a young farm boy who dreams of adventure beyond his desert planet, Tatooine. Luke's life changes when he encounters a message from Princess Leia Organa, leader of the rebellion, hidden in the droid R2-D2. Luke, along with his friends Obi-Wan Kenobi, a wise and powerful Jedi Knight, and Han Solo, a smuggler, embark on a journey to rescue Leia and destroy the Empire's powerful Death Star.\n\nAmid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans to the Death Star, a colossal space station built by the Galactic Empire that is capable of destroying entire planets. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a Rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader. Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby planet of Tatooine.\n\nCast\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, and Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Other notable actors include Phil Brown and Shelagh Fraser as Luke's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, respectively, and Jack Purvis as the Chief Jawa.\n\nRebel leaders include Alex McCrindle as General Dodonna and Eddie Byrne as General Willard.

Rebel pilots are played by Drewe Henley (Red Leader, mistakenly credited as Drewe Hemley), Denis Lawson (Red Two/Wedge, credited as Dennis Lawson), Garrick Hagon (Red Three/Biggs), Jack Klaff (Red Four/John \"D\"), William Hootkins (Red Six/Porkins), Angus MacInnes (Gold Leader, credited as Angus McInnis), Jeremy Sinden (Gold Two), and Graham Ashley (Gold Five).\n\nUncredited actors include Paul Blake as the bounty hunter Greedo, Alfie Curtis as the outlaw who confronts Luke in the cantina, and Peter Geddis as the Rebel officer who is strangled by Darth Vader.\n\nProduction\nThe idea for Star Wars was conceived by George Lucas in the early 1970s. Lucas had always been fascinated by science fiction and adventure films, and he wanted to create a film that combined the best elements of both genres. He wrote the first draft of the script in 1973, but it wasn't until 1975 that he began to develop the story and characters in earnest.\n\nLucas assembled a team of conceptual designers, including Colin Cantwell, Alex Tavoularis, and Ralph McQuarrie, to visualize the film's world and characters. McQuarrie's paintings helped to bring the film to life and influenced the studio's decision to fund the project.\n\nFilming began in March 1976, with the cast and crew shooting on location in Tunisia and Guatemala. The film's special effects were created by John Dykstra and his team at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), who developed the pioneering digital motion control photography system known as the Dykstraflex.\n\nPost-production\nThe film's editor, John Jympson, began cutting the film while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia. However, Lucas was unhappy with Jympson's selection of takes and eventually fired him and replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and Marcia Lucas.\n\nThe new editing team felt that Jympson's cut lacked excitement and sought to inject more dynamism into the film. They also added music to the film, with John Williams composing the iconic score.\n\nSoundtrack\nLucas initially planned to use pre-existing music for Star Wars, but John Williams convinced him to create an original score. Williams drew inspiration from a range of sources, including the music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Alessandro Cicognini.\n\nCinematic and literary allusions\nStar Wars was influenced by a range of literary and cinematic sources, including the Flash Gordon serials, Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, and Akira Kurosawa's film The Hidden Fortress.\n\nMarketing\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in May 1977, with a series of television commercials and print advertisements. The campaign was successful, and the film grossed over $2.5 million in its first six days.\n\nBox office\nStar Wars was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $220 million in its initial theatrical run. It became one of the highest-grossing films of all time, and it remains one of the most successful films in history.\n\nReception\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its innovative special effects, engaging storyline, and memorable characters. However, some critics were less enthusiastic, with some viewing the film as overly simplistic or lacking in depth.\n\nAccolades\nStar Wars won six Academy Awards, including Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound. It also won two BAFTA Awards, one Golden Globe Award, and three Grammy Awards.\n\nPost-release\nThe film was re-released in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982, with the addition of subtitles and a revised version of the film's ending. The film's success led to a series of sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, including The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.\n\nLegacy\nStar Wars has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless films, television shows, and other works of fiction. It has also influenced the way that special effects are created and used in filmmaking, and it remains one of the most successful and beloved films of all time.\n\nInfluence on other media\nStar Wars has influenced a wide range of other media, including film, television, literature, and video games. The film's success has led to the creation of numerous spin-offs, including animated series, novels, and comic books.\n\nStar Wars has also inspired a range of other films and television shows, including the Indiana Jones series, The Matrix, and Guardians of the Galaxy. The film's influence can also be seen in a range of other media, including music, fashion, and art.\n\nImpact on popular culture\nStar Wars has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless fans around the world. The film's iconic characters, including Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, have become cultural touchstones, and the film's memorable quotes, such as \"May the Force be with you,\" have become ingrained in popular culture.\n\nThe film's influence can also be seen in a range of other areas, including fashion, music, and art. The film's iconic costumes, such as Darth Vader's helmet and Luke Skywalker's Jedi robes, have been imitated and parodied countless times.\n\nConclusion\nStar Wars is a groundbreaking film that has had a lasting impact on popular culture. The film's innovative special effects, memorable characters, and engaging storyline have made it a beloved classic, and its influence can be seen in a wide range of other media. The film's success has led to a series of sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, and it remains one of the most successful and beloved films of all time.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

of John Wayne (from his earlier films) were used for the voice of Garindan, an Imperial spy [34]\n\n\nProduction\nLucas had the idea for a space opera prior to 1971 [35] According to Mark Hamill, he wanted to make it before his 1973 coming-of-age film American Graffiti [36] His original plan was to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into films, having been fascinated by them since he was young [37] Lucas attempted to purchase the rights, but they had already been acquired by producer Dino De Laurentiis [38] Lucas then discovered that Flash Gordon was inspired by the John Carter of Mars book series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the author of Tarzan Burroughs, in turn, had been influenced by Gulliver on Mars, a 1905 science fantasy written by Edwin Arnold Lucas took the science fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a \"space fantasy\" [37]\n\n\nDevelopment\nLucas had the idea for a space opera prior to 1971 [35] According to Mark Hamill, he

science fantasy concept and began developing what he would later call a \"space fantasy\" [37]\n\n\nWriting\nIt's the flotsam and jetsam from the period when I was twelve years old All the books and films and comics that I liked when I was a child The plot is simple—good against evil—and the film is designed to be all the fun things and fantasy things I remember The word for this movie is fun.\n\n\nCasting\nLucas had a preference for casting unknown (or relatively unknown) actors, [48] which led him to select Hamill and Fisher for leading roles Hamill was cast as Luke over Robby Benson, William Katt, Kurt Russell, and Charles Martin Smith, [78] [79] while Fisher was cast as Leia over Karen Allen, Amy Irving, Terri Nunn, Cindy Williams, and Linda Purl [80] [81] Jodie Foster was offered the role, but turned it down because she was under contract with Disney [82] Koo Stark was also considered for Leia, but was instead cast as Luke's friend Camie Marstrap, a character that did not make the final cut of the film [83] [84]\n\n\nDesign\nDuring pre-production, Lucas recruited several conceptual designers: Colin Cantwell, who visualized the initial spacecraft models; Alex Tavoularis, who created storyboard sketches from early scripts; and Ralph McQuarrie, who created conceptual images of characters, costumes, props, and scenery [37] McQuarrie's paintings helped the studio visualize the film, which positively influenced their decision to fund the project [108] [109] His artwork also set the visual tone for Star Wars and the rest of the original trilogy [37]\n\n\nFilming\nIn 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) after discovering that Fox's visual effects department had been shut down ILM began its work on Star Wars in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California Most of the visual effects used pioneering digital motion control photography developed by John Dykstra and his team, which created the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras The technology is now known as the Dykstraflex system [48] [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nPost-production\nStar Wars was originally slated for release on December 25, 1976, but production delays pushed it back to mid-1977 [139] Editor John Jympson began cutting the film while Lucas was still filming in Tunisia; as Lucas noted, the editor was in an \"impossible position\" because Lucas had not explained any of the film's material to him When Lucas viewed Jympson's rough cut, he felt the editor's selection of takes was questionable [140] He felt Jympson did not fully understand the film nor Lucas's style of filmmaking, and he continued to disapprove of Jympson's editing as time went by [141] Halfway through production, Lucas fired Jympson and replaced him with Paul Hirsch, Richard Chew, and his then-wife, Marcia Lucas The new editing team felt Jympson's cut lacked excitement, and they sought to inject more dynamism into the film [48] [142]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nLucas initially planned to use pre-existing music for Star Wars, rather than an original score Since the film portrayed alien worlds, he believed recognizable music was needed to create a sense of familiarity He hired John Williams as a music consultant, and showed him a collection of orchestral pieces he intended to use for the soundtrack [157] After Williams convinced Lucas that an original score would be preferable, Lucas tasked him with creating it A few of the composer's finished pieces were influenced by Lucas's initial orchestral selections The \"Main Title Theme\" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film Kings Row (scored by Erich Wolfgang Korngold), and the \"Dune Sea of Tatooine\" was influenced by the music of Bicycle Thieves (scored by Alessandro Cicognini) Lucas later denied he ever considered using pre-existing music for the film [158] [159]\n\n\nCinematic and literary allusions\nBefore creating Star Wars, Lucas had hoped to make a Flash Gordon film, but was unable to obtain the rights Star Wars features many elements ostensibly derived from Flash Gordon, such as the conflict between rebels and imperial forces; the fusion of mythology and futuristic technology; the wipe transitions between scenes; and the text crawl at the beginning of the film [165] [better source needed] Lucas also reportedly drew from Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces and Akira Kurosawa's 1958 film The Hidden Fortress [38] [165] [166] Robey has also suggested that the Mos Eisley cantina brawl was influenced by Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), and that the scene in which Luke and his friends hide in the floor of the Millenium Falcon was derived from that film's sequel, Sanjuro (1962) [165]\n\n\nMarketing\nWhile the film was in production, a logo was commissioned from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976) Perri created a logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and leaning towards a vanishing point The graphic was designed to follow the same perspective as the opening text crawl Ultimately, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely in pre-release print advertising and on cinema marquees [174] [175]\n\n\nRelease\nWhen Star Wars was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, the votes for the rating were evenly split between G and PG In an unusual move, Fox requested the stricter PG rating, in part because it believed the film was too scary for young children, but also because it feared teenagers would perceive the G rating as \"uncool\" Lucasfilm marketer Charley Lippincott supported Fox's position after witnessing a five-year-old at the film's preview become upset by a scene in which Darth Vader chokes a Rebel captain Although the board initially opted for the G rating, it reneged after Fox's request and applied the PG rating

Northpoint Theatre in San Francisco, [181] [182] where American Graffiti had been test-screened four years earlier [183] [184]\n\n\nPremiere and initial release\nLucas wanted the film released in May, on the Memorial Day weekend According to Fox executive Gareth Wigan, \"Nobody had ever opened a summer film before school was out.\" Lucas, however, hoped the school-term release would build word-of-mouth publicity among children [185] Fox ultimately decided on a release date of May 25, the Wednesday before the holiday weekend Very few theaters, however, wanted to show Star Wars To encourage exhibitors to purchase the film, Fox packaged it with The Other Side of Midnight, a film based on a bestselling book If a theater wanted to show Midnight, it was required to show Star Wars as well [48]\n\n\nBox office\nStar Wars remains one of the most financially successful films of all time It earned over $2.5 million in its first six days ($12.9 million in 2023 dollars) [196] According to Variety's weekly box office charts, it was number one at the US box office for its first three weeks It was dethroned by The Deep, but gradually added screens and returned to number one in its seventh week, building up to $7-million weekends as it entered wide release ($35.2 million in 2023 dollars) and remained number one for the next 15 weeks [3] It replaced Jaws as the highest-earning film in North America just six months into release, [197] eventually grossing over $220 million during its initial theatrical run ($1.11 billion in 2023 dollars) [198] Star Wars entered international release towards the end of the year, and in 1978 added the worldwide record to its domestic one, [199] earning $314.4 million in total [3] Its biggest international market was Japan, where it grossed $58.4 million [200]\n\n\nReception\nStar Wars received many positive reviews upon its release Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \"an out-of-body experience\" [215] Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as \"the most elaborate .. most beautiful movie serial ever made\" [216] A. D Murphy of Variety called the film \"magnificent\" and said Lucas had succeeded in his attempt to create the \"biggest possible adventure fantasy\" based on the serials and action epics of his childhood [105] Writing for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold gave the film a positive review, calling it \"a new classic in a rousing movie tradition: a space swashbuckler.\" [217] Star Wars was not without its detractors, however Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said \"there's no breather in the picture, no lyricism\", and no \"emotional grip\" [218] John Simon of New York magazine also panned the film, writing, \"Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its highfalutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality.\" [219]\n\n\nCritical response\nStar Wars received many positive reviews upon its release

[219]\n\n\nAccolades\nStar Wars won many awards after its release, including six Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, one Golden Globe Award, three Grammy Awards, one Hugo Award, and thirteen Saturn Awards Additionally, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave a Special Achievement Academy Award to Ben Burtt, and granted a Scientific and Engineering Award to John Dykstra, Alvah J Miller, and Jerry Jeffress for the development of the Dykstraflex camera system [243] [244]\n\n\nPost-release\nStar Wars was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1982 [273] The subtitles Episode IV and A New Hope were added for the 1981 re-release [274] [275] [j] The subtitles brought the film into line with its 1980 sequel, which was released as Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back [276] Lucas claims the subtitles were intended from the beginning, but were dropped for Star Wars to avoid confusing audiences [277] Kurtz said they considered calling the first film Episode III, IV, or V [278] Hamill claims that Lucas's motivation for starting with Episode IV was to give the audience \"a feeling that they'd missed something\" Another reason Lucas began with Episodes IV–VI, according to Hamill, was because they were the most \"commercial\" sections of the larger overarching story [279] [71] Michael Kaminski, however, points out that multiple early screenplay drafts of Star Wars carried an \"Episode One\" subtitle, and that early drafts of Empire were called \"Episode II\" [71]\n\n\nTheatrical re-releases\nStar Wars was re-released theatrically

however, points out that multiple early screenplay drafts of Star Wars carried an \"Episode One\" subtitle, and that early drafts of Empire were called \"Episode II\" [71]\n\n\nSpecial Edition\nAfter ILM began to create CGI for Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park, Lucas decided that digital technology had caught up to his \"original vision\" for Star Wars [48] For the film's 20th anniversary in 1997, Star Wars was digitally remastered with some altered scenes and re-released to theaters, along with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, under the campaign title Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition This version of Star Wars runs 124 minutes.\n\n\nHome media\nIn the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan, parts of or the whole film were released on Super 8 [292] Clips were also released for the Movie Viewer toy projector by Kenner Products in cassettes featuring short scenes [293] [294]\n\n\nMerchandising\nLittle Star Wars merchandise was available for several months after the film's debut, as only Kenner Products had accepted marketing director Charles Lippincott's licensing offers Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its \"empty box\" Christmas campaign Television commercials told children and parents that vouchers contained in a \"Star Wars Early Bird Certificate Package\" could be redeemed for four action figures between February and June 1978 [48] Jay West of the Los Angeles Times said that the boxes in the campaign \"became the most coveted empty box [es] in the history of retail.\" [314] In 2012, the Star Wars action figures were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame [315]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nFord, who subsequently starred in the Indiana Jones series (1981–2023), Blade Runner (1982), and Witness (1985), told the Daily Mirror that Star Wars \"boosted\" his career [321] [better source needed] The film also spawned the Star Wars Holiday Special, which debuted on CBS on November 17, 1978, and is often considered a failure; Lucas himself disowned it [322] The special was never aired again after its original broadcast, and it has never been officially released on home video However, many bootleg copies exist, and it has consequently become something of an underground legend [323]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nStar Wars and its subsequent film installments have been explicitly referenced and satirized across a wide range of media Hardware Wars, released in 1978, was one of the first fan films to parody Star Wars It received positive critical reaction, earned over $1 million, and is one of Lucas's favorite Star Wars spoofs [324] [325] [326] [327] Writing for The New York Times, Frank DeCaro said, \"Star Wars littered pop culture of the late 1970s with a galaxy of space junk.\" [328] He cited Quark (a short-lived 1977 sitcom that parodies the science fiction genre) [328] and Donny & Marie (a 1970s variety show that featured a 10-minute musical adaptation of Star Wars guest starring Daniels and Mayhew) [329] as \"television's two most infamous examples.\" [328] Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, a satirical comic science-fiction parody, was released in 1987 to mixed reviews [330] Lucas permitted Brooks to make a spoof of the film under \"one incredibly big restriction: no action figures.\" [331] In the 1990s and 2000s, animated comedy TV series Family Guy, [332] Robot Chicken, [333] and The Simpsons [334] produced episodes satirizing the film series A Nerdist article published in 2021 argues that \"Star Wars is the most influential film of all time\" partly on the basis that \"if all copies .. suddenly vanished, we could more or less recreate the film .. using other media,\" including parodies [335]\n\n\nCinematic influence\nIn his book The Great Movies, Roger Ebert called Star Wars \"a technical watershed\" that influenced many subsequent films It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon [111] Along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away from the more personal filmmaking of the 1970s towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences [48] [341] [342]\n\n\nSequels, prequels, and adaptations\nStar Wars was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), which conclude the original film trilogy [k] Both were financially successful and fared well with critics The original trilogy is considered one of the best film trilogies in history [l]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther
