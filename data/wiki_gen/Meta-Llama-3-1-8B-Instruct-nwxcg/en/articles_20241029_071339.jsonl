The sculpture is a symbol of the Mauryan Empire and is considered one of the most iconic and influential works of art in the history of Indian art.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is believed to have been created in the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the Mauryan Empire from 269 to 232 BCE. The sculpture is thought to have been originally installed at the top of the Ashoka Pillar, a 43-foot-tall column built at Sarnath, a city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. The pillar was built to commemorate the site of the Buddha's first sermon, and the Lion Capital was placed at the top of the column as a symbol of the Mauryan Empire's triumph.\n\nThe Lion Capital was moved to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 1878, where it remains on display today. The sculpture has undergone several restorations and reconstructions over the years, with the most recent restoration taking place in the 1980s.\n\n**Excavation and display**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka was excavated at Sarnath in 1915 by a team of archaeologists led by Sir John Marshall. The sculpture was found in several pieces, which were later reassembled and restored. The original installation of the Lion Capital at the top of the Ashoka Pillar is believed to have been accompanied by a series of other sculptures and inscriptions, which have since been lost.\n\nThe Lion Capital is now on display at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year. The sculpture is displayed in a specially designed pavilion, which is designed to replicate the original installation of the Lion Capital at the top of the Ashoka Pillar.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of a lion sitting on a wheel, with four animals surrounding the wheel. The lion is depicted as a majestic creature, with a regal bearing and a fierce expression. The wheel is decorated with intricate carvings, including floral patterns and geometric designs.\n\nThe four animals surrounding the wheel are depicted as different creatures, including a bull, an elephant, a horse, and a lion. Each animal is depicted in a unique and elaborate style, reflecting the artistic and cultural traditions of the Mauryan Empire.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a symbol of the Mauryan Empire's power and authority, as well as its cultural and artistic achievements. The sculpture is thought to represent the idea of the wheel of dharma, or the law of righteousness, which was a central concept in the Mauryan Empire's philosophy.\n\nThe lion itself is a symbol of strength and courage, and is often associated with the royal family of the Mauryan Empire. The wheel is a symbol of the cycle of life and death, and is often associated with the concept of karma.\n\n**Influences**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has had a significant influence on the development of art and architecture in India and beyond. The sculpture's unique blend of Indian and Greek influences has made it a model for subsequent artistic and architectural styles, including the Gandhara style and the Pala style.\n\nThe Lion Capital has also been an inspiration for many other works of art, including sculptures, paintings, and prints. The sculpture's iconic design and symbolism have made it a popular subject for artists and designers around the world.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a testament to the artistic and cultural achievements of the Mauryan Empire, and is considered one of the most iconic and influential works of art in the history of Indian art. The sculpture's legacy extends beyond India, and has had a significant influence on the development of art and architecture around the world.\n\nThe Lion Capital has been recognized as a symbol of India's cultural and artistic heritage, and is celebrated as a national emblem. The sculpture's significance extends beyond its artistic and cultural importance, and is seen as a symbol of India's rich and diverse cultural traditions.\n\n**Reconstructions**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka has undergone several restorations and reconstructions over the years, with the most recent restoration taking place in the 1980s. The sculpture was reassembled and restored by a team of conservators and restorers, who worked to preserve the sculpture's original design and symbolism.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Lion Capital was a complex and challenging process, which required the use of advanced technical skills and specialized equipment. The team of conservators and restorers worked to restore the sculpture to its original condition, while also taking into account the needs of modern conservation and preservation.\n\n**Related sculpture**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is part of a larger collection of sculptures and inscriptions that were discovered at the site of the Ashoka Pillar in Sarnath. The collection includes several other sculptures, including a series of lions and other animals, as well as a series of Buddhist and Hindu inscriptions.\n\nThe sculptures and inscriptions that were discovered at the site of the Ashoka Pillar are believed to have been created during the 3rd century BCE, and are thought to represent the artistic and cultural traditions of the Mauryan Empire. The collection is now on display at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, where it is seen by millions of visitors each year.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Lion Capital of Ashoka is a significant cultural and artistic achievement, and is considered one of the most iconic and influential works of art in the history of Indian art. The sculpture's legacy extends beyond India, and has had a significant influence on the development of art and architecture around the world.\n\nThe Lion Capital has been recognized as a symbol of India's cultural and artistic heritage, and is celebrated as a national emblem.

The election was the eighth since Kenya gained independence in 1963. The election was characterized by a tight presidential contest between incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, who was running as the candidate of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was held in a backdrop of significant political changes in Kenya. Uhuru Kenyatta, who had been in office since 2013, was stepping down as president, while his deputy, William Ruto, was seeking to succeed him. Ruto's bid for the presidency was seen as a challenge to Kenyatta's influence in the Jubilee Party, which had dominated Kenyan politics since 2013. The election also saw the emergence of new parties and alliances, including the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition, which was formed by Kenyatta to support his preferred candidate, Raila Odinga.\n\nThe election was also influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had significantly impacted the Kenyan economy and had led to widespread job losses and poverty. Many Kenyans were concerned about the economy and the ability of the next government to address the country's economic challenges.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nKenya uses a mixed electoral system, which combines elements of first-past-the-post and proportional representation. The president is elected by first-past-the-post, while members of the National Assembly and the Senate are elected using a proportional representation system.\n\nThe electoral system has been the subject of controversy in Kenya, with many critics arguing that it favors the ruling party and can lead to rigging and manipulation of the results. The electoral system has been reformed several times since the introduction of multiparty democracy in 1992, but critics argue that it still has significant flaws.\n\n**Presidential Candidates**\n\nThere were over 50 presidential candidates in the 2022 election, but the contest was dominated by two main candidates: Raila Odinga of the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition and William Ruto of the United Democratic Alliance (UDA).\n\nRaila Odinga was a veteran politician who had been a leading figure in Kenyan politics since the 1990s. He had run for president twice before, in 2007 and 2017, and had been a key ally of Uhuru Kenyatta since 2013. Odinga's campaign focused on economic development, job creation, and corruption.\n\nWilliam Ruto, on the other hand, was a younger politician who had risen to prominence in the Jubilee Party in the early 2010s. He had been Kenyatta's deputy since 2013 and had become a key figure in the party. Ruto's campaign focused on economic empowerment, entrepreneurship, and corruption.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign season was marked by intense competition between the two main candidates, with both sides engaging in a series of debates, rallies, and other campaign activities.\n\n### Presidential Nomination\n\nThe presidential nomination process was held in May 2022 and saw both Odinga and Ruto emerge as the front-runners. Odinga won the nomination on the first round, while Ruto won on the second round after failing to secure the required 50% of the votes.\n\n### Deputy Presidential Nomination\n\nThe deputy presidential nomination process was held in June 2022 and saw Odinga nominate Martha Karua as his running mate. Ruto, on the other hand, nominated Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate.\n\n### Manifestos\n\nBoth Odinga and Ruto released their manifestos in June 2022, outlining their vision for Kenya's future. Odinga's manifesto focused on economic development, job creation, and corruption, while Ruto's manifesto focused on economic empowerment, entrepreneurship, and corruption.\n\n### Electoral Candidates Debates\n\nThe electoral candidates debates were held in July 2022 and saw both Odinga and Ruto participate. The debates were marked by intense competition and controversy, with both sides engaging in personal attacks and exchanges.\n\n### Campaign Season\n\nThe campaign season was marked by intense competition between the two main candidates, with both sides engaging in a series of debates, rallies, and other campaign activities. The campaign season was also marked by controversy, with both sides accusing each other of rigging and manipulation of the results.\n\n**Conduct**\n\nThe conduct of the election was overseen by the Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission (IEBC), which had been reformed in 2017 to improve the electoral process.\n\n### Mass Voter Listing\n\nThe mass voter listing process was held in June 2022 and saw over 22 million Kenyans register to vote. The process was marked by controversy, with some voters complaining of irregularities and delays.\n\n### Electoral Candidates Clearance\n\nThe electoral candidates clearance process was held in July 2022 and saw over 50 presidential candidates cleared to contest the election. The process was marked by controversy, with some candidates complaining of unfair treatment.\n\n### IEBC Preparation for General Election\n\nThe IEBC prepared for the general election by conducting a series of tests and rehearsals. The commission also increased the number of polling stations from 38,000 to 46,000 to improve access to voting.\n\n### General Elections\n\nThe general elections were held on August 9, 2022, and saw over 22 million Kenyans cast their votes. The election was marked by controversy, with both sides accusing each other of rigging and manipulation of the results.\n\n### Interference\n\nThere were reports of interference in the election, with some observers complaining of irregularities and delays. The IEBC also reported several cases of hacking and cyber-attacks on its systems.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nOpinion polls were conducted throughout the campaign season, with several polls predicting a close contest between Odinga and Ruto. The polls were marked by controversy, with some critics accusing the pollsters of bias and manipulation.\n\n### Graphical Summary of Opinion Polls\n\nThe following graphical summary of opinion polls shows the trend in public opinion throughout the campaign season.\n\n**Results and Reactions**\n\nThe results of the election were announced on August 15, 2022, and saw William Ruto declared the winner.

The cruiser, part of the Black Sea Fleet, sank after a Ukrainian missile strike hit the ship. The sinking of the Moskva marked one of the most significant naval losses for Russia since the Soviet era.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Moskva was a Slava-class cruiser commissioned in 1983 and had undergone several modernization programs over the years. The ship was known for its advanced air defense systems and was considered one of the most capable warships in the Black Sea Fleet. The Moskva had been involved in various international naval exercises and had a crew of around 510 personnel.\n\n**Sinking**\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva occurred in the early hours of April 14, 2022, while the ship was on a mission to support Russian naval operations in the Black Sea. Ukrainian forces claimed that they had launched a missile strike against the Moskva, which resulted in significant damage to the ship.\n\n### **Ukrainian account**\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian military, the Moskva had been struck by a Neptune anti-ship missile fired from the Odessa region. The missile, designed to evade air defenses, allegedly penetrated the ship's defenses and caused significant damage. Ukrainian officials reported that the ship had been damaged beyond repair and was listing heavily, eventually sinking.\n\n### **Russian account**\n\nThe Russian military initially reported that the Moskva had suffered a \"fire\" on board, which had caused significant damage to the ship. Russian officials claimed that the ship had been struck by a Ukrainian missile, but the extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Later, Russian sources acknowledged that the ship had sunk, but blamed a \"magnetic storm\" for the explosion.\n\n### **Other early observations**\n\nEyewitness accounts from the Ukrainian coast reported seeing a massive explosion on the Moskva, followed by a series of secondary explosions. The ship was seen listing heavily, with debris and smoke billowing from the damaged areas. The incident was widely reported by international media, with many outlets speculating about the cause of the sinking.\n\n### **Missile strike**\n\nThe Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missile is a surface-to-surface missile designed to evade air defenses. The missile uses a combination of terrain-following radar and infrared guidance to target ships, making it a challenging opponent for modern air defense systems. The exact details of the missile strike, including the type of missile used and the timing of the launch, have not been publicly confirmed.\n\n### **Images and video of the sinking ship**\n\nVideos and images of the Moskva's sinking were widely shared on social media, showing the ship listing heavily and on fire.

He was a key figure in the Democratic Party and a leading advocate for the rights of the common man.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAndrew Jackson was a complex figure who played a significant role in shaping the United States during the early 19th century. He was a skilled military leader who fought in several wars, including the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. He also had a successful law career and served as a congressman and senator before becoming president. Jackson's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the Indian Removal Act and the Nullification Crisis. He was also known for his strong personality and his willingness to take bold action.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region of South Carolina, which is now part of both North and South Carolina. His parents, Andrew Jackson Sr. and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, were of Scottish and English descent. Jackson's father was a Scottish-Irish immigrant who served as a justice of the peace and a surveyor. Jackson's mother was a wealthy plantation owner who died when Andrew was just 14 years old. Jackson had six siblings, including two brothers, Hugh and Robert, who also served in the military.\n\nJackson received his early education at a local school and later attended the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied law. However, he did not graduate, as he was forced to leave college due to financial difficulties.\n\n**Revolutionary War**\n\nAndrew Jackson's first experience in combat was during the Revolutionary War, where he served as a courier and a soldier in the South Carolina militia. In 1780, he was captured by British forces and held prisoner for several months before escaping. This experience had a profound impact on Jackson's life and shaped his views on politics and war.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n**Legal Career and Marriage**\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Jackson returned to South Carolina and began studying law under the tutelage of a local attorney. He was admitted to the bar in 1787 and quickly established a successful law practice. In 1788, Jackson married Rachel Donelson Robards, a widow with a young daughter, Emily. The couple had no children of their own.\n\n**Early Public Career**\n\nJackson's early public career began in 1791, when he was elected as a representative to the Tennessee state legislature. He served in this position for several years, during which time he advocated for the rights of the common man and opposed the wealthy elite.\n\n**Planting Career and Slavery**\n\nIn 1791, Jackson began to build a plantation in Tennessee, which he called the Hermitage. He spent much of his life managing this plantation, which became one of the most successful in the state. Jackson was a slaveowner and owned over 150 slaves at the peak of his plantation's success.\n\n**Duel with Dickinson and Adventure with Burr**\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a famous duel with Charles Dickinson, who had insulted Jackson's wife. Jackson killed Dickinson in the duel, which was widely publicized in the press. In 1806, Jackson also accompanied Aaron Burr on a ill-fated expedition to the West, during which they became embroiled in a conflict with the Spanish.\n\n**Military Career**\n\n**War of 1812**\n\nAndrew Jackson played a key role in the War of 1812, which was fought between the United States and the British Empire. In 1813, Jackson led a successful campaign against the Creek Indians in what is now Alabama and Georgia. He later led a force of militiamen against the British at the Battle of New Orleans, where they achieved a decisive victory.\n\n### Creek War\n\nJackson's campaign against the Creek Indians was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Tallapoosa, where he defeated a large force of Creek warriors. He later led a campaign against the Red Sticks, a faction of Creek Indians who were allied with the British.\n\n### Battle of New Orleans\n\nJackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans was one of the most significant battles of the War of 1812. He led a force of militiamen and regular army soldiers against a large force of British troops, who were attempting to capture the city. Jackson's forces were vastly outnumbered, but they were able to defeat the British in a series of fierce battles.\n\n**First Seminole War**\n\nIn 1814, Jackson led a campaign against the Seminole Indians in what is now Florida. He defeated the Seminoles in several battles, including the Battle of Tampa Bay, where he captured a large force of Seminole warriors.\n\n**Presidential Aspirations**\n\n**Election of 1824**\n\nAndrew Jackson's presidential ambitions began in 1824, when he ran for president against John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and William Crawford. Jackson won the popular vote, but lost the election in the House of Representatives, where the election was decided by a single vote.\n\n**Election of 1828 and Death of Rachel Jackson**\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for president again, this time against John Quincy Adams. Jackson won the election in a landslide, but his wife, Rachel, died shortly after the election. This event had a profound impact on Jackson, who was deeply grieved by his wife's death.\n\n**Presidency (1829–1837)**\n\n**Inauguration**\n\nAndrew Jackson was inaugurated as president on March 4, 1829. His inauguration was marked by several key events, including the famous inaugural ball, which was attended by thousands of people.\n\n**Reforms and Rotation in Office**\n\nJackson was a strong advocate for reform and rotation in office. He believed that the power of government should be in the hands of the people, rather than the wealthy elite. He also believed that government officials should serve limited terms to prevent corruption.\n\n**Petticoat Affair**\n\nOne of the most significant scandals of Jackson's presidency was the Petticoat Affair, which involved a socialite named Margaret \"Peggy\" Eaton. Jackson's wife, Rachel, had been friends with Eaton, but after Rachel's death, Jackson became embroiled in a controversy over Eaton's character.\n\n**Indian Removal Act**\n\nIn 1830, Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, which allowed the government to negotiate treaties with Native American tribes to remove them from their ancestral lands. The act was widely opposed by many Americans, who saw it as a form of ethnic cleansing.\n\n**Nullification Crisis**\n\nIn 1832, South Carolina nullified a federal tariff, which led to a crisis between the state and the federal government. Jackson supported the federal government's right to enforce the tariff, but he also believed in the principle of states' rights.\n\n**Bank War and Election of 1832**\n\nJackson's presidency was also marked by a controversy over the Second Bank of the United States. He vetoed a bill to re-charter the bank and instead supported the creation of a new national bank. In 1832, he ran for re-election against Henry Clay, but lost the popular vote.\n\n### Bank Veto\n\nJackson's veto of the bank re-charter bill was a major controversy of his presidency. He believed that the bank was unconstitutional and that it concentrated too much power in the hands of a few wealthy individuals.\n\n### Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election against Henry Clay, but lost the popular vote. However, he won the election in the Electoral College, thanks to the support of his vice president, Martin Van Buren.\n\n### Removal of Deposits and Censure\n\nIn 1833, Jackson removed federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and placed them in state banks. This move was widely opposed by many Americans, who saw it as a form of economic warfare.\n\n### Panic of 1837\n\nThe Panic of 1837, which occurred in 1837, was a major economic downturn that was caused in part by Jackson's policies. The panic was marked by widespread bank failures, business closures, and unemployment.\n\n**Physical Assault and Assassination Attempt**\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of a physical assault by a group of men who were upset by his policies.

It is a distinctive and iconic headgear that has played a significant role in Uzbek culture and history.\n\n**#Etymology**\n\nThe origins of the Malahai hat date back to the 14th century, during the reign of the Timurid Empire. The name \"Malahai\" is derived from the Turkic language, with \"mal\" meaning \"hat\" or \"headgear,\" and \"hai\" meaning \"Uzbek\" or \"Turk.\" Over time, the name has been adopted into various languages, including Russian and Uzbek.\n\n**#Design and materials**\n\nThe Malahai hat is characterized by its distinctive conical shape, which is made from a single piece of felted wool. The hat is typically made from the wool of sheep raised in the Fergana Valley, which is renowned for its high-quality wool. The wool is first washed and then carded to create a thick, soft pile. The pile is then shaped and molded into a conical form, which is then secured with a leather or fabric band.\n\nThe Malahai hat is often decorated with intricate embroidery or appliqué, which features traditional Uzbek motifs such as flowers, leaves, and geometric patterns. The embroidery is typically done by hand, using a combination of cotton and silk threads.\n\n**#In Russia**\n\nThe Malahai hat gained popularity in Russia during the 19th century, when it became a fashionable accessory among the nobility. The hat was prized for its warmth and practicality, as well as its exotic and distinctive design. Many Russian nobles and aristocrats adopted the Malahai as a symbol of their cultural and intellectual sophistication.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Malahai hat became a popular fashion accessory among the Russian avant-garde movement. Artists and intellectuals such as Kandinsky and Malevich often wore the Malahai as a statement of their cultural and artistic identity.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Uzbek culture\n* Timurid Empire\n* Fergana Valley\n* Russian avant-garde movement\n* Kandinsky\n* Malevich\n\n**#Explanatory notes**\n\nThe Malahai hat is a unique and fascinating piece of cultural heritage that reflects the rich history and traditions of Uzbekistan and Russia.

It has been a significant aspect of human history, shaping cultures, societies, and empires. This article will explore the various phases and aspects of Christianization, from the early Christian missions to the modern era of global Christianization.\n\n**Missions**\n\nEarly Christian missionaries were instrumental in spreading Christianity throughout the ancient world. Their efforts were driven by a desire to convert others to the faith and to establish a global Christian community. The apostles, in particular, played a crucial role in spreading Christianity, with Saint Paul being one of the most influential missionaries.\n\n**Individual conversion**\n\nIndividual conversion to Christianity typically involved a series of rituals and sacraments, which were designed to mark the individual's transition from a non-Christian to a Christian. These rituals and sacraments varied across different Christian traditions, but they often included baptism, eucharist, and confirmation.\n\n### Baptism\n\nBaptism was the most common ritual associated with individual conversion. It involved the immersion or sprinkling of water on the individual, symbolizing their death to their old life and their rebirth as a Christian. Baptism was often performed in a public setting, such as a church or a river, and was accompanied by prayers and hymns.\n\n### Eucharist\n\nThe Eucharist, also known as the Lord's Supper, was another important sacrament associated with individual conversion. It involved the consumption of bread and wine, which were seen as symbols of Christ's body and blood. The Eucharist was often celebrated in a church setting, and was typically accompanied by prayers and hymns.\n\n### Confirmation\n\nConfirmation was a sacrament that involved the laying on of hands by a bishop or other senior clergy member. It was designed to confirm the individual's decision to become a Christian, and to impart spiritual gifts and blessings. Confirmation was often performed in a church setting, and was typically accompanied by prayers and hymns.\n\n**Places and practices**\n\nChristianization was not limited to individual conversions, but also involved the conversion of entire communities and societies. This was often achieved through the establishment of churches, monasteries, and other Christian institutions. The conversion of sacred sites, such as temples and iconoclastic images, was also an important aspect of Christianization.\n\n### Temple conversion within Roman Empire\n\nIn the Roman Empire, Christianization involved the conversion of temples and other pagan sites into churches and other Christian institutions. This process was often accompanied by the destruction of pagan images and artifacts. The conversion of the Pantheon in Rome, for example, was a significant event in the Christianization of the Roman Empire.\n\n### Temple and icon destruction\n\nThe destruction of temples and icons was a common feature of Christianization in many parts of the world. This was often motivated by a desire to eliminate pagan influences and to establish a Christian monopoly on sacred space. The destruction of the Buddha statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, for example, was a significant event in the Christianization of that region.\n\n### Other sacred sites\n\nChristianization also involved the conversion of other sacred sites, such as mountains, forests, and rivers. These sites were often seen as having spiritual significance, and were often associated with pagan deities or spirits. The conversion of these sites involved the establishment of Christian shrines and other institutions, and the suppression of pagan practices and rituals.\n\n**Nations**\n\nChristianization has been a significant aspect of the history of many nations, shaping their cultures, societies, and empires.\n\n### Roman Empire to Early Middle Ages (1 to 800)\n\nIn the Roman Empire, Christianization was a gradual process that was driven by the efforts of early Christian missionaries.

The conversion of the Albanians, for example, was a peaceful process that was driven by the efforts of Christian missionaries.\n\n### Constantine and the goal of Christianization\n\nThe conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine in 313 CE was a significant turning point in the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Constantine's goal was to establish a Christian empire, and to spread Christianity throughout the world.\n\n### Albanians\n\nThe Albanians were one of the first peoples to be converted to Christianity in the early Middle Ages.

Its conversion to Christianity was a significant event in the Christianization of Europe.\n\n### Christianization with coercion under Justinian I\n\nJustinian I, the Byzantine Emperor, was a devout Christian who sought to spread Christianity throughout the world. His efforts were often driven by coercion, and involved the destruction of pagan temples and the conversion of non-Christians.\n\n### Ireland\n\nIreland was one of the earliest countries to be converted to Christianity. The conversion of the Irish was a peaceful process that was driven by the efforts of Christian missionaries, such as Saint Patrick.\n\n### Great Britain\n\nGreat Britain was also converted to Christianity in the early Middle Ages.

The Western Bulldogs appointed David Teague as their new coach, replacing Luke Beveridge. The Brisbane Lions appointed Chris Fagan as their new coach, replacing Dean Russell. The Adelaide Crows appointed Matthew Nicks as their new coach, replacing Matthew Primus.\n\n**Club Leadership**\n\nSeveral teams made changes to their leadership groups ahead of the 2023 season.

These laws aim to protect individuals from harm, promote public safety, and uphold the principles of justice and human rights.\n\n**Common Features**\n\nSexual offences in Northern Ireland share common features with those in other jurisdictions. These include:\n\n*   The requirement for consent, which is a fundamental principle in determining whether a sexual act is lawful or unlawful\n*   The need to establish the age of consent, which is the minimum age at which an individual is considered capable of giving informed consent to sexual activity\n*   The recognition of certain groups, such as children and mentally disordered persons, as being vulnerable to exploitation and harm\n\n**Rape**\n\nRape is a serious sexual offence in Northern Ireland, involving non-consensual penetration, whether vaginal, anal, or oral. The law recognizes two forms of rape:\n\n*   **Rape of a female**: This involves non-consensual penetration of a female, whether by a male or female.\n*   **Rape of a male**: This involves non-consensual penetration of a male, whether by a male or female.\n\n**Assault**\n\nAssault is a broad term that encompasses a range of non-consensual sexual acts, including:\n\n*   **Gross indecency**: This involves engaging in a sexual act in a public place or in the presence of others.\n*   **Indecent assault**: This involves touching an individual in a sexual manner without their consent.\n\n**Sexual Activity Without Consent**\n\nSexual activity without consent is a serious offence in Northern Ireland, encompassing a range of acts, including:\n\n*   **Sexual touching**: This involves touching an individual in a sexual manner without their consent.\n*   **Sexual activity**: This involves engaging in any form of sexual activity, such as kissing, touching, or penetration, without consent.\n\n**Offences Against Children**\n\nThe law in Northern Ireland recognizes that children are vulnerable to exploitation and harm, and therefore, provides additional protections for this group.\n\n### Offences Against Children Under 13\n\nOffences against children under 13 are considered particularly serious, as these individuals are deemed incapable of giving informed consent. These offences include:\n\n*   **Rape of a child under 13**: This involves non-consensual penetration of a child under 13.\n*   **Assault of a child under 13**: This involves engaging in a sexual act with a child under 13.\n\n### Offences Against Children Under 16\n\nOffences against children under 16 are also taken seriously, as these individuals may not have fully developed the capacity to give informed consent.

The outbreak began in May 2022 and has since spread to over 100 countries, with a total of over 86,000 confirmed cases reported as of March 2023.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Emergency Preparedness Prior to Outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) had established emergency preparedness plans for the mpox virus, including surveillance and response protocols. However, the rapid spread of the virus in 2022 caught many countries off guard, highlighting the need for better preparedness and coordination between national and international health authorities.\n\n### Endemic Mpox in Africa\n\nMpox is endemic in several African countries, where it is typically found in rodents and other small mammals. The virus is usually transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. In Africa, mpox is often associated with traditional practices such as hunting and preparing bushmeat, which can increase the risk of transmission.\n\n**Outbreak Characteristics**\n\n### Phylogenetics\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak is caused by a distinct genetic lineage of the virus, which is different from the lineages found in Africa. This suggests that the outbreak may have originated from an external source, rather than being a re-emergence of a previously established strain.\n\n### Long Incubation Periods\n\nThe incubation period of mpox is typically between 5 and 21 days, with a median value of around 10-14 days. This means that individuals may not exhibit symptoms for several days after exposure, making it challenging to track and contain the spread of the virus.\n\n### Mild Clinical Manifestations\n\nIn the 2022–2023 outbreak, many cases have reported mild clinical manifestations, such as rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). However, in some cases, the virus has caused more severe symptoms, including respiratory distress and sepsis.\n\n### Fear of Zoonotic Spread\n\nThe mpox virus has been detected in various animal species, including rodents, primates, and carnivores. This has raised concerns about the potential for zoonotic transmission, where the virus is transmitted from animals to humans. However, the risk of zoonotic transmission is considered low, and most cases are believed to be linked to human-to-human transmission.\n\n**Chronology**\n\n### Deaths Outside of Africa\n\nAs of March 2023, there have been several deaths reported outside of Africa, including in the United States, Europe, and other regions. These deaths are thought to be linked to the 2022–2023 outbreak, although the exact number of deaths is difficult to determine due to the complexities of reporting and confirmation.\n\n**Transmission**\n\n### Transmission Patterns\n\nMpox is primarily transmitted through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, often during intimate activities. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated bodily fluids, such as saliva or semen. In addition, the virus can be present in respiratory droplets, although this is considered a less common mode of transmission.\n\n### Wastewater Surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to detect the presence of mpox virus in sewage systems. This can provide valuable information on the spread of the virus in a community, as well as help identify areas where testing and containment efforts may be needed.\n\n**Interventions**\n\n### Testing and Containment\n\nTesting and containment efforts have been implemented in affected countries to slow the spread of the virus. This includes contact tracing, isolation of infected individuals, and quarantine of close contacts. Laboratory testing has also been used to confirm cases and identify the presence of the virus in various settings.\n\n### Vaccination\n\nSeveral vaccines have been developed to protect against mpox, including the Jynneos vaccine, which has been used in the 2022–2023 outbreak. Vaccination efforts have been implemented in some countries, although challenges have been reported in terms of access and equity.\n\n**Social Aspects**\n\n### Misinformation\n\nThe 2022–2023 mpox outbreak has been associated with significant misinformation and stigma, particularly around the virus's mode of transmission and the groups affected. This has led to concerns about the impact on vulnerable populations and the need for accurate and culturally sensitive messaging.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a critical role in responding to the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak, including providing guidance on testing, treatment, and prevention. The organization has also worked closely with national and international health authorities to coordinate response efforts.\n\n### Countries\n\nCountries have implemented a range of measures to respond to the outbreak, including testing, contact tracing, and vaccination efforts. Some countries have also implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n### Dependent Territories\n\nDependent territories, such as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, have also been affected by the outbreak. These territories have implemented response efforts, including testing and vaccination programs, to protect their populations.\n\n**Cases per Country and Territory**\n\nThe following table provides an overview of confirmed cases by country and territory:\n\n| Country/Territory | Cases | Date of First Confirmed Case |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Argentina | 1,261 | May 15, 2022 |\n| Australia | 2,342 |

Born on April 30, 1777, in Braunschweig, Germany, Gauss is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and science.\n\n## Youth and Education\n\nGauss's early life was marked by exceptional mathematical abilities. He was born to a humble family and was the only son of a gardener. Gauss's mother, Dorothea Benze, recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue his interest in mathematics. At the age of three, Gauss could perform arithmetic calculations with ease, and by the age of seven, he was attending school, where he excelled in mathematics and science.\n\nIn 1788, Gauss entered the Johnneum, a prestigious school in Braunschweig, where he continued to demonstrate his exceptional mathematical abilities. In 1792, he moved to the Collegium Carolinum, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy. During this period, Gauss developed a deep interest in mathematics, particularly number theory, and began to work on his own mathematical projects.\n\n## Private Scholar\n\nIn 1795, Gauss graduated from the Collegium Carolinum and began to work as a private scholar. He continued to develop his mathematical skills and began to publish his work. In 1799, Gauss published his first major work, \"Arithmetische Untersuchungen\" (Arithmetical Investigations), which dealt with the theory of numbers. This work demonstrated Gauss's exceptional mathematical abilities and established him as a leading figure in the field of number theory.\n\n## Professor in Göttingen\n\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed as a professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his death. At Göttingen, Gauss established himself as a leading figure in the academic community, and his lectures on mathematics and physics attracted students from across Europe. During this period, Gauss published several important works, including his famous \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (Arithmetical Investigations), which dealt with the theory of numbers and became a fundamental text in the field.\n\n## Gauss's Brain\n\nAfter Gauss's death, his brain was preserved and studied by the German anatomist Rudolf Wagner. The study of Gauss's brain revealed that it was larger than average and had a higher concentration of neurons than normal. This has led to speculation about the relationship between brain structure and mathematical ability, although it is still unclear whether this is a causal factor.\n\n## Family\n\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff in 1805, and the couple had three children together. However, Johanna died in 1809, and Gauss was devastated by her death. He married Minna Waldeck in 1810, and the couple had three children together.\n\n## Personality\n\n### Scholar\n\nGauss was a dedicated scholar who spent most of his life studying and working on mathematical problems. He was known for his exceptional memory and his ability to perform complex calculations in his head. Gauss was also a prolific writer and published over 150 papers on mathematics and physics during his lifetime.\n\n### Private Man\n\nDespite his exceptional abilities, Gauss was a private man who preferred to keep a low profile. He was known to be shy and introverted, and he avoided public gatherings and social events. However, Gauss was a devoted family man and was deeply attached to his wife and children.\n\n## Scientific Work\n\nGauss's scientific work can be divided into several areas, including algebra and number theory, analysis, astronomy, theory of errors, and differential geometry.\n\n### Algebra and Number Theory\n\nGauss made significant contributions to the field of algebra and number theory, particularly in the areas of the fundamental theorem of algebra and the theory of numbers. His work on the fundamental theorem of algebra established it as a fundamental principle of algebra, and his work on the theory of numbers led to the development of modern number theory.\n\n### Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nGauss's most famous work, \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", was published in 1801 and dealt with the theory of numbers. This work established Gauss as a leading figure in the field of number theory and became a fundamental text in the field.\n\n### Further Investigations\n\nGauss continued to work on the theory of numbers and published several papers on the subject. His work on the theory of numbers led to the development of modern number theory, and his results on the subject remain influential to this day.\n\n## Analysis\n\nGauss made significant contributions to the field of analysis, particularly in the areas of numeric analysis and differential equations. His work on numeric analysis led to the development of modern numeric analysis, and his work on differential equations established the subject as a fundamental area of analysis.\n\n## Chronology\n\nGauss's work spanned over four decades, and his contributions to mathematics and science are still widely studied and respected today.

It is contested by 18 teams, with the most successful club being Persebaya Surabaya, who have won the league a record 14 times. The league is organized by PT Liga Indonesia Baru, a private company that has been managing the league since 2017.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe first professional football league in Indonesia was established in 1930, during the Dutch colonial era. The league was known as the Voetbal Bond Eiland Java (VB Eiland Java) and was contested by teams from the islands of Java and Sumatra. However, the league was short-lived and was eventually abandoned due to the outbreak of World War II.\n\n### Foundation\n\nAfter Indonesia gained independence in 1945, the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) was established, and the first national league was formed in 1950. The league was known as the Liga Perserikatan and was contested by teams from all over Indonesia. However, the league was plagued by corruption and financial issues, and was eventually replaced by the Liga Indonesia in 1994.\n\n### Dualism\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Liga Indonesia faced a major crisis due to the emergence of a rival league, the Indonesian Super League (ISL). The ISL was established by a group of wealthy businessmen who were dissatisfied with the governance of the Liga Indonesia. The dualism between the two leagues led to a decline in the quality of football in Indonesia, and the PSSI was eventually forced to intervene to resolve the crisis.\n\n### Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn 2015, the PSSI was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the affairs of the association. The Indonesian government had appointed a new president for the PSSI, which was seen as a violation of the association's autonomy. The suspension was lifted in 2016, but the PSSI was still facing financial issues and a decline in the quality of football in the country.\n\n### Name change\n\nIn 2017, the PSSI announced a name change for the top-tier league, which was renamed the Liga 1. The name change was seen as a way to rebrand the league and attract more sponsors and fans.\n\n**Competition format**\n\n### Competition\n\nThe Liga 1 is contested by 18 teams, with each team playing the others in a double round-robin format. The team with the most points at the end of the season is crowned the champion. If two or more teams are tied on points, the team with the better goal difference is declared the winner.\n\n### Promotion and relegation\n\nThe bottom three teams in the Liga 1 are relegated to the Liga 2, while the top three teams in the Liga 2 are promoted to the Liga 1.\n\n### Video assistant referee\n\nIn 2019, the Liga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology to help with refereeing decisions. The VAR system has been well-received by fans and players, and has helped to improve the quality of refereeing in the league.\n\n**Clubs**\n\n### Champions\n\nPersebaya Surabaya has won the Liga 1 a record 14 times, followed by Persija Jakarta with 9 titles.\n\n### Performance by clubs\n\nHere is a list of the top 5 clubs in the Liga 1 by number of titles won:\n\n1.

The film also delves into Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationships with his wife and his friends.\n\n### Casting\n\nCasting for the film took place over several years, with Cillian Murphy eventually being cast as Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt was cast as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, and Matt Damon was cast as Leslie Groves, the military officer who oversaw the Manhattan Project.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for the film took place over several months in 2022, with a cast of over 1,000 extras. The film was shot on location in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iceland. The production team used a combination of practical and CGI effects to recreate the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film took several months, with the editing team working closely with Nolan to assemble the final cut. The film was scored by Ludwig Göransson, who also composed the music for Nolan's previous film, Tenet.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film features a score by Ludwig Göransson, which incorporates a combination of classical and contemporary music. The score includes a number of themes and motifs that reflect Oppenheimer's personal and professional life. The film also features a number of period-specific songs and recordings, including music from the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nMarketing for the film began several months before its release, with a series of promotional trailers and interviews with the cast and crew.

This means that the game's source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the game as they see fit. Open-source video games have been around since the early days of the video game industry, but they have gained popularity in recent years due to advancements in technology and changes in consumer attitudes towards software ownership.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nAn open-source video game is different from a traditional commercial video game in several key ways. Firstly, open-source games are not owned by a single company or individual, but are instead maintained and developed by a community of contributors. This means that the game's source code is freely available, and anyone can contribute to its development. Additionally, open-source games are often released under permissive licenses, which allow users to freely modify and distribute the game as they see fit.\n\nIn contrast, commercial video games are typically owned and controlled by a single company, and are subject to copyright and licensing laws that restrict their use and distribution. While some commercial games may offer modding tools or community-created content, the underlying game code remains proprietary and is not made available to the public.\n\nOpen-source video games can be classified into several different categories, including:\n\n* **Free and open-source games**: These games are released under permissive licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), and are free to download and play.\n* **Open-source games with proprietary elements**: These games may be released under a proprietary license, but still allow users to view and modify the source code.\n* **Community-driven games**: These games are developed and maintained by a community of contributors, and may be released under a variety of licenses.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source video games has its roots in the early days of the video game industry. In the 1970s and 1980s, computer games were often created by small teams of developers who shared their code and ideas with one another. This collaborative approach to game development helped to foster a sense of community and cooperation among game developers, and laid the groundwork for the open-source movement that would emerge in later years.\n\nIn the 1990s, the open-source movement gained momentum with the release of software such as Linux and Apache. These projects demonstrated the viability of open-source development and the potential for collaborative software creation. As the internet became more widely available, the idea of open-source video games began to take hold, with projects such as Doom and Quake being released under open-source licenses.\n\n**History**\n\n#### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video games were released in the early days of the industry, when games were often created by small teams of developers who shared their code and ideas with one another. One of the earliest examples of an open-source game is the 1976 game \"Spacewar!\", which was developed by a group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The game's source code was released under a permissive license, allowing other developers to view and modify the code.\n\nIn the 1980s, the open-source movement gained momentum with the release of games such as \"Doom\" and \"Quake\". These games were developed by id Software, a company that was founded by John Carmack and John Romero. The source code for these games was released under open-source licenses, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\n#### 3D games and source releases\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of 3D games, which were capable of rendering complex graphics and environments. This led to a new wave of open-source games, including projects such as \"Breed\" and \"Neverball\". These games were developed using open-source tools and released under permissive licenses, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source movement gained momentum with the release of games such as \"OpenArena\" and \"Warzone 2100\". These games were developed by teams of contributors and released under open-source licenses, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\n#### Rise in popularity and diversity\n\nThe early 2000s saw a significant increase in the popularity of open-source games, with the release of games such as \"OpenTibia\" and \"Battle for Wesnoth\". These games were developed by large communities of contributors and released under open-source licenses, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\nThe rise of the internet and social media platforms has made it easier for developers to collaborate and share their work with one another. This has led to a proliferation of open-source games, with new projects emerging every year.\n\n#### Greater organization\n\nIn recent years, the open-source movement has become more organized, with the emergence of formal organizations and communities. For example, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit organization that promotes and supports open-source software development. The OSI has a formal certification process for open-source licenses, which helps to ensure that software is released under permissive and compatible licenses.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation (FSF) is another non-profit organization that promotes and supports free and open-source software development. The FSF has a strong focus on protecting user freedom and promoting the use of free and open-source software.\n\n#### Hubs and development teams\n\nOpen-source games are often developed by large communities of contributors, who work together to create and maintain the game. These communities are often organized around specific hubs or platforms, such as GitHub or SourceForge.\n\nFor example, the OpenArena game is developed by a community of contributors who work together on GitHub. The game's source code is released under an open-source license, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\nSimilarly, the Battle for Wesnoth game is developed by a community of contributors who work together on SourceForge. The game's source code is released under an open-source license, allowing users to view and modify the code.\n\n**See also**\n\n* **Open-source software**\n* **Free and open-source games**\n* **Game development**\n* **Linux**\n* **Apache**\n* **GitHub**\n* **SourceForge**\n\n**References**\n\nN/A\n\n**External links**\n\n* **Open Source Initiative**: [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)\n* **Free Software Foundation**: [www.fsf.org](http://www.fsf.org)\n* **GitHub**: [www.github.com](http://www.github.com)\n* **SourceForge**: [www.sourceforge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net)\n* **OpenArena**: [www.openarena.org](http://www.openarena.org)\n* **Battle for Wesnoth**: [www.wesnoth.org](http://www.wesnoth.org)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the 19th Italian general election since the end of World War II and the second since the country adopted a proportional representation system.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe outgoing government was a centre-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy, which had taken office in October 2022 following the previous election. The government's main policies included tax cuts, pension reform, and a hardline stance on immigration. However, the government faced several challenges, including a stagnant economy, high inflation, and a growing public debt.\n\nThe election was also marked by a significant shift in the country's politics, with the rise of the Brothers of Italy and the decline of traditional centre-left and centre-right parties. The election was seen as a test of the country's ability to navigate the challenges of the 21st century and to ensure a stable and prosperous future for its citizens.\n\n**Electoral campaign**\n\nThe electoral campaign was marked by a series of intense debates and disputes between the main parties. The Brothers of Italy, led by Giorgia Meloni, focused on issues such as immigration, law and order, and the economy. The Democratic Party (PD), led by Enrico Letta, emphasized the need for a more progressive and inclusive government. The Five Star Movement (M5S), led by Giuseppe Conte, campaigned on issues such as environmental protection, public services, and economic growth.\n\n**Main parties' slogans**\n\n* Brothers of Italy: \"Forza Italia\" (Strong Italy)\n* Democratic Party: \" La Differenza è Necessaria\" (The Difference is Necessary)\n* Five Star Movement: \"Riforma senza frontiere\" (Reform without borders)\n\n**Electoral debates**\n\nThe electoral debates were characterized by a series of intense and often heated exchanges between the main party leaders. The debates focused on issues such as immigration, the economy, and public services. The debates were broadcast on television and followed by large audiences.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe electoral system used in the 2022 Italian general election was a proportional representation system, with lists of candidates competing in each of the 20 regions. The system was designed to ensure that the number of seats allocated to each party was proportional to the number of votes they received.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nA total of 68 electoral lists competed in the election, including:\n\n**Lists with parliamentary representation**\n\n* Brothers of Italy (Fratelli d'Italia)\n* Democratic Party (Partito Democratico)\n* Five Star Movement (Movimento 5 Stelle)\n* League (Lega)\n* Forza Italia (Forza Italia)\n* Action (Azione)\n* Italia Viva (Italia Viva)\n\n**Lists without parliamentary representation**\n\n* Communist Refoundation (Rifondazione Comunista)\n* Green and Left (Sinistra Ecologia Libertà)\n* Civic Area (Area Civica)\n* The People of Family (Il Popolo della Famiglia)\n* Force of the People (Forza del Popolo)\n\n**Lists running only in overseas constituencies**\n\n* Italian Nationalist Association (Associazione Italiana Nazionalista)\n* Italian Social Movement (Movimento Sociale Italiano)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls conducted in the run-up to the election showed a tight contest between the main parties, with the Brothers of Italy and the Democratic Party leading the way. The polls were subject to a degree of volatility, with some showing a significant shift in support for the Five Star Movement.\n\n**Voter turnout**\n\nThe voter turnout in the election was 65.2%, with over 25 million voters casting their ballots.
