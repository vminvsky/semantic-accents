awards for drama [18] In 1957, he enrolled in the Department of Economics at Dhaka University and completed his BA in 1960 and MA in 1961 [19] [20]\n\n\nAfter graduation\nAfter his graduation, Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant to the economics researches of Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan [18] Later, he was appointed lecturer in economics in Chittagong College in 1961 [18] During that time, he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side [17]  In 1965, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States He obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University Graduate Program in Economic Development (GPED) in 1971 [21] [22] From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was the assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro [19] [20]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn 1976, during visits to the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong University, Yunus discovered that very small loans could make a disproportionate difference to a poor person Village women who made bamboo furniture had to take usurious loans to buy bamboo, and repay their profits to the lenders Traditional banks did not want to make tiny loans at reasonable interest to the poor due to high risk of default [29] But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the poor will not need to pay high interest on the money, can keep any profits from their own labour, and hence microcredit was a viable business model [30]  Yunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan [citation needed] Thus, Yunus is credited with the idea of microcredit [31]\n\n\nRecognition\nYunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and social development:\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn July 2007, in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Graça Machel and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders \"to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems.\" [75] Nelson Mandela announced the formation of this new group, The Elders, in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday [76] Yunus attended the launch of the group and was one of its founding members He stepped down as an Elder in September 2009, stating that he was unable to do justice to his membership due to the demands of his work [77]\n\n\nAdvisor to the Caretaker Government\nIn 1996, Muhammad Yunus served as an advisor to the caretaker government led by former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman He was responsible for overseeing the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Environment and Forests [83] [84]\n\n\nNagorik Shakti\nIn early 2006, Yunus, along with other members of the civil society including Rehman Sobhan, Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Kamal Hossain, Matiur Rahman, Mahfuz Anam and Debapriya Bhattacharya, participated in a campaign for honest and clean candidates in national elections [85] He considered entering politics in the later part of that year [86] On 11 February 2007, Yunus wrote an open letter, published in the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star, where he asked citizens for views on his plan to float a political party to establish political goodwill, proper leadership and good governance In the letter, he called on everyone to briefly outline how he should go about the task and how they can contribute to it [87] Yunus finally announced that he is willing to launch a political party tentatively called Nagorik Shakti (lit. 'Citizens' Power') on 18 February 2007 [88] [89] There was speculation that the army supported a move by Yunus into politics [90] On 3 May, however, Yunus declared that he had decided to abandon his political plans following a meeting with the head of the caretaker government, Fakhruddin Ahmed [91]\n\n\nChief Advisor of Bangladesh\nAmid the Student–People's uprising in Bangladesh, Yunus expressed support for the students and his distaste of the current government, and in August 2024, after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and her departure to India, it was announced that Yunus would be chief adviser of the interim government [92] [93]\n\n\nReception\nThe second Sheikh Hasina government, which was dictatorial and authoritarian at best, [103] announced a review of Grameen Bank activities on 11 January 2011 [104] In February 2011, several international leaders, such as Mary Robinson, stepped up their defence of Yunus through a number of efforts, including the founding of a formal network of supporters known as \"Friends of Grameen\" [105]\n\n\n2011 dismissal\nThe second Sheikh Hasina government, which was

of microfinance\nThe allegations against Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank were made in a context where some people began to question the effectiveness of microfinance, prompted by the actions of some for-profit microfinance institutions (MFIs) in India and Mexico [115] Coercion, peer pressure and physical harassment were reportedly used as loan repayment practices in some specific MFIs [116] Commercialisation of microcredit [117] prompted Yunus to state that he \"never imagined that one day microcredit would give rise to its own breed of loan sharks.\" [118]\n\n\nPolitical motivations behind the allegations\nIn December 2010, Grameen Bank was quickly cleared by the Norwegian government of all allegations surrounding misused or misappropriated funds [104] Yet, in March 2011, the Bangladeshi government launched a three-month investigation of all Grameen Bank's activities [104] This inquiry prevented Muhammad Yunus from participating in the World Economic Forum [123]\n\n\nFood adulteration case\nOn 27 January 2011, Yunus appeared in court in a food-adulteration case filed by the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Food Safety Court, accusing him of producing an \"adulterated\" yogurt [129] whose fat content was below the legal minimum This yogurt is produced by Grameen Danone, a social business joint venture between Grameen Bank and Danone that aims to provide opportunities for street vendors who sell the yogurt and to improve child nutrition with the nutrient-fortified yogurt According to Yunus' lawyer, the allegations are \"false and baseless\" [130]\n\n\nTrials\nYunus faced 174 lawsuits in Bangladesh, 172 of which were civil cases Allegations included labour law violations, corruption, and money laundering, which Yunus alleged were politically motivated [131]\n\n\nBackground\nFor many years, Yunus remained a follower of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding father [146] While, teaching at Middle Tennessee State University, [147] Yunus founded the Bangladesh Citizens' Committee (BCC) as a response to West Pakistan's aggression against Bangladesh [148]: 74  After the outbreak of the war of liberation, the BCC selected Yunus to become editor of its Bangladesh News Letter [149] Inspired by the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Yunus returned home in 1972 The relationship continued after Mujib's death Yunus maintained a professional relationship with Hasina Yunus appointed Hasina—along with U.S First Lady Hillary Clinton—as co-chair of a microcredit summit held 2–4 February 1997 At this event, 50 heads of state and high-level officials from 137 nations gathered in Washington, DC, to discuss solutions to poverty At this event, Hasina had nothing but praise for Yunus In her statement she praised, \"the outstanding work done by Professor Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded. .. The success of the Grameen Bank has created optimism about the viability of banks engaged in extending micro-credit to the poor\" [150] The inaugural ceremony of Grameen Phone, Bangladesh's largest telephone service, took place at Hasina's office on 26 March 1997 Using Grameen Phone, Hasina made the first call to Thorbjorn Jagland, the then-Norwegian prime minister When her conversation ended, she received another call, from Laily Begum, a Grameen Phone employee However, this long relationship ended in 2007 after Yunus disclosed his intention to form a political party, Nagorik Shakti [151]\n\n\nFrom friend to foe\nThe Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina campaigned against Grameen and Yunus The New York Times reported, \"Her actions appear to be retaliation for Mr Yunus's announcement in 2007 that he would seek public office, even though he never went through with his plans\" [152] According to Times of India, one other factor contributed to her decision against Yunus: the Nobel Peace Prize [153]\n\n\nHistorical description\nOn 11 January 2007, Army General Moeen U Ahmed staged a military coup [155] Meanwhile, Yunus turned down his request to become the nation's fourth Chief Advisor after Khaleda Zia's term ended Yunus, however, suggested the general pick Fakhruddin Ahmed [156] for the job Fakhruddin took office on 11 January 2007 and made it clear on his first day that he intended not only to arrange a free and fair election but also to clean up corruption While Khaleda and Hasina criticised Fakruddin and claimed that it was not his job to clean up corruption, Yunus expressed his satisfaction In an interview with the AFP news agency, Yunus remarked \"There is no ideology here.\" [125] Hasina had a harsh reaction to Yunus's comments, calling him a \"usurer who has not only failed to eradicate poverty but has also nurtured poverty [157]\" This was Hasina's first public statement against Yunus Later Yunus announced the name of this prospective political party, Nagorik Shakti (Citizens' Power), saying he had a mission to enter the political arena in his nation in hope of changing its identity from \"bottomless basket\" to \"rising tiger\" However, on 3 May, Yunus published a third open letter and put his political ambitions to rest [136]\n\n\nProceedings\nThe Bangladesh government launched the first trial against Yunus in December 2010, alleging that in 1996 he had transferred approximately $100 million to a sister company of Grameen Bank Yunus denied [158] the allegations and he was found innocent by the Norwegian government [159]\n\n\nFrom 2012\nOn 2 August 2012, Sheikh Hasina approved a draft of \"Grameen Bank Ordinance 2012\" [166] to increase government control over the bank [166] That power resided with the bank's directors—nine poor women who were elected by 8.3 million Grameen borrowers Hasina also ordered a fresh investigation into Yunus's activities and financial transactions [167] in his later years as managing director of Grameen, but people saw the move as an attempt to destroy his image The prime minister also alleged that Yunus had received his earnings without the necessary permission from the government, including his Nobel Peace Prize earnings and book royalties [168]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYunus belongs to a Muslim family and continues to actively display a normative orthodox Sunnite theological creed He encourages the public to engage in Dua directly to Allah, [173] [174] whom Yunus publicly recognises as the supreme source of assistance and support, [175] and as the master of Divine Decree [176]\n\n\nYunus Centre\nThe Yunus Centre, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is a think tank focused on social business, poverty alleviation, and sustainability Founded in 2008 and chaired by Dr Yunus, it promotes his philosophy of social business and serves as a resource center for related initiatives The centre's activities include poverty eradication campaigns, research and publications, support for social business start-ups, organizing the Global Social Business Summit, and developing academic programs on social business with international universities [180]\n\n\nPublications\nFootnotes\n\n\nDocumentaries\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Muhammad Yunus**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMuhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi economist and founder of the Grameen Bank, a microfinance organization that has provided credit to millions of people, primarily women, in Bangladesh and other countries. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to create economic and social development.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMuhammad Yunus was born on June 28, 1940, in Bathua, a village in the Chittagong District of Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh). He was the third of nine children in a family of Muslim Saudagars. His father, Haji Muhammad Dula Mia Soudagar, was a jeweller, and his mother, Sufia Khatun, was a homemaker. Yunus spent his early childhood in the village, where he developed a strong sense of community and social responsibility.\n\nIn 1944, Yunus's family moved to the city of Chittagong, where he attended the Lamabazar Primary School. By 1949, his mother was afflicted with psychological illness, which had a significant impact on his family. Despite this, Yunus continued his education, passing the matriculation examination from Chittagong Collegiate School in 1957, ranking 16th out of 39,000 students in East Pakistan.\n\nDuring his school years, Yunus was an active Boy Scout, traveling to West Pakistan and India in 1952, and to Canada in 1955 to attend Jamborees. He also became involved in cultural activities, winning awards for drama. In 1957, Yunus enrolled in the Department of Economics at Dhaka University, completing his BA in 1960 and MA in 1961.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nAfter graduation, Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant to the economics researchers of Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan. In 1961, he was appointed lecturer in economics in Chittagong College, where he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side.\n\nIn 1965, Yunus received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States, where he obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University Graduate Program in Economic Development (GPED) in 1971.

But Yunus believed that, given the chance, the poor will not need to pay high interest on the money, can keep any profits from their own labor, and hence microcredit was a viable business model.\n\nYunus lent US$27 of his money to 42 women in the village, who made a profit of BDT 0.50 (US$0.02) each on the loan. Thus, Yunus is credited with the idea of microcredit.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nYunus was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Grameen Bank, for their efforts to create economic and social development. The Nobel Committee recognized Grameen Bank's achievement in its ability to provide microcredit to the poor, helping them to escape poverty and improve their living conditions.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nIn July 2007, Yunus attended the launch of The Elders, a group of world leaders convened by Nelson Mandela to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Yunus was one of its founding members, but stepped down as an Elder in September 2009, stating that he was unable to do justice to his membership due to the demands of his work.\n\nIn 1996, Yunus served as an advisor to the caretaker government led by former Chief Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman.

prevented Muhammad Yunus from participating in the World Economic Forum [123]\n\n\nFood adulteration case\nOn 27 January 2011, Yunus appeared in court in a food-adulteration case filed by the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Food Safety Court, accusing him of producing an \"adulterated\" yogurt [129] whose fat content was below the legal minimum This yogurt is produced by Grameen Danone, a social business joint venture between Grameen Bank and Danone that aims to provide opportunities for street vendors who sell the yogurt and to improve child nutrition with the nutrient-fortified yogurt According to Yunus' lawyer, the allegations are \"false and baseless\" [130]\n\n\nTrials\nYunus faced 174 lawsuits in Bangladesh, 172 of which were civil cases Allegations included labour law violations, corruption, and money laundering, which Yunus alleged were politically motivated [131]\n\n\nBackground\nFor many years, Yunus remained a follower of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujib, the country's founding father [146] While, teaching at Middle Tennessee State University, [147] Yunus founded the Bangladesh Citizens' Committee (BCC) as a response to West Pakistan's aggression against Bangladesh [148]: 74  After the outbreak of the war of liberation, the BCC selected Yunus to become editor of its Bangladesh News Letter [149] Inspired by the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Yunus returned home in 1972 The relationship continued after Mujib's death Yunus maintained a professional relationship with Hasina Yunus appointed Hasina—along with U.S First Lady Hillary Clinton—as co-chair of a microcredit summit held 2–4 February 1997 At this event, 50 heads of state and high-level officials from 137 nations gathered in Washington, DC, to discuss solutions to poverty At this event, Hasina had nothing but praise for Yunus In her statement she praised, \"the outstanding work done by Professor Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded. .. The success of the Grameen Bank has created optimism about the viability of banks engaged in extending micro-credit to the poor\" [150] The inaugural ceremony of Grameen Phone, Bangladesh's largest telephone service, took place at Hasina's office on 26 March 1997 Using Grameen Phone, Hasina made the first call to Thorbjorn Jagland, the then-Norwegian prime minister When her conversation ended, she received another call, from Laily Begum, a Grameen Phone employee However, this long relationship ended in 2007 after Yunus disclosed his intention to form a political party, Nagorik Shakti [151]\n\n\nFrom friend to foe\nThe Awami League government of Sheikh Hasina campaigned against Grameen and Yunus The New York Times reported, \"Her actions appear to be retaliation for Mr Yunus's announcement in 2007 that he would seek public office, even though he never went through with his plans\" [152] According to Times of India, one other factor contributed to her decision against Yunus: the Nobel Peace Prize [153]\n\n\nHistorical description\nOn 11 January 2007, Army General Moeen U Ahmed staged a military coup [155] Meanwhile, Yunus turned down his request to become the nation's fourth Chief Advisor after Khaleda Zia's term ended Yunus, however, suggested the general pick Fakhruddin Ahmed [156] for the job Fakhruddin took office on 11 January 2007 and made it clear on his first day that he intended not only to arrange a free and fair election but also to clean up corruption While Khaleda and Hasina criticised Fakruddin and claimed that it was not his job to clean up corruption, Yunus expressed his satisfaction In an interview with the AFP news agency, Yunus remarked \"There is no ideology here.\" [125] Hasina had a harsh reaction to Yunus's comments, calling him a \"usurer who has not only failed to eradicate poverty but has also nurtured poverty [157]\" This was Hasina's first public statement against Yunus Later Yunus announced the name of this prospective political party, Nagorik Shakti (Citizens' Power), saying he had a mission to enter the political arena in his nation in hope of changing its identity from \"bottomless basket\" to \"rising tiger\" However, on 3 May, Yunus published a third open letter and put his political ambitions to rest [136]\n\n\nProceedings\nThe Bangladesh government launched the first trial against Yunus in December 2010, alleging that in 1996 he had transferred approximately $100 million to a sister company of Grameen Bank Yunus denied [158] the allegations and he was found innocent by the Norwegian government [159]\n\n\nFrom 2012\nOn 2 August 2012, Sheikh Hasina approved a draft of \"Grameen Bank Ordinance 2012\" [166] to increase government control over the bank [166] That power resided with the bank's directors—nine poor women who were elected by 8.3 million Grameen borrowers Hasina also ordered a fresh investigation into Yunus's activities and financial transactions [167] in his later years as managing director of Grameen, but people saw the move as an attempt to destroy his image The prime minister also alleged that Yunus had received his earnings without the necessary permission from the government, including his Nobel Peace Prize earnings and book royalties [168]\n\n\nPersonal life\nYunus belongs to a Muslim family and continues to actively display a normative orthodox Sunnite theological creed He encourages the public to engage in Dua directly to Allah, [173] [174] whom Yunus publicly recognises as the supreme source of assistance and support, [175] and as the master of Divine Decree [176]\n\n\nYunus Centre\nThe Yunus Centre, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is a think tank focused on social business, poverty alleviation, and sustainability Founded in 2008 and chaired by Dr Yunus, it promotes his philosophy of social business and serves as a resource center for related initiatives The centre's activities include poverty eradication campaigns, research and publications, support for social business start-ups, organizing the Global Social Business Summit, and developing academic programs on social business with international universities [180]\n\n\nPublications\nFootnotes\n\n\nDocumentaries\nFootnotes\n\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\nFootnotes\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was born on February 25, 1885, in the Tapestry Room at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, in the presence of her great-grandmother Queen Victoria.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAlice was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the Queen's second daughter. Her father was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine through his morganatic marriage to Countess Julia Hauke, who was created Princess of Battenberg in 1858 by Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse. Alice's three younger siblings, Louise, George, and Louis, later became Queen of Sweden, Marquess of Milford Haven, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, respectively.\n\nGrowing up, Alice was educated at home and received a traditional princess's education, which included music, dance, and languages. She was particularly close to her mother, who instilled in her a strong sense of duty and responsibility.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1902, Alice met Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, the fourth son of King George I of Greece and Olga Constantinovna of Russia, while in London for King Edward VII's coronation. They married in a civil ceremony on October 6, 1903, at Darmstadt. The following day, there were two religious marriage ceremonies; one Lutheran in the Evangelical Castle Church, and one Greek Orthodox in the Russian Chapel on the Mathildenhöhe.\n\nAs the bride and groom were closely related to the ruling houses of the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Denmark, and Greece, their wedding was one of the great gatherings of the descendants of Queen Victoria and King Christian IX held before World War I. After their marriage, Alice adopted the style of her husband, becoming \"Princess Andrew.\"\n\n**Successive Life Crises**\n\nWith the advent of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was reinstated in the army, and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals. Her work for the army earned her recognition, and King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913.\n\nDuring World War I, Princess Andrew's brother-in-law, King Constantine I of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on December 1, 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so untenable that she and other members of the Greek royal family were forced into exile when King Constantine abdicated.\n\nFor the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland. In 1920, Princess Andrew and her family settled in a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece and Denmark at Saint-Cloud, on the outskirts of Paris. Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees and became deeply involved in charitable work.\n\n**Illness**\n\nIn 1928, Princess Andrew converted to the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated into English her husband's defense of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers.\n\nPrincess Andrew's claims of healing powers and divine messages were met with skepticism by some, but she remained convinced of their validity. She spent the rest of her life promoting her faith and spreading her message of healing and love.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDuring World War II, Princess Andrew was in the difficult situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a son in the British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. Princess Andrew and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece, lived in Athens for the duration of the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa.\n\nPrincess Andrew moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace, and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Crown Princess Louise. She organized two shelters for orphaned and lost children and a nursing circuit for poor neighborhoods.\n\n**Widowhood**\n\nIn April 1947, Princess Andrew returned to the United Kingdom to attend the November wedding of her only son, Philip, to Princess Elizabeth, the elder daughter and heir presumptive of King George VI. She had some of her remaining jewels used in Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring. On the day of the wedding, her son was created Duke of Edinburgh by George VI.\n\nFor the wedding ceremony, Princess Andrew sat at the head of her family on the north side of Westminster Abbey, opposite the King, Queen Elizabeth, and Queen Mary. Princess Andrew's daughters were not invited to the wedding because of anti-German sentiment in Britain following World War II.\n\n**Death and Burial**\n\nPrincess Andrew died at Buckingham Palace on December 5, 1969. Initially, her remains were placed in the Royal Crypt in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on December 10, 1969. However, before she died, she had expressed her wish to be buried at the Convent of Saint Mary Magdalene in Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, near her aunt Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, a Russian Orthodox saint.\n\nWhen her daughter Princess George William of Hanover complained that it would be too far away for them to visit her grave, Princess Andrew jested, \"Nonsense, there's a perfectly good bus service!\" Her wish was realized on August 3, 1988, when her remains were transferred to her final resting place in a crypt below the church.\n\n**Titles, Styles, and Honours**\n\nPrincess Alice of Battenberg was a member of the British royal family and the morganatic wife of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. She held the title of Princess Andrew and was recognized for her charitable work during World War I and World War II. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross in 1913 and was a patron of several charitable organizations.\n\n**Issue**\n\nPrincess Alice of Battenberg had five children with Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark:\n\n* Margarita, Hereditary Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1905-1981)\n* Theodora, Duchess of Sparta (1906-1969)\n* Cecilie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine (1911-1937)\n* Sophie, Princess of Greece and Denmark (1914-2001)\n* Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1921-2021)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nPrincess Alice of Battenberg descended from King Christian IX of Denmark and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

[15] During the taping of Living Dolls, she lapsed into a coma and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes [18] [19] [20] After the cancellation of Living Dolls, she moved to Los Angeles [15]\n\n\nEarly work and breakthrough (1989–1999)\nIn 1989, Berry moved to New York City to pursue her acting ambitions [14] During her early time there, she ran out of money and briefly lived in a homeless shelter and a YMCA [15] [16] [17] Her situation improved by the end of that year, and she was cast in the role of model Emily Franklin in the short-lived ABC television series Living Dolls, which was shot in New York and was a spin-off of the hit series Who's the Boss?

[27] she was reportedly paid an additional $500,000 for the short scene [28] Berry denied these stories, telling one interviewer that they amused her and \"made for great publicity for the movie.\" [26] [29] After turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she said she decided to make Swordfish because her then-husband, Eric Benét, supported her and encouraged her to take risks [30]\n\n\nEstablished actress and career fluctuations (2005–2013)\nHer next film appearance was in the Oprah Winfrey-produced ABC television film Their Eyes Were Watching God (2005), an adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's novel, with Berry portraying a free-spirited woman whose unconventional sexual mores upset her 1920s contemporaries in a small community She received her second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her role Also in 2005, she served as an executive producer in Lackawanna Blues, and landed her voice for the character of Cappy, one of the many mechanical beings in the animated feature Robots [49]\n\n\nContinued film and television work (2014–present)\nIn 2014, Berry signed on to star and serve as a co-executive producer in CBS drama series Extant, [70] where she took on the role of Molly Woods, an astronaut who struggles to reconnect with her husband and android son after spending 13 months in space The show ran for two seasons until 2015, receiving largely positive reviews from critics [71] [72] [73] USA Today remarked: \"She  [Halle Berry] brings a dignity and gravity to Molly, a projected intelligence that allows you to buy her as an astronaut and to see what has happened to her as frightening rather than ridiculous Berry's all in, and you float along.\" [74] Also in 2014, Berry launched a new production company, 606 Films, with producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas It is named after the Anti-Paparazzi Bill, SB 606, that the actress pushed for and which was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown in the fall of 2013 The new company emerged as part of a deal for Berry to work in Extant [75]\n\n\nMedia image\nBerry was ranked No 1 on People's \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" list in 2003 after making the top ten seven times and appeared No 1 on FHM's \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" the same year [91] [92] She was named Esquire magazine's \"Sexiest Woman Alive\" in October 2008, about which she stated: \"I don't know exactly what it means, but being 42 and having just had a baby, I think I'll take it.\" [93] [94] Men's Health ranked her at No 35 on their \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\" list [95] In 2009, she was voted #23 on Empire's 100 Sexiest Film Stars [96] The same year, rapper Hurricane Chris released a song titled \"Halle Berry (She's Fine)\" extolling Berry's beauty and sex appeal [97] At the age of 42 (in 2008), she was named the \"Sexiest Black Woman\" by Access Hollywood's \"TV One Access\" survey [98] [99] [100] [101] Born to an African-American father and a white mother, Berry has stated that her biracial background was \"painful and confusing\" when she was a young woman, and she made the decision early on to identify as a black woman because she knew that was how she would be perceived [14]\n\n\nPersonal life\nBerry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991 [102] In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what he claimed were unpaid loans to help launch her career [103] Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge dismissed the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a debtor when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992 [10]\n\n\nActivism\nAlong with Pierce Brosnan, Cindy Crawford, Jane Seymour, Dick Van Dyke, Téa Leoni, and Daryl Hannah, Berry successfully fought in 2006 against the Cabrillo Port Liquefied Natural Gas facility that was proposed off the coast of Malibu [137] Berry said, \"I care about the air we breathe, I care about the marine life and the ecosystem of the ocean.\" [138] In May 2007, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the facility [139] Hasty Pudding Theatricals gave her its 2006 Woman of The Year award [140] Berry took part in a nearly 2,000-house cellphone-bank campaign for Barack Obama in February 2008 [141] In April 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice [142] In August 2013, Berry testified alongside Jennifer Garner before the California State Assembly's Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers [143] The bill passed in September [144]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo game\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nGeneral bibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This power allows the President to grant pardons, commutations, and reprieves to individuals convicted of federal crimes. During his presidency, Donald Trump exercised this power extensively, granting executive clemency to over 237 individuals. This article provides a comprehensive list of individuals granted executive clemency by Trump, along with an overview of his use of this power.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe U.S. President's power of clemency arises from Article II of the United States Constitution. Clemency \"may take several forms, including pardon, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve\", with the two most commonly used forms being a pardon or commutation. A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime, once issued, all further punishment for the crime is waived. The President can only grant pardons for federal offenses. When the President commutes a sentence, it reduces the severity of a sentence without voiding the conviction itself; for example, a commutation may reduce or eliminate a prison term, while leaving other punishments intact. The power of clemency is \"one of the most unlimited powers bestowed on the President by the Constitution.\"\n\n**Trump's use of executive clemency**\n\nFor 125 years, the key adviser to the President on clemency has been the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney (OPA), which normally reviews all requests for pardons. Trump often bypassed the OPA, and, unlike previous Presidents, made the majority of his grants to executive clemency to \"well-connected offenders who had not filed petitions with the pardon office or did not meet its requirements.\" Ultimately, of the 237 grants of clemency by Trump, only 25 came through the Office of the Pardon Attorney's process (which at the end of Trump's presidency had a backlog of 14,000 applications); the other clemency recipients came to Trump's attention through an ad hoc process at the Trump White House that benefited clemency applicants with money or connections to Trump allies, friends, and family members. Most of Trump's pardons and commutations were granted to people with personal or political connections to him.\n\n**Supporters and political allies**\n\nTrump's use of the pardon power was marked by an unprecedented degree of favoritism. He frequently granted executive clemency to his supporters or political allies, or following personal appeals or campaigns in conservative media, as in the cases of Rod Blagojevich, Michael Milken, Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D'Souza, and Clint Lorance, as well as Bernard Kerik. Trump granted clemency to five of his former campaign staff members and political advisers: Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Stephen K. Bannon, and George Papadopoulos.\n\n**Requests by celebrities**\n\nIn 2018, following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian, Trump commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted of drug trafficking. In August 2020, he pardoned Johnson after she had praised his leadership in a campaign video at the 2020 Republican National Convention.\n\n**Military personnel accused or convicted of war crimes**\n\nTrump granted executive clemency to three court-martialed U.S. military officers who were accused or convicted of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump granted the pardons against the advice of senior military and Defense Department leadership, as well as U.S. military lawyers. Critics state that Trump's pardons of the officers undermined military discipline, constituted an inappropriate interference in the U.S. military justice system, and called into question the U.S. commitment to the law of armed conflict. Tensions between Trump and the Defense Department regarding Trump's interventions in the military justice system culminated in the firing of Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer.\n\n**Congressmen**\n\nTrump issued pardons to seven Republican congressmen convicted of crimes: Chris Collins, Duncan D. Hunter, Steve Stockman, Rick Renzi, Robin Hayes, Mark Siljander, and Randall \"Duke\" Cunningham. Trump also granted clemency to at least ten healthcare executives and doctors convicted in large-scale Medicare fraud schemes. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association criticized Trump's pardons to executives who orchestrated massive Medicare frauds.\n\n**Wealthy individuals**\n\nMany wealthy individuals paid tens of thousands of dollars to former advisors to Trump for them to lobby Trump to grant pardons, bypassing the review process of the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Trump's former personal lawyer, John M. Dowd, was hired by a number of convicts to lobby Trump for clemency, taking advantage of his direct access to Trump's White House Counsel's Office. Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, and a lobbyist close to Trump administration, also lobbied Trump for clemency on behalf of their clients, as did Mark D. Cowan, another lobbyist allied with the administration.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the pardons included former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio; former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine; Scooter Libby, a political aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney; and conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza. He pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American soldiers convicted or accused of war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n**List of recipients of executive clemency from Trump**\n\nTrump issued a total of 143 pardons during his first four years in office: one in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, twelve in 2020, and 116 in January 2021.\n\n**First term (2017–2021)**\n\nTrump issued a total of 143 pardons during his first four years in office: one in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, twelve in 2020, and 116 in January 2021.\n\n**Pardons**\n\nTrump issued a total of 143 pardons during his first four years in office: one in 2017, six in 2018, eight in 2019, twelve in 2020, and 116 in January 2021.\n\n**Commutations**\n\nTrump issued 94 commutations: one in 2017, four in 2018, two in 2019, five in 2020, and 83 in January 2021.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nIn 2019, former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher was demoted following a July 2, 2019, court martial based on accusations that he had committed a war crime. Trump later reversed his demotion.\n\n**Second term (2025–)**\n\nTrump has said multiple times that if he were reelected in 2024, he would pardon January 6 rioters.\n\n**Potential**\n\nTrump has said multiple times that if he were reelected in 2024, he would pardon January 6 rioters.\n\n**Responses**\n\nIn October 2019, New York enacted the TRUST Act, which was signed into law by Andrew Cuomo. Among other things, the act closed a double jeopardy provision of state law to allow state prosecutors to pursue charges for violations of New York law against individuals pardoned by the President for a violation of federal law. The New York legislation was aimed at Trump's use of the pardon power. New York State Attorney General Letitia James proposed the law after multiple former Trump associates were investigated in New York State. James' office has been investigating the finances of Trump and the Trump Organization. Upon passage of the law, James said that \"We have a responsibility to ensure that individuals who commit crimes under New York State law are held accountable for those crimes. This critical new law closes a gaping loophole that could have allowed any President to abuse the presidential pardon power by unfairly granting a pardon to a family member or close associate and possibly allow that individual to evade justice altogether.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_by_Donald_Trump\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe U.S president's power of clemency arises from Article II of the United States Constitution Clemency \"may take several forms, including pardon, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve\", [7] with the two most commonly used forms being a pardon or commutation A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime Once a pardon is issued, all further punishment for the crime is waived [8] The president can only grant pardons for federal offenses [9] When the president commutes a sentence, it reduces the severity of a sentence without voiding the conviction itself;

Mississippi in the town of Centreville, an elderly woman was killed when a severe storm blew a tree onto her mobile home [14]\n\n\nMarch 25–26\nOn March 22, the Storm Prediction Center issued a broad 15% risk contour from Eastern Texas to the Central Gulf Coast States, highlighting the potential for multiple rounds of severe storms to move through the region The next day, a large enhanced risk area was issued over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast, including most of Mississippi On March 24, the risk was upgraded to moderate over Central and Northern Mississippi as well as Northwestern Alabama and large portion of Tennessee On the morning of March 25, the moderate risk was upgraded to a high following the issuance of a 30% hatched risk area for tornadoes from central, eastern and northern Mississippi into northwestern Alabama and southern Tennessee The high risk was later expanded to include all of northern Alabama southward to the central part of the state At 16:25 UTC, a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued for western and northern Alabama, northwest Georgia, central and eastern Mississippi, and southern Middle Tennessee Six more tornado watches would be issued through the rest of the day as well [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nMarch 27–28\nA slight risk of severe thunderstorms was issued for March 27 from the Lower Mississippi through Tennessee Valleys on March 25 as another weather system was expected to enter the region The next morning, a small enhanced risk was issued from the Memphis to the Western Nashville metropolitan areas due to a 10% risk contour for tornadoes That afternoon, the area was hatched, indicating an increased likelihood for strong tornadoes The enhanced area was expanded to cover a region from Southern Arkansas to Middle Tennessee on the morning of March 27 with the addition of 30% hatched contours for both wind damage and large hail The southwestern portion of the enhanced risk was eventually pushed into the ArkLaTex region later that day Slight and marginal risk areas also covered areas from Eastern Texas and Illinois to North Carolina Numerous strong to severe thunderstorms formed that afternoon, producing widespread reports of hail and wind damage There were 19 confirmed tornadoes, including six that were rated EF2, with a fatality occurring from one of them east of Carthage, Texas Another fatality occurred in Carmel, Indiana when severe thunderstorm winds blew a tree down onto a man while he was in his backyard [35]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nTwenty-three minutes after the Talladega National Forest low-end EF3 tornado lifted, the same parent supercell thunderstorm produced this intense, long-tracked tornado that caused significant damage in the southern suburbs of Birmingham It first touched down along Vance Road west of West Blocton in Bibb County at 12:53 p.m CDT (17:53 UTC) and moved northeastward, damaging trees at EF0 to EF1 strength It quickly strengthened as it passed north of town and briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity, snapping large tree trunks in a wooded area It then weakened back to EF1 strength, uprooting trees near Hebron before weakening further, causing high-end EF0 damage northeast of the rural community The tornado then moved into Shelby County, briefly reaching low-end EF1 strength as it uprooted trees EF1 damage continued south of Turner, as it uprooted more trees before weakening back to EF0 strength as it entered the west side of Helena, causing minor roof damage to homes and downing trees Mainly shingle, siding, and fence damage was noted in this area, though a house that was under construction collapsed The tornado then intensified to EF1 strength once again as it moved through the north side of Helena A few homes along Cunningham Lane sustained partial roof loss, and one home in town sustained destruction of its front porch overhang The tornado briefly weakened back to EF0 strength before strengthening more significantly at the north edge of Pelham, reaching EF2 intensity as it moved directly through a residential neighborhood Several homes were significantly damaged along Crosscreek Trail and Wilderness Road, including a few that had their roofs ripped off, and at least two that had an exterior wall knocked down Trees were uprooted or severely damaged as well The tornado then continued northeast at EF1 strength, damaging or snapping numerous trees as it moved farther into the southern suburbs of Birmingham, and proceeded to cross US 31 and I-65 A few mobile homes and some businesses sustained roof damage along this corridor East of the interstate, a manufactured home was completely destroyed at high-end EF1 intensity and more trees were damaged More trees were snapped along Indian Trail as the tornado traversed mountainous terrain into Indian Springs Village, where additional trees were downed and homes sustained minor to moderate damage As the tornado passed New Hope, it briefly regained low-end EF2 intensity as it paralleled SR 119, snapping several tree trunks and uprooting more trees, some of which fell on homes in a neighborhood The tornado then caused high-end EF0 to EF1 damage to homes and trees in another neighborhood before briefly reaching low-end EF2 strength again as it moved directly over SR 119, where more large tree

southeast of Ragland along Boiling Springs Road at about 2:31 p.m CDT (19:31 UTC) It quickly intensified to high-end EF2 intensity as it moved northeast, snapping or uprooting dozens of trees, damaging the roof of a metal building, and obliterating a mobile home along Simpson Bend Road Continuing at high-end EF2 strength, the tornado caused major damage in the small community of Macon, destroying several mobile homes, ripping the roofs off of several residences while knocking down some exterior walls, and snapping or uprooting numerous trees Maintaining its strength, the tornado crossed Ragan Chapel Road, destroying two mobile homes and inflicting major roof damage to a frame home Northeast of this location, the tornado reached its peak intensity as it destroyed Precision Materials, a manufacturing facility housed in a large metal warehouse building southwest of Ohatchee The building was almost totally collapsed, with severe twisting and buckling of metal support beams noted, and damage in this area was rated low-end EF3 The tornado caused more high-end EF2 damage as it crossed SR 77, destroying multiple mobile homes, a church, and a large outbuilding One of the fatalities occurred in this area along Mudd Street, where a very small and unanchored home collapsed, while the others occurred in mobile homes The tornado also downed many trees and snapped power poles, shattered windows, and ripped large sections of roofing off of multiple houses along this segment of the path before continuing to the northeast It then weakened to high-end EF1 strength as it

occurred just northeast of this point along County Road 35, where a mobile home was completely destroyed at high-end EF2 intensity The tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached and crossed County Road 28, quickly reaching its peak intensity and completely destroying a house at mid-range EF3 intensity, which was left with only one wall standing Fields near this home were strewn with structural debris, and many trees were denuded and debarked, with a wide swath of forest containing hundreds of trees mowed down Outbuildings and mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and a few other frame homes were severely damaged It widened and weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached SR 14 Continuing northeastward, the large tornado crossed SR 14 between Sawyerville and Greensboro at EF2 strength, destroying mobile homes and outbuildings, and mowing down large swaths of trees North of SR 14, five Y-shaped metal transmission towers were downed The tornado then briefly reached low-end EF3 strength again as a large swath of trees was completely flattened near Brown Road Just past this area, the tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity, and along County Road 21, a mobile home was obliterated and the remnants were swept away A nearby house lost its roof and several exterior walls as well The tornado continued at EF2 intensity to the northeast of Greensboro, snapping trees and impacting numerous houses, barns, and outbuildings as it approached then crossed SR 69 A couple of houses sustained complete roof loss and partial collapse of some walls in this area Farther along the path, a swath of particularly severe of tree damage near County Road 32 was rated EF3 EF2 damage continued just to the northeast near County Road 86 and SR 25, and several site-built homes and mobile homes were damaged One house was pushed entirely off its foundation, and another sustained collapse of several outer walls.\n\n\nFranklin–Newnan–Peachtree City, Georgia\nThis very large, violent nighttime tornado caused severe damage in the southern suburbs of Atlanta It first touched down in western Heard County at 11:37 p.m EDT (03:37 UTC) and tracked east-northeastward along SR 34 northeast of Texas, initially causing only minor EF0 to EF1 tree damage as it passed north of Viola It widened and intensified before moving into Franklin, causing high-end EF2 damage in the downtown area Multiple businesses were heavily damaged, metal beams were twisted at a large industrial building, which lost its roof and a wall, and some other metal buildings were damaged to a lesser degree A gas station awning and a semi-trailer were blown over as well Homes were damaged in residential areas of Franklin, and two had their roofs torn off Sheds and detached garages were destroyed, and many trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout the town This included a few pine trees that sustained some low-end debarking [1] The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength and narrowed as it crossed US 27 and exited Franklin It continued to parallel GA 34 as it approached the county line, snapping and uprooting trees in a heavily forested area The tornado crossed into Coweta County at 11:54 p.m EDT (03:54 UTC) and began to move toward Newnan Along JD Walton Road, EF1 damage continued as the tornado destroyed an outbuilding and uprooted and snapped numerous trees As it crossed Smokey Road, Holbrook Road, and Victorian Lane, the tornado began to widen again and reached low-end EF2 intensity, snapping many large trees and causing roof and window damage to homes as it entered more populated areas at the southwestern edge of Newnan The most intense damage in this area occurred in the Mountain Creek and Woodlawn Farms subdivisions The tornado then grew tremendously and reached EF3 intensity as it moved across Timberland Trail and Smokey Ridge Drive, damaging or destroying numerous homes as it moved through multiple subdivisions Many homes sustained roof loss and collapse of exterior walls, and one home was left with only its back wall standing Severe tree damage occurred in this area, cars were flipped, and a gas station awning was shredded [74] The first of three tornado emergencies was then issued at 12:06 a.m EDT (04:06 UTC) as a large debris signature appeared on radar [88] [89] [90]\n\n\nPreparations and impact\nOn the morning of March 25, 2021, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for 46 counties as the National Weather Service predicted a major severe weather outbreak and possible tornado outbreak [93]\n\n\nNon-tornadic effects\nDuring the event there were 298 and 198 filtered reports of wind damage and large hail respectively [97] On March 27, there was widespread wind and hail damage recorded from Texas to North Carolina with 2 in (5.1 cm) hail being recorded as far east as Rose Hill, North Carolina [98] Across the Delaware Valley on April 28, 60–70 mph (97–113 km/h) wind gusts blew down numerous trees and power lines resulting in numerous power outages One person suffered minor injuries when a barn was blown over near Gap, Pennsylvania [99] New York City approached wind gusts of 50 mph (80 km/h) during record warm temperatures, [100] resulting in both the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Bayonne Bridge closing due to the high winds [101] High winds across the Northeast led to over 78,000 customers losing power [102] Flooding also closed portions of I-65 in Cullman County, Alabama [103]\n\n\nTennessee flooding\nAlong with the severe and tornadic weather, training thunderstorm also produced widespread flooding occurred in Middle Tennessee on March 27–28, especially in Franklin and Nashville Before the storm, a rare flash flood emergency was issued [104] Over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain was reported in Franklin while 7 inches (180 mm) of rain fell in Nashville and nearby Murfreesboro This made it the highest single-day March rainfall on record, and the second highest two-day rainfall event on record for Nashville The Harpeth River reached major flood stage in Franklin trapping people in their homes on Hillsboro road In Nashville, seven people were killed and cars were trapped on I-24 The storms and tornadoes from March 25 left saturated ground, setting the stage for flooding after heavy rain all day on March 27 [105] Damage due to the flooding totaled to $28.021 million

and widespread severe weather event that affected multiple states in the United States, particularly Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The event was characterized by a prolonged period of severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and flash flooding.\n\nMeteorological Synopsis\n------------------------\n\nThe first day of the severe weather outbreak, March 24, was not well forecast. A marginal risk outlook for severe weather was originally issued for Eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley on March 22, highlighting the isolated possibility for all severe hazards. By the day of the event, a slight risk outlook had been issued across the Southern Plains and the ArkLaTex regions, mainly for the threat of large hail. However, by 2000 UTC, an enhanced risk outlook for large hail had been issued and extended from Central to Northeast Texas.\n\nMarch 24\n----------\n\nThe first day of the severe weather outbreak, March 24, was not well forecast. A marginal risk outlook for severe weather was originally issued for Eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley on March 22, highlighting the isolated possibility for all severe hazards. By the day of the event, a slight risk outlook had been issued across the Southern Plains and the ArkLaTex regions, mainly for the threat of large hail. However, by 2000 UTC, an enhanced risk outlook for large hail had been issued and extended from Central to Northeast Texas.\n\nNumerous supercells formed that afternoon, producing mainly large hail, although two EFU tornadoes were confirmed. To the east in Mississippi, an elderly woman was killed when a severe storm blew a tree onto her mobile home.\n\nMarch 25-26\n------------\n\nOn March 22, the Storm Prediction Center issued a broad 15% risk contour from Eastern Texas to the Central Gulf Coast States, highlighting the potential for multiple rounds of severe storms to move through the region. The next day, a large enhanced risk area was issued over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast, including most of Mississippi.\n\nOn March 24, the risk was upgraded to moderate over Central and Northern Mississippi as well as Northwestern Alabama and large portion of Tennessee. On the morning of March 25, the moderate risk was upgraded to a high following the issuance of a 30% hatched risk area for tornadoes from central, eastern and northern Mississippi into northwestern Alabama and southern Tennessee.\n\nA Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued for western and northern Alabama, northwest Georgia, central and eastern Mississippi, and southern Middle Tennessee. Six more tornado watches would be issued through the rest of the day.\n\nMarch 27-28\n------------\n\nA slight risk of severe thunderstorms was issued for March 27 from the Lower Mississippi through Tennessee Valleys on March 25, as another weather system was expected to enter the region. The next morning, a small enhanced risk was issued from the Memphis to the Western Nashville metropolitan areas due to a 10% risk contour for tornadoes.\n\nThat afternoon, the area was hatched, indicating an increased likelihood for strong tornadoes. The enhanced area was expanded to cover a region from Southern Arkansas to Middle Tennessee on the morning of March 27, with the addition of 30% hatched contours for both wind damage and large hail.\n\nConfirmed Tornadoes\n-------------------\n\nTwenty-three minutes after the Talladega National Forest low-end EF3 tornado lifted, the same parent supercell thunderstorm produced this intense, long-tracked tornado that caused significant damage in the southern suburbs of Birmingham.\n\nIt first touched down along Vance Road west of West Blocton in Bibb County at 12:53 p.m. CDT (17:53 UTC) and moved northeastward, damaging trees at EF0 to EF1 strength. The tornado quickly strengthened as it passed north of town and briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity, snapping large tree trunks in a wooded area.\n\nThe tornado then weakened back to EF1 strength, uprooting trees near Hebron before weakening further, causing high-end EF0 damage northeast of the rural community. The tornado then moved into Shelby County, briefly reaching low-end EF1 strength as it uprooted trees.\n\nEF1 damage continued south of Turner, as it uprooted more trees before weakening back to EF0 strength as it entered the west side of Helena, causing minor roof damage to homes and downing trees. Mainly shingle, siding, and fence damage was noted in this area, though a house that was under construction collapsed.\n\nThe tornado then intensified to EF1 strength once again as it moved through the north side of Helena. A few homes along Cunningham Lane sustained partial roof loss, and one home in town sustained destruction of its front porch overhang.\n\nThe tornado briefly weakened back to EF0 strength before strengthening more significantly at the north edge of Pelham, reaching EF2 intensity as it moved directly through a residential neighborhood. Several homes were significantly damaged along Crosscreek Trail and Wilderness Road, including a few that had their roofs ripped off, and at least two that had an exterior wall knocked down.\n\nTrees were uprooted or severely damaged as well. The tornado then continued northeast at EF1 strength, damaging or snapping numerous trees as it moved farther into the southern suburbs of Birmingham, and proceeded to cross US 31 and I-65.\n\nA few mobile homes and some businesses sustained roof damage along this corridor. East of the interstate, a manufactured home was completely destroyed at high-end EF1 intensity and more trees were damaged. More trees were snapped along Indian Trail as the tornado traversed mountainous terrain into Indian Springs Village, where additional trees were downed and homes sustained minor to moderate damage.\n\nAs the tornado passed New Hope, it briefly regained low-end EF2 intensity as it paralleled SR 119, snapping several tree trunks and uprooting more trees, some of which fell on homes in a neighborhood. The tornado then caused high-end EF0 to EF1 damage to homes and trees in another neighborhood before briefly reaching low-end EF2 strength again as it moved directly over SR 119, where more large tree trunks were snapped.\n\nMacon–Ohatchee–Wellington–Piedmont, Alabama\n------------------------------------------\n\nA very large, intense, and long-tracked tornado first touched down at 4:26 p.m. CDT (21:26 UTC) south of Sawyerville in Hale County along SR 17 and moved northeastward, downing trees at EF1 strength.\n\nThe first area of significant damage along the path occurred just northeast of this point along County Road 35, where a mobile home was completely destroyed at high-end EF2 intensity.

Outbuildings and mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and a few other frame homes were severely damaged.\n\nThe tornado widened and weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached SR 14. Continuing northeastward, the large tornado crossed SR 14 between Sawyerville and Greensboro at EF2 strength, destroying mobile homes and outbuildings, and mowing down large swaths of trees.\n\nPreparations and Impact\n-----------------------\n\nOn the morning of March 25, 2021, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for 46 counties as the National Weather Service predicted a major severe weather outbreak and possible tornado outbreak.\n\nNon-tornadic Effects\n---------------------\n\nDuring the event, there were 298 and 198 filtered reports of wind damage and large hail, respectively. On March 27, there was widespread wind and hail damage recorded from Texas to North Carolina, with 2-inch hail being recorded as far east as Rose Hill, North Carolina.\n\nAcross the Delaware Valley on April 28, 60-70 mph wind gusts blew down numerous trees and power lines, resulting in numerous power outages. One person suffered minor injuries when a barn was blown over near Gap, Pennsylvania.\n\nNew York City approached wind gusts of 50 mph, resulting in both the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Bayonne Bridge closing due to the high winds. High winds across the Northeast led to over 78,000 customers losing power.\n\nFlooding also closed portions of I-65 in Cullman County, Alabama.\n\nTennessee Flooding\n-----------------\n\nAlong with the severe and tornadic weather, training thunderstorms also produced widespread flooding in Middle Tennessee on March 27-28, especially in Franklin and Nashville.\n\nBefore the storm, a rare flash flood emergency was issued. Over 10 inches of rain was reported in Franklin, while 7 inches of rain fell in Nashville and nearby Murfreesboro.\n\nThis made it the highest single-day March rainfall on record, and the second-highest two-day rainfall event on record for Nashville. The Harpeth River reached major flood stage in Franklin, trapping people in their homes on Hillsboro Road.\n\nIn Nashville, seven people were killed, and cars were trapped on I-24. The storms and tornadoes from March 25 left saturated ground, setting the stage for flooding after heavy rain all day on March 27.\n\nDamage due to the flooding totaled $28.021 million.\n\nSee

to Northeast Texas Numerous supercells formed that afternoon, producing mainly large hail, although two EFU tornadoes were confirmed To the east in Mississippi in the town of Centreville, an elderly woman was killed when a severe storm blew a tree onto her mobile home [14]\n\n\nMarch 25–26\nOn March 22, the Storm Prediction Center issued a broad 15% risk contour from Eastern Texas to the Central Gulf Coast States, highlighting the potential for multiple rounds of severe storms to move through the region The next day, a large enhanced risk area was issued over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast, including most of Mississippi On March 24, the risk was upgraded to moderate over Central and Northern Mississippi as well as Northwestern Alabama and large portion of Tennessee On the morning of March 25, the moderate risk was upgraded to a high following the issuance of a 30% hatched risk area for tornadoes from central, eastern and northern Mississippi into northwestern Alabama and southern Tennessee The high risk was later expanded to include all of northern Alabama southward to the central part of the state At 16:25 UTC, a Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued for western and northern Alabama, northwest Georgia, central and eastern Mississippi, and southern Middle Tennessee Six more tornado watches would be issued through the rest of the day as well [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]\n\n\nMarch 27–28\nA slight risk of severe thunderstorms was issued for March 27 from the Lower Mississippi through Tennessee Valleys on March 25 as another weather system was expected to enter the region The next morning, a small enhanced risk was issued from the Memphis to the Western Nashville metropolitan areas due to a 10% risk contour for tornadoes That afternoon, the area was hatched, indicating an increased likelihood for strong tornadoes The enhanced area was expanded to cover a region from Southern Arkansas to Middle Tennessee on the morning of March 27 with the addition of 30% hatched contours for both wind damage and large hail The southwestern portion of the enhanced risk was eventually pushed into the ArkLaTex region later that day Slight and marginal risk areas also covered areas from Eastern Texas and Illinois to North Carolina Numerous strong to severe thunderstorms formed that afternoon, producing widespread reports of hail and wind damage There were 19 confirmed tornadoes, including six that were rated EF2, with a fatality occurring from one of them east of Carthage, Texas Another fatality occurred in Carmel, Indiana when severe thunderstorm winds blew a tree down onto a man while he was in his backyard [35]\n\n\nConfirmed tornadoes\nTwenty-three minutes after the Talladega National Forest low-end EF3 tornado lifted, the same parent supercell thunderstorm produced this intense, long-tracked tornado that caused significant damage in the southern suburbs of Birmingham It first touched down along Vance Road west of West Blocton in Bibb County at 12:53 p.m CDT (17:53 UTC) and moved northeastward, damaging trees at EF0 to EF1 strength It quickly strengthened as it passed north of town and briefly reached low-end EF2 intensity, snapping large tree trunks in a wooded area It then weakened back to EF1 strength, uprooting trees near Hebron before weakening further, causing high-end EF0 damage northeast of the rural community The tornado then moved into Shelby County, briefly reaching low-end EF1 strength as it uprooted trees EF1 damage continued south of Turner, as it uprooted more trees before weakening back to EF0 strength as it entered the west side of Helena, causing minor roof damage to homes and downing trees Mainly shingle, siding, and fence damage was noted in this area, though a house that was under construction collapsed The tornado then intensified to EF1 strength once again as it moved through the north side of Helena A few homes along Cunningham Lane sustained partial roof loss, and one home in town sustained destruction of its front porch overhang The tornado briefly weakened back to EF0 strength before strengthening more significantly at the north edge of Pelham, reaching EF2 intensity as it moved directly through a residential neighborhood Several homes were significantly damaged along Crosscreek Trail and Wilderness Road, including a few that had their roofs ripped off, and at least two that had an exterior wall knocked down Trees were uprooted or severely damaged as well The tornado then continued northeast at EF1 strength,

affected the Birmingham area lifted, the same supercell produced another strong tornado, which touched down southeast of Ragland along Boiling Springs Road at about 2:31 p.m CDT (19:31 UTC) It quickly intensified to high-end EF2 intensity as it moved northeast, snapping or uprooting dozens of trees, damaging the roof of a metal building, and obliterating a mobile home along Simpson Bend Road Continuing at high-end EF2 strength, the tornado caused major damage in the small community of Macon, destroying several mobile homes, ripping the roofs off of several residences while knocking down some exterior walls, and snapping or uprooting numerous trees Maintaining its strength, the tornado crossed Ragan Chapel Road, destroying two mobile homes and inflicting major roof damage to a frame home Northeast of this location, the tornado reached its peak intensity as it destroyed Precision Materials, a manufacturing facility housed in a large metal warehouse building southwest of Ohatchee The building was almost totally collapsed, with severe twisting and buckling of metal support beams noted, and damage in this area was rated low-end EF3 The tornado caused more high-end EF2 damage as it crossed SR 77, destroying multiple mobile homes, a church, and a large outbuilding One of the fatalities occurred in this area along Mudd Street, where a very small and unanchored home collapsed, while the others occurred in mobile homes The tornado also downed many trees and snapped power poles, shattered windows, and ripped large sections of roofing off of multiple houses along this segment of the path before continuing to the northeast It then weakened to high-end EF1 strength as it moved northeastward through the southern and eastern fringes of Ohatchee Trees, mobile homes, outbuildings, and houses in and around Ohatchee all sustained damage as the tornado approached and crossed SR 144 As it passed near Grayton, it briefly regained EF2 intensity, snapping trees and destroying four mobile homes A few other residences and mobile homes in the area were also damaged to a lesser extent The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength and continued to snap trees and cause roof damage to homes as it approached the western side of Wellington Homes, outbuildings, and trees were moderately damaged in Wellington as the tornado crossed US 431 before it reached EF2 intensity for a third time east of the highway along Wellington Road, destroying more mobiles homes and snapping more trees One residence had its roof torn off and exterior walls collapsed, two more were shifted off their foundations, and several others had their roofs ripped off Several barns and outbuildings were also destroyed, and a few vehicles were flipped in this area as well [74]

SR 17 and moved northeastward, downing trees at EF1 strength The first area of significant damage along the path occurred just northeast of this point along County Road 35, where a mobile home was completely destroyed at high-end EF2 intensity The tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached and crossed County Road 28, quickly reaching its peak intensity and completely destroying a house at mid-range EF3 intensity, which was left with only one wall standing Fields near this home were strewn with structural debris, and many trees were denuded and debarked, with a wide swath of forest containing hundreds of trees mowed down Outbuildings and mobile homes were also destroyed in this area, and a few other frame homes were severely damaged It widened and weakened back to EF2 intensity as it approached SR 14 Continuing northeastward, the large tornado crossed SR 14 between Sawyerville and Greensboro at EF2 strength, destroying mobile homes and outbuildings, and mowing down large swaths of trees North of SR 14, five Y-shaped metal transmission towers were downed The tornado then briefly reached low-end EF3 strength again as a large swath of trees was completely flattened near Brown Road Just past this area, the tornado weakened back to EF2 intensity, and along County Road 21, a mobile home was obliterated and the remnants were swept away A nearby house lost its roof and several exterior walls as well The tornado continued at EF2 intensity to the northeast of Greensboro, snapping trees and impacting numerous houses, barns, and outbuildings as it approached then crossed SR 69 A couple of houses sustained complete roof loss and partial collapse of some walls in this area Farther along the path, a swath of particularly severe of tree damage near County Road 32 was rated EF3 EF2 damage continued just to the northeast near County Road 86 and SR 25, and several site-built homes and mobile homes were damaged One house was pushed entirely off its foundation, and another sustained collapse of several outer walls.\n\n\nFranklin–Newnan–Peachtree City, Georgia\nThis very large, violent nighttime tornado caused severe damage in the southern suburbs of Atlanta It first touched down in western Heard County at 11:37 p.m EDT (03:37 UTC) and tracked east-northeastward along SR 34 northeast of Texas, initially causing only minor EF0 to EF1 tree damage as it passed north of Viola It widened and intensified before moving into Franklin, causing high-end EF2 damage in the downtown area Multiple businesses were heavily damaged, metal beams were twisted at a large industrial building, which lost its roof and a wall, and some other metal buildings were damaged to a lesser degree A gas station awning and a semi-trailer were blown over as well Homes were damaged in residential areas of Franklin, and two had their roofs torn off Sheds and detached garages were destroyed, and many trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged throughout the town This included a few pine trees that sustained some low-end debarking [1] The tornado weakened back to EF1 strength and narrowed as it crossed US 27 and exited Franklin It continued to parallel GA 34 as it approached the county line, snapping and uprooting trees in a heavily forested area The tornado crossed into Coweta County at 11:54 p.m EDT (03:54 UTC) and began to move toward Newnan Along JD Walton Road, EF1 damage continued as the tornado destroyed an outbuilding and uprooted and snapped numerous trees As it crossed Smokey Road, Holbrook Road, and Victorian Lane, the tornado began to widen again and reached low-end EF2 intensity, snapping many large trees and causing roof and window damage to homes as it entered more populated areas at the southwestern edge of Newnan The most intense damage in this area occurred in the Mountain Creek and Woodlawn Farms subdivisions The tornado then grew tremendously and reached EF3 intensity as it moved across Timberland Trail and Smokey Ridge Drive, damaging or destroying numerous homes as it moved through multiple subdivisions Many homes sustained roof loss and collapse of exterior walls, and one home was left with only its back wall standing Severe tree damage occurred in this area, cars were flipped, and a gas station awning was shredded [74] The first of three tornado emergencies was then issued at 12:06 a.m EDT (04:06 UTC) as a large debris signature appeared on radar [88] [89] [90]\n\n\nPreparations and impact\nOn the morning of March 25, 2021, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency for 46 counties as the National Weather Service predicted a major severe weather outbreak and possible tornado outbreak [93]\n\n\nNon-tornadic effects\nDuring the event there were 298 and 198 filtered reports of wind damage and large hail respectively [97] On March 27, there was widespread wind and hail damage recorded from Texas to North Carolina with 2 in (5.1 cm) hail being recorded as far east as Rose Hill, North Carolina [98] Across the Delaware Valley on April 28, 60–70 mph (97–113 km/h) wind gusts blew down numerous trees and power lines resulting in numerous power outages One person suffered minor injuries when a barn was blown over near Gap, Pennsylvania [99] New York City approached wind gusts of 50 mph (80 km/h) during record warm temperatures, [100] resulting in both the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and Bayonne Bridge closing due to the high winds [101] High winds across the Northeast led to over 78,000 customers losing power [102] Flooding also closed portions of I-65 in Cullman County, Alabama [103]\n\n\nTennessee flooding\nAlong with the severe and tornadic weather, training thunderstorm also produced widespread flooding occurred in Middle Tennessee on March 27–28, especially in Franklin and Nashville Before the storm, a rare flash flood emergency was issued [104] Over 10 inches (250 mm) of rain was reported in Franklin while 7 inches (180 mm) of rain fell in Nashville and nearby Murfreesboro This made it the highest single-day March rainfall on record, and the second highest two-day rainfall event on record for Nashville The Harpeth River reached major flood stage in Franklin trapping people in their homes on Hillsboro road In Nashville, seven people were killed and cars were trapped on I-24 The storms and tornadoes from March 25 left saturated ground, setting the stage for flooding after heavy rain all day on March 27 [105] Damage due to the flooding totaled to $28.021 million [106]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Tamil_Nadu", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name is derived from Tamil language with nadu meaning \"land\" and Tamil Nadu meaning \"the land of Tamils\" The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it [6] In the ancient Sangam literature, Tamilakam refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh Tolkāppiyam (2nd to 1st century BCE) indicates the borders of Tamilakam as Tirumala and Kanniyakumari [7] The name Tamilakam is used in other Sangam era literature such as Puṟanāṉūṟu, Patiṟṟuppattu, Cilappatikaram, and Manimekalai [8] Cilappatikaram (5th to 6th century CE) and Ramavataram (12th century CE) mention the name Tamil Nadu to denote the region [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence points to the region being inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago [12] [13] Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago [14] Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language [15] [16] Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain [17] Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE [18] Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which might be a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later [19]\n\n\nPrehistory (before 5th century BCE)\nArchaeological evidence points to the region being inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago

triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas [22] The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta The kings called Vendhar ruled over several tribes of Velala (peasants), headed by the Velir chiefs [23] The rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolkāppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar [24]\n\n\nMedieval era (4th–13th century CE)\nAround the 7th century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas, who patronised Buddhism and Jainism before the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement [33] Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital [34] The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture: the massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples, originated with the Pallava architecture They built the group of rock-cut monuments in Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram [35] Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas and Pandyas The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the 6th century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas [36] The Pallavas were finally defeated by Chola prince Aditya I in the 9th century CE [37]\n\n\nVijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE)\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate [46] The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in 1336 CE [47] The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates [48] [49]\nLater, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent [50] [51] They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai [52]\n\n\nLater conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE)\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks [53] The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751–1752) [54] [55] [56] This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom [57]\n\n\nPost-Independence (1947–present)\nAfter the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala Andhra state was split from the state in 1953 and the state was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape [84] [85] On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\" [86] [87] In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi [88] After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates from the 1970s, due to reform-oriented economic policies [89] In the 2000s, the state has become one of the most urbanized states in the country with a higher Human Development Index compared to national average [90]\n\n\nEnvironment\nTamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km2 (50,216 sq mi) and is the tenth-largest state in India [90] Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula [91] Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry  It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast [92] [93] The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea [94]\n\n\nGeography\nTamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km2 (50,216 sq mi) and is the tenth-largest state in

mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea [94]\n\n\nGeology\nTamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II and III [106] The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan plateau were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago [107] Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table [108] The predominant soils of Tamil Nadu are red loam, laterite, black, alluvial and saline Red soil, with a higher iron content, occupies a larger portion of the state and all the inland districts Black soil is found in western Tamil Nadu and parts of the southern coast Alluvial soil is found in the fertile Kaveri delta region, with laterite soil found in pockets, and saline soil across the coast where the evaporation is high [109]\n\n\nClimate\nThe region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall [110] Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri delta [111] A tropical wet and dry climate prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above 18 °C (64 °F); summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding 50 °C (122 °F); and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between 750 and 1,500 mm (30 and 59 in) across the region Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry [112] A hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats which includes inland south and south central parts of the state and gets between 400 and 750 millimetres (15.7 and 29.5 in) of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around 20–24 °C (68–75 °F) The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around 32 °C (90 °F), with 320 millimetres (13 in) precipitation Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture [113]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nForests occupy an area of 22,643 km2 (8,743 sq mi) constituting 17.4% of the geographic area [124] There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in Tamil Nadu, resulting from its varied climates and geography Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior [125] The southern Western Ghats have rain forests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests [126] The Western Ghats eco-region is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site [127] There are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu, 5640 species of angiosperms (including 1,559 species of medicinal plants, 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants, 230 red-listed species), 64 species of gymnosperms (including four indigenous species and 60 introduced species) and 184 species of pteridophytes apart from bryophytes, lichen, fungi, algae, and bacteria [128] Common plant species include the state tree: palmyra palm, eucalyptus, rubber, cinchona, clumping bamboos (Bambusa arundinacea), common teak, Anogeissus latifolia, Indian laurel, grewia, and blooming trees like Indian laburnum, ardisia, and solanaceae Rare and unique plant life includes Combretum ovalifolium, ebony (Diospyros nilagrica), Habenaria rariflora (orchid), Alsophila, Impatiens elegans, Ranunculus reniformis, and royal fern [129]\n\n\nAdministration and politics\nChennai is the capital of the state and houses the state executive, legislative and head of judiciary [157] The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments There are 43

Tamil Nadu was dominated by national parties till the 1960s Regional parties have ruled ever since The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency [184] During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E V Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency and led to the formation of the Justice party [185] The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the chief minister of the Madras Presidency [184] In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics [186] After independence, the Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi [187] [188] C N Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949 [189]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs per the 2011 census,

[264]\n\n\nLiterature\nTamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era [6] Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India [265] [266] [267] This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam, and the epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai [268] The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE [269] [270] The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku consisting of Eṭṭuttokai and the Pattupattu, and the Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book Naṉṉūl based on the Tolkāppiyam Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu, sol, poruḷ, yāppu,

are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex [287] The gopuram's origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram [35] The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance [288] [289] The state emblem also features the Lion Capital of Ashoka with an image of a Gopuram on the background [290] Vimanam are similar structures built over the garbhagriha or inner

officially known as the State of Tamil Nadu, is a state in southern India. It is the eleventh largest state in India by area and the sixth most populous state. Tamil Nadu is the second-largest state in India by economy, after Maharashtra. The state is bounded by the states of Kerala to the west, Karnataka to the northwest, Andhra Pradesh to the north and northeast, and the union territory of Puducherry to the east. The state is also the second-largest state in terms of GDP, after Maharashtra. Tamil Nadu is a major agricultural producer in India and is known for its rich cultural heritage and ancient history.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Tamil Nadu is derived from the Tamil language, with \"nadu\" meaning \"land\" or \"region\" and \"Tamil\" referring to the Tamil people. The origin of the word \"Tamil\" is unclear, with multiple theories. The earliest known reference to the name \"Tamil\" is found in the Tamil Sangam literature, which dates back to the 2nd century BCE.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Tamil Nadu dates back to the prehistoric era, with evidence of human habitation dating back to over 400 millennia. The region has been inhabited by various cultures and civilizations, including the Indus Valley Civilization and the Neolithic people. The Sangam period is considered the golden age of Tamil literature and culture, with the three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams being held during this time.\n\nTamil Nadu was a major power in the ancient world, with the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms vying for power. The Cholas rose to prominence in the 9th century CE and established the Chola Empire, which lasted for over 200 years. The Cholas were known for their naval power and their conquests of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Chola Empire declined in the 13th century CE, and the region was divided between the Pandya and the Pallava kingdoms. The Pandyas were revived in the 12th century CE, and the region was reunified under the Pandya rule. The region was later conquered by the Vijayanagara Empire, which lasted for over 200 years.\n\nThe Vijayanagara Empire was eventually defeated by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates. The Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region and established their own kingdoms. The Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent of these kingdoms.\n\nLater, the Mughal Empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly. This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.\n\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Andhra state was split from the state in 1953, and the state was further reorganized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape. On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\".\n\nPrehistory (before 5th century BCE)\n\nArchaeological evidence points to the region being inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago. Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago. Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language.\n\nExcavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Further epigraphic inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE.\n\nSangam period (5th century BCE–3rd century CE)\n\nThe Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE, with the main source of history during the period coming from the Sangam literature. Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas, and Pandyas. The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilakam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta.\n\nThe rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism, and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature, with the oldest surviving work being Tolkāppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar.\n\nMedieval era (4th–13th century CE)\n\nAround the 7th century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas, who patronised Buddhism and Jainism before the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement. The Pallavas, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital, were noted for their patronage of architecture, including the massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples.\n\nThe state was divided between the Pallavas and Pandyas, with the Pallavas ruling Kanchipuram and the Pandyas ruling Madurai. The Pallavas were eventually defeated by Chola prince Aditya I in the 9th century CE.\n\nVijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE)\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate. The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in 1336 CE and eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates.\n\nLater, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region and established their own kingdoms, with the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur being the most prominent.\n\nLater conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE)\n\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks. The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly. This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom.\n\nAfter the independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Andhra state was split from the state in 1953, and the state was further reorganized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape.\n\nOn 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\".\n\nPost-Independence (1947–present)\n\nAfter the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. The state was reorganized several times, with the final reorganization in 1956 resulting in the state taking its current shape.\n\nIn 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose, which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi.\n\nAfter independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment.\n\nAdministration\n\nChennai is the capital of the state and houses the state executive, legislative, and head of judiciary. The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments. The state is divided into 38 districts, each of which is administered by a District Collector, who is an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) appointed to the district by the government of Tamil Nadu.\n\nGeography\n\nTamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km² (50,216 sq mi) and is the tenth-largest state in India.

multiple cities", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tamil_Nadu\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name is derived from Tamil language with nadu meaning \"land\" and Tamil Nadu meaning \"the land of Tamils\" The origin and precise etymology of the word Tamil is unclear with multiple theories attested to it [6] In the ancient Sangam literature, Tamilakam refers to the area of present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh Tolkāppiyam (2nd to 1st century BCE) indicates the borders of Tamilakam as Tirumala and Kanniyakumari [7] The name Tamilakam is used in other Sangam era literature such as Puṟanāṉūṟu, Patiṟṟuppattu, Cilappatikaram, and Manimekalai [8] Cilappatikaram (5th to 6th century CE) and Ramavataram (12th century CE) mention the name Tamil Nadu to denote the region [9] [10] [11]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological evidence points to the region being inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago [12] [13] Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago [14] Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language [15] [16] Excavations at Keezhadi have revealed a large urban settlement, with the earliest artefact dated to 580 BCE, during the time of urbanization in the Indo-Gangetic plain [17] Further epigraphical inscriptions found at Adichanallur use Tamil Brahmi, a rudimentary script dated to 5th century BCE [18] Potsherds uncovered from Keeladi indicate a script which might be a transition between the Indus Valley script and Tamil Brahmi script used later [19]\n\n\nPrehistory (before 5th century BCE)\nArchaeological evidence points to the region being inhabited by hominids more than 400 millennia ago [12] [13] Artifacts recovered in Adichanallur by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a continuous history from more than 3,800 years ago [14] Neolithic celts with the Indus script dated between 1500 and 2000 BCE indicate the use of the Harappan language [15] [16] Excavations at Keezhadi have

script used later [19]\n\n\nSangam period (5th century BCE–3rd century CE)\nThe Sangam period lasted for about eight centuries, from 500 BCE to 300 CE with the main source of history during the period coming from the Sangam literature [20] [21] Ancient Tamilakam was ruled by a triumvirate of monarchical states, Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas [22] The Cheras controlled the western part of Tamilkam, the Pandyas controlled the south, and the Cholas had their base in the Kaveri delta The kings called Vendhar ruled over several tribes of Velala (peasants), headed by the Velir chiefs [23] The rulers patronized multiple religions including vedic religion, Buddhism and Jainism and sponsored some of the earliest Tamil literature with the oldest surviving work being Tolkāppiyam, a book of Tamil grammar [24]\n\n\nMedieval era (4th–13th century CE)\nAround the 7th century CE, the Kalabhras were overthrown by the Pandyas and Cholas, who patronised Buddhism and Jainism before the revival of Saivism and Vaishnavism during the Bhakti movement [33] Though they existed previously, the period saw the rise of the Pallavas in the sixth century CE under Mahendravarman I, who ruled parts of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital [34] The Pallavas were noted for their patronage of architecture: the massive gopuram, ornate towers at the entrance of temples, originated with the Pallava architecture They built the group of rock-cut monuments in Mahabalipuram and temples in Kanchipuram [35] Throughout their reign, the Pallavas remained in constant conflict with the Cholas and Pandyas The Pandyas were revived by Kadungon towards the end of the 6th century CE and with the Cholas in obscurity in Uraiyur, the Tamil country was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas [36] The Pallavas were finally defeated by Chola prince Aditya I in the 9th century CE [37]\n\n\nVijayanagar and Nayak period (14th–17th century CE)\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, there were repeated attacks from Delhi Sultanate [46] The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded in 1336 CE [47] The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by a confederacy of Deccan sultanates [48] [49]\nLater, the Nayaks, who were the military governors in the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region amongst whom the Nayaks of Madurai and Nayaks of Thanjavur were the most prominent [50] [51] They introduced the palayakkararar system and re-constructed some of the well-known temples in Tamil Nadu including the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai [52]\n\n\nLater conflicts and European colonization (17th to 20th century CE)\nIn the 18th century, the Mughal empire administered the region through the Nawab of the Carnatic with his seat at Arcot, who defeated the Madurai Nayaks [53] The Marathas attacked several times and defeated the Nawab after the Siege of Trichinopoly (1751–1752) [54] [55] [56] This led to a short-lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom [57]\n\n\nPost-Independence (1947–present)\nAfter the Independence of India in 1947, the Madras Presidency became Madras state, comprising present-day Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala Andhra state was split from the state in 1953 and the state was further re-organized when states were redrawn linguistically in 1956 into the current shape [84] [85] On 14 January 1969, Madras state was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\" [86] [87] In 1965, agitations against the imposition of Hindi and in support of continuing English as a medium of communication arose which eventually led to English being retained as an official language of India alongside Hindi [88] After independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economy of Tamil Nadu consistently exceeded national average growth rates from the 1970s, due to reform-oriented economic policies [89] In the 2000s, the state has become one of the most urbanized states in the country with a higher Human Development Index compared to national average [90]\n\n\nEnvironment\nTamil Nadu covers an area of 130,058 km2 (50,216 sq mi) and is the tenth-largest state in India [90] Located on the south-eastern coast of the Indian peninsula, Tamil Nadu is straddled by the Western Ghats and Deccan Plateau in the west, the Eastern Ghats in the north, the Eastern Coastal Plains lining the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait to the south-east, and the Laccadive Sea at the southern cape of the peninsula [91] Politically, Tamil Nadu is bound by the Indian states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, and the union territory of Puducherry  It shares an international maritime border with the Northern Province of Sri Lanka at Pamban Island The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast [92] [93] The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea [94]\n\n\nGeography\nTamil Nadu covers an area of

mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in Zones II and III [106] The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan plateau were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago [107] Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table [108] The predominant soils of Tamil Nadu are red loam, laterite, black, alluvial and saline Red soil, with a higher iron content, occupies a larger portion of the state and all the inland districts Black soil is found in western Tamil Nadu and parts of the southern coast Alluvial soil is found in the fertile Kaveri delta region, with laterite soil found in pockets, and saline soil across the coast where the evaporation is high [109]\n\n\nClimate\nThe region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall [110] Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: northeast, northwest, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and Kaveri delta [111] A tropical wet and dry climate prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above 18 °C (64 °F); summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding 50 °C (122 °F); and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between 750 and 1,500 mm (30 and 59 in) across the region Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry [112] A hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats which includes inland south and south central parts of the state and gets between 400 and 750 millimetres (15.7 and 29.5 in) of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around 20–24 °C (68–75 °F) The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around 32 °C (90 °F), with 320 millimetres (13 in) precipitation Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture [113]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nForests occupy an area of 22,643 km2 (8,743 sq mi) constituting 17.4% of the geographic area [124] There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in Tamil Nadu, resulting from its varied climates and geography Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior [125] The southern Western Ghats have rain forests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests [126] The Western Ghats eco-region is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site [127] There are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu, 5640 species of angiosperms (including 1,559 species of medicinal plants, 533 endemic species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants, 230 red-listed species), 64 species of gymnosperms (including four indigenous species and 60 introduced species) and 184 species of pteridophytes apart from bryophytes, lichen, fungi, algae, and bacteria [128] Common plant species include the state tree: palmyra palm, eucalyptus, rubber, cinchona, clumping bamboos (Bambusa arundinacea), common teak, Anogeissus latifolia, Indian laurel, grewia, and blooming trees like Indian laburnum, ardisia, and solanaceae Rare and unique plant life includes Combretum ovalifolium, ebony (Diospyros nilagrica), Habenaria rariflora (orchid), Alsophila, Impatiens elegans, Ranunculus reniformis, and royal fern [129]\n\n\nAdministration and politics\nChennai is the capital of the state and houses the state executive, legislative and head of judiciary [157] The administration of the state government functions through various secretariat departments There are 43 departments of the state and the departments have further sub-divisions which may govern various undertakings and boards [158] The state is divided into 38 districts, each of which is administered by a District Collector, who is an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) appointed to the district by the Government of Tamil Nadu For revenue administration, the districts are further subdivided into 87 revenue divisions administered by Revenue Divisional Officers (RDO) which comprise 310 taluks administered by Tahsildars [159] The

Tamil Nadu was the first state to establish town panchayats as a new administrative unit [162] [163] [164] [160]\n\n\nLegislature\nIn accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head and appoints the chief minister who has the de facto executive authority [165] [166] The Indian Councils Act 1861 established the Madras Presidency legislative council with four to eight members but was a mere advisory body to the governor of the presidency The strength was increased to twenty in 1892 and fifty in 1909 [167] [168] Madras legislative council was set-up in 1921 by the Government of India Act 1919 with a term of three years and consisted of 132 Members of which 34 were nominated by the Governor and the rest were elected [169] The Government of India Act 1935 established a bicameral legislature with the creation of a new legislative council with 54 to 56 members in July 1937 [169] The first legislature of Madras state under the Constitution of India was constituted on 1 March 1952 after the 1952 elections The number of seats post the re-organization in 1956 was 206, which was further increased to 234 in 1962 [169] In 1986, the state moved to a unicameral legislature with the abolition of the Legislative Council by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council (Abolition) act, 1986 [170] The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly is housed in the Fort St George in Chennai [171] The state elects 39 members to the Lok Sabha and 18 to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament [172]\n\n\nLaw and order\nThe Madras High Court was established on 26 June 1862

[183] Politics in Tamil Nadu was dominated by national parties till the 1960s Regional parties have ruled ever since The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency [184] During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E V Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency and led to the formation of the Justice party [185] The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the chief minister of the Madras Presidency [184] In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics [186] After independence, the Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi [187] [188] C N Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949 [189]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs per

Tamil Nadu [263] Palani Panchamirtham, Ooty varkey, Kovilpatti Kadalai Mittai, Manapparai Murukku and Srivilliputhur Palkova are unique foods that have been recognised as Geographical Indications [264]\n\n\nLiterature\nTamil Nadu has an independent literary tradition dating back over 2500 years from the Sangam era [6] Early Tamil literature was composed in three successive poetic assemblies known as the Tamil Sangams, the earliest of which, according to legend, were held on a now vanished continent far to the south of India [265] [266] [267] This includes the oldest grammatical treatise, Tolkappiyam, and the epics Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai [268] The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date from around the 3rd century BCE [269] [270] The available literature from the Sangam period was categorised and compiled into two categories based roughly on chronology: the Patiṉeṇmēlkaṇakku consisting of Eṭṭuttokai and the Pattupattu, and the Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku The existent Tamil grammar is largely based on the 13th-century grammar book Naṉṉūl based on the Tolkāppiyam Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely eḻuttu, sol, poruḷ, yāppu, aṇi [271] [272] Tirukkural, a book on ethics by Thiruvalluvar, is amongst the most popular works of Tamil literature [273]\n\n\nArchitecture\nDravidian architecture is the distinct style of rock architecture in Tamil Nadu [284] In Dravidian architecture, the temples consisted of porches or mantapas preceding the door leading to the sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple, and pillared halls used for many purposes  These features are the invariable accompaniments of these temples Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the kalyani or pushkarni [285] The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature of koils and Hindu temples of the Dravidian style [286] They are topped by the kalasam, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex [287] The gopuram's origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram [35] The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance [288] [289] The state emblem also features the Lion Capital of Ashoka with an image of a Gopuram on the background [290] Vimanam are similar structures built over the garbhagriha or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture with a few exceptions including the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur [291] [292]\n\n\nArts\nTamil Nadu is a major centre for music, art and dance in India [297] Chennai is called the cultural capital of South India [298] In the Sangam era, art forms were classified into: iyal (poetry), isai (music) and nadakam (drama) [299] Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form that originated in Tamil Nadu and is one of the oldest dances of India [300] [301] [302] Other regional folk dances include Karakattam, Kavadi, Koodiyattam, Oyilattam, Paraiattam and Puravaiattam [303] [304] [305] [306] The dance, clothing, and sculptures of Tamil Nadu exemplify the beauty of the body and motherhood [307] Koothu is an ancient folk art, where artists tell stories from the epics accompanied by dance and music [308] [309]\n\n\nFestivals\nPongal is a major and multi-day harvest festival celebrated by Tamils [330] It is observed in the month of Thai according to the Tamil solar calendar and usually falls on 14 or 15 January [331] It is dedicated to the Surya, the Sun God and the festival is named after the ceremonial \"Pongal\", which means \"to boil, overflow\" and refers to the traditional dish prepared from the new harvest of rice boiled in milk with jaggery offered to Surya [332] [333] [334] Mattu Pongal is

{"title": "Roman_Abramovich", "content": "\nEarly life\nRoman Arkadyevich Abramovich was born on 24 October 1966 in Saratov, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union (present-day Saratov, Russia) His mother, Irina (1939−1967), was a music teacher who died when Abramovich was one year old [12] His father, Aaron Abramovich Leibovich (1937−1969), who was of Jewish descent, [13] worked in the economic council of the Komi ASSR, [14] and died when Roman was three [12] Roman's maternal grandparents were Ukrainian Jews Vasily Mikhailenko and Faina Borisovna Grutman It was to Saratov in the early days of World War II that Roman's maternal grandmother fled from Ukraine Irina was then three years old [15] Roman's paternal grandparents, Nachman Leibovich and Toybe (Tatyana) Stepanovna Abramovich, were Belarusian Jews [15] They lived in Belarus and, after the revolution, [which?] moved to Tauragė, Lithuania, [16] [17] [18] with the Lithuanian spelling of the family name being Abramavičius.\n\n\nCareer\nAbramovich entered the business world during his army service [21] He first worked as a street-trader, and then as a mechanic at a local factory [citation needed] Abramovich attended the Gubkin Institute of Oil and Gas in Moscow, [22] then traded commodities for the Swiss trading firm Runicom [23]\n\n\nBusiness career\nAbramovich entered the business world during his army service [21] He first worked as a street-trader, and then as a mechanic at a local factory [citation needed] Abramovich attended the Gubkin Institute of Oil and Gas in Moscow, [22] then traded commodities for the Swiss trading firm Runicom [23]\n\n\nFriendship with Boris Berezovsky\nAccording to two different sources, Abramovich first met Berezovsky either at a meeting with the Russian businessmen in 1993 [28] or in the summer of 1995 [29]\n\n\nAcquisition of Sibneft, loans-for-shares, and aluminium wars\nIn 1995, Abramovich and Berezovsky acquired a controlling interest in the large oil company Sibneft in a rigged auction [30] The deal took place within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100 million for half of the company, above the stake's stock market value of US$150 million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, to suggest that the real cost of the company should have been in the billions of dollars (it was worth US$2.7 billion at that time) [31] [32] [30] Abramovich later admitted in court that he paid billions of dollars of bribes to government officials and gangsters to acquire and protect his assets [33] As of 2000, Sibneft annually produced US$3 billion worth of oil [34]\n\n\nRelationship with Boris Berezovsky and Badri Patarkatsishvili\nIn 2011, Abramovich's longtime business partner filed a civil suit, Berezovsky v Abramovich, [40] in the High Court of Justice in London He accused Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract The suit sought over £3 billion in damages [41]\n\n\nEvidence in the case\nIn 2011, a transcript emerged of a taped conversation that took place between Abramovich and Berezovsky at Le Bourget airport in December 2000 Badri Patarkatsishvili, a close acquaintance of Berezovsky, was also present and secretly had the conversation recorded [43] [44] During the discussion, Berezovsky spoke of how they should \"legalise\" their aluminium business, and later claimed in court that he was an undisclosed shareholder in the aluminium assets and that \"legalisation\" in this case meant to make his ownership \"official\" In response, Abramovich states in the transcript that they cannot legalise because the other party in the 50–50 joint venture (Rusal) would need to do the same, in a supposed reference to his business partner Oleg Deripaska Besides Deripaska, references are made to several other players in the aluminium industry at the time that would have had to \"legalise\" their stake Abramovich's lawyers later claimed that \"legalisation\" meant structuring protection payments to Berezovsky to ensure they complied with Western antimoney-laundering regulations [45] [46]\n\n\nInvestments in technology\nIn 2015, Abramovich invested and led a $30 million round of funding with businessman OD Kobo Chairman of PIR Equities [47] [48] Other partners include several well-known people from the music industry, among them David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, Tiësto, Avicii, will.i.am, Benny Andersson, Dave Holmes and others

skin peeling They all recovered quickly Bellingcat investigated the allegation and said that chocolate or water that the three had consumed may have been laced with poison; experts took samples of the substance but were unable to identify the type of material used owing to the passage of time Western sources said the low dosage of poison was aimed to serve as a warning, most likely to Abramovich, and suspected the attack may have been carried out by hardliners in Moscow who tried to sabotage peace talks [101] [102] [103] [104] An unnamed US official said that the illness was caused by \"environmental factors\" rather than poisoning Additionally, an official in the Ukrainian president's office, Igor Zhovkva, informed the BBC that while he hadn't spoken to Mr Abramovich, participants of the Ukrainian delegation were \"fine\" and one had said the story was \"false\" [104] Frank Gardiner of the BBC said the US denial may be caused by a reluctance to respond in a retaliatory manner to Russia by accepting the deployment of chemical weapons in Ukraine [104] A spokesman for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had no information about a suspected poisoning

[30] The deal took place within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100 million for half of the company, above the stake's stock market value of US$150 million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, to suggest that the real cost of the company should have been in the billions of

their aluminium business, and later claimed in court that he was an undisclosed shareholder in the aluminium assets and that \"legalisation\" in this case meant to make his ownership \"official\" In response, Abramovich states in the transcript that they cannot legalise because the other party in the 50–50 joint venture (Rusal) would need to do the same, in a supposed reference to his business partner Oleg Deripaska Besides Deripaska, references are made to several other players in the aluminium industry at the time that would have had to \"legalise\" their stake Abramovich's lawyers later

sponsorship deal worth €41.3 million (US$58 million) with the Russian team CSKA Moscow [73] Although the company explained that the decision was made at management level, some viewed the deal as an attempt by Abramovich to counter accusations of being \"unpatriotic\" which were made at the time of the Chelsea purchase UEFA rules prevent one person owning more than one team participating in UEFA competitions, so Abramovich has no equity interest in CSKA A lawyer, Alexandre Garese, is one of his partners in CSKA.\n\n\nRussian national team\nAbramovich also played a large role in bringing Guus

its founder, Yuri Konoplev [78]\n\n\nPolitical career\n\"Everyone's got their own reason Some believe it's because I spent some of my childhood in the far north that I helped Chukotka, some believe it's because I had a difficult childhood that I helped Chukotka, some believe it's because I stole money that I helped Chukotka None of these is real When you come out and you see a situation and there are 50,000 people, you want to do something I haven't seen anything worse than what I saw there in my life.\"\n\n\nInformal Ukraine diplomacy\nThe day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

or water that the three had consumed may have been laced with poison; experts took samples of the substance but were unable to identify the type of material used owing to the passage of time Western sources said the low dosage of poison was aimed to serve as a warning, most likely to Abramovich, and suspected the attack may have been carried out by hardliners in Moscow who tried to sabotage peace talks [101] [102] [103] [104] An unnamed US official said that the illness was caused by \"environmental factors\" rather than poisoning Additionally, an official in the Ukrainian president's office, Igor Zhovkva, informed the BBC that while he hadn't spoken to Mr Abramovich, participants of the Ukrainian delegation were \"fine\" and one had said the story was \"false\" [104] Frank Gardiner of the BBC said the US denial may be caused by a reluctance to respond in a retaliatory manner to Russia by accepting the deployment of chemical weapons in Ukraine [104] A spokesman for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had no information about a suspected poisoning [105]\n\n\nRelationship with Russian leaders\nBy 1996, at the age of 30, Abramovich had become close to President Boris

any suspicion [143]\n\n\nControversy in Portugal\nIn April 2021, Abramovich became a Portuguese citizen as part of the country's Nationality Act; his genealogy was vetted by experts who look for

through and through, but there's an additional scene that we filmed that was scripted  [...] We ended up lifting it when I became more confident of where we're going to pick up in the next movie  [Ends], it felt it didn't feel authentic to where we're going to go So we lifted it.\", referring to the ending scene where Michael suddenly kills Karen [62] The alternate ending involves Laurie attempting to call Karen - initially unaware of what just happened - only for Michael to pick up and, upon hearing his breathing on the phone and knowing Karen is dead, warns that she is coming for him She then takes the knife from her bedside and leaves the hospital determined to find him The ending would have suggested the sequel would take place the same night as Kills (in 2018), instead of

to a major book distribution warehouse in Roseburg, Oregon Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado [23] The company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos's house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994 [24] The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially

some offer international shipping [49]\n\n\nMerchant partnerships\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website The company was later awarded $51 million in damages [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nPrivate-label products\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019 These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18% [80] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials [81]\n\n\nThird-party sellers\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon [82] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price [83]\n\n\nAffiliate program\nPublishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs [84] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads [85] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission [86]\n\n\nProduct reviews\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \".. the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse) If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews [88]\n\n\nAmazon sales rank\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon [91] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists [91] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales [92] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors [93] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR, [94] though Amazon states:\n\n\nPhysical stores\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle The store was 5,500 square feet and prices for all products matched those on its website [96] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017; [97] media speculation at the time suggested that Amazon planned to eventually roll out 300 to 400

culture\nDuring his tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett [181] These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus [181] [182] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, \"customer obsession\") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address [183] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\" This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS [citation needed]\n\n\nLobbying\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively

warehouse conditions for workers; [194] actively opposing unionization efforts; [195] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination; [196] [197] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content [198] [199] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel, anti-LGBT merchandise, and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities An article published by Time in the wake of social media website Parler's termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet [200] In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon [201] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap have countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products [202] [203]\n\n\nSee

Bezos also considered several other options, including Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThe company, originally named Cadabra, was founded in the converted garage of Bezos's house for symbolic reasons and was renamed to Amazon in November 1994. The Amazon website launched for public sales on July 16, 1995, and initially sourced its books directly from wholesalers and publishers.\n\n### 2010-Present\n\nIn 2010, Amazon expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of products beyond books, such as electronics, clothing, and home goods. In 2017, Amazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain for $13.7 billion, expanding its presence in the grocery market. Today, Amazon is the leading e-retailer in the United States, with approximately $178 billion in net sales in 2017.\n\nProducts and Services\n---------------------\n\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies. Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the U.S and amazon.co.uk for UK) though some offer international shipping.\n\nMerchant Partnerships\n--------------------\n\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity.\n\nPrivate-Label Products\n---------------------\n\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019.\n\nThird-Party Sellers\n------------------\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon. Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers.\n\nAffiliate Program\n----------------\n\nPublishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.\n\nProduct Reviews\n----------------\n\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity.\n\nAmazon Sales Rank\n-----------------\n\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.\n\nHardware and Services\n---------------------\n\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music, and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\n\nSubsidiaries\n------------\n\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), One Medical, Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.\n\nOperations\n----------\n\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include Amazon Logistics (AMZL), which is a carrier that provides transportation for Amazon packages. Amazon Logistics uses a combination of company-owned vehicles and third-party carriers to provide transportation.\n\nSupply Chain\n------------\n\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs.\n\nCorporate Affairs\n-----------------\n\nAs of June 2022, Amazon's board of directors were:\n\n* Jeff Bezos, Chairman\n* Andrew Jassy, President and Chief Executive Officer\n* Judith A.

These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus.\n\nLobbying\n---------\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property.\n\nCriticism\n----------\n\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools, forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA, leading customers away from bookshops, adversely impacting the environment, placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers, actively opposing unionization

service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website The company was later awarded $51 million in damages [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nPrivate-label products\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019 These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18% [80] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials [81]\n\n\nThird-party sellers\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon [82] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price [83]\n\n\nAffiliate program\nPublishers can sign up as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs [84] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads [85] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission [86]\n\n\nProduct reviews\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \".. the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse) If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews [88]\n\n\nAmazon sales rank\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon [91] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists [91] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales [92] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors [93] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR, [94] though Amazon states:\n\n\nPhysical stores\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle The store was 5,500 square feet and prices for all products matched those on its website [96] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017; [97] media speculation at the time suggested that Amazon planned to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country [96] All of its locations were closed in 2022 along with other retail locations under the \"Amazon 4-Star\" brand [98]\n\n\nHardware and services\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music, and Prime Video for

computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role:

tenure, Jeff Bezos had become renowned for his annual shareholder letters, which have gained similar notability to those of Warren Buffett [181] These annual letters gave an \"invaluable window\" into the famously \"secretive\" company, and revealed Bezos's perspectives and strategic focus [181] [182] A common theme of these letters is Bezos's desire to instill customer-centricity (in his words, \"customer obsession\") at all levels of Amazon, notably by making all senior executives field customer support queries for a short time at Amazon call centers He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address [183] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\" This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS [citation needed]\n\n\nLobbying\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5 million, $5 million and $9.5 million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively [184] In 2019, it spent $16.8 million and had a team of 104 lobbyists [185]\n\n\nCriticism\nAmazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools; [190] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA; [191] leading customers away from bookshops; [192] adversely impacting the environment; [193] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers; [194] actively opposing unionization efforts; [195] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination; [196] [197] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content [198] [199] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel, anti-LGBT merchandise, and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities An article published by Time in the wake of social media website Parler's termination of service by Amazon Web Service highlights the power companies like Amazon now have over the internet [200] In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon [201] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap have countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products [202] [203]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

Launched in 2015 by Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, Discord has grown into a massive platform with over 150 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord's concept originated from Jason Citron's experience in the gaming industry, where he had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games. After selling OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for $104 million, Citron went on to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012. Their first product, Fates Forever, was a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that, although unsuccessful, helped pave the way for Discord's development.\n\nThe Features of Discord\n------------------------\n\nDiscord is centered around managing communities, providing various tools for communication, collaboration, and socialization. Key features include:\n\n*   **Voice and Video Calls**: Discord allows users to engage in voice and video conversations, either one-on-one or in groups.\n*   **Persistent Chat Rooms**: Users can participate in chat rooms, which can be categorized and sorted for ease of use.\n*   **Direct Messages**: Users can send direct messages to other users, either privately or in groups.\n*   **Server Management**: Users can create, manage, and customize servers, including setting up roles, channels, and permissions.\n\nServers on Discord\n------------------\n\nDiscord communities are organized into discrete collections of channels called servers. Although referred to as \"servers\" on the front end, they are called \"guilds\" in the developer documentation to distinguish them from actual servers. Users can create servers for free, manage their public visibility, and create voice channels, text channels, and categories to sort the channels into. Most servers have a limit of 250,000 members, but this limit can be raised if the server owner contacts Discord.\n\nChannel Types\n-------------\n\nChannels on Discord can be used for various purposes, including voice chat and streaming, instant messaging, and file sharing. Users can create different types of channels, such as:\n\n*   **Voice Channels**: For voice chat and streaming.\n*   **Text Channels**: For instant messaging and file sharing.\n*   **Category Channels**: For organizing and sorting channels.\n\nUser Profiles\n-------------\n\nUsers register for Discord with an email address and must create a username. Until mid-2023, users were assigned a four-digit number called a \"discriminator\" (colloquially a \"Discord tag\"), prefixed with \"#\", which was added to the end of their username. This system was changed to a handle-based system in May 2023, removing the discriminator from usernames. Users selected their new usernames in priority based on how early they registered for Discord, Nitro status, and ownership of partner and verified servers.\n\nVideo Calls and Streaming\n-------------------------\n\nVideo calling and screen sharing were added to Discord in October 2017, allowing users to create private video calls with up to 10 users. Later, due to the increased popularity of video calling during the COVID-19 pandemic, the limit was increased to 50 users.\n\nDigital Distribution\n-------------------\n\nDiscord launched a games storefront beta in August 2018, allowing users to purchase a curated set of games through the service. This includes a \"First on Discord\" featured set of games that their developers attest to Discord's help in getting launched, giving these games 90 days of exclusivity on the Discord marketplace. Discord Nitro subscribers will also gain access to a rotating set of games as part of their subscription.\n\nDeveloper Tools and Bots\n-------------------------\n\nDiscord introduced its GameBridge API in December 2016, which allows game developers to directly integrate with Discord within games. This has enabled developers to create custom bots and integrate Discord with their games, providing a seamless experience for players.\n\nUnofficial Extensions\n--------------------\n\nAlthough Discord disallows modifications, many unofficial extensions have been created. BetterDiscord is an open-source desktop modification that allows various plugins to be installed. These plugins augment existing functionality or add features that are not offered by Discord.\n\nInfrastructure\n-------------\n\nDiscord is a persistent group chat software, based on an eventually consistent database architecture. The infrastructure was migrated to ScyllaDB when it reached a trillion messages.\n\nMonetization\n------------\n\nWhile the software itself comes at no cost, the developers investigated ways to monetize it, with potential options including paid customization options such as emoji or stickers.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nDiscord has been widely adopted since its launch in 2015. By January 2016, Hammer & Chisel reported Discord had been used by 3 million people, with growth of 1 million per month, reaching 11 million users in July that year. By December 2016, the company reported it had 25 million users worldwide. By the end of 2017, the service had drawn nearly 90 million users, with roughly 1.5 million new users each week.\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\n---------------------------\n\nDiscord has had problems with hostile behavior and abuse within chats, with some communities of chat servers being \"raided\" (a large number of users joining a server) by other communities. This includes flooding chats with controversial topics related to race, religion, politics, and pornography. Discord has stated that it has plans to implement changes that would \"rid the platform of the issue.\"\n\nCyberbullying and Moderation\n---------------------------\n\nDiscord has had problems with hostile behavior and abuse within chats, with some communities of chat servers being \"raided\" (a large number of users joining a server) by other communities. This includes flooding chats with controversial topics related to race, religion, politics, and pornography.\n\nData Privacy\n------------\n\nIn September 2024, the Federal Trade Commission released a report summarizing 9 company responses (including from Discord) to orders made by the agency pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 to provide information about user and non-user data collection (including of children and teenagers) and data use by the companies that found that the companies' user and non-user data practices put individuals vulnerable to identity

His creators aimed to showcase Bane as a formidable and intimidating character, capable of taking on even the toughest opponents. As a result, Bane is a highly skilled fighter and gunslinger, with a reputation for being ruthless and merciless.\n\n**Characterization**\n\nThe official Star Wars Databank describes Cad Bane as \"a ruthless bounty hunter\" and \"the preeminent blaster-for-hire in the galaxy.\" He is a cold, calculating, and selfish individual who will stop at nothing to achieve his objectives. Bane has no qualms about harming and murdering innocents and even children in pursuit of his quarry. His lack of morality and disregard for collateral damage have earned him a reputation as one of the galaxy's most notorious mercenaries.\n\nBane's character has been developed to be a foil to the more heroic characters in the Star Wars universe. He is often at odds with Boba Fett, who is seen as a more honorable and skilled bounty hunter. Bane's actions and motivations are driven by a desire for power and wealth, rather than any sense of duty or loyalty.\n\n**Appearances**\n\nCad Bane made his debut in the season one finale of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, where he leads a group of bounty hunters in infiltrating the Senate building on Coruscant. Bane's plan to hold a group of Republic senators hostage to demand the release of Ziro the Hutt is successful, despite the efforts of Anakin Skywalker to stop them.\n\nBane has also appeared in several other animated series, including The Bad Batch and The Book of Boba Fett. In The Bad Batch, Bane is hired by Prime Minister Lama Su to retrieve the unaltered clone Omega, who has escaped from Kamino with a group of elite clone troopers. Bane's attempts to capture Omega are thwarted by Fennec Shand and the Clone Force 99.\n\nIn The Book of Boba Fett, Bane is hired by the Pyke Syndicate to aid in their takeover of Tatooine. Bane's actions are instrumental in the Pyke's victory, but he is ultimately defeated by Boba Fett, who overpowers him with a Tusken gaffi stick.\n\n**Comics**\n\nCad Bane has also appeared in several comic book series, including the five-part Marvel Comics miniseries Star Wars: Darth Maul. In this series, Bane aids the titular character in kidnapping a Jedi Padawan. Bane's first appearance in comics is in Star Wars: Darth Maul issue #2.\n\n**Legends**\n\nIn April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the rest of the franchise by Lucasfilm. Cad Bane has appeared in several comics and video games set in the Legends continuity.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nCad Bane has been featured in several Hasbro toys, including ones concerning himself, his blaster, and his ship. Bane has also appeared in a crossover toy with Transformers. Both Cad Bane and his speeder were included as part of the Lego Star Wars toy line.\n\n**Appearance and Reception**\n\nCad Bane was featured in a 2009 article by UGO Networks, where he was described as \"quintessentially cold, cruel, and calculating.\" IGN listed him as the 31st top Star Wars character, praising his first impression and saying his creators succeeded in introducing \"an inarguably cool and effective villain.\" IGN also noted that Bane continued to be an excellent foil to the main protagonists in his later appearances.\n\nEric Goldman, writing for IGN, said that Bane was a successful attempt at creating a new ongoing villain. Goldman also called Bane's introduction and his torture of Bolla Ropal (a Jedi) two of The Clone Wars's darkest moments, adding that Bane lived up to the hype that surrounded him in his introduction.\n\nChristian Bauvelt, writing for Entertainment Weekly's PopWatch, said that one of the three top reasons the \"Evil Plans\" episode worked for him was because Cad Bane appeared in it, and noted Bane's similarities to Angel Eyes from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCad Bane is a ruthless and cunning bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe.

This definition was a significant event in the history of the Catholic Church and was met with controversy and opposition from many within the Church and outside of it.\n\n**Elizabeth II**\n\nThe phrase was brought to prominence by Queen Elizabeth II in a speech at Guildhall on 24 November 1992, marking her Ruby Jubilee on the throne. In the speech, the Queen described the year 1992 as her \"annus horribilis,\" citing a series of challenges and controversies that had faced the British royal family. These challenges included the separation of Charles and Diana, the Queen's own health issues, and the economic crisis that was affecting the UK.\n\n**1992**\n\nThe year 1992 was a difficult one for the British royal family. The separation of Charles and Diana was a major challenge, and the Queen's own health issues were a concern. The economic crisis that was affecting the UK was also a significant challenge, and the Queen's speech at Guildhall was seen as an attempt to reassure the public that the royal family was doing everything it could to address these challenges.\n\n**2019**\n\n2019 was described by some commentators as a second \"annus horribilis\" for the British royal family. In January of that year, 97-year-old Prince Philip crashed his car into another carrying two women and a baby, and subsequently surrendered his driving license. Later in the year, the Queen was involved in a constitutional crisis when Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised her to prorogue Parliament, a recommendation which was later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Prince Andrew also gave a universally-criticized BBC Newsnight interview about his relationship with convicted child-sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and there was increased tabloid scrutiny regarding rifts between the Cambridge and Sussex households.\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nThe phrase \"annus horribilis\" has also been used to describe other years that have been marked by significant challenges and controversies. In 1998, Time magazine described the year in Russian politics as an \"annus horribilis\" due to Boris Yeltsin's isolationist and militarist policies, the East Asian financial crisis, and Western countries cutting off the reform money that they gave to the Russian government in prior years.\n\n**Boris Yeltsin**\n\nThe year 1998 was a difficult one for Russian politics. Boris Yeltsin's policies were widely criticized, and the country was facing significant economic challenges. The East Asian financial crisis was also having a major impact on Russia, and the country was struggling to recover from the effects of the crisis.\n\n**Ben Affleck**\n\nIn 2003, Hollywood actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck described the year as his \"annus horribilis.\" Affleck had starred in the films Daredevil and Gigli, both of which received negative reviews from critics. Gigli, in particular, was a box office bomb and drew particular ire from Hollywood critics and moviegoers, culminating in six wins at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards.\n\n**Kofi Annan**\n\nIn 2004, Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, used the phrase to describe the year. In a year-end press conference, Annan reflected on the challenges that had faced the United Nations, including allegations of corruption in the UN's Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. He also spoke of upheaval and violence in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Palestine, and Sudan; the ongoing process of UN internal reform; and \"persistent...criticism against the UN\" and himself personally.\n\n**Juan Carlos I**\n\nIn 2007, the Spanish royal family, in particular King Juan Carlos I, faced a difficult year. Family tragedy and a series of controversies led Spanish newspapers to refer to the year as the king's \"annus horribilis.\" The king's family had been facing significant challenges, including a scandal surrounding the king's son-in-law, and the king himself had been under fire for his decision to attend a hunting trip while his son was in the hospital.\n\n**COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nThe year 2020 was widely remarked as being an \"annus horribilis\" for the entire world in general, most notably due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide throughout 2020. The pandemic had a major impact on economies, societies, and individuals around the world, and it was characterized by widespread lockdowns, travel restrictions, and significant economic disruption.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of annus horribilis years\n* British royal family controversies\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\n**References**\n\n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Annus_horribilis\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigin of phrase\nThe phrase \"annus horribilis\" was used in 1891 in an Anglican publication to describe 1870, the year in which the dogma of papal infallibility was defined in the Catholic Church [1]\n\n\nElizabeth II\nThe expression was brought to prominence by Queen Elizabeth II In a speech at Guildhall on 24 November 1992, marking her Ruby Jubilee on the throne, she said: [2]\n\n\n1992\nThe expression was brought to prominence by Queen Elizabeth II In a speech at Guildhall on 24 November 1992, marking her Ruby Jubilee on the throne, she said: [2]\n\n\n2019\n2019 was described by some commentators as a second annus horribilis for the British royal family In January that year, 97-year-old Prince Philip crashed his car into another carrying two women and a baby, and subsequently surrendered his driving licence Later on in August, the Queen was involved in a constitutional crisis when Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised her to prorogue Parliament, a recommendation which was later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom Prince Andrew gave a universally-criticised BBC Newsnight interview about his relationship with convicted child-sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, [5] and there was increased tabloid scrutiny regarding rifts between the Cambridge and Sussex households [5]\n\n\nOther uses\nTime magazine described 1998 in Russian politics as an annus horribilis because of Boris Yeltsin's isolationist and militarist policies, the East Asian financial crisis, and Western countries cutting off the reform money that they gave to the Russian government in prior years [6]\n\n\nBoris Yeltsin\nTime magazine described 1998 in Russian politics as an annus horribilis because of Boris Yeltsin's isolationist and militarist policies, the East Asian financial crisis, and Western countries cutting off the reform money that they gave to the Russian government in prior years [6]\n\n\nBen Affleck\nHollywood actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck once described that the year 2003 was his annus horribilis [7] Affleck starred in the films Daredevil and Gigli, both of which received negative reviews from critics Gigli bombed in the box office and drew particular ire from Hollywood critics and moviegoers, which culminated in six wins at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards In addition, Affleck and his fiancée and later second wife, Jennifer Lopez, were mocked and criticised by the public for their seemingly accommodating attitudes to and henceforth over-exposure in the tabloid media [citation needed]\n\n\nKofi Annan\nKofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, used the phrase in his year-end press conference on 21 December 2004 He reflected: \"There's no doubt that this has been a particularly difficult year, and I am relieved that this annus horribilis is coming to an end.\" [8] His remarks were widely interpreted as having alluded to persistent allegations of corruption in the UN's Iraq Oil-for-Food Program [9] He also spoke of upheaval and violence in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Palestine, and Sudan; the ongoing process of UN internal reform; and \"persistent...criticism against the UN\" and himself personally [8] [9] Annan's remarks came five days before the deadliest event of the year (and one of the deadliest natural disasters in history), the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December, when 227,898 people died.\n\n\nJuan Carlos I\nIn 2007, the Spanish royal family, in particular King Juan Carlos I, faced a difficult year Family tragedy and a series of controversies led Spanish newspapers to refer to the year as the king's annus horribilis [10]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nThe year 2020 was widely remarked as being an annus horribilis for the entire world in general, most notably due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide throughout 2020 [12] [13] [14] 2020 was also awarded a \"Special Governors' Award for The Worst Calendar Year EVER!\" at the 41st Golden Raspberry Awards At the end of the year, Netflix released Death to 2020, a mockumentary discussing the events of the year.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on November 14, 1948, in Pimpri Meghe, Wardha district, India, she was known for her selfless efforts to provide a home and love to those who had been abandoned by their families.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSapkal was born to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder, in a poor family. She was referred to as \"Chindhi\" (Marathi for \"piece of rag\") due to being an unwanted child. Her family struggled with poverty, and Sapkal was forced to quit formal education after passing the fourth standard. At the age of 12, she was married off to Shrihari Sapkal, who was 20 years older than her, and moved to Nawargaon, Seloo in Wardha.\n\nThe marriage was short-lived, and at the age of 20, Sapkal was violently forced out of her home by her husband, leaving her to care for a daughter. This traumatic experience marked a turning point in her life, and she began to focus on helping others who were in similar situations.\n\n**Early Work with Adivasis**\n\nSapkal later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging for food to survive. During this period, she realized that there were many children abandoned by their parents, and she decided to adopt them as her own. She had to beg even harder to feed her growing family, which included the children she had adopted. However, this selfless act brought her great joy, and she continued to care for the children, eventually giving away her own daughter to the Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai trust of Pune to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her own child and the adopted children.\n\n**Orphanages**\n\nSapkal devoted herself to caring for orphaned children, and as a result, she was fondly called \"Mai,\" which means \"mother.\" She nurtured over 1,500 orphaned children, and through them, she had a grand family of 382 sons-in-law and 49 daughters-in-law. Her selfless work earned her numerous awards, which she used to buy land to create a home for the orphaned children.\n\n**Organisations**\n\nSapkal's organization, the Sindhutai Sapkal Foundation, continued her work after her passing. The foundation provides shelter, education, and medical care to orphaned children, and it has become a model for similar organizations across India. Sapkal's legacy extends beyond her work with orphaned children; she also inspired countless people to become social workers and philanthropists.\n\n**Awards**\n\nSapkal received over 700 awards for her work, including the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian awards. Her dedication to helping others was recognized by the government, and she was honored with numerous awards at the state and national levels.\n\n**Film**\n\nThe 2010 Marathi film \"Mee Sindhutai Sapkal\" by Anant Mahadevan is a biopic inspired by the true story of Sindhutai Sapkal. The film was selected for a world premiere at the 54th London Film Festival, and it has become a popular film in India.\n\n**TV Serial**\n\nThe 2023 Marathi TV serial \"Sindhutai Majhi Mai\" aired on Colors Marathi and is also inspired by the true story of Sindhutai Sapkal. The serial has been well-received by audiences, and it has helped to raise awareness about the importance of social work and philanthropy.\n\n**Death**\n\nSapkal died of a heart attack on January 4, 2022, at the age of 73, in Pune, Maharashtra.

out who I was.\" [237] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize

musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé [233] [234] In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyoncé: \"Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles\" [235] She revealed during Oprah's Next Chapter that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label [236] According to Rihanna, \"I felt like they were giving me a blueprint  [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was.\" [237] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005) [238] She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound [239]\n\n\nLegacy\nRihanna is regarded by the media as a pop and fashion icon, particularly since her third studio album Good Girl Gone Bad (2007) [262] [263] [264] [265] [266] Nick

He first appeared in Thor: God of Thunder #2 (January 2013) as a mortal who becomes a powerful villain, determined to kill all the gods in the Marvel Universe.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nGorr the God Butcher was created by writer Jason Aaron and artist Esad Ribic as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative. He first appeared in Thor: God of Thunder #2 (January 2013) and has since become a central character in the Thor comic book series.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nGorr grew up on a barren planet where he was exposed to a harsh environment and experienced the loss of his family at a young age. This traumatic event led him to question the existence of gods, and he became determined to kill them all. He sought out the All-Black the Necrosword, a powerful symbiotic weapon forged by Knull, the progenitor of the Klyntar species. With the Necrosword, Gorr set out to eliminate the gods, starting with Thor, the God of Thunder.\n\nGorr's campaign against the gods spanned centuries, and he eventually brought Thor into a dark future where he was the last Asgardian defending the realm against the shadow berserkers. Gorr's ultimate goal was to force Thor to witness the results of his efforts, but Thor was able to escape and join forces with his other selves to mount a new attack.\n\nHowever, when Gorr killed his wife for calling him her god, his \"son,\" a construct made out of All-Black the Necrosword, released Thor the Avenger from captivity and asked him to kill his father. Thor, driven by a sense of outrage and disgust, accepted the challenge and dove into the heart of the Godbomb, wielding both his Mjolnir and the Mjolnir of his older self. The prayers of all the gods from across time gave Thor the power to absorb the blast, and he ultimately killed Gorr with the two Mjolnirs.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nGorr is a mortal who does not have superhuman abilities. However, he later enters into possession of the symbiotic weapon \"All-Black the Necrosword,\" which is forged from the head of a slain Celestial. The blade is incredibly powerful and has a connection to the alien symbiote that spawned Venom. Gorr uses the Necrosword to kill the gods, and its power grows stronger with each victim.\n\nThe Necrosword is also banished into a black hole, but an elderly King Thor uses it to battle Galactus. The blade is capable of carving the first dawn from the stone of the endless night, and its power is rivaled only by the might of the gods themselves.\n\n**Reception**\n\nGorr the God Butcher has been well-received by fans and critics alike. He is considered one of Thor's most powerful and well-regarded villains, and his campaign against the gods has left a lasting impact on the Marvel Universe. His ghostly appearance and the connection to the Necrosword have made him a compelling and formidable foe.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nGorr the God Butcher has been praised for his complexity and depth as a character. He is a nuanced and multi-dimensional villain who is driven by a sense of trauma and loss. His actions are motivated by a desire to kill the gods, but his methods are also driven by a sense of morality and justice.\n\nGorr's character has been compared to other villains in the Marvel Universe, including Thanos and Magneto. However, his unique blend of power and vulnerability sets him apart from other characters in the Marvel Universe.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nGorr the God Butcher has received several accolades for his portrayal in the Thor comic book series. He has been praised for his complexity and depth as a character, and his campaign against the gods has left a lasting impact on the Marvel Universe.\n\nGorr's character has also been featured in several spin-off comics and graphic novels, including Thor: God of Thunder and Thor: The God Butcher.

{"title": "Northern_Ireland", "content": "\nHistory\nThe region that is now Northern Ireland was long inhabited by native Gaels who were Irish-speaking and predominantly Catholic [36] It was made up of several Gaelic kingdoms and territories and was part of the province of Ulster In 1169, Ireland was invaded by a coalition of forces under the command of the English crown that quickly overran and occupied most of the island, beginning 800 years of foreign central authority Attempts at resistance were swiftly crushed everywhere outside of Ulster Unlike in the rest of the country, where Gaelic authority continued only in scattered, remote pockets, the major kingdoms of Ulster would mostly remain intact with English authority in the province contained to areas on the eastern coast closest to Great Britain English power gradually eroded in the face of stubborn Irish resistance in the centuries that followed; eventually being reduced to only the city of Dublin and its suburbs When Henry VIII launched the 16th century Tudor re-conquest of Ireland, Ulster once again resisted most effectively In the Nine Years' War (1593–1603), an alliance of Gaelic chieftains led by the two most powerful Ulster lords, Hugh Roe O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill, fought against the English government in Ireland The Ulster-dominated alliance represented the first Irish united front; prior resistance had always been geographically localized Despite being able to cement an alliance with Spain and major victories early on, defeat was virtually inevitable following England's victory at the siege of Kinsale In 1607, the rebellion's leaders fled to mainland Europe alongside much of Ulster's Gaelic nobility Their lands were confiscated by the Crown and colonized with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in the Plantation of Ulster This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns and created a lasting Ulster Protestant community with ties to Britain The Irish Rebellion of 1641 began in Ulster The rebels wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantation It developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics and British Protestant settlers and became part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–53), which ended with the English Parliamentarian conquest Further Protestant victories in the Williamite-Jacobite War (1688–91) solidified Anglican Protestant rule in the Kingdom of Ireland The Williamite victories of the siege of Derry (1689) and Battle of the Boyne (1690) are still celebrated by some Protestants in Northern Ireland [37] Many more Scots Protestants migrated to Ulster during the Scottish famine of the 1690s.\n\n\nHome Rule Crisis\nBy the late 19th century, a large and disciplined cohort of Irish Nationalist MPs at Westminster committed the Liberal Party to \"Irish Home Rule\"—self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom This was bitterly opposed by Irish Unionists, most of whom were Protestants, who feared an Irish devolved government dominated by Irish nationalists and Catholics The Government of Ireland Bill 1886 and Government of Ireland Bill 1893 were defeated However, Home Rule became a near-certainty in 1912 after the Government of Ireland Act 1914 was first introduced The Liberal government was dependent on Nationalist support, and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords from blocking the bill indefinitely [40]\n\n\nPartition of Ireland\nBy the end of the war (during which the 1916 Easter Rising had taken place), most Irish nationalists now wanted full independence rather than home rule In September 1919, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George tasked a committee with planning another home rule bill Headed by English unionist politician Walter Long, it was known as the 'Long Committee' It decided that two devolved governments should be established—one for the nine counties of Ulster and one for the rest of Ireland—together with a Council of Ireland for the \"encouragement of Irish unity\" [49] Most Ulster unionists wanted the territory of the Ulster government to be reduced to six counties so that it would have a larger Protestant unionist majority, which they believed would guarantee its longevity The six counties of Antrim, Down, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh comprised the maximum area unionists believed they could dominate [50] The area that was to become Northern Ireland included counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, even though they had nationalist majorities in the 1918 Irish general election [51]\n\n\n1925–1965\nNorthern Ireland's border was drawn to give it \"a decisive Protestant majority\" At the time of its creation, Northern Ireland's population was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Catholic [20] Most Protestants were unionists/loyalists who sought to maintain Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, while most Catholics were Irish nationalists/republicans who sought an independent United Ireland There was mutual self-imposed segregation in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics such as in education, housing, and often employment [67]\n\n\nThe Troubles\nThe Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed [82] with over 50,000 casualties [83] From 1969 to 2003 there were over 36,900 shooting incidents and over 16,200 bombings or attempted bombings associated with The Troubles [31] The conflict was caused by escalating tensions between the Irish nationalist minority and the dominant unionist majority; Irish nationalists object to Northern Ireland staying within the United Kingdom [84] From 1967 to 1972 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which modelled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of civil resistance to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home [85]\n\n\nPeace process\nThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"Good Friday Agreement\") This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the \"Irish nation\" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2) [89]\n\n\nExecutive crisis 2022–2024\nOn 3 February 2022, Paul Givan resigned as first minister, which automatically resigned Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and collapsed the executive of Northern Ireland [96] On 30 January 2024, leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons [97]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions Unionists are predominantly Ulster Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, and Huguenot settlers as well as Gaels who converted to one of the Protestant denominations Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the Scottish Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (1921–1972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s [98]\n\n\nBackground\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is

Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (1921–1972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s [98]\n\n\nGovernance\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has had devolved government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the Northern Ireland Assembly and a cross-community government (the Northern Ireland Executive) The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for reserved and excepted matters Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future Excepted matters (such as international relations, taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North/South Ministerial Council, which coordinates areas of cooperation (such as agriculture, education, and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Additionally, \"in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland\", the Government of Ireland and Government of the United Kingdom co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference.\n\n\nDescriptions\nThere is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is It has been described as a country, province, region, and other terms officially, by the press, and in common speech The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal one's political preferences [16] This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nAlternative names\nMany people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called \"Derry\" or \"Londonderry\".\n\n\nUnionist\nThe volcanic activity which created the Antrim

Ireland has a temperate maritime climate, (Cfb in the Köppen climate classification) rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is very common across the region The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5 °C (43.7 °F) in January and 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) in July The highest maximum temperature recorded was 31.4 °C (88.5 °F), registered in July 2021 at Armagh Observatory's weather station [133] The lowest minimum temperature recorded was −18.7 °C (−1.7 °F) at Castlederg, County Tyrone on 23 December 2010 [134]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUntil the end of the Middle Ages, the land was heavily forested Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, elm, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew and holly [135] Today, only 8% of Northern Ireland is woodland, and most of this is non-native conifer plantations [136]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County

Protestant/other Christian, 41% as Roman Catholic, 0.8% as other religions, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one [160] In terms of background (i.e religion or religion brought up in), at the 2021 census 45.7% of the population came from a Catholic background, 43.5% from a Protestant background, 1.5% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds [159] This was the first time since Northern Ireland's creation that there were more people from a Catholic background than Protestant [161] At the 2011 census, 48% came from a Protestant background, 45% from a Catholic background, 0.9% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds [160]\n\n\nLanguages\nIrish is an official language of Northern Ireland as of 6 December 2022 when the Irish Language Act (Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022) became law The Irish Language Act officially repealed legislation from 1737 that banned the use of Irish in courts [1] English is a de facto official language [citation needed] English is also spoken as a first language by 95.4% of the Northern Ireland population [177] \n\nEnglish\nAccording to the 2021 census, in 94.74% of households, all people aged 16 and above spoke English as their main language [180] The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language [181] There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, for instance; the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \"aitch\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \"haitch\", as in Hiberno-English [182] However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.\n\n\nIrish\nThe Irish language (Irish: an Ghaeilge), or Gaelic, is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland [183] It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics) However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival [184]\n\n\nUlster Scots\nUlster Scots comprises varieties of the Scots language spoken in Northern Ireland For a native English speaker, \" [Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary.\" [192]\n\n\nSign languages\nThe most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL) However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin [citation needed] where Irish Sign Language (ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.\n\n\nEducation\nUnlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school, many children sit entrance examinations for grammar schools Integrated schools, which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic, and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system In the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are Gaelscoileanna (Irish language-medium schools).\n\n\nHealth care\nSince 1948 Northern Ireland has a health care system similar to England, Scotland and Wales, though it provides not only health care, but also social care Health care performance has been decreasing since the mid-2010s and reached crisis levels since 2022 [202]\n\n\nEconomy\nNorthern Ireland traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably featuring shipbuilding, rope manufacture, and textiles In 2019, 53% of GVA was generated by services, 22% by the public sector, 15% by production, 8% by construction and 2% by agriculture [203]\n\n\nInfrastructure and transportation\nNorthern Ireland has underdeveloped transport infrastructure, with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry, and Craigavon Northern Ireland is served by three airports—Belfast International near Antrim, George Best Belfast City integrated into the railway network at Sydenham in East Belfast, and City of Derry in County Londonderry There are upgrade plans to transform the railway network in Northern Ireland including new lines from Derry to Portadown and Belfast to Newry, though it will take the best part of 25 years to deliver [215] There are major seaports at Larne and Belfast which carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\nCulture\nNorthern Ireland shares both the culture of Ulster and the culture of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nSymbols\nNorthern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916, [222] is flown in some republican areas Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies [223]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nThe BBC has a division called BBC Northern Ireland with headquarters in Belfast and operates BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland As well as broadcasting standard UK-wide programmes, BBC NI produces local content, including a news break-out called BBC Newsline The ITV franchise in Northern Ireland is UTV The state-owned Channel 4 and the privately owned Channel 5 also broadcast in Northern Ireland Access is also available to satellite and cable services [233] All Northern Ireland viewers must obtain a UK TV licence to watch live television transmissions or use BBC iPlayer.\n\n\nSports\nMany sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with a single governing body or team for the whole island [243] The most notable exception is association football (soccer), which has a separate governing body, league and national team for Northern Ireland [243] [244]\n\n\nSee also\n54°37′N 6°37′W﻿ / ﻿54.61°N 6.62°W﻿ / 54.61;

Ireland\n\nIntroduction\n\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, located in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It has a complex and often contentious history, which has shaped its identity and politics. The region has a distinct culture, with a mix of Irish, British, and Ulster-Scots influences.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region that is now Northern Ireland was long inhabited by native Gaels who were Irish-speaking and predominantly Catholic. It was made up of several Gaelic kingdoms and territories and was part of the province of Ulster. In 1169, Ireland was invaded by a coalition of forces under the command of the English crown that quickly overran and occupied most of the island, beginning 800 years of foreign central authority. Attempts at resistance were swiftly crushed everywhere outside of Ulster. Unlike in the rest of the country, where Gaelic authority continued only in scattered, remote pockets, the major kingdoms of Ulster would mostly remain intact with English authority in the province contained to areas on the eastern coast closest to Great Britain. English power gradually eroded in the face of stubborn Irish resistance in the centuries that followed; eventually being reduced to only the city of Dublin and its suburbs.\n\nWhen Henry VIII launched the 16th century Tudor re-conquest of Ireland, Ulster once again resisted most effectively. In the Nine Years' War (1593–1603), an alliance of Gaelic chieftains led by the two most powerful Ulster lords, Hugh Roe O'Donnell and Hugh O'Neill, fought against the English government in Ireland. The Ulster-dominated alliance represented the first Irish united front; prior resistance had always been geographically localized. Despite being able to cement an alliance with Spain and major victories early on, defeat was virtually inevitable following England's victory at the siege of Kinsale. In 1607, the rebellion's leaders fled to mainland Europe alongside much of Ulster's Gaelic nobility. Their lands were confiscated by the Crown and colonized with English-speaking Protestant settlers from Britain, in the Plantation of Ulster. This led to the founding of many of Ulster's towns and created a lasting Ulster Protestant community with ties to Britain.\n\nThe Irish Rebellion of 1641 began in Ulster, with the rebels wanting an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantation. It developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics and British Protestant settlers and became part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–53), which ended with the English Parliamentarian conquest. Further Protestant victories in the Williamite-Jacobite War (1688–91) solidified Anglican Protestant rule in the Kingdom of Ireland. The Williamite victories of the siege of Derry (1689) and Battle of the Boyne (1690) are still celebrated by some Protestants in Northern Ireland.\n\nHome Rule Crisis\n\nBy the late 19th century, a large and disciplined cohort of Irish Nationalist MPs at Westminster committed the Liberal Party to \"Irish Home Rule\"—self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. This was bitterly opposed by Irish Unionists, most of whom were Protestants, who feared an Irish devolved government dominated by Irish nationalists and Catholics. The Government of Ireland Bill 1886 and Government of Ireland Bill 1893 were defeated. However, Home Rule became a near-certainty in 1912 after the Government of Ireland Act 1914 was first introduced. The Liberal government was dependent on Nationalist support, and the Parliament Act 1911 prevented the House of Lords from blocking the bill indefinitely.\n\nPartition of Ireland\n\nBy the end of the war (during which the 1916 Easter Rising had taken place), most Irish nationalists now wanted full independence rather than home rule. In September 1919, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George tasked a committee with planning another home rule bill, known as the 'Long Committee'. It decided that two devolved governments should be established—one for the nine counties of Ulster and one for the rest of Ireland—together with a Council of Ireland for the \"encouragement of Irish unity\". Most Ulster unionists wanted the territory of the Ulster government to be reduced to six counties so that it would have a larger Protestant unionist majority, which they believed would guarantee its longevity. The six counties of Antrim, Down, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone, and Fermanagh comprised the maximum area unionists believed they could dominate. The area that was to become Northern Ireland included counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, even though they had nationalist majorities in the 1918 Irish general election.\n\n1925–1965\n\nNorthern Ireland's border was drawn to give it \"a decisive Protestant majority\". At the time of its creation, Northern Ireland's population was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Catholic. Most Protestants were unionists/loyalists who sought to maintain Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, while most Catholics were Irish nationalists/republicans who sought an independent United Ireland. There was mutual self-imposed segregation in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics, such as in education, housing, and often employment.\n\nThe Troubles\n\nThe Troubles, which started in the late 1960s, consisted of about 30 years of recurring acts of intense violence during which 3,254 people were killed, with over 50,000 casualties. From 1967 to 1972, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), which modeled itself on the US civil rights movement, led a campaign of civil resistance to anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and electoral procedures. The franchise for local government elections included only rate-payers and their spouses, and so excluded over a quarter of the electorate. While the majority of disenfranchised electors were Protestant, Catholics were over-represented since they were poorer and had more adults still living in the family home.\n\nPeace process\n\nThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organizations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and sensitive border areas, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"Good Friday Agreement\"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which had never before been fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the \"Irish nation\" to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2).\n\nExecutive crisis 2022–2024\n\nOn 3 February 2022, Paul Givan resigned as first minister, which automatically resigned Michelle O'Neill as deputy first minister and collapsed the executive of Northern Ireland. On 30 January 2024, leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom. These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions. Unionists are predominantly Ulster Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, and Huguenot settlers as well as Gaels who converted to one of the Protestant denominations. Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the Scottish Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism.\n\nGovernance\n\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has had devolved government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the Northern Ireland Assembly and a cross-community government (the Northern Ireland Executive). The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for reserved and excepted matters. Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly at some time in the future. Excepted matters (such as international relations, taxation, and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution. On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland.\n\nDescriptions\n\nThere is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is. It has been described as a country, province, region, and other terms officially, by the press, and in common speech. The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal one's political preferences.\n\nAlternative names\n\nMany people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view. Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres. The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called \"Derry\" or \"Londonderry\".\n\nUnionist\n\nThe volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north Antrim coast. Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple, and the Glens of Antrim. Northern Ireland was covered by an ice sheet for most of the last ice age and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of drumlins in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim, and particularly Down.\n\nNationalist\n\nThe volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north Antrim coast.

The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5°C (43.7°F) in January and 17.5°C (63.5°F) in July. The highest maximum temperature recorded was 31.4°C (88.5°F), registered in July 2021 at Armagh Observatory's weather station. The lowest minimum temperature recorded was -18.7°C (-1.7°F) at Castlederg, County Tyrone on 23 December 2010.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nUntil the end of the Middle Ages, the land was heavily forested. Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, elm, rowan, and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such as Scots pine, yew, and holly. Today, only 8% of Northern Ireland is woodland, and most of this is non-native conifer plantations.\n\nDemographics\n\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry, and County Tyrone.\n\nCounties\n\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry, and County Tyrone.\n\nCities and major towns\n\nThe population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978. The population at the time of the 2021 census was 1.9 million, having grown 5% over the previous decade. The population in 2011 was 1.8 million, a rise of 7.5% over the previous decade. The current population makes up 2.8% of the UK's population (67 million) and 27% of the island of Ireland's population (7.03 million). The population density is 135 inhabitants/km2.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978.

The population density is 135 inhabitants/km2.\n\nIdentity and citizenship\n\nIn Northern Ireland censuses, respondents can choose more than one national identity. In 2021, 42.3% of the population identified as Roman Catholic, 37.3% as Protestant/other Christian, 1.3% as other religions, while 17.4% identified with no religion or did not state one. The biggest of the Protestant/other Christian denominations were the Presbyterian Church (16.6%), the Church of Ireland (11.5%), and the Methodist Church (2.3%). At the 2011 census, 41.5% of the population identified as Protestant/other Christian, 41% as Roman Catholic, 0.8% as other religions, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one.\n\nLanguages\n\nIrish is an official language of Northern Ireland as of 6 December 2022, when the Irish Language Act (Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022) became law. The Irish Language Act officially repealed legislation from 1737 that banned the use of Irish in courts. English is a de facto official language. English is also spoken as a first language by 95.4% of the Northern Ireland population.\n\nEnglish\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, in 94.74% of households, all people aged 16 and above spoke English as their main language. The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language. There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, for instance; the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \"aitch\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \"haitch\", as in Hiberno-English. However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.\n\nIrish\n\nThe Irish language (Irish: an Ghaeilge), or Gaelic, is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland.

Integrated schools, which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic, and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular. Although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system, in the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools, and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are Gaelscoileanna (Irish language-medium schools).\n\nHealth care\n\nSince 1948, Northern Ireland has a health care system similar to England, Scotland, and Wales, though it provides not only health care but also social care. Health care performance has been decreasing since the mid-2010s and reached crisis levels since 2022.\n\nEconomy\n\nNorthern Ireland traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably featuring shipbuilding, rope manufacture, and textiles.

Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons [97]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish to see Northern Ireland unified with the Republic of Ireland, independent from the United Kingdom These two opposing views are linked to deeper cultural divisions Unionists are predominantly Ulster Protestant, descendants of mainly Scottish, English, and Huguenot settlers as well as Gaels who converted to one of the Protestant denominations Nationalists are overwhelmingly Catholic and descend from the population predating the settlement, with a minority from the Scottish Highlands as well as some converts from Protestantism Discrimination against nationalists under the Stormont government (1921–1972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s [98]\n\n\nBackground\nThe main political divide in Northern Ireland is between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland continue as part of the United Kingdom, and nationalists, who wish

(1921–1972) gave rise to the civil rights movement in the 1960s [98]\n\n\nGovernance\nSince 1998, Northern Ireland has had devolved government within the United Kingdom, presided over by the Northern Ireland Assembly and a cross-community government (the Northern Ireland Executive) The UK Government and UK Parliament are responsible for reserved and excepted matters Reserved matters comprise listed policy areas (such as civil aviation, units of measurement, and human genetics) that Parliament may devolve to the Assembly some time in the future Excepted matters (such as international relations, taxation and elections) are never expected to be considered for devolution On all other governmental matters, the Executive together with the 90-member Assembly may legislate for and govern Northern Ireland Devolution in Northern Ireland is dependent upon participation by members of the Northern Ireland executive in the North/South Ministerial Council, which coordinates areas of cooperation (such as agriculture, education, and health) between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Additionally, \"in recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland\", the Government of Ireland and Government of the United Kingdom co-operate closely on non-devolved matters through the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference.\n\n\nDescriptions\nThere is no generally accepted term to describe what Northern Ireland is It has been described as a country, province, region, and other terms officially, by the press, and in common speech The choice of term can be controversial and can reveal one's political preferences [16] This has been noted as a problem by several writers on Northern Ireland, with no generally recommended solution [15] [16] [17]\n\n\nAlternative names\nMany people inside and outside Northern Ireland use other names for Northern Ireland, depending on their point of view Disagreement on names, and the reading of political symbolism into the use or non-use of a word, also attaches itself to some urban centres The most notable example is whether Northern Ireland's second-largest city should be called \"Derry\" or \"Londonderry\".\n\n\nUnionist\nThe volcanic activity which created the Antrim Plateau also formed the geometric pillars of the Giant's Causeway on the north Antrim coast Also in north Antrim are the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Mussenden Temple and the Glens of Antrim Northern Ireland was covered by an ice sheet for most of the last ice age and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which

ice sheet for most of the last ice age and on numerous previous occasions, the legacy of which can be seen in the extensive coverage of drumlins in Counties Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim and particularly Down.\n\n\nClimate\nThe vast majority of Northern Ireland has a temperate maritime climate, (Cfb in the Köppen climate classification) rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is very common across the region The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5 °C (43.7 °F) in January and 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) in July The highest maximum temperature recorded was 31.4 °C (88.5 °F), registered in July 2021 at Armagh Observatory's weather station [133] The lowest minimum temperature recorded was −18.7 °C (−1.7 °F) at Castlederg, County Tyrone on 23 December 2010 [134]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nUntil the end of the Middle Ages, the land was heavily forested Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, elm, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew and holly [135] Today, only 8% of Northern Ireland is woodland, and most of this is non-native conifer plantations [136]\n\n\nDemographics\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry, [e] and County Tyrone.\n\n\nCounties\nNorthern Ireland consists of six historic counties: County Antrim, County Armagh, County Down, County Fermanagh, County Londonderry, [e] and County Tyrone.\n\n\nCities and major towns\nThe population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978 The population at the time of the 2021 census was 1.9 million, having grown 5% over the previous decade [144] The population in 2011 was 1.8 million, a rise of 7.5% over the previous decade [145] The current population makes up 2.8% of the UK's population (67 million) and 27% of the island of Ireland's population (7.03 million) The population density is 135 inhabitants / km2.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe population of Northern Ireland has risen yearly since 1978 The population at the time of the 2021 census was 1.9 million, having grown 5% over the previous decade [144] The

(7.03 million) The population density is 135 inhabitants / km2.\n\n\nIdentity and citizenship\nIn Northern Ireland censuses, respondents can choose more than one national identity In 2021: [153]\n\n\nReligion\nAt the 2021 census, 42.3% of the population identified as Roman Catholic, 37.3% as Protestant/other Christian, 1.3% as other religions, while 17.4% identified with no religion or did not state one [159] The biggest of the Protestant/other Christian denominations were the Presbyterian Church (16.6%), the Church of Ireland (11.5%) and the Methodist Church (2.3%) [159] At the 2011 census, 41.5% of the population identified as Protestant/other Christian, 41% as Roman Catholic, 0.8% as other religions, while 17% identified with no religion or did not state one [160] In terms of background (i.e religion or religion brought up in), at the 2021 census 45.7% of the population came from a Catholic background, 43.5% from a Protestant background, 1.5% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds [159] This was the first time since Northern Ireland's creation that there were more people from a Catholic background than Protestant [161] At the 2011 census, 48% came from a Protestant background, 45% from a Catholic background, 0.9% from other religious backgrounds, and 5.6% from non-religious backgrounds [160]\n\n\nLanguages\nIrish is an official language of Northern Ireland as of 6 December 2022 when the Irish Language Act (Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022) became law The Irish Language Act officially repealed legislation from 1737 that banned the use of Irish in courts [1] English is a de facto official language [citation needed] English is also spoken as a first language by 95.4% of the Northern Ireland population [177] \n\nEnglish\nAccording to the 2021 census, in 94.74% of households, all people aged 16 and above spoke English as their main language [180] The dialect of English spoken in Northern Ireland shows influence from the lowland Scots language [181] There are supposedly some minute differences in pronunciation between Protestants and Catholics, for instance; the name of the letter h, which Protestants tend to pronounce as \"aitch\", as in British English, and Catholics tend to pronounce as \"haitch\", as in Hiberno-English [182] However, geography is a much more important determinant of dialect than religious background.\n\n\nIrish\nThe Irish language (Irish: an Ghaeilge), or Gaelic, is the second most spoken language in Northern Ireland and is a native language of Ireland [183] It was spoken predominantly throughout what is now Northern Ireland before the Ulster Plantations in the 17th century and most place names in Northern Ireland are anglicised versions of a Gaelic name Today, the language is often associated with Irish nationalism (and thus with Catholics) However, in the 19th century, the language was seen as a common heritage, with Ulster Protestants playing a leading role in the Gaelic revival [184]\n\n\nUlster Scots\nUlster Scots comprises varieties of the Scots language spoken in Northern Ireland For a native English speaker, \" [Ulster Scots] is comparatively accessible, and even at its most intense can be understood fairly easily with the help of a glossary.\" [192]\n\n\nSign languages\nThe most common sign language in Northern Ireland is Northern Ireland Sign Language (NISL) However, because in the past Catholic families tended to send their deaf children to schools in Dublin [citation needed] where Irish Sign Language (ISL) is commonly used, ISL is still common among many older deaf people from Catholic families.\n\n\nEducation\nUnlike most areas of the United Kingdom, in the last year of primary school, many children sit entrance examinations for grammar schools Integrated schools, which attempt to ensure a balance in enrolment between pupils of Protestant, Roman Catholic, and other faiths (or none), are becoming increasingly popular, although Northern Ireland still has a primarily de facto religiously segregated education system In the primary school sector, 40 schools (8.9% of the total number) are integrated schools and 32 (7.2% of the total number) are Gaelscoileanna (Irish language-medium schools).\n\n\nHealth care\nSince 1948 Northern Ireland has a health care system similar to England, Scotland and Wales, though it provides not only health care, but also social care Health care performance has been decreasing since the mid-2010s and reached crisis levels since 2022 [202]\n\n\nEconomy\nNorthern Ireland traditionally had an industrial economy, most notably featuring shipbuilding, rope manufacture, and textiles In 2019, 53% of GVA was generated by services, 22% by the public sector, 15% by production, 8% by construction and 2% by agriculture [203]\n\n\nInfrastructure and transportation\nNorthern Ireland has underdeveloped transport infrastructure, with most infrastructure concentrated around Greater Belfast, Greater Derry, and Craigavon Northern Ireland is served by three airports—Belfast International near Antrim, George Best Belfast City integrated into the railway network at Sydenham in East Belfast, and City of Derry in County Londonderry There are upgrade plans to transform the railway network in Northern Ireland including new lines from Derry to Portadown and Belfast to Newry, though it will take the best part of 25 years to deliver [215] There are major seaports at Larne and Belfast which carry passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\nCulture\nNorthern Ireland shares both the culture of Ulster and the culture of the United Kingdom.\n\n\nSymbols\nNorthern Ireland comprises a patchwork of communities whose national loyalties are represented in some areas by flags flown from flagpoles or lamp posts The Union Jack and the former Northern Ireland flag are flown in many loyalist areas, and the Tricolour, adopted by republicans as the flag of Ireland in 1916, [222] is flown in some republican areas Even kerbstones in some areas are painted red-white-blue or green-white-orange, depending on whether local people express unionist/loyalist or nationalist/republican sympathies [223]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nThe BBC has a division called BBC Northern Ireland with headquarters in Belfast and operates BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland As well as broadcasting standard UK-wide programmes, BBC NI produces local content, including a news break-out called BBC Newsline The ITV franchise in Northern Ireland is UTV The state-owned Channel 4 and the privately owned Channel 5 also broadcast in Northern Ireland Access is also available to satellite and cable services [233] All Northern Ireland viewers must obtain a UK TV licence to watch live television transmissions or use BBC iPlayer.\n\n\nSports\nMany sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with a single governing body or team for the whole island [243] The most notable exception is association football (soccer), which has a separate governing body, league and national team for Northern Ireland [243] [244]\n\n\nSee also\n54°37′N 6°37′W﻿ / ﻿54.61°N 6.62°W﻿ / 54.61; -6.62\n\n\nNotes\n54°37′N 6°37′W﻿ / ﻿54.61°N 6.62°W﻿ / 54.61; -6.62\n\n\nReferences\n54°37′N 6°37′W﻿ / ﻿54.61°N 6.62°W﻿ /

The novel explores themes of love, class, and social status, delving into the complexities of relationships and the consequences of one's choices.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe story begins seven years after the broken engagement of Anne Elliot to Frederick Wentworth, a young and ambitious naval officer. At the age of 19, Anne fell in love and accepted a proposal of marriage from Wentworth, but was persuaded by her family and friends to break off the engagement due to his uncertain prospects and lack of wealth. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot, and her older sister, Elizabeth, viewed Wentworth as an unsuitable partner for a woman of their social standing. Lady Russell, a distant relative and confidante to Anne, also saw the relationship as imprudent for one so young.\n\nThe story picks up where the engagement was broken off, with Anne still unmarried at 27. She has rejected a proposal of marriage from Charles Musgrove, knowing that she still holds feelings for Wentworth. However, it is not until Wentworth returns from fighting abroad that Anne is finally confronted with her unfulfilled emotions.\n\n# Main Characters\n\nAnne Elliot is the central character of the novel, an intelligent, accomplished, and attractive young woman who is still unmarried at 27. She is the second daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and is characterized by her introspection and self-awareness. Anne is torn between her love for Wentworth and her sense of duty to her family and social standing.\n\nFrederick Wentworth is the love interest of Anne, a naval officer who has risen through the ranks to become a respected and successful commander. He is confident, ambitious, and intelligent, but also proud and stubborn.\n\nOther notable characters in the novel include Sir Walter Elliot, Anne's father, who is portrayed as a self-absorbed and vain man; Elizabeth Elliot, Anne's older sister, who is depicted as shallow and vain; and Lady Russell, a distant relative and confidante to Anne, who is wise and kind but also manipulative.\n\n# Themes\n\nOne of the primary themes of Persuasion is the concept of persuasion itself, which is explored through vignettes and character interactions throughout the novel. Austen highlights the moral dangers of persuasion, particularly for young women who are pressured into making choices that may not be in their best interests.\n\nAnother theme of the novel is the social class system, which is portrayed as rigid and restrictive. Austen critiques the class system, highlighting the social pressures and expectations that govern the lives of her characters.\n\nLove is also a major theme of the novel, as Anne and Wentworth's relationship is rekindled and developed throughout the story. Austen explores the complexities of love, including the pain of rejection and the joy of second chances.\n\n# Development of the Novel\n\nPersuasion was written in the early 19th century, a time of great social change and upheaval. Austen drew on her own experiences and observations to create the novel, which is characterized by its witty dialogue, insightful characterization, and nuanced exploration of themes.\n\nAusten's brother, Charles Austen, was a Royal Navy officer who served in the North America station, and his career may have influenced the development of the novel. Austen's own experiences as a woman in a patriarchal society also inform the novel, particularly in her portrayal of Anne's struggles with social expectations and her own desires.\n\n# Publication History\n\nPersuasion was published in 1817, along with Northanger Abbey, in a four-volume set. The novel was a commercial success, selling rapidly and earning Austen a reputation as one of the leading writers of her time. The novel was not widely recognized until the 20th century, when it was rediscovered and reevaluated by scholars and readers.\n\n# Early Drafts and Revisions\n\nAusten did not rewrite Persuasion from earlier drafts of novels that she had originally started before 1800. The novel was written in its final form, with some revisions and edits made during the publication process.\n\n# Literary Significance and Criticism\n\nPersuasion has been widely regarded as one of Austen's finest works, praised for its nuanced characterization, witty dialogue, and insightful exploration of themes. However, some critics have argued that the novel is less polished than some of Austen's other works, such as Pride and Prejudice.\n\n# Adaptations\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into numerous film, television, and stage productions over the years. Some notable adaptations include the 1971 film starring Anne de Villiers and the 1995 film starring Amanda Root.\n\n# Film\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into several films, including the 1971 film starring Anne de Villiers and the 1995 film starring Amanda Root. The 1995 film was a critical and commercial success, earning several awards and nominations.\n\n# Digital Media\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into several digital media productions, including a 2016 web series and a 2018 audiobook.\n\n# Television\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into several television productions, including a 1971 BBC mini-series and a 1995 ITV mini-series.\n\n# Theatre\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into several stage productions, including a 2013 play and a 2018 musical.\n\n# Radio\n\nPersuasion has been adapted into several radio productions, including a 2011 BBC Radio 4 drama and a 2018 BBC Radio 4 drama.\n\n# Literature using themes or characters of the novel\n\nPersuasion has been referenced and parodied in numerous literary works, including the novels of Anthony Trollope and the poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\nAusten, J.

{"title": "Isaac_Newton", "content": "\nEarly life\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643 [a]) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire [25] His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug [26] When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe) Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\" [27] Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage [28]\n\n\nThe King's School\nFrom the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School in Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics [29] He was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659 His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated [30] Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, [31] distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills [32]\n\n\nUniversity of Cambridge\nIn June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university At Cambridge, Newton started as a subsizar, paying his way by performing valet duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his MA [33] At the time, Cambridge's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo Galilei and Thomas Street He set down in his notebook a series of \"Quaestiones\" about mechanical philosophy as he found it In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague [34]\n\n\nMid-life\nNewton's work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\" [49] His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers [50] His work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\" [51] Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz [52] [12] [53] Leibniz's notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians [54]\n\n\nCalculus\nNewton's work has been said \"to distinctly advance every

Leibniz [52] [12] [53] Leibniz's notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians [54]\n\n\nOptics\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles [70] [71] This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.\n\n\nGravity\nNewton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665 [37] [38] In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society, [91]  and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions [81] Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed [92] After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684 [93] This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.\n\n\nPhilosophy of Science\nStarting with the second edition of his \"Principia (Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica),\" Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method  It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, \"hypotheses non fingo\", which can be translated as \"I don't make hypotheses,\" (the direct translation of \"fingo\" is \"frame\", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science)  He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation The full quote, translated from that section is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were discovered And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea [57]\"\n\n\nLater life\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785 [105]\n\n\nRoyal Mint\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785 [105]\n\n\nKnighthood\nIn April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint [116] Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon [117]\n\n\nDeath\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) [a] He was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey [126] Voltaire may have been present at his funeral [127] A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate [128] His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton [129]\n\n\nPersonality\nAlthough it was claimed that he was once engaged, [b] Newton never married The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton's funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.” [135] There exists a widespread belief that Newton died a virgin, and writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, [136] economist John Maynard Keynes, [137] and physicist Carl Sagan have commented on it [138]\n\n\nTheology\nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, [149] with one historian labelling him a heretic [150]\n\n\nReligious views\nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, [149] with one historian labelling him a heretic [150]\n\n\nReligious thought\nNewton and Robert Boyle's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians [166] The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, [167] and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\n\n\nAlchemy\n\n\nLegacy\nThe mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange frequently asserted that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, [179] and once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\" [180] English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:\n\n\nRecognition\nThe mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange frequently asserted that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, [179] and once added that Newton was also

the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree [197] [198] The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton's niece, to Voltaire [199] Voltaire then wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), \"Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.\" [200] [201]\n\n\nCommemorations\nNewton's monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent [210] The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680 A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism [211]\n\n\nThe Enlightenment\nEnlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded [214]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nPublished in his

about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684 [93] This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.\n\n\nPhilosophy of Science\nStarting with the second edition of his \"Principia (Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica),\" Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method  It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, \"hypotheses non fingo\", which can be translated as \"I don't make hypotheses,\" (the direct translation of \"fingo\" is \"frame\", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science)  He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation The full quote, translated from that section is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were discovered And to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the celestial bodies, and of our sea [57]\"\n\n\nLater life\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785 [105]\n\n\nRoyal Mint\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785 [105]\n\n\nKnighthood\nIn April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint [116] Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon [117]\n\n\nDeath\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) [a] He was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey [126] Voltaire may have been present at his funeral [127] A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate [128] His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton [129]\n\n\nPersonality\nAlthough it was claimed that he was once engaged, [b] Newton never married The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton's funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.” [135] There exists a widespread belief that Newton died a virgin, and writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, [136] economist John Maynard Keynes, [137] and physicist Carl Sagan have commented on it [138]\n\n\nTheology\nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, [149] with one historian labelling him a heretic [150]\n\n\nReligious views\nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, [149] with one historian labelling him a heretic [150]\n\n\nReligious thought\nNewton and Robert Boyle's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians [166] The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, [167] and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\n\n\nAlchemy\n\n\nLegacy\nThe mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange frequently asserted that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, [179] and once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\" [180] English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:\n\n\nRecognition\nThe mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange frequently asserted that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, [179] and once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\" [180] English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:\n\n\nApple incident\nNewton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree [197] [198] The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton's niece, to Voltaire [199] Voltaire then wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), \"Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.\" [200] [201]\n\n\nCommemorations\nNewton's monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent [210] The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680 A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism [211]\n\n\nThe Enlightenment\nEnlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded [214]\n\n\nWorks\n\n\nPublished in his lifetime\n\n\nPublished posthumously\n\n\nSee

He had no children.\n\n**Canadian Confederation**\n\nWhile Prince Edward lived in Quebec (1791–93), he met with Jonathan Sewell, an immigrant American Loyalist who played trumpet in the Prince's regimental band. Sewell would rise in Lower Canadian government to hold such offices as Attorney General, Chief Justice, and Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. In 1814, Sewell forwarded to the Duke a copy of his report \"A plan for the federal union of British provinces in North America.\" The Duke supported Sewell's plan to unify the colonies, offering comments and critiques that would later be cited by Lord Durham (1839) and participants of the Charlottetown and Quebec Conferences (1864).\n\n**Freemasonry - United Grand Lodge of England**\n\nIn January 1813, Prince Edward's brother, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex (sixth son of King George III), became Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England (aka \"The Moderns\") on the resignation of his brother, the Prince Regent; and, in December of that year, Prince Edward became Grand Master of the Antient Grand Lodge of England (aka \"The Ancients\"). In 1811, both Grand Lodges had appointed Commissioners; and over the ensuing two years, articles of Union were negotiated and agreed upon. On 27 December 1813, the United Grand Lodge of England, formed as a result of these negotiations, was constituted at Freemasons' Hall, London with the younger Duke of Sussex as Grand Master. A Lodge of Reconciliation was formed a few weeks prior to reconcile the rituals worked under the two former Grand Lodges.\n\n**Later Life**\n\nThe Duke of Kent purchased a house of his own from Maria Fitzherbert in 1801. Castle Hill Lodge on Castlebar Hill, Ealing (West London), was then placed in the hands of architect James Wyatt and more than £100,000 spent (£9.62 million in 2023). Near neighbours from 1815 to 1817 at Little Boston House were US envoy and future US President John Quincy Adams and his English wife, Louisa. \"We all went to church and heard a charity sermon preached by a Dr Crane before the Duke of Kent\", wrote Adams in a diary entry from August 1815.\n\n**Death**\n\nThe Duke of Kent died of pneumonia on 23 January 1820 at Woolbrook Cottage, Sidmouth, and was interred in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. He died six days before his father, George III, and less than a year after his daughter's birth.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThere is a bronze statue of the prince in Park Crescent, London.

He is the namesake of Prince Edward Island, Prince Edward Islands, Prince Edward County, and Duke Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n**Honours and Arms**\n\nAs a son of the sovereign, the Duke of Kent

military training in the Electorate of Hanover in 1785 King George III intended to send him to the University of Göttingen, but decided against it upon the advice of the Duke of York Instead, Edward went to Lüneburg and later Hanover, accompanied by his German tutor, Lieutenant Colonel George von Wangenheim, Baron Wangenheim [8] On 30 May 1786, he was appointed a brevet colonel in the British Army [9] From 1788 to 1789, he completed his education in Geneva [7] On 5 August 1789, aged 22, he became a mason in L'Union, the most important Genevan masonic lodge in the 19th century

time to witness the proclamation of the Constitutional Act of 1791, became the first member of the Royal Family to tour Upper Canada, and became a fixture of British North American society Edward and his mistress, Julie St Laurent, became close friends with the French Canadian family of Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine d'Irumberry de Salaberry; the Prince mentored all of the family's sons throughout their military careers Edward guided Charles de Salaberry throughout his career, and made sure that the famous commander was duly honoured after his leadership during the Battle of Chateauguay.\n\n\nNova Scotia\nAfter 1794, Prince Edward lived at the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station located in Halifax, Nova Scotia He was instrumental in shaping that settlement's military defences, protecting its important Royal Navy base, as well as influencing the city's and colony's socio-political and economic institutions Edward was responsible for the construction of Halifax's iconic Garrison Clock, as well as numerous other civic projects such as St George's Round Church Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth and Lady Francis Wentworth provided their country residence for the use of Prince Edward and Julie St Laurent Extensively renovated, the estate became known as \"Prince's Lodge\" as the couple hosted numerous dignitaries, including Louis-Phillippe of Orléans (the future King of the French) All that remains of the residence is a small rotunda built by Edward for his regimental band to play music.\n\n\nGibraltar\nAppointed Governor of Gibraltar by the War Office, gazetted 23 March 1802, [17] the Duke took up his post on 24 May with express orders from the government to restore discipline among the drunken troops The Duke's harsh discipline precipitated a mutiny by soldiers in his own and the 25th Regiment on Christmas Eve His brother Frederick, the Duke of York, then Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, recalled him in May 1803 after receiving reports of the mutiny, but despite this direct order he refused to return to England until his successor arrived He was refused permission to return to Gibraltar for an inquiry and, although allowed to continue to hold the governorship of Gibraltar until his death, he was forbidden to return [7]\n\n\nPersonal life and interests\nFollowing the death of Princess

{"title": "Predator_(franchise)", "content": "\nPremise\nThe Predator franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters between humanity and a hostile, trophy-hunting extraterrestrial species known as the Yautja Predominantly transpiring in the present day of the 20th and 21st century, the series comprises films that, while largely independent, portray human confrontations with Yautjas in different locations Drawn by heat and conflict, the creatures have been travelling to Earth for centuries in order to hunt Humans.\n\n\nBackground\nPredator was John McTiernan's first studio film as director The studio hired screenplay writer Shane Black to not only play a supporting role in the film, but to keep an eye on McTiernan due to the director's inexperience [1] Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally cast as the film's creature, [2] the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the creature an agile, ninja-esque hunter When compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura, actors known for their bodybuilding regimes, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening Eventually, Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by the actor and mime artist Kevin Peter Hall [3] [4] [5] [6] A Van Damme easter egg was eventually featured in The Predator [7]\n\n\nFilms\n\n\n\nPredator (1987)\nAn elite paramilitary rescue team, led by Major Dutch is on a covert operation in a Central American jungle where they are tasked with rescuing an official and his aide from guerrillas when they encounter a highly dangerous extraterrestrial with futuristic technology who hunts them for sport and are forced to find a way to defeat it before it kills off the entire team while awaiting a helicopter rescue.\n\n\nPredator 2 (1990)\nIn the record-hot summer of 1997, a different Predator arrives in Los Angeles and hunts violent gang members, drawing the attention of the local police force, specifically Lieutenant Harrigan, who pursues the creature as it rampages throughout the city The creature itself is in turn being hunted by the secretive government task-force OWLF, led by CIA agent Peter Keyes, which wishes to capture it for study.\n\n\nPredators (2010)\nA group of notorious mercenaries and murderers find themselves kidnapped and transported to an extraterrestrial game preserve jungle planet, where they have to learn to work together in order to fight off a band of Super Predators and other creatures stalking them and find a way off this world.\n\n\nThe Predator (2018)\nAfter witnessing the crash of a Predator spaceship on Earth and hiding some of the remains, U.S Army Ranger Quinn McKenna and a team of PTSD-afflicted soldiers must take down a pair of Predators, including a new enhanced Predator which was genetically enhanced by its species The Predator canon is expanded by distinguishing  multiple types and purposes of the Predator species.\n\n\nPrey (2022)\nWith the sale of 21st Century Fox's assets to The Walt Disney Company, the future of the series was called into question, though Bob Iger confirmed that certain properties would remain R-rated [16] In December 2019, Dan Trachtenberg was announced to be developing a film under the working title of Skulls, with a script from Patrick Aison, set during the American Civil War [17] [18] [19] In November 2020, it was revealed that the project was actually a fifth film in the Predator franchise Trachtenberg indicated that he had been working on the film since 2016, with the intention to market the project without any references to Predator [20] The Walt Disney Company produced the project through their 20th Century Studios banner [21] In May 2021, Amber Midthunder was announced to star [22] In late July, the title was shortened to Skull [23] before officially becoming  Prey in November; it was released on Hulu on August 5, 2022 [24] [25]\n\n\nUntitled Predator film (2025)\nIn October 2024, it was reported that a secret Predator film had been directed by Dan Trachtenberg and is one of two Predator films releasing in 2025, set to be released on streaming before the release of Predator: Badlands [26]\n\n\nPredator: Badlands (2025)\nIn June 2022, Dan Trachtenberg stated that there are discussions for additional installments being developed after the release of Prey The filmmaker stated that moving forward, the intent is to do things that have not been done before in the franchise [27] In August, Bennett Taylor expressed interest in reprising his role as Raphael Adolini as \"the pirate he is\" in a potential prequel to Prey, serving as a loose adaptation of the 1996 comic book Predator: 1718 in which Adolini was introduced, reading it as research before shooting Prey, having aimed to \"bring as much of  [Raphael] into Prey that made sense\" [28]\n\n\nCrossover series\nInspired by the Dark Horse Comics series, the filmmakers of Predator 2 (1990) incorporated an easter egg in which an Alien skull was seen in a Predator trophy case Expansions upon this shared universe between the Alien and Predator franchises followed through comics and video games, leading up to the launch of a film franchise with the release of Alien vs Predator in 2004, followed by Aliens vs Predator: Requiem in 2007 The franchise has spawned various comics, novels, video games, and other merchandise based upon or inspired by the films A third film has been variously rumored since the production of Requiem [33] [34] [35] In mid-2018, Shane Black, the director of The Predator, expressed his belief that a third Alien vs Predator could still happen, indicating the studio's interest in both franchises [36]\n\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\nIn 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in Earth orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand miles north of Antarctica A buried pyramid giving off a \"heat bloom\" attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid Three Predators descend to the planet and enter the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien, while the third allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa \"Lex\" Woods (Sanaa Lathan), while making their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually does battle with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien Chestburster was present within the corpse, thus a predator/alien hybrid is born.\n\n\nAliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the Predalien hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of Gunnison, Colorado The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a veteran Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to \"clean up\" the infestation When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the Alien films.\n\n\nShort films\nOn October 19, 2010, Predators was released on home video and included the two prequel short films Moments of Extraction and Crucified, along with the prequel short film The Chosen, which had aired as a television and cinema advertisement prior to the release of Predators [39] Loot Crate (commonly known for producing and distributing various officially licensed merchandise based on the Alien, Predator, Alien vs Predator, and Prometheus brands) released a VR 360° short film titled Predator vs Colonial Marines in February 2016,  directed by Julian Higgins and written by Peter Weidman in which a troop of Colonial Marines storm a Weyland-Yutani warehouse and encounter the deadly alien hunter [40] [41] The Predator was released on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD formats on December 18, 2018, in America, alongside the short film The Predator Holiday Special,

Three Predators descend to the planet and enter the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos.\n\n### Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)\n\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the Predalien hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of Gunnison, Colorado. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a veteran Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to \"clean up\" the infestation.\n\n## Short films\n\nOn October 19, 2010, Predators was released on home video and included the two prequel short films Moments of Extraction and Crucified, along with the prequel short film The Chosen, which had aired as a television and cinema advertisement prior to the release of Predators.

He also became known for his advocacy of animal rights and his efforts to promote spaying and neutering pets.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBarker was married to Dorothy Jo Gideon from 1945 until her death from lung cancer in 1981. From 1983 until his death, Barker was in a long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet, an admitted \"radical\" animal rights activist nearly 20 years younger than Barker. By mutual decision, Barker and Burnet were never married and lived in separate residences throughout their relationship.\n\n**Animal Rights**\n\nBarker was a vegetarian and became more aggressive in his efforts to promote animal rights during his relationship with Burnet. He began ending \"The Price is Right\" episodes with the phrase, \"This is Bob Barker reminding you to help control the pet population – have your pets spayed or neutered.\" Barker also advocated for the use of humane treatment of animals on television sets and was a vocal critic of the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues.\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\nIn the late 1980s, Barker accused the American Humane Society and the United Activists for Animal Rights of condoning animal cruelty on the set of \"Project X\" and in several other media projects. The American Humane Society responded by suing Barker for $10 million, citing libel, slander, and invasion of privacy. The suit was eventually settled by Barker's insurance company, which paid the American Humane Society $300,000.\n\n**Health and Death**\n\nOn September 16, 1999, Barker was in Washington, D.C., to testify before Congress regarding proposed legislation that would ban captive elephants from traveling shows, such as circuses. While preparing for the presentation, Barker experienced what he called clumsiness in his right hand. He was admitted to George Washington University Hospital and diagnosed with a partially blocked left carotid artery. Barker underwent carotid endarterectomy to remove the blockage, which was successful, and he was able to return to work within the month.\n\n**Film and Other TV Appearances**\n\nBarker made several film and television appearances throughout his career, including appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" \"Saturday Night Live,\" and \"The Simpsons.\" He also made appearances in several films, including \"The Price is Right\" (1982), \"The Price is Right: The Retirement Show\" (1987), and \"The Price is Right: The Next Generation\" (1993).\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nBarker won several awards throughout his career, including multiple Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show Host. He was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\n**Autobiography**\n\nBarker's autobiography, \"Priceless Memories,\" was published in 2009. The book chronicles his life and career, including his early years on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, his career in broadcasting, and his time hosting \"The Price is Right.\" The book also includes stories about his personal life, including his marriage to Dorothy Jo Gideon and his long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of television personalities\n* List of game show hosts\n* List of Daytime Emmy Award winners\n* List of Television Hall of Fame inductees\n* List of Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame inductees\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive biography of Bob Barker's life and career.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.\n* The article includes a detailed account of Barker's early life, his career in broadcasting, and his time hosting \"The Price is Right.\"\n* The article also includes information about Barker's personal life, including his marriage and long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet.\n* The article includes a discussion of Barker's advocacy of animal rights and his efforts to promote spaying and neutering pets.\n* The article includes a list of awards and honors received by Barker throughout his career.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bob_Barker\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBarker was born in Darrington, Washington, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota [2] The U.S Indian Census Rolls, 1885–1940, list Barker as a citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, which the tribe publicly confirmed [3] [4] His mother, Matilda (\"Tillie\") Valandra (née Matilda Kent Tarleton), was a schoolteacher;

Roosevelt's presidency was marked by significant reforms, including the trust-busting policies that aimed to break up large corporations and promote competition.

{"title": "Petro_Poroshenko", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nPetro Poroshenko was born on 26 September 1965, into an ethnic Ukrainian family in Bolhrad, a primarily Bulgarian town in Ukraine's southwestern Odesa Oblast Poroshenko's father  Oleksiy Poroshenko  [de; uk; ru] (1936–2020), [13] was an engineer and later a government official who managed multiple factories in the Ukrainian SSR Little is known about his mother, Yevhenia Serhiyivna Hryhorchuk (1937–2004), but a Ukrainian newspaper said she was an accountant, who taught at a vocational and technical school of accounting [14] He also spent his childhood and youth in Tighina (Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, now known as Bender and under de facto control of the unrecognized breakaway state Transnistria), [15] [16] where his father Oleksii was heading a machine building plant [15] and where he learned Romanian [17]\n\n\nBusiness career\nIn 1993, Poroshenko, together with his father Oleksii and colleagues from the Road Traffic Institute in Kyiv, created the UkrPromInvest Ukrainian Industry and Investment Company, which specialized in the confectionery and automotive industries (as well as in other agricultural processing later on) [18] Poroshenko was director-general of the company from its founding until 1998, when in connection with his entry into parliament he handed the title over to his father, while retaining the title of honorary president [18]\n\n\nBillionaires lists rankings\nIn March 2012, Forbes placed him on the Forbes list of billionaires at 1,153rd place, with US$1 billion [26] As of May 2015, Poroshenko's net worth was about US$720 million (Bloomberg estimate), losing 25 percent of his wealth because of Russia's ban of Roshen products and the state of the Ukrainian economy [27]\n\n\nAssociated businesses\nA number of businesses were once part of the Ukrprominvest  [uk] which Poroshenko headed in 1993–1998 The investment group was dissolved in April 2012 [31] Poroshenko has stated that upon beginning his political activity he passed on his holdings to a trust fund [18]\n\n\nEarly political career\nPoroshenko first won a seat in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) in 1998 for the 12th single-mandate constituency He was initially a member of the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (SDPU), the party led by Viktor Medvedchuk and loyal to president Leonid Kuchma at the time [18] Poroshenko left SDPU(o) in 2000 to create an independent left-of-center faction and then a party, naming it Party of Ukraine's Solidarity (PSU) [18] [34] In 2001 Poroshenko was instrumental in creating the Party of Regions, also loyal to Kuchma; the Party of Ukraine's Solidarity having merged into the Party of Regions, Poroshenko launched a new party with a similar name, the party \"Solidarity\" [35]\n\n\nSecretary of the National Security and Defense Council\nIn December 2001, Poroshenko broke ranks with Kuchma supporters to become campaign chief of Viktor Yushchenko's Our Ukraine Bloc opposition faction After parliamentary elections in March 2002 in which Our Ukraine won the biggest share of the popular vote and Poroshenko won a seat in parliament, [18] [36] Poroshenko served as head of the parliamentary budget committee, where he was accused of \"misplacing ₴47 million\" (US$8.9 million) [37] As a consequence of Poroshenko's Our Ukraine Bloc membership tax inspectors launched an attack on his business [18] Despite great difficulties, UkrPromInvest managed to survive until Yushchenko became President of Ukraine in 2005 [18]\n\n\nForeign Minister and Minister of Trade\nUkrainian President Yushchenko nominated Poroshenko for Foreign Minister on 7 October 2009 [45] [46] Poroshenko was appointed by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) on 9 October 2009 [47] [48] On 12 October 2009, President Yushchenko re-appointed Poroshenko to the National Security and Defense Council [49]\n\n\nReturn to parliament\nPoroshenko returned to the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) after the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election after winning (with more than 70%) as an independent candidate in single-member district number 12 (first-past-the-post wins a parliamentary seat) located in Vinnytsia Oblast [57] [58] [59] He did not enter any faction in parliament [60] and became member of the committee on European Integration [19] Poroshenko's father Oleksii did intend to take part in the elections too in single-member district number 16 (also located in Vinnytsia Oblast), but withdrew his candidacy for health reasons [61] [62] In mid-February 2013, Poroshenko hinted he would run for Mayor of Kyiv in the 2013 Kyiv mayoral election [63]\n\n\n2014 Revolution of Dignity\nPoroshenko actively and financially supported the Euromaidan protests between November 2013 and February 2014, [18] leading to an upsurge in his popularity, although [18] he did not participate in negotiations between then President Yanukovych and the Euromaidan parliamentary opposition parties Batkivshchyna, Svoboda and UDAR [18]\n\n\n2014 presidential campaign\nFollowing the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the resulting removal of Viktor Yanukovych from the office of President of Ukraine, new presidential elections were scheduled to take place on 25 May 2014 [65] In pre-election polls from March 2014, Poroshenko garnered the most support of all the prospective candidates, with one poll conducted by SOCIS giving him a rating of over 40% [66] On 29 March he stated that he would run for president; at the same time Vitali Klitschko left the presidential contest, choosing to support Poroshenko's bid [67] [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nPresidency (2014–2019)\nWhen it became clear he had won the election on election day evening (on 25 May 2014) Poroshenko announced his \"first presidential trip will be to Donbas\", where armed pro-Russian rebels had declared the separatist republics Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and control part of the region [73] [82] Poroshenko also vowed to continue the military operations by the Ukrainian government forces to end the armed insurgency claiming: \"The anti-terrorist operation cannot and should not last two or three months It should and will last hours.\" [83]\n\n\nInauguration\nPoroshenko was inaugurated in the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) on 7 June 2014 [87] In his inaugural address he stressed that Ukraine would not give up Crimea and stressed the unity of Ukraine [88] He promised an amnesty \"for those who do not have blood on their hands\" to the separatist and pro-Russia insurgents of the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine and to the Ukrainian nationalist groups that oppose them, but added: \"Talking to gangsters and killers is not our path.\" [88] He also called for early regional elections in Eastern Ukraine [88]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nAt the time of his inauguration, armed pro-Russian rebels, after disputed referendums, had declared the independence of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and controlled a large part of Donbas, but were largely considered to be illegitimate by the international community [73] [82] After the inauguration, Poroshenko launched a \"peace\" plan envisioned to garner the recognition of the presidential elections in Ukraine by Russia, consisting of a cease-fire with the separatists (named \"terrorists\" by Poroshenko himself) and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for civilians (\"who are not involved in the conflict\") [92] Poroshenko warned that he had a \"Plan B\" if the initial peace plan was rejected [93]\n\n\nPeace plan for Eastern Ukraine\nAt the time of his inauguration, armed pro-Russian rebels, after disputed referendums, had declared the independence of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and controlled a large part of Donbas, but were largely considered to be illegitimate by the international community [73] [82] After the inauguration, Poroshenko launched a \"peace\" plan envisioned to garner the recognition of the presidential elections in Ukraine by Russia, consisting of a cease-fire with the separatists (named \"terrorists\" by Poroshenko himself) and the establishment of a humanitarian corridor for civilians (\"who are not involved in the conflict\") [92] Poroshenko warned that he had a \"Plan B\" if the initial peace plan was rejected [93]\n\n\nDecentralization of power\nIn mid-June Poroshenko started the process of amending Ukraine's constitution to achieve Ukraine's administrative decentralization [94] According to Poroshenko (on 16 June 2014) this was \"a key element of the peace plan\" [94] In his draft constitutional amendments of June 2014 proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions (replacing the current oblasts), districts and \"hromadas\" (united territorial communities) [95]\n\n\nDissolution of Parliament\nOn 25 August 2014, Poroshenko called a snap election to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament), to be held 26 October 2014 [103] [104] According to him this was necessary \"to purify the Rada of the mainstay of  [former president] Viktor Yanukovych\" These deputies, Poroshenko said, \"clearly do not represent the people who elected them\" [105] Poroshenko said that these Rada deputies were responsible for \"the  [January 2014] Dictatorship laws that took the lives of the Heavenly hundred\" [105] Poroshenko stated that many of the (then) current MPs were \"direct sponsors and accomplices or at least sympathizers of militant-separatists\" [105]\n\n\nNuclear weapons\nOn 13 December 2014, Poroshenko stated that he did not want Ukraine to become a nuclear power again [112]\n\n\nDecommunization and deoligarchization\nOn 15 May 2015, Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six months period for the removal of communist monuments and the mandatory renaming of streets and other public places and settlements with a name related to Communism [113] According to Poroshenko, \"I did what I had to\"; adding, \"Ukraine as a state has done its job, then historians should work, while the government should take care of the future.\" [113]\n\n\nLanguage\nIn 2016, a new rule came into force requiring Ukraine's radio stations to play a quota of Ukrainian-language songs each day The law also requires TV and radio broadcasters to ensure 60% of programs such as news and analysis are in Ukrainian [120]\n\n\nReligion\nUnder Poroshenko the autocephalous Orthodox Church of Ukraine was created by the merging of the UOC-KP and the UAOC, and two members of the UOC-MP in a unification council which also elected Epiphanius I as its first primate The 11 October 2018 announcement by Ecumenical Patriarchate that it would—among other things—grant autocephaly to a Ukrainian church is one of the reasons which created the Moscow–Constantinople schism when the Moscow Patriarchate severed full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate on 15 October 2018.\n\n\nCorruption\nCorruption in Ukraine is a widespread problem; although there are signs that during Poroshenko presidency it decreased (thanks to the Prozorro digital system) [134] Poroshenko signed a decree to create the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine to comply with the requirements of the International Monetary Fund Since 2015, the Bureau has sent 189 cases to court, but no one significant was convicted The head of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office reportedly coached suspects on how to avoid corruption charges [135]\n\n\nLGBTQ rights\nIn 2015, Poroshenko spoke in support of a planned gay pride march in Kyiv, calling it \"the constitutional right of every citizen of Ukraine\";

the favorite for the nomination and led in fundraising and polls, but his campaign took serious damage after a gaffe  Speaking about the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Cuomo said, \"Pataki stood behind the leader He held the leader's coat He was a great assistant to the leader But he was not a leader Cream rises to the top, and Rudy Giuliani rose to the top.\" His remarks were widely derided; even his father, former governor Mario Cuomo, later admitted it was a blunder [47]\n\n\nNew York attorney general\nCuomo declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for New York State Attorney General in 2006 and on May 30, 2006, captured the Democratic Party's endorsement, receiving 65% of the delegates Though Cuomo won the endorsement, former New York City Public Advocate

responded by accepting responsibility and issuing an apology to Bruno [51] [53]\n\n\nStudent loan inquiry, 2007\nIn 2007, Cuomo was active in a high-profile investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to a \"preferred lender\", which resulted in the borrowers' incurring higher interest rates This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities Many universities also rebated millions of dollars in fees to affected borrowers [54] [55]\n\n\nUsenet, 2008\nOn June 10, 2008, Cuomo announced that three major Internet service providers (Verizon Communications, Time Warner Cable, and Sprint) would \"shut down major sources of online child pornography\" by no longer hosting many Usenet groups Time Warner Cable ceased offering Usenet altogether, Sprint ended access to the 18,408 newsgroups in the alt.* hierarchy, and Verizon limited its Usenet offerings to the approximately 3,000 Big 8 newsgroups The move came after Cuomo's office located 88 different newsgroups to which child pornography had been posted [56] [57] [58]\n\n\n2008 Obama remarks\nIn 2008, Cuomo said of the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama, who was running against Hillary Clinton, the candidate Cuomo supported: \"You can't shuck and jive at a press conference.\" Cuomo received criticism from some for his use of the phrase Roland Martin of CNN said that \"'Shucking and jiving' have long been words used as a negative assessment of African Americans, along the lines of a 'foot shufflin' Negro' In fact, I don't recall ever hearing the phrase used in reference to anyone white.\" [59]\n\n\nCorruption and fraud investigations, 2009\nCuomo investigated a corruption scandal, a \"fraudulent scheme to extract kickbacks\", which involved New York investigators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and attorneys general in dozens of states [60]\n\n\nConsideration for U.S. Senate appointment\nAfter Hillary Clinton became President Obama's choice for U.S Secretary of State in December 2008, then–New York governor David Paterson was charged with appointing a temporary replacement until a special election Cuomo was seen as a leading contender for this appointment [61] [62] [failed verification] Caroline Kennedy (who is a first cousin of Cuomo's ex-wife) was another leading contender, but withdrew for personal reasons two days before Paterson was set to announce his choice, leaving Cuomo and U.S representative Kirsten Gillibrand as the most likely appointees [62] [63] On January 23, Paterson announced he would appoint Gillibrand to the U.S Senate [64]\n\n\nGubernatorial elections\nOn September 18, 2009, advisors to President Barack Obama informed Governor David Paterson that the president believed he should withdraw his 2010 gubernatorial candidacy, stepping aside for \"popular Attorney General Andrew Cuomo\"

president believed he should withdraw his 2010 gubernatorial candidacy, stepping aside for \"popular Attorney General Andrew Cuomo\" [65] On January 23, 2010, the New York Daily News reported that Cuomo would announce plans for a gubernatorial campaign at the end of March [66] Later reports indicated Cuomo would announce his gubernatorial campaign coinciding with the state Democratic Convention in late May [67] On May 22, 2010, Cuomo announced his run for governor in a video posted to his campaign website Cuomo announced his choice for lieutenant governor on May 26, 2010: Robert Duffy, Mayor of Rochester [68]\n\n\n2014\nCuomo sought reelection in 2014, with former U.S Representative Kathy Hochul as his new running mate On March 5, 2014, Westchester County executive Rob Astorino announced that he would run on the Republican ticket against Cuomo for governor [70] Law professors Zephyr Teachout and Tim Wu challenged the Cuomo–Hochul ticket in the Democratic primary election [71] [72] – capturing 34% of the vote on the gubernatorial line (Wu drew 40.1% as lieutenant governor [73]) [74] On November 4, 2014, Cuomo was reelected for a second term with 54% of the vote, [75] [76] while Astorino received 40.6% of the vote [77]\n\n\n2018\nCuomo was challenged in the primary from the left by actress and activist Cynthia Nixon She criticized him for having failed to fix the New York City Subway following his declaration of the 2017 New York City transit crisis as well as for not protecting undocumented immigrants, not legalizing recreational marijuana, [78] and not creating a single-payer healthcare system [79] When debating Nixon, Cuomo countered her argument on the subways by pointing out that the system is owned by New York City, though past administrations agree it is the governor's role [80] [81] [82] An analysis conducted by New York City comptroller Scott Stringer revealed that New York City pays for 70 percent of subway repair costs [82]\n\n\n2022\nIn May 2019, Governor Cuomo announced he would run for a fourth term [86] In August 2021, after a report released by the Attorney General of New York, Letitia James, detailed accusations of sexual harassment by Governor Cuomo and his attempts to silence victims, the New York State Legislature's leaders indicated that they would seek to remove Cuomo from office While denouncing the report's findings as political and maintaining his\ninnocence, in the face of almost certain removal from office, he announced his resignation as Governor, effective August 24, 2021 [87] [88] [89] Although there was no formal withdrawal, individuals close to Cuomo indicated he would likely not seek his party's nomination following his resignation [90]\n\n\nGovernor of New York (2011–2021)\nCuomo took the gubernatorial oath of office at 12:01 a.m on January 1, 2011, succeeding David Paterson [91] [92] During his first year as governor, Cuomo worked to pass an on-time budget [93] that cut spending

with bipartisan support, [99] [100] and restructured New York's tax code [101] [102]\n\n\nAppointee donations controversy\nOn his first day in office, Cuomo renewed an executive order signed by Eliot Spitzer which prohibited Governors of New York from receiving donations from gubernatorial appointees [119] A February 2018 investigation by The New York Times, however, revealed that the Cuomo administration had quietly reinterpreted the order, and that Cuomo had collected $890,000 from 24 of his appointees, as well as $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees [119] Some donations were made to Cuomo just days after the donor was appointed [119]\n\n\nCorporate incentives\nCuomo has supported providing tax and other incentives to attract business to locate in New York State [121] [122]  He even joked in 2018 that he would be willing to change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" if Amazon located their \"Amazon HQ2\" in the state [123] His strong support for New York City's bid to become the home of Amazon's HQ2 faced criticism based on arguments that the costs to the state outweighed the possible benefits [124] Amazon decided on two \"major corporate outposts\", in New York City and Arlington, Virginia, instead of a single second headquarters, [125] before bowing out of the former under local pressure.\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic response\nOn March 1, 2020, Cuomo issued a statement regarding novel coronavirus in New York wherein he mentioned the first positive case of novel coronavirus in New York State [126] On March 2, 2020, Cuomo said that community transmission of the new coronavirus is \"inevitable\" [127] He also mentioned New York City's plans to aggressively ramp up diagnostic testing for the new virus and said that he would like

statewide\" for the novel coronavirus On March 3, 2020, Cuomo signed a $40 million emergency management authorization for coronavirus response and claimed that \"New York's overall risk remained low\" [128] He also announced the institution of a new cleaning protocol at schools and in the public transportation system \"to help stop any potential spread of the virus\" On March 4, 2020, Cuomo confirmed nine new cases in the state and said that it was \"literally like trying to stop air\" and that it was inevitable that it would continue to spread [129]\n\n\nCriminal justice\nIn August 2017, the Cuomo administration awarded more than $7 million, financed with money from large bank settlements, in grants to New York colleges to offer courses to New York prisoners [148] In January 2018, Cuomo proposed reforms that would \"reduce delays during trials, ban asset seizures in cases where there has been no conviction and make it easier for former convicts to get a job after leaving prison\" [149] He also called for an end to cash bail for minor crimes [149]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn 2017, Cuomo announced that the Indian Point nuclear plant, which produced one quarter of New York City's power, would be phased out As a result of the phaseout, the carbon-free power generated by the plant was replaced by power generated by carbon-generating fossil fuels As a consequence, New York was estimated to struggle to meet its climate goals [151]\n\n\nGun control and \"gravity knives\"\nOn January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state gun control bill to pass after the December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in neighboring Connecticut [152] The NY SAFE Act was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States [153] The act came under criticism, and the National Rifle Association called it draconian The New York State Sheriffs' Association issued a statement supporting tougher penalties for illegal use of firearms but criticizing several aspects of the legislation, including a magazine limit of seven rounds and a \"too broad\" definition of assault weapons [154]\n\n\nHurricane Sandy\nAfter Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in the state [164] He also appointed a commission to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm [165]\n\n\nHydraulic fracturing\nIn June 2012, the Cuomo administration said it was considering lifting a state ban on the practice of hydraulic fracturing (also known as \"fracking\") [168] to stimulate the economy in upstate New York But critics said that fracking upstate could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania [169] [170] Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited \"significant public health risks\" associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York State [171]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn solidarity with Israel, Cuomo announced an executive order against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement Cuomo tweeted: \"If you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.\" [172]\n\n\nMarijuana legalization\nIn January 2014, Cuomo announced an executive order to allow the limited use of medical marijuana in New York [173] Later that year, a comprehensive bill to legalize medical cannabis was passed by the state legislature, containing some restrictions at Cuomo's insistence such as a ban on consumption by smoking [174] [175] On July 5, 2014, the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law by Governor Cuomo [175] [176]\n\n\nNew York City Subway\nIn June 2017, after a series of subway disasters, Cuomo declared a \"state of emergency\" for the New York City Subway system [178] According to The New York Times, a series of New York City mayors and New York governors, including Cuomo, were partly at fault for the worsening quality of the subway system and inflated construction costs [178] Under the Cuomo administration, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority repeatedly diverted tax revenues earmarked for the subways, paid for services that there was no need for and spent on subway projects that did not boost service or reliability [178] As a result, the MTA was saddled with debt and could not undertake investments into overhauling outdated and inefficient subway infrastructure [178] Cuomo also directed the MTA to spend on projects that the heads of the MTA did not consider to be priorities [178] One reason why the New York City subway system is so expensive is due to exorbitant labor costs; according to several M.T.A officials who were involved in negotiating labor contracts, Cuomo pressured the MTA to accept labor union contracts that were extremely favorable to workers [178] The New York Times noted that Cuomo was closely aligned with the union in question and had received $165,000 in campaign contributions from it [178]\n\n\nPublic college and university tuition\nOn April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget It included the Excelsior Scholarship, a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all SUNY and CUNY universities, [179] [180] though some education experts including Sara Goldrick-Rab say it won't help the poorest students and that the requirement that recipients live and work in New York after graduating is counter-productive [181]\n\n\nPublic employees\nOn July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement furlough days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts [182] In an interview with The New York Times, he stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of public employee pensions [183]\n\n\nPublic housing\nIn the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the New York City Housing Authority by attorney Jim Walden on behalf of a group of public housing tenants The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City [184] By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis [185]\n\n\nRemarks about right-wing conservatives\nIn a January 17, 2014, interview with Susan Arbetter on WCNY's The Capital Pressroom, Cuomo stated:\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn keeping with a campaign promise, Cuomo signed the Marriage Equality Act, introducing same-sex marriage, on June 24, 2011, following an \"intense public and private lobbying campaign\", and later called for all states to do the same [191] Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation [192] [193] [194] One prominent advocate stated that for gay Americans, Cuomo was \"the only national politician with hero status\" [193] Following the passage of the Act, Cuomo was criticized for describing the viewpoints of opponents as \"anti-American\" [195] [196] On July 25, 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction against the Act, alleging corruption and violations of the law in the process of passing the bill [197] The trial court initially held that the plaintiffs' case could proceed, but the decision was reversed on appeal [198]\n\n\nStart-Up NY\nIn July 2016, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, released a report indicating that the state's flagship business tax incentive program, called Start-Up NY, had generated 408 jobs since its inception in 2014 Ads promoting the program had cost at least $53 million [199] The Start-Up NY annual report was delayed three months in 2016, leading some lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Schimminger, to call the delays \"curious\" [200]\n\n\nTaxes\nCuomo was praised for his 2011 restructuring of the New York State tax code [201] [202] [203] He was also criticized for allegedly requesting a unanimous Assembly vote in favor of the proposal and threatening to campaign against Assembly members who voted \"no\" [204] – a charge he denied [204] Cuomo also received criticism from voices on the left who felt that the tax reform was insufficient [205] Hoping that the Federal cap on state and local tax deductions will be repealed, Cuomo signed a tax increase on high income workers and corporations and the wealthy worth over one million dollars in 2021  The increase extends until the year 2027 [206]\n\n\nVoting rights\nIn April 2018, Cuomo announced that he would restore

throughout his term [207]\n\n\nWomen's issues and abortion\nIn 2013, Cuomo called for the passage of a Women's Equality Act [208] The Women's Equality Act included 10 component bills affecting issues such as domestic violence, human trafficking, and pregnancy discrimination [208] The tenth bill of the Women's Equality Act was the Reproductive Health Act, [209] which would have \"enshrine [d] in state law existing federal protections for abortion rights\", \"shift [ed] the state's abortion law from the criminal code to the health care laws\", and \" [made] it clearer that licensed health care practitioners as well as physicians could perform abortions\" [210] During his 2013 State of the State address, Cuomo said, \"Enact a Reproductive Health Act because it is her body, it is her choice Because it's her body, it's her choice Because it's her body, it's her choice.\" [208] The New York State Assembly passed the Women's Equality Act on June 20, 2013 [211] The Republican leadership of the New York State Senate expressed support for the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women's Equality Act, but objected to the Reproductive Health Act and expressed unwillingness to allow a vote on it [212]\n\n\nControversies\nIn July 2014, it was reported that the Moreland Commission, a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics, [222] was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging [223] Cuomo later disbanded the commission [223] Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo's dealings with the anti-corruption

patients to nursing homes who test positive for the coronavirus and barred testing prospective nursing home patients after the CDC announced that \"patients with COVID-19 could be discharged from a health care facility to both home and long-term care facilities when indicated.\" [245] This was also in federal compliance with the HHS's announcement that \"Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\" [246] Due to widespread misinformation in the press, Cuomo and his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, were wrongfully accused of being the origin of mandating nursing homes to accept patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from hospitals [247] [248] [249]\n\n\nSexual harassment allegations and resignation\nOn December 13, 2020, Lindsey Boylan, a former aide for Cuomo who was a Democratic candidate for Manhattan Borough president in 2021, alleged \" [Cuomo] sexually harassed me for years Many saw it, and watched.\" Boylan further alleged that Cuomo \"exists without ethics\", \"takes advantage of people, including me\" and ran a \"toxic team environment\" [265] [266] [267] A spokesperson for the Cuomo administration denied the accusation [265] Boylan further elaborated on her accusations in February 2021, claiming Cuomo goaded her to play

politician and the 56th Governor of New York, serving from 2011 to 2021. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been a prominent figure in New York politics for over three decades.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nAndrew Cuomo was born on December 6, 1957, in the New York City borough of Queens to lawyer and later governor of New York Mario Cuomo and Matilda (née Raffa). His paternal grandparents were from Nocera Inferiore and Tramonti in the Campania region of southern Italy, while his maternal grandparents were from Sicily. Cuomo has four siblings, including his younger brother, Chris Cuomo, a current NewsNation anchor and a former CNN journalist.\n\nEarly Career\nDuring his father's successful 1982 campaign for governor, Cuomo served as campaign manager. He then joined the governor's staff as a policy advisor and sometime Albany roommate, earning $1 a year. As a member of his father's administration, Cuomo was known as the \"enforcer\" where his father was known as the \"nice guy\" in a good cop/bad cop dynamic to further advance his father's legislative agenda.\n\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development\nCuomo was appointed Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1993, a member of President Bill Clinton's administration. After the departure of Secretary Henry Cisneros at the end of Clinton's first term under the cloud of an FBI investigation, Cuomo was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate to succeed him as Secretary of HUD. He served as Secretary from January 1997 until the Clinton administration ended in 2001.\n\nPrivate Sector\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Cuomo was not in government. He worked at the Fried Frank law firm from 2001 to 2004 and later the Island Capital real estate firm.\n\n2002 New York Gubernatorial Election\nCuomo first ran for the Democratic nomination for the New York governor seat in 2002. He was initially the favorite for the nomination and led in fundraising and polls, but his campaign took serious damage after a gaffe. Speaking about the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Cuomo said, \"Pataki stood behind the leader He held the leader's coat He was a great assistant to the leader But he was not a leader Cream rises to the top, and Rudy Giuliani rose to the top.\" His remarks were widely derided, even by his father, former governor Mario Cuomo.\n\nNew York Attorney General\nCuomo declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for New York State Attorney General in 2006 and on May 30, 2006, captured the Democratic Party's endorsement, receiving 65% of the delegates. Though Cuomo won the endorsement, former New York City Public Advocate Mark Green and two-time candidate for Lieutenant Governor Charlie King also earned places on the Democratic ballot. King dropped out of the race before the primary and endorsed Cuomo.\n\nElection\nOn July 23, 2007, Cuomo's office admonished the Spitzer administration for ordering the New York State Police to keep special records of then Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City. At the discretion of top officials of the Spitzer administration, the created documents meant to cause political damage to Bruno. Spitzer responded by accepting responsibility and issuing an apology to Bruno.\n\nTenure\nCuomo was active in a high-profile investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to a \"preferred lender,\" which resulted in the borrowers' incurring higher interest rates. This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities, and many universities also rebated millions of dollars in fees to affected borrowers.\n\nUsenet\nOn June 10, 2008, Cuomo announced that three major Internet service providers (Verizon Communications, Time Warner Cable, and Sprint) would \"shut down major sources of online child pornography\" by no longer hosting many Usenet groups. Time Warner Cable ceased offering Usenet altogether, Sprint ended access to the 18,408 newsgroups in the alt.* hierarchy, and Verizon limited its Usenet offerings to the approximately 3,000 Big 8 newsgroups.\n\nGovernor of New York (2011-2021)\nCuomo took the gubernatorial oath of office at 12:01 a.m on January 1, 2011, succeeding David Paterson. During his first year as governor, Cuomo worked to pass an on-time budget that cut spending without raising taxes, made a new deal with a large state-employee union, signed ethics reform legislation, passed a property tax cap, worked to enact a same-sex marriage bill with bipartisan support, and restructured New York's tax code.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response\nOn March 1, 2020, Cuomo issued a statement regarding novel coronavirus in New York wherein he mentioned the first positive case of novel coronavirus in New York State. On March 2, 2020, Cuomo said that community transmission of the new coronavirus is \"inevitable.\" He also mentioned New York City's plans to aggressively ramp up diagnostic testing for the new virus and said that he would like to see New York City conducting \"1,000 tests per day.\" He announced the \"world-renowned\" Wadsworth Center was partnering with hospitals to expand surge testing capacity to \"1,000 tests per day statewide\" for the novel coronavirus.\n\nCorruption and Fraud Investigations\nIn August 2017, the Cuomo administration awarded more than $7 million, financed with money from large bank settlements, in grants to New York colleges to offer courses to New York prisoners. In January 2018, Cuomo proposed reforms that would \"reduce delays during trials, ban asset seizures in cases where there has been no conviction and make it easier for former convicts to get a job after leaving prison.\"\n\nGun Control and \"Gravity Knives\"\nOn January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state gun control bill to pass after the December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in neighboring Connecticut. The NY SAFE Act was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States. The act came under criticism, and the National Rifle Association called it draconian.\n\nHurricane Sandy\nAfter Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in the state. He also appointed a commission to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm.\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\nIn June 2012, the Cuomo administration said it was considering lifting a state ban on the practice of hydraulic fracturing (also known as \"fracking\") to stimulate the economy in upstate New York. But critics said that fracking upstate could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey, and parts of Pennsylvania. Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited \"significant public health risks\" associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York State.\n\nIsrael\nIn solidarity with Israel, Cuomo announced an executive order against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Cuomo tweeted: \"If you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.\"\n\nMarijuana Legalization\nIn January 2014, Cuomo announced an executive order to allow the limited use of medical marijuana in New York. Later that year, a comprehensive bill to legalize medical cannabis was passed by the state legislature, containing some restrictions at Cuomo's insistence, such as a ban on consumption by smoking. On July 5, 2014, the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law by Governor Cuomo.\n\nPublic College and University Tuition\nOn April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget. It included the Excelsior Scholarship, a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all SUNY and CUNY universities.\n\nPublic Employees\nOn July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement furlough days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts. In an interview with The New York Times, he stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of public employee pensions.\n\nPublic Housing\nIn the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the New York City Housing Authority by attorney Jim Walden on behalf of a group of public housing tenants. The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City. By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis.\n\nSexual Harassment Allegations and Resignation\nOn December 13, 2020, Lindsey Boylan, a former aide for Cuomo who was a Democratic candidate for Manhattan Borough president in 2021, alleged that Cuomo sexually harassed her for years. A spokesperson for the Cuomo administration denied the accusation. Cuomo's resignation was announced on August 10, 2021, following a report by the New York State Attorney General's office that found he had engaged in \"unwelcome touching\" and made \"unwanted comments\" to several women.\n\nPost-Gubernatorial Career\nCuomo filed for a state retirement pension, to be effective September 1, 2021, based on 14.56 years of state service as attorney general and governor.\n\nElectoral History\nCuomo married Kerry Kennedy, the seventh child of Robert F Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, on June 9, 1990. They have three daughters: twins, Cara Ethel Kennedy-Cuomo and Mariah Matilda Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1995), and Michaela Andrea Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1997). They separated in 2003, and divorced in 2005.\n\nPersonal Life\nCuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was the 52nd Governor of New York, serving from 1983 to 1994.

having failed to fix the New York City Subway following his declaration of the 2017 New York City transit crisis as well as for not protecting undocumented immigrants, not legalizing recreational marijuana, [78] and not creating a single-payer healthcare system [79] When debating Nixon, Cuomo countered her argument on the subways by pointing out that the system is owned by New York City,

however, revealed that the Cuomo administration had quietly reinterpreted the order, and that Cuomo had collected $890,000 from 24 of his appointees, as well as $1.3 million from the spouses, children

[123] His strong support for New York City's bid to become the home of Amazon's HQ2 faced criticism based on arguments that the costs to the state outweighed the possible benefits [124] Amazon decided

quarter of New York City's power, would be phased out As a result of the phaseout, the carbon-free power generated by the plant was replaced by power generated by carbon-generating fossil fuels As a consequence, New York was estimated to struggle to meet its climate goals [151]\n\n\nGun control and \"gravity knives\"\nOn January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state gun control bill to pass after the December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in neighboring Connecticut [152] The NY SAFE Act was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States [153] The act came under criticism, and the National Rifle Association called it draconian The New York State Sheriffs' Association issued a statement supporting tougher penalties for illegal use of firearms but criticizing several aspects of the legislation, including a magazine limit of seven rounds and a \"too broad\" definition of assault weapons [154]\n\n\nHurricane Sandy\nAfter Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in the state [164] He also

lifting a state ban on the practice of hydraulic fracturing (also known as \"fracking\") [168] to stimulate the economy in upstate New York But critics said that fracking upstate could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania [169] [170] Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited \"significant public health risks\" associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York State [171]\n\n\nIsrael\nIn solidarity with Israel, Cuomo announced an executive order against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement Cuomo tweeted: \"If you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.\" [172]\n\n\nMarijuana legalization\nIn January 2014, Cuomo announced an executive order to allow the limited use of medical marijuana in New York [173] Later that year, a comprehensive bill to legalize medical cannabis was passed by the state legislature, containing some restrictions at Cuomo's insistence such as a ban on consumption by smoking [174] [175] On July 5, 2014, the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law by Governor Cuomo [175] [176]\n\n\nNew York City Subway\nIn June 2017, after a series of subway disasters, Cuomo declared a \"state of emergency\" for the New York City Subway system [178] According to The New York Times, a series of New York City mayors and New York governors, including Cuomo, were partly at fault for the worsening quality of the subway system and inflated construction costs [178] Under the Cuomo administration, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority repeatedly diverted tax revenues earmarked for the subways, paid for services that there was no need for and spent on subway projects that did not boost service or reliability [178] As a result, the MTA was saddled with debt and could not undertake investments into overhauling outdated and inefficient subway infrastructure [178] Cuomo also directed the MTA to spend on projects that the heads of the MTA did not consider to be priorities [178] One reason why the New York City subway system is so expensive is due to exorbitant labor costs; according to several M.T.A officials who were involved in negotiating labor contracts, Cuomo pressured the MTA to accept labor union contracts that were extremely favorable to workers [178] The New York Times noted that Cuomo was closely aligned with the union in question and had received $165,000 in campaign contributions from it [178]\n\n\nPublic college and university tuition\nOn April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget It included the Excelsior Scholarship, a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all SUNY and CUNY universities, [179] [180] though some education experts including Sara Goldrick-Rab say it won't help the poorest students and that the requirement that recipients live and work in New York after graduating is counter-productive [181]\n\n\nPublic employees\nOn July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement furlough days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts [182] In an interview with The New York Times, he stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of public employee pensions [183]\n\n\nPublic housing\nIn the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the New York City Housing Authority by attorney Jim Walden on behalf of a group of public housing tenants The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City [184] By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis [185]\n\n\nRemarks about right-wing conservatives\nIn a January 17, 2014, interview with Susan Arbetter on WCNY's The Capital Pressroom, Cuomo stated:\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nIn keeping with a campaign promise, Cuomo signed the Marriage Equality Act, introducing same-sex marriage, on June 24, 2011, following an \"intense public and private lobbying campaign\", and later called for all states to do the same [191] Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation [192] [193] [194] One prominent advocate stated that for gay Americans, Cuomo was \"the only national politician with hero status\" [193] Following the passage of the Act, Cuomo was criticized for describing the viewpoints of opponents as \"anti-American\" [195] [196] On July 25, 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction against the Act, alleging corruption and violations of the law in the process of passing the bill [197] The trial court initially held that the plaintiffs' case could proceed, but the decision was reversed on appeal [198]\n\n\nStart-Up NY\nIn July 2016, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, released a report indicating that the state's flagship business tax incentive program, called Start-Up NY, had generated 408 jobs since its inception in 2014 Ads promoting the program had cost at least $53 million [199] The Start-Up NY annual report was delayed three months in 2016, leading some lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Schimminger, to call the delays \"curious\" [200]\n\n\nTaxes\nCuomo was praised for his 2011 restructuring of the New York State tax code [201] [202] [203] He was also criticized for allegedly requesting a unanimous Assembly vote in favor of the proposal and threatening to campaign against Assembly members who voted \"no\" [204] – a charge he denied [204] Cuomo also received criticism from voices on the left who felt that the tax reform was insufficient [205] Hoping that the Federal cap on state and local tax deductions will be repealed, Cuomo signed a tax increase on high income workers and corporations and the wealthy worth over one million dollars in 2021  The increase extends until the year 2027 [206]\n\n\nVoting rights\nIn April 2018, Cuomo announced that he would restore the voting rights of parolees through an executive order [207] He said that he would consider restoring the voting rights of all parolees (more than 35,000), and would also enfranchise new parolees throughout his term [207]\n\n\nWomen's issues and abortion\nIn 2013, Cuomo called for the passage of a Women's Equality Act [208] The Women's Equality Act included 10 component bills affecting issues such as domestic violence, human trafficking, and pregnancy discrimination [208] The tenth bill of the Women's Equality Act was the Reproductive Health Act, [209] which would have \"enshrine [d] in state law existing federal protections for abortion rights\", \"shift [ed] the state's abortion law from the criminal code to the health care laws\", and \" [made] it clearer that licensed health care practitioners as well as physicians could perform abortions\" [210] During his 2013 State of the State address, Cuomo said, \"Enact a Reproductive Health Act because it is her body, it is her choice Because it's her body, it's her choice Because it's her body, it's her choice.\" [208] The New York State Assembly passed the Women's Equality Act on June 20, 2013 [211] The Republican leadership of the New York State Senate expressed support for the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women's Equality Act, but objected to the Reproductive Health Act and expressed unwillingness to allow a vote on it [212]\n\n\nControversies\nIn July 2014, it was reported that the Moreland Commission, a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics, [222] was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging [223] Cuomo later disbanded the commission [223] Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo's dealings with the anti-corruption panel and concluded that \"after a thorough investigation\", there was \"insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime\" [224]\n\n\nOfficial corruption\nIn July 2014, it was reported that the Moreland Commission, a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics, [222] was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging [223] Cuomo later disbanded the commission [223] Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo's dealings with the anti-corruption panel and concluded that \"after a thorough investigation\", there was \"insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime\" [224]\n\n\nCOVID-19 nursing home deaths\nOn March 25, 2020, the New York State Department of Health issued an advisory requiring the admission of patients to nursing homes who test positive for the coronavirus and barred testing prospective nursing home patients after the CDC announced that \"patients with COVID-19 could be discharged from a health care facility to both home and long-term care facilities when indicated.\" [245] This was also in federal compliance with the HHS's announcement that \"Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\" [246] Due to widespread misinformation in the press, Cuomo and his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, were wrongfully accused of being the origin of mandating nursing homes to accept patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from hospitals [247] [248] [249]\n\n\nSexual harassment allegations and resignation\nOn December 13, 2020, Lindsey Boylan, a former aide for Cuomo who was a Democratic candidate for Manhattan Borough president in 2021, alleged \" [Cuomo] sexually harassed me for years Many saw it, and watched.\" Boylan further alleged that Cuomo \"exists without ethics\", \"takes advantage of people, including me\" and ran a \"toxic team environment\" [265] [266] [267] A spokesperson for the Cuomo administration denied the accusation [265] Boylan further elaborated on her accusations in February 2021, claiming Cuomo goaded her to play strip poker with him while on a flight in 2017 and forcibly kissed her on the mouth in his Manhattan office [268] The governor's office said Boylan's claims were false [269]\n\n\nPost-gubernatorial career\nCuomo filed for a state retirement pension, to be effective September 1, 2021, based on 14.56 years of state service as attorney general and governor [317]\n\n\nElectoral history\nCuomo

Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, [42] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi [43]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nLower Paleolithic artefacts, dating back 850,000 years, have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo [41] Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, [42] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi [43]\n\n\nAncient Rome\nAncient Rome, a settlement on the river Tiber in central Italy, founded in 753 BC, was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR), expelled the monarchy and established an oligarchic republic.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the Odoacer's kingdom, and was seized by the Ostrogoths [60] Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed \"Dark Ages\" The invasion of another Germanic tribe in the 6th century, the Lombards, reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula The north formed the Lombard kingdom, central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine [61]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nDuring the 1400s and 1500s, Italy was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families [72] Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the Medici of Florence After the end of the Western Schism, newly elected Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity The Medici Bank was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties [72] [73]\n\n\nUnification\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism led to revolution [82] Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged to unite Italy by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control A radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, founder of the political movement Young Italy in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement 1847 saw the first public performance of \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", which became the national anthem in 1946 [83]\n\n\nLiberal period\nSardinia's constitution was extended to all of Italy in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals As northern Italy quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling a large and influential diaspora The Italian Socialist Party increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment In the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by subjugating Eritrea, Somalia, Tripolitania, and Cyrenaica in Africa [91] In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted The pre-World War I period was dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921.\n\n\nFascist regime and World War II\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Mussolini In October 1922, the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party organised a mass demonstration and the \"March on Rome\" coup King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini as prime minister, transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict [98] Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain.\n\n\nRepublican era\nItaly became a republic after the 1946 Italian institutional referendum [109] held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as Festa della Repubblica This was the first time women voted nationally [110] Victor Emmanuel III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate The Republican Constitution was approved in 1948 Under the Treaty of Paris between Italy and the Allied Powers, areas next to the Adriatic Sea were annexed by Yugoslavia, resulting in the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which involved the emigration of around 300,000 Istrian and Dalmatian Italians [111] Italy lost all colonial possessions, ending the Italian Empire.\n\n\nGeography\nItaly, whose territory largely coincides with the eponymous geographical region, [15] is located in Southern Europe (and is also considered part of Western Europe [13]) between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E To the north, from west to east, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain It consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula, Sicily and Sardinia (the biggest islands of the Mediterranean), and many smaller islands Some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin, and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is influenced by the seas that surround Italy on every side except the north, which constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences [138] Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate is highly diverse In most inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic The Po Valley is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers [139] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany, and most of the south generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype, as in the Köppen climate classification.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nItaly's varied geography, including the Alps, Apennines, central Italian woodlands, and southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, contribute to habitat diversity As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean, forming a corridor between Central Europe and North Africa, and having 8,000 km (5,000 mi) of coastline, Italy has received species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East Italy has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna, [141] and the highest level of biodiversity of animal and plant species within the EU [142]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took time to address its environmental problems After improvements, Italy now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability [160] The total area protected by national parks, regional parks, and nature reserves covers about 11% of Italian territory, [161] and 12% of Italy's coastline is protected [162]\n\n\nPolitics\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 1946, when the monarchy was abolished The president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy's head of state The president is elected for a single seven-year term by the Italian Parliament and regional voters in joint session Italy has a written democratic constitution that resulted from a Constituent Assembly formed by representatives of the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy, in World War II [170]\n\n\nGovernment\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system The parliament is perfectly bicameral; each house has the same powers The two houses: the Chamber of Deputies meets in Palazzo Montecitorio, and the Senate of the Republic in Palazzo Madama A peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad: 8 Deputies and 4 Senators are elected in four distinct overseas constituencies There are senators for life, appointed by the president \"for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field\" Former presidents are ex officio life senators.\n\n\nLaw and criminal justice\nThe law of Italy has several sources These are hierarchical: the law or regulation from a lower source cannot conflict with the rule of an upper source (hierarchy of sources) [172] The Constitution of 1948 is the highest source [173] The Constitutional Court of Italy rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution The judiciary bases their decisions on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic Code and later statutes The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court for both criminal and civil appeals.\n\n\nForeign relations\nItaly is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and is a member and strong supporter of international organisations, such as the OECD, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative Its turns in the rotating presidencies of international organisations include the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018, G7 in 2017, and the EU Council in 2014 Italy is a recurrent non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe military history of Italy chronicles a vast time period, lasting from the military conflicts fought by the ancient peoples of Italy, most notably the conquest of the Mediterranean world by the ancient Romans, through the expansion of the Italian city-states and maritime republics during the medieval period and the involvement of the historical Italian states in the Italian Wars and the wars of succession, to the Napoleonic period, the Italian unification, the campaigns of the colonial empire, the two world wars, and into the modern day, with world peacekeeping operations under the aegis of NATO, the EU or the UN.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nItaly is constituted of 20 regions (regioni)—five of which have special autonomous status which enables them to enact legislation on additional matters [192]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants [193] The population density, of 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than most West European countries However, distribution is uneven: the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (almost half the population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennine highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata, and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\nLargest cities\nIn the 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy began to attract substantial flows of immigrants [205] After the fall of the Berlin Wall, and enlargements of the EU, waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of East Europe Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa, with arrivals soaring as a consequence of the Arab Spring Growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China [206] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\n\n\nImmigration\nIn the 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy began to attract substantial flows of immigrants [205] After the fall of the Berlin

a consequence of the Arab Spring Growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China [206] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\n\n\nLanguages\nItaly's official language is Italian [212] [213] There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers around the world, [214] and another 21 million use it as a second language [215] Italian is often natively spoken as a regional dialect, not to be confused with Italy's regional and minority languages; [216] however, during the 20th century, the establishment of a national education system led to a decrease in regional dialects Standardisation was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, due to economic growth and the rise of mass media and television.\n\n\nReligion\nThe Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the government of Vatican City and the worldwide Catholic Church It is recognised as a sovereign entity, headed by the pope, who is also the Bishop of Rome, with which diplomatic relations can be maintained [222] [f]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is mandatory and free from ages six to sixteen, [233] and consists of five stages: kindergarten, primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school, and university [234]\n\n\nHealth\nLife expectancy is 80 for men and 85 for women, placing the country 5th in the world [242] Compared to other Western countries, Italy has a low rate of adult obesity (below 10% [243]), as the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet are very significant [244] In 2013, UNESCO, prompted by Italy, added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, and Croatia [245]\n\n\nEconomy\nItaly has an advanced [251] mixed economy that is the third-largest in the eurozone and 13th-largest in the world by purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP [252] It has the ninth-largest national wealth and the third-largest central bank gold reserve As a founding member of the G7, the eurozone, and the OECD, it is one of the most industrialised nations and a leading country in international trade [253] It is a developed country ranked 30th on the Human Development Index It performs well in life expectancy, healthcare, [254] and education The country is well known for its creative and innovative businesses, [255] a competitive agricultural sector [256] (with the world's largest wine production), [257] and for its influential and high-quality automobile, machinery, food, design, and fashion industries [258]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAccording to the last agricultural census, there were 1.6 million farms in 2010 (−32% since 2000) covering 12,700,000 ha or 31,382,383 acres (63% are in south Italy) [285] 99% are family-operated and small, averaging only 8 ha (20 acres) [285] Of the area in agricultural use, grain fields take up 31%, olive orchards 8%, vineyards 5%, citrus orchards 4%, sugar beets 2%, and horticulture 2% The remainder is primarily dedicated to pastures (26%) and feed grains (12%) [285]\n\n\nTransport\nItaly was the first country to build motorways, the autostrade, reserved for fast traffic and motor vehicles [287] In 2002 there were 668,721 km (415,524 mi) of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487 km (4,031 mi) of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by Atlantia In 2005, about 34,667,000 cars (590 per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the network [288]\n\n\nEnergy\nItaly has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, ranking as the second largest producer in the EU and the ninth in the world Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are significant sources of electricity in the country Renewable sources account for 28% of all electricity produced, with hydro alone reaching 13%, followed by solar at 6%, wind at 4%, bioenergy at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6% [295] The rest of the national demand is supplied by fossil fuels (natural gas 38%, coal 13%, oil 8%) and imports [295] Eni, operating in 79 countries, is one of the seven \"Big Oil\" companies, and one of the world's largest industrial companies [296]\n\n\nScience and technology\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered a scientific community that produced major discoveries the sciences Galileo Galilei played a major role in the Scientific Revolution and is considered the \"father\" of observational astronomy, [299] modern physics, [300] [301] and the scientific method [302] [303]\n\n\nTourism\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for tourism were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, which began in the 17th century, and flourished in the 18th and the 19th centuries [311] This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination [311] For Italy, this was in order to study ancient architecture, local culture, and admire its natural beauty [312]\n\n\nCulture\nItaly is one of the birthplaces of Western culture and a cultural superpower [323] Italy's culture has been shaped by a multitude of regional customs and local centres of power and patronage [324] Italy has made a substantial contribution to the cultural and historical heritage of Europe [325]\n\n\nArchitecture\nItaly is known for its architectural achievements, [328] such as the construction of arches, domes, and similar structures by ancient Rome, the founding of the Renaissance architectural movement in the late 14th to 16th centuries, and as the home of Palladianism, a style that inspired movements such as Neoclassical architecture and influenced designs of country houses all over the world, notably in the UK and US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries.\n\n\nVisual art\nThe history of Italian visual arts is significant to Western painting Roman art was influenced by Greece and can be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings [338] These may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape [339]\n\n\nLiterature\nFormal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome [341] Latin literature was, and is, highly influential, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, and Livy The Romans were famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama, and epigrams [342] In the early 13th century, Francis of Assisi was the first Italian poet, with his religious song Canticle of the Sun [343]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nItalian philosophy had an influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and Renaissance humanism, the Age of Enlightenment, and modern philosophy [354] Formal philosophy was introduced to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone [355] Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Zeno Roman philosophers include Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca the Younger, Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Augustine of Hippo [354]\n\n\nTheatre\nItalian theatre came about in the Middle Ages, with its antecedents dating back to ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy (Magna Graecia), [367] as well as the theatre of the Italic peoples [368] and the theatre of ancient Rome There were two main lines along which theatre developed The first, dramatization of Catholic liturgies, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle, such as staging for city festivals, court preparations of jesters, and songs of the troubadours [369] Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of modern theatre Ancient theatrical texts were translated and staged at courts, and moved to public theatres In the late 15th century, the cities of Ferrara and Rome were important for the rediscovery and renewal of theatre [370]\n\n\nMusic\nFrom folk to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, [376] and many prevailing forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, trace their roots back to innovations in 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\n\n\nCinema\nItalian cinema began just after the Lumière brothers introduced motion picture exhibitions [385] The first Italian director is Vittorio Calcina, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 [386] Cabiria, from 1914, is the most famous Italian silent film [387] [388] The oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s [389]\n\n\nSport\nThe most popular sport is football [406] Italy's team is one of the most successful, with four World Cup victories (1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006) and two UEFA Euro victories (1968 and 2020) [407] Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in Europe, after Spain Italy's top league is Serie A and is followed by millions of fans around the world [408]\n\n\nFashion and design\nItalian fashion has a long tradition Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings (2013), by Global Language Monitor, ranked Rome sixth and Milan twelfth [420] Major Italian fashion labels—such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana—are among the finest fashion houses in the world Jewellers such as Bulgari, Damiani, and Buccellati were founded in Italy The fashion magazine Vogue Italia is one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world [421]\n\n\nCuisine\nItalian cuisine is heavily influenced by Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, Arabic, and Jewish cuisines [426] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World, with items such as potatoes, tomatoes, and maize becoming main ingredients from the 18th century [427] The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, which is rich in pasta, fish, fruits, and vegetables and characterised by its simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients [428] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity, [429] abundance of difference in taste, and as one of the most popular in the world, [430] wielding strong influence abroad [431] [432] [433]\n\n\nPublic holidays, festivals and folklore\nPublic holidays include religious, national, and regional observances Italy's National Day, the Festa della Repubblica ('Republic Day'), [441] is celebrated on 2 June, with the main celebration taking place in Rome, and commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946 [442] The ceremony includes deposition of a wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.\n\n\nSee also\n43°N 12°E﻿ / ﻿43°N 12°E﻿ / 43; 12\n\n\nNotes\n43°N 12°E﻿ / ﻿43°N 12°E﻿ / 43;

"**Italy**\n\nItaly, officially the Italian Republic, is a country located in Southern Europe. It is bordered by France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. The country is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. Italy consists of the entire Italian Peninsula, Sicily, and Sardinia, as well as many smaller islands.\n\n**History**\n\n## Lower Paleolithic artefacts\n\nLower Paleolithic artefacts, dating back 850,000 years, have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo. Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi.\n\n## Prehistory and antiquity\n\nPrehistory and antiquity in Italy are characterized by the presence of various civilizations, including the Etruscans, the ancient Greeks, and the ancient Romans. The Etruscans were a civilization that flourished in central Italy from the 8th to the 1st century BC. They were known for their advanced art and architecture, as well as their system of writing. The ancient Greeks had a significant presence in southern Italy, particularly in the region of Magna Graecia. The ancient Romans, on the other hand, were a powerful and influential civilization that conquered much of the Mediterranean world, including Italy.\n\n## Ancient Rome\n\nAncient Rome, a settlement on the river Tiber in central Italy, was founded in 753 BC. It was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system.

Italy lost all colonial possessions, ending the Italian Empire.\n\n**Geography**\n\nItaly is located in Southern Europe, between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E. The country is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. Italy consists of the entire Italian Peninsula, Sicily, and Sardinia, as well as many smaller islands. The country's terrain is varied, with mountains in the north and central regions, and hills and plains in the south. The Alps form the northern border of Italy, while the Apennine Mountains run along the east coast.\n\n**Climate**\n\nThe climate in Italy is influenced by the seas that surround the country, as well as its varied terrain. The climate is generally mild, with warm summers and cool winters. The Mediterranean climate dominates the coastal regions, while the inland areas experience a more continental climate. The Po Valley, which is the largest plain in Italy, has a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The northern regions, including the Alps and the Dolomites, have a cold climate, with snowfall in the winter and mild temperatures in the summer.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nItaly's varied geography, including the Alps, Apennines, central Italian woodlands, and southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, contribute to habitat diversity. As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean, forming a corridor between Central Europe and North Africa, Italy has received species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Italy has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna.\n\n**Environment**\n\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took time to address its environmental problems. Improvements were made, and Italy now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability. The total area protected by national parks, regional parks, and nature reserves covers about 11% of Italian territory, and 12% of Italy's coastline is protected.\n\n**Politics**\n\nItaly has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 1946, when the monarchy was abolished. The president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, is the head of state. The president is elected for a single seven-year term by the Italian Parliament and regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution that resulted from a Constituent Assembly formed by representatives of the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy, in World War II.\n\n**Government**\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral, with each house having the same powers. The two houses are the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. A peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad, with eight Deputies and four Senators elected in four distinct overseas constituencies.\n\n**Law and criminal justice**\n\nThe law of Italy has several sources, which are hierarchical. The Constitution of 1948 is the highest source. The Constitutional Court of Italy rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution. The judiciary bases their decisions on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic Code and later statutes. The Supreme Court of Cassation is the highest court for both criminal and civil appeals.\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nItaly is a founding member of the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), and of NATO. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955 and is a member and strong supporter of international organizations, including the OECD, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and the Central European Initiative. Italy has held the rotating presidencies of international organizations, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2018, the G7 in 2017, and the EU Council in 2014. Italy is a recurrent non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe military history of Italy chronicles a vast time period, from the military conflicts fought by the ancient peoples of Italy, to the expansion of the Italian city-states and maritime republics during the medieval period, and the involvement of the historical Italian states in the Italian Wars and the wars of succession, to the Napoleonic period, the Italian unification, the campaigns of the colonial empire, the two world wars, and into the modern day, with world peacekeeping operations under the aegis of NATO, the EU, or the UN.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nItaly is constituted of 20 regions, five of which have special autonomous status, which enables them to enact legislation on additional matters. The regions are: Abruzzo, Apulia, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Lazio, Liguria, Lombardy, Marche, Molise, Piedmont, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Umbria, Valle d'Aosta, and Veneto.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nIn 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants. The population density is 202 inhabitants per square kilometer, which is higher than most West European countries. However, distribution is uneven, with the most densely populated areas being the Po Valley (almost half the population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennine highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata, and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n**Immigration**\n\nIn the 1980s, Italy began to attract substantial flows of immigrants. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the enlargements of the EU, waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of East Europe. Another source of immigration is neighboring North Africa, with arrivals soaring as a consequence of the Arab Spring. Growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific, notably China and the Philippines, and Latin America have been recorded.\n\n**Languages**\n\nItaly's official language is Italian. There are an estimated 64 million native Italian speakers around the world, and another 21 million use it as a second language.\n\n**Religion**\n\nThe Holy See, the episcopal jurisdiction of Rome, contains the government of Vatican City and the worldwide Catholic Church.

Compared to other Western countries, Italy has a low rate of adult obesity (below 10%), as the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet are very significant. In 2013, UNESCO, prompted by Italy, added the Mediterranean diet to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Italy, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, and Croatia.\n\n**Economy**\n\nItaly has an advanced mixed economy that is the third-largest in the eurozone and 13th-largest in the world by purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP. It has the ninth-largest national wealth and the third-largest central bank gold reserve. As a founding member of the G7, the eurozone, and the OECD, it is one of the most industrialized nations and a leading country in international trade. It is a developed country ranked 30th on the Human Development Index, performing well in life expectancy, healthcare, and education.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nAccording to the last agricultural census, there were 1.6 million farms in 2010 (−32% since 2000), covering 12,700,000 ha or 31,382,383 acres (63% are in south Italy). 99% are family-operated and small, averaging only 8 ha (20 acres). Of the area in agricultural use, grain fields take up 31%, olive orchards 8%, vineyards 5%, citrus orchards 4%, sugar beets 2%, and horticulture 2%. The remainder is primarily dedicated to pastures (26%) and feed grains (12%).\n\n**Transport**\n\nItaly was the first country to build motorways, the autostrade, reserved for fast traffic and motor vehicles. In 2002, there were 668,721 km of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487 km of motorways, state-owned but privately operated by Atlantia. In 2005, about 34,667,000 cars (590 per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles circulated on the network.\n\n**Energy**\n\nItaly has become one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, ranking as the second-largest producer in the EU and the ninth in the world. Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power are significant sources of electricity in the country. Renewable sources account for 28% of all electricity produced, with hydro alone reaching 13%, followed by solar at 6%, wind at 4%, bioenergy at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%. The rest of the national demand is supplied by fossil fuels (natural gas 38%, coal 13%, oil 8%) and imports. Eni, operating in 79 countries, is one of the seven \"Big Oil\" companies and one of the world's largest industrial companies.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nThrough the centuries, Italy has fostered a scientific community that produced major discoveries in the sciences. Galileo Galilei played a major role in the Scientific Revolution and is considered the \"father\" of observational astronomy, modern physics, and the scientific method.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nPeople have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for tourism were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, which began in the 17th century and flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination. For Italy, this was in order to study ancient architecture, local culture, and admire its natural beauty.\n\n**Culture**\n\nItaly is one of the birthplaces of Western culture and a cultural superpower.

Roman art was influenced by Greece and can be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings. These may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.\n\n**Literature**\n\nFormal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when the first stage play was performed in Rome. Latin literature was, and is, highly influential, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, and Livy. The Romans were famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama, and epigrams.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nItalian philosophy had an influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and Renaissance humanism, the Age of Enlightenment, and modern philosophy. Formal philosophy was introduced to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone. Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Zeno. Roman philosophers include Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca the Younger, Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Augustine of Hippo.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nItalian theatre came about in the Middle Ages, with its antecedents dating back to ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy (Magna Graecia), as well as the theatre of the Italic peoples and the theatre of ancient Rome. There were two main lines along which theatre developed: the dramatization of Catholic liturgies, and the formed by pagan forms of spectacle, such as staging for city festivals, court preparations of jesters, and songs of the troubadours. Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of modern theatre.\n\n**Music**\n\nFrom folk to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy. Many prevailing forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, trace their roots back to innovations in 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nItalian cinema began just after the Lumière brothers introduced motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian director is Vittorio Calcina, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896. Cabiria, from 1914, is the most famous Italian silent film. The oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s.\n\n**Sport**\n\nThe most popular sport is football. Italy's team is one of the most successful, with four World Cup victories (1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006) and two UEFA Euro victories (1968 and 2020). Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in Europe, after Spain. Italy's top league is Serie A and is followed by millions of fans around the world.\n\n**Fashion and design**\n\nItalian fashion has a long tradition.

Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Italy\" following this outline:\n\n\nName\n\n\n\nHistory\nLower Paleolithic artefacts, dating back 850,000 years, have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo [41] Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, [42] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi [43]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nLower Paleolithic artefacts, dating back 850,000 years, have been recovered from Monte Poggiolo [41] Excavations throughout Italy revealed a Neanderthal presence in the Middle Palaeolithic period 200,000 years ago, [42] while modern humans appeared about 40,000 years ago at Riparo Mochi [43]\n\n\nAncient Rome\nAncient Rome, a settlement on the river Tiber in central Italy, founded in 753 BC, was ruled for 244 years by a monarchical system In 509 BC, the Romans, favouring a government of the Senate and the People (SPQR), expelled the monarchy and established an oligarchic republic.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Italy fell under the Odoacer's kingdom, and was seized by the Ostrogoths [60] Invasions resulted in a chaotic succession of kingdoms and the supposed \"Dark Ages\" The invasion of another Germanic tribe in the 6th century, the Lombards, reduced Byzantine presence and ended political unity of the peninsula The north formed the Lombard kingdom, central-south was also controlled by the Lombards, and other parts remained Byzantine [61]\n\n\nEarly modern period\nDuring the 1400s and 1500s, Italy was the birthplace and heart of the Renaissance This era marked the transition from the medieval period to the modern age and was fostered by the wealth accumulated by merchant cities and the patronage of dominant families [72] Italian polities were now regional states effectively ruled by princes, in control of trade and administration, and their courts became centres of the arts and sciences These princedoms were led by political dynasties and merchant families, such as the Medici of Florence After the end of the Western Schism, newly elected Pope Martin V returned to the Papal States and restored Italy as the sole centre of Western Christianity The Medici Bank was made the credit institution of the Papacy, and significant ties were established between the Church and new political dynasties [72] [73]\n\n\nUnification\nThe birth of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula By the mid-19th century, rising Italian nationalism led to revolution [82] Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the political and social Italian unification movement, or Risorgimento, emerged to unite Italy by consolidating the states and liberating them from foreign control A radical figure was the patriotic journalist Giuseppe Mazzini, founder of the political movement Young Italy in the 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement 1847 saw the first public performance of \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", which became the national anthem in 1946 [83]\n\n\nLiberal period\nSardinia's constitution was extended to all of Italy in 1861, and provided basic freedoms for the new state; but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied classes The new kingdom was governed by a parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberals As northern Italy quickly industrialised, southern and northern rural areas remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions to migrate and fuelling a large and influential diaspora The Italian Socialist Party increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment In the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by subjugating Eritrea, Somalia, Tripolitania, and Cyrenaica in Africa [91] In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted The pre-World War I period was dominated by Giovanni Giolitti, prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921.\n\n\nFascist regime and World War II\nThe socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the Russian Revolution, led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small National Fascist Party, led by Mussolini In October 1922, the Blackshirts of the National Fascist Party organised a mass demonstration and the \"March on Rome\" coup King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini as prime minister, transferring power to the fascists without armed conflict [98] Mussolini banned political parties and curtailed personal liberties, establishing a dictatorship These actions attracted international attention and inspired similar dictatorships in Nazi Germany and Francoist Spain.\n\n\nRepublican era\nItaly became a republic after the 1946 Italian institutional referendum [109] held on 2 June, a day celebrated since as Festa della Repubblica This was the first time women voted nationally [110] Victor Emmanuel III's son, Umberto II, was forced to abdicate The Republican Constitution was approved in 1948 Under the Treaty of Paris between Italy and the Allied Powers, areas next to the Adriatic Sea were annexed by Yugoslavia, resulting in the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which involved the emigration of around 300,000 Istrian and Dalmatian Italians [111] Italy lost all colonial possessions, ending the Italian Empire.\n\n\nGeography\nItaly, whose territory largely coincides with the eponymous geographical region, [15] is located in Southern Europe (and is also considered part of Western Europe [13]) between latitudes 35° and 47° N, and longitudes 6° and 19° E To the north, from west to east, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia, and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain It consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula, Sicily and Sardinia (the biggest islands of the Mediterranean), and many smaller islands Some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin, and some islands are located outside the Eurasian continental shelf.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is influenced by the seas that surround Italy on every side except the north, which constitute a reservoir of heat and humidity Within the southern temperate zone, they determine a Mediterranean climate with local differences [138] Because of the length of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous hinterland, the climate is highly diverse In most inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from humid subtropical to humid continental and oceanic The Po Valley is mostly humid subtropical, with cool winters and hot summers [139] The coastal areas of Liguria, Tuscany, and most of the south generally fit the Mediterranean climate stereotype, as in the Köppen climate classification.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nItaly's varied geography, including the Alps, Apennines, central Italian woodlands, and southern Italian Garigue and Maquis shrubland, contribute to habitat diversity As the peninsula is in the centre of the Mediterranean, forming a corridor between Central Europe and North Africa, and having 8,000 km (5,000 mi) of coastline, Italy has received species from the Balkans, Eurasia, and the Middle East Italy has probably the highest level of faunal biodiversity in Europe, with over 57,000 species recorded, representing more than a third of all European fauna, [141] and the highest level of biodiversity of animal and plant species within the EU [142]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took time to address its environmental problems After improvements, Italy now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability [160] The total area protected by national parks, regional parks, and nature reserves covers about 11% of

Security Council.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe military history of Italy chronicles a vast time period, lasting from the military conflicts fought by the ancient peoples of Italy, most notably the conquest of the Mediterranean world by the ancient Romans, through the expansion of the Italian city-states and maritime republics during the medieval period and the involvement of the historical Italian states in the Italian Wars and the wars of succession, to the Napoleonic period, the Italian unification, the campaigns of the colonial empire, the two world wars, and into the modern day, with world

Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennine highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata, and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\nLargest cities\nIn the 1980s, until then a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society, Italy began to attract substantial flows of immigrants [205] After the fall of the Berlin Wall, and enlargements of the EU, waves of migration originated from the former socialist countries of East Europe Another source of immigration is neighbouring North Africa, with arrivals soaring as a consequence of the Arab Spring Growing migration fluxes from Asia-Pacific (notably China [206] and the Philippines) and Latin America have been recorded.\n\n\nImmigration\nIn the 1980s, until then a linguistically and

Rome [341] Latin literature was, and is, highly influential, with numerous writers, poets, philosophers, and historians, such as Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Horace, Propertius, Ovid, and Livy The Romans were famous for their oral tradition, poetry, drama, and epigrams [342] In the early 13th century, Francis of Assisi was the first Italian poet, with his religious song Canticle of the Sun [343]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nItalian philosophy had an influence on Western philosophy, beginning with the Greeks and Romans, and Renaissance humanism, the Age of Enlightenment, and modern philosophy [354] Formal philosophy was introduced to Italy by Pythagoras, founder of the Italian school of philosophy in Crotone [355] Italian philosophers of the Greek period include Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Zeno Roman philosophers include Cicero, Lucretius, Seneca the Younger, Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Augustine of Hippo [354]\n\n\nTheatre\nItalian theatre came about in the Middle Ages, with its antecedents dating back to ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy (Magna Graecia), [367] as well as the theatre of the Italic peoples [368] and the theatre of ancient Rome There were two main lines along which theatre developed The first, dramatization of Catholic liturgies, and the second, formed by pagan forms of spectacle, such as staging for city festivals, court preparations of jesters, and songs of the troubadours [369] Renaissance theatre marked the beginning of modern theatre Ancient theatrical texts were translated and staged at courts, and moved to public theatres In the late 15th century, the cities of Ferrara and Rome were important for the rediscovery and renewal of theatre [370]\n\n\nMusic\nFrom folk to classical, music is an intrinsic part of Italian culture Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy, [376] and many prevailing forms, such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata, trace their roots back to innovations in 16th- and 17th-century Italian music.\n\n\nCinema\nItalian cinema began just after the Lumière brothers introduced motion picture exhibitions [385] The first Italian director is Vittorio Calcina, who filmed Pope Leo XIII in 1896 [386] Cabiria, from 1914, is the most famous Italian silent film [387] [388] The oldest European avant-garde cinema movement, Italian futurism, took place in the late 1910s [389]\n\n\nSport\nThe most popular sport is football [406] Italy's team is one of the most successful, with four World Cup victories (1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006) and two UEFA Euro victories (1968 and 2020) [407] Italian clubs have won 48 major European trophies, making Italy the second most successful country in Europe, after Spain Italy's top league is Serie A and is followed by millions of fans around the world [408]\n\n\nFashion and design\nItalian fashion has a long tradition Top Global Fashion Capital Rankings (2013), by Global Language Monitor, ranked Rome sixth and Milan twelfth [420] Major Italian fashion labels—such as Gucci, Armani, Prada, Versace, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana—are among the finest fashion houses in the world Jewellers such as Bulgari, Damiani, and Buccellati were founded in Italy The fashion magazine Vogue Italia is one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in the world [421]\n\n\nCuisine\nItalian cuisine is heavily influenced by Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, Arabic, and Jewish cuisines [426] Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World, with items such as potatoes, tomatoes, and maize becoming main ingredients from the 18th century [427] The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, which is rich in pasta, fish, fruits, and vegetables and characterised by its simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients [428] Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity, [429] abundance of difference in taste, and as one of the most popular in the world, [430] wielding strong influence abroad [431] [432] [433]\n\n\nPublic holidays, festivals and folklore\nPublic holidays include religious, national, and regional observances Italy's National Day, the Festa della Repubblica ('Republic Day'), [441] is celebrated on 2 June, with the main celebration taking place in Rome, and commemorates the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946 [442] The ceremony includes deposition of a wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.\n\n\nSee

{"title": "2021_Atlantic_hurricane_season", "content": "\nSeasonal forecasts\nIn advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Philip J Klotzbach, William M Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU) The forecasts discuss weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained roughly 14 tropical storms, seven hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 72–111 units [6] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h) [1] NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered [1]\n\n\nPre-season forecasts\nOn December 9, 2020, TSR issued an extended range forecast for the 2021 hurricane season, predicting slightly above-average activity with 16 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of about 127 units TSR cited the expected development of a weak La Niña during the third quarter of 2021 as the main factor behind their forecast [6] CSU released their first predictions on April 8, 2021, predicting an above-average season with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 150 units, citing the unlikelihood of an El Niño and much warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the subtropical Atlantic [7] On the same day, Pennsylvania State University predicted 9–15 named storms, anticipating slightly above-average sea surface temperatures and a neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation [8] TSR updated their forecast on April 13, with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 134 units [9] On the same day, the University of Arizona (UA) issued its seasonal prediction of above-average hurricane activities, with 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 137 units [10] North Carolina State University (NCSU) made its prediction for the season on April 14, calling for an above-average season with 15 to 18 named storms, 7 to 9 hurricanes, and 2 to 3 major hurricanes [11] The Weather Company (TWC) issued their first predictions on April 15, forecasting 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, citing warm sea surface temperatures, a La Niña, and other active seasons with similar atmospheric conditions [12]\n\n\nMid-season forecasts\nThe second prediction by CSU, issued on June 3, increased the number of named storms to 18, while leaving the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes unchanged at 8 and 4, respectively [17] On June 16, UA updated their forecast for the season, with 19 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 183 units [18] On July 6, TSR released their third forecast for the season, slightly increasing their numbers to 20 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes This prediction was largely based on their expectation for a weak La Niña to develop by the third quarter of the year [19] On July 8, CSU updated their prediction to 20 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes [20] UKMO's updated forecast on August 2 called for 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes [21] The second and final forecast by NOAA, issued on August 4, predicted 15 to 21 named storms, 7 to 10 hurricanes, and 3 to 5 major hurricanes [22] On August 5, CSU's final seasonal predictions decreased the number of named storms to 18 and hurricanes to 8, while the number of major hurricanes remained unchanged [23] TSR issued their final forecast for the season on the same day, lowering their numbers to 18 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes [24]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 [7] A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity This made it the third-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, behind only 2005 and 2020 And, like both those seasons, the 2021 season exhausted its primary list of storm names [nb 4] [25] Nine of the systems lasted for two days or less, tied with 2007 for the most since the NHC began monitoring subtropical systems in 1968 Although the season was highly active in terms of the number of named storms, seven of those tropical or subtropical systems intensified into a hurricane and four of those became a major hurricane, which is near-average and just slightly above-average, respectively Nonetheless, 2021 marked the record sixth consecutive above-average season in the Atlantic [26] The ongoing warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, which began in 1995, contributed to the season's high level of activity, as it led to above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [27]\n\n\nBackground\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 [7] A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity This made it the third-most active Atlantic

above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [27]\n\n\nPre/early season activity\nTropical Storm Ana formed on May 22, making 2021 the seventh consecutive year in which a tropical or subtropical cyclone formed before the season's official start Ana formed in a location where no tropical storms within the month of May had been documented since before 1950 [33] In mid-June, a rapidly developing non-tropical low offshore of the North Carolina coast became Tropical Storm Bill The system lasted for only two days before becoming extratropical [34] Later that month, Tropical Storm Claudette formed just off the coast of Louisiana and Tropical Storm Danny developed offshore South Carolina [35] [36] Overall, there were three named storms during the month, tying 1886, 1909, 1936, 1959, 1966, 1968, and later 2023, for most named storms in June [37] Elsa formed on June 30 and became a tropical storm on the following day, making it the earliest fifth-named storm on record, surpassing the previous record by five days, set by Tropical Storm Edouard in 2020 [38] It soon became the first hurricane of the season before impacting the Caribbean and making landfall in Cuba Later, Elsa brought impacts to the Eastern United States, striking Florida on July 7 and New York and Rhode Island on July 9 [39] Thereafter, activity came to a monthlong halt due to unfavorable conditions across the basin [40]\n\n\nPeak to late season activity\nAs the mid-point of the hurricane season approached, [nb 5] Mindy formed on September 8 and struck the Florida Panhandle shortly thereafter [49] It was followed by Nicholas, which developed on September 12 and made landfall along the central Texas coast two days later as a hurricane [50] Three tropical storms—Odette, Peter, and Rose—then formed in quick succession and were steered by prevailing winds away from any interaction with land [51] [52] [53] The busy pace of storm-formation continued late into September Sam, a long-lived major hurricane, developed in the central tropical Atlantic and proceeded to rapidly intensify from a tropical depression to a hurricane within 24 hours on September 23 and 24 Sam peaked in strength on September 26 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane [54] It remained a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) for nearly eight consecutive days, the longest continuous stretch at that intensity for an Atlantic hurricane since Ivan, in 2004 [54] Meanwhile, Subtropical Storm Teresa formed north of Bermuda on September 24 [55] Short-lived Victor developed late in the month at an unusually low latitude of 8.1°N, [56] tying Kirk in 2018 and behind only an unnamed 1902 hurricane (7.7°N) for the southernmost location in which an Atlantic system has reached tropical storm intensity [57]\n\n\nSystems\nAn upper-level trough drifted across the western Atlantic on May 19, inducing the formation of a low-pressure area along a stalled front the next day This system became co-located with an upper-level low, reducing wind shear and causing atmospheric instability, which allowed convection to develop despite cold sea surface temperatures After the disturbance shed its frontal characteristics, it became Subtropical Storm Ana at 06:00 UTC on May 22 about 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda Ana then made counter-clockwise loop due to weak steering currents After the wind field became more symmetrical and convection organized further by early on May 23, Ana transitioned into a tropical storm as it accelerated northeastward amid southwesterly mid-level flow Ana peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) before it encountered increasing wind shear and began losing convection By 18:00 UTC on May 23, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 605 mi (975 km) northeast of Bermuda The extratropical cyclone merged with a trough early on May 24 and was then absorbed by a frontal system later that day [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Ana\nAn upper-level trough drifted across the western Atlantic on May 19, inducing the formation of a low-pressure area along a stalled front the next day This system became co-located with an upper-level low, reducing wind shear and causing atmospheric instability, which allowed convection to develop despite cold sea surface temperatures After the disturbance shed its frontal characteristics, it became Subtropical Storm Ana at 06:00 UTC on May 22 about 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda Ana then made counter-clockwise loop due to weak steering currents After the wind field became more symmetrical and convection organized further by early on May 23, Ana transitioned into a tropical storm as it accelerated northeastward amid southwesterly mid-level flow Ana peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) before it encountered increasing wind shear and began losing convection By 18:00 UTC on May 23, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 605 mi (975 km) northeast of Bermuda The extratropical cyclone merged with a trough early on May 24 and was then absorbed by a frontal system later that day [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Bill\nIn mid-June, a cold front sagged southward across the Mid-Atlantic United States Shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced offshore South Carolina, leading to the formation of an area of low pressure there This low, and the associated convection, became better defined while being directed northeast by a shortwave trough, and a tropical depression formed about 125 mi (200 km) east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, around 06:00 UTC on June 14 Though sheared, the incipient cyclone strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill twelve hours later Banding features became better defined, especially across the northern and western quadrants of the storm, and Bill reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) early on June 15 while paralleling the Northeast United States coastline Its northeast track soon brought the system over colder waters and into higher wind shear, resulting in Bill's transition to an extratropical cyclone approximately 370 mi (595 km) east-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, around 00:00 UTC on June 16 The low dissipated into a trough six hours later before progressing across southeastern Newfoundland [34]\n\n\nTropical Storm Claudette\nIn mid-June, a tropical wave crossed the Caribbean and eventually interacted with the enhanced portion of the monsoon trough in the East Pacific This resulted in a large cyclonic gyre over Central America, with distinct disturbances over the East Pacific and in the Bay of Campeche The latter system moved north, though it struggled with wind shear, resulting in a broad center with multiple swirls and winds largely confined in a rainband to the east Around 00:00 UTC on June 19, the system organized into Tropical Storm Claudette and promptly moved onshore about 30 mi (48 km) south-southwest of Houma, Louisiana, with peak winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) The cyclone weakened to a depression as it moved northeastward over Alabama, but it regained tropical storm intensity while crossing North Carolina and reached a secondary peak intensity just offshore By June 22, Claudette was accelerating northeast and undergoing an extratropical transition, a process it completed around 06:00 UTC that day The extratropical low dissipated on June 23 to the southeast of Nova Scotia [35]\n\n\nTropical Storm Danny\nOn June 22, an upper-level trough detached from the mid-latitude jet stream The system transitioned into an upper-level low over the subtropical central Atlantic during the next few days while trekking southwestward Warmer waters caused convective activity to increase on June 24 while a deep-layer ridge moved the system westward By June 27, the trough developed a closed low-level circulation as it continued to track west-northwestward, and it is estimated that Tropical Depression Four formed by 18:00 UTC that day about 460 mi (740 km) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina Approximately 12 hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny The storm intensified slightly further a few hours later and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1009 mb (29.80 inHg) At 23:20 UTC on June 28, Danny made landfall just north of Hilton Head on Pritchards Island, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) The cyclone rapidly weakened while moving inland, falling to tropical depression intensity just 40 minutes later [36] Danny dissipated over eastern Georgia early on June 29, after satellite imagery revealed that its low-level circulation was no longer well defined [61]\n\n\nHurricane Elsa\nOn June 27, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa The wave initially produced disorganized convection while tracking quickly westward, though a marked increase in convection occurred on June 30 Later that day, satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that a tropical depression formed at 18:00 UTC, about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Elsa [39] The storm continued westward due to a strong subtropical ridge to the north After banding features became more defined and a small inner core developed, Elsa intensified into a hurricane on July 2 Passing near Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent shortly thereafter, the cyclone then reached the Caribbean and attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (29.3 inHg) [39]\n\n\nTropical Storm Fred\nThree tropical waves emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa in late July and early August The waves slowly consolidated and organized while moving generally west-northwestward across the Atlantic The system passed through the Leeward Islands without a well-defined center on August 10 By 00:00 UTC the next day, however, the system developed into Tropical Storm Fred over the northeastern Caribbean just south of Puerto Rico Fred then made landfall near San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, with winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) at 17:00 UTC The storm deteriorated to a tropical depression early on August 12, hours before emerging into the Atlantic off the north coast of Haiti Fred briefly re-intensified into a tropical storm on August 13, but strong wind shear weakened it back to a tropical depression before striking Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 12:00 UTC Land interaction then caused the system to degrade into an open trough early on August 14, but the storm began re-organizing after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico several hours later Fred re-developed into a tropical storm over the eastern Gulf of Mexico around 12:00 UTC the next day as it headed generally northward At 18:00 UTC on August 16, Fred peaked with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (29.3 inHg), just over an hour before making landfall near Cape San Blas, Florida Fred weakened to a tropical depression over Alabama on August 17, before weakening into a remnant low over Tennessee at 00:00 UTC on August 18 The remnant low became extratropical about 24 hours later over Pennsylvania This system persisted until dissipating over Massachusetts on August 20 [41]\n\n\nHurricane Grace\nOn August 9, a tropical wave entered the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa Although satellite imagery noted a mid-level circulation, scatterometer data indicated that the system did not have a surface circulation Tracking quickly westward, the system acquired sufficient convective organization and a surface circulation, and thus, it became a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 13, approximately 1,015 mi (1,635 km) east of the Leeward Islands Moving westward due to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Grace on August 14 following a significant increase in deep convection However, dry air and the storm's quick motion caused Grace to weaken back to a tropical depression early the next day as it approached the Leeward Islands Grace soon entered the Caribbean and initially remained weak, but the cyclone reintensified into a tropical storm on August 16 Around 16:30 UTC, the system made landfall near Oviedo, Dominican Republic, with winds of 40 mph (64 km/h), and subsequently brushed Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula [42]\n\n\nHurricane Henri\nBetween August 11 and August 12, a mid-level disturbance and its associated convection moved offshore the Mid-Atlantic The system spawned a weak surface trough on August 14, which became a surface low-pressure area early the following day After deep convection organized further, a tropical depression formed at 18:00 UTC on August 15 about 230 mi (370 km) north-northeast of Bermuda Tracking southward due to a nearby mid-level high-pressure area, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Henri about 24 hours later Due to persistent wind shear, the center was consistently near the western edge of its convection Late on August 18, however, Henri intensified into a high-end tropical storm as the convection organized and wrapped around the mid-level circulation center For the next three days, Henri remained as a strong tropical storm whilst curving northwards as it rounded the western edge of the Azores High At 12:00 UTC on August 21, Henri strengthened to a hurricane as wind shear relaxed, [43] allowing the low-level and the mid-level circulation centers to align [73] Henri weakened to a tropical storm on August 22, shortly before making two landfalls in Rhode Island, first on Block Island and later near Westerly with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) After landfall, Henri rapidly weakened to a tropical depression as it made a small loop Late on August 23, Henri degenerated into a remnant low over southeastern New York The remnant low moved eastward and dissipated in the Atlantic east of New England on the next day [43]\n\n\nHurricane Ida\nMultiple systems, including a westward-moving tropical wave and a broad low-pressure area, began interacting in the Caribbean near the ABC islands on August 24 Convection associated with the disturbance increased and concentrated further over the next few days, resulting in the formation of a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 26 just southwest of Jamaica Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ida, based on reconnaissance flight data Moving northwestward, Ida strengthened quicker after passing the Cayman Islands, reaching hurricane status late on August 27 At 18:00 UTC, the cyclone struck Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and then the mainland at 23:25 UTC near Playa Dayaniguas, Pinar del Río Province After crossing Cuba and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Ida entered a region of light wind shear and water temperatures exceeding 86 °F (30 °C), resulting in rapid intensification, with the storm strengthening to a Category 2 hurricane early on August 29 and to a Category 3 hurricane within six hours as the system cleared out a warm eye Thereafter, Ida became a Category 4 hurricane at 12:00 UTC as it neared the Louisiana coast Simultaneously, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar (27.4 inHg) [44]\n\n\nTropical Storm Kate\nOn August 22, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic The wave, accompanied by a broad area of low pressure, moved quickly to the west and west-northward, passing well south of the Cabo Verde Islands After decelerating and curving northwestward due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, the system organized into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 28 while situated approximately 805 mi (1,295 km) east of the Leeward Islands The depression moved generally northward and remained weak due to strong wind shear generated by a broad mid-to-upper-level trough A temporary burst in convection allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Kate early on August 30 and soon peaked with winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004 mbar (29.6 inHg) However, strong wind shear and very dry mid-level air caused Kate to weaken to a tropical depression on August 31 By 18:00 UTC on September 1, Kate degenerated into a trough about 960 mi (1,545 km) northeast of the Leeward Islands The remnants continued north-northwestward until dissipating a few days later [46]\n\n\nTropical Storm Julian\nA tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 20 After the wave split between August 23 and August 24, its northern portion tracked northwestward toward a subtropical ridge and later northward around the ridge's western periphery Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear allowed the disturbance to acquire deep convection and a low-level circulation Consequently, the system became a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 28 approximately 890 mi (1,430 km) east of Bermuda Early the next day, the depression attained wind speeds of a tropical storm and was named Julian Although wind shear left convection displaced to the northeast of Julian's center, seas remained warm, allowing some intensification as the storm headed rapidly northeastward due to an approaching cold front Late on August 29, Julian peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (29.3 inHg) However, the storm soon began interacting with the cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC on August 30 about 865 mi (1,390 km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland The remnants of Julian turned northward on August 31 and merged with a large extratropical system over the far north Atlantic later that day [45]\n\n\nHurricane Larry\nOn August 30, a strong tropical wave and an accompanying broad area of low pressure emerged off the west coast of Africa Deep convection quickly began to increase around the eastern portion of the circulation as it moved over the far eastern tropical Atlantic The system organized into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 31 while located about 320 mi (520 km) south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Larry six hours later Located within favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions, the cyclone steadily strengthened while moving generally westward across the Atlantic to the south of a strong mid-level ridge A small inner-core developed late on September 1, and, by 06:00 UTC on September 2, a well-defined low- to midlevel eye feature became apparent, indicating that Larry had attained hurricane status The storm intensified to Category 2 strength late on September 3 Then, after battling against some shear and an intrusion of dry mid-level air during an eyewall replacement cycle, Larry became a Category 3 major hurricane by 00:00 UTC on September 4 [47] While maintaining Category 3 status for multiple days, Larry gained annular characteristics and completed two eyewall replacement cycles [75] [76] [77]\n\n\nTropical Storm Mindy\nOn August 22, a tropical wave and its associated broad low-pressure area exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic The wave moved westward across the Atlantic for nearly a week, while a portion of it split-off and became Tropical Storm Kate on August 28 Thereafter, the system crossed the Caribbean and reached Central America by September 2 Part of the wave then detached again and contributed to the development of Hurricane Olaf in the eastern Pacific The remainder of the wave moved slowly northwestward and reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 5 A burst in deep convection late on September 8 resulted in the formation of Tropical Storm Mindy over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico Moderate wind shear and warm water temperatures allowed Mindy to peak with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,000 mbar (30 inHg) before it made landfall on St Vincent Island, Florida, at 01:15 UTC on the following day Heading east-northeastward, the storm weakened to a tropical depression over southeast Georgia around 12:00 UTC and degenerated into a remnant low late on September 9 after emerging into the Atlantic The remnant circulation merged with a baroclinic zone area on September 11 [49]\n\n\nHurricane Nicholas\nA tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic on August 28 For several days, convection remained disorganized while the system trekked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean Although the wave struck Central America on September 9, a surface trough remained in the western Caribbean The trough reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 11 and quickly developed a circulation and additional convection by the next day With reconnaissance aircraft flights observing tropical storm-force winds, the system became Tropical Storm Nicholas around 12:00 UTC on September 12 over the Bay of Campeche Despite warm seas and unstable atmospheric conditions, Nicholas only strengthened gradually due to moderate wind shear as it headed north-northwestward around a subtropical ridge On September 13, a weakness in the ridge caused the cyclone to curve north-northeastward Based on a weather station at Matagorda Bay reporting sustained hurricane-force winds, Nicholas intensified into a hurricane around 00:00 UTC on September 14 Shortly thereafter, at 05:30 UTC, Nicholas made landfall near Sargent Beach, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 km/h) The system quickly weakened inland to tropical storm strength as it moved east-northeastward towards Galveston Bay Around 00:00 UTC on September 15, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, approximately 18 hours prior to degenerating into a remnant low over southwestern Louisiana The remnant low meandered over Louisiana and briefly re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a mid-latitude trough on September 20 [50]\n\n\nTropical Storm Odette\nOn September 11, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather over the southeastern Bahamas [83] As the system moved northwestward to north-northwestward, a low-pressure area formed well east of northeast Florida early on September 16 Despite the low having a relatively well-defined circulation, convection was disorganized and displaced from the center due to wind shear By 18:00 UTC on September 17, the system organized into Tropical Storm Odette about 175 mi (280 km) east of the North Carolina–Virginia state line Early on the following day, however, the cyclone was already beginning to lose tropical characteristics due to colder and drier air [51] During this process, its deep convection was consistently displaced well to the east of a poorly-defined center due to strong westerly wind shear The system's circulation was elongated from southwest to northeast and contained multiple low-cloud swirls [84] Odette completed an extratropical transition by 12:00 UTC on September 18, about 290 mi (465 km) east-southeast of Atlantic City, New Jersey The remnants of Odette retained gale-force winds and continued moving out into the central Atlantic, curving northeastward, before turning southward, making a slow counterclockwise curve During this time, the NHC monitored Odette's remnants for the potential to redevelop into a subtropical or tropical cyclone [85] However, the remnants of Odette failed to organize further, and it succumbed to high upper-level winds [86] Thereafter, a strengthening ridge situated over the northwestern Atlantic caused the remnants of Odette to turn south-southeastward and later to the south-southwest The extratropical low degenerated into a trough on September 27 [51]\n\n\nTropical Storm Peter\nOn September 8, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave over west Africa [87] The wave emerged into the Atlantic between September 13 and September 14, producing a large burst of convection but lacking a closed circulation Moving westward, convection became more concentrated over the next few days, and by late on September 18, the system acquired a closed circulation according to a NOAA buoy and satellite imagery As a result, a tropical depression developed by 00:00 UTC on September 19 about 605 mi (975 km) east of the Leeward Islands Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Peter Relatively light wind shear and warm seas allowed Peter to reach a peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,005 mbar (29.7 inHg) late on September 19 However, as the storm approached the northern Leeward Islands on September 20, it encountered nearly 35 mph (55 km/h) of southwesterly wind shear from a nearby upper low As a result, Peter's low-level center was displaced west of its showers and thunderstorms Later on September 21, the system weakened to a tropical depression and degenerated into a trough about 230 mi (370 km) north of Puerto Rico around 00:00 UTC on September 23 [52] Although the NHC monitored the remnants due to the potential for redevelopment, [88] the system dissipated well south of Newfoundland on September 29 [52]\n\n\nTropical Storm Rose\nThe National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave approaching the Atlantic coast of Africa on September 14 [90] After moving into the far eastern tropical Atlantic early on September 16, the wave acquired a low-pressure center, though it remained disorganized By 00:00 UTC on September 19, the disturbance had acquired a well-defined circulation and enough organized deep convection for it to be designated a tropical depression around 375 mi (605 km) south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands Despite wind shear and dry air impacting the depression's eastern quadrants, [53] satellite images showed that the deep convection increased within the cyclone and that its overall structure continued to improve, [91] with the system becoming Tropical Storm Rose late on September 19 Around 00:00 UTC on September 21, Rose peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004 mbar (29.6 inHg) However, a sharp increase in wind shear weakened the cyclone to a minimal tropical storm several hours later and to a tropical depression early the next day By 12:00 UTC on September 22, Rose degenerated into a remnant low while situated roughly 980 mi (1,575 km) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands The low moved northwestward until curving northward on the following day Early on September 24, the low became an open trough [53]\n\n\nHurricane Sam\nOn September 19, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa and into the Atlantic The wave consisted of fairly concentrated convective activity as it moved westward to the south of the Capo Verde Islands on the following day By 18:00 UTC on September 22, the wave organized enough to become a tropical depression approximately 660 mi (1,060 km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde's southernmost islands The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Sam around 06:00 UTC on September 23 Thereafter, very low wind shear and warm waters allowed Sam to reach hurricane status about 24 hours later as it tracked westward to west-northward along the eastern periphery of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone Intensification then briefly ceased, but by 12:00 UTC on September 25, Sam reached Category 3 hurricane status Satellite images showed a well-defined eye embedded in a developing central dense overcast, and following an increase in Dvorak intensity estimates, Sam became a Category 4 hurricane late on September 25 [54]\n\n\nSubtropical Storm Teresa\nA weak cold front first began pushing into the western Atlantic on September 19 As this front interacted with an upper-level low moving in from the west, it generated an area of disturbed weather, with increasing convection located near a developing surface center That disturbance, nestled underneath the upper-level low, developed into a subtropical depression around 06:00 UTC on September 24 while located about 175 mi (280 km) east-southeast of Bermuda Over the next 12 hours, the depression intensified into Subtropical Storm Teresa and reached peak winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) As the cyclone moved northwest but then veered northeast, it encountered dry air and wind shear promptly causing it to weaken Teresa degenerated to a remnant low around 18:00 UTC on September 25 The low weakened to a trough the next day, and that trough was absorbed by a frontal system on September 27 [55]\n\n\nTropical Storm Victor\nA vigorous tropical wave moved off Africa on September 27 and swiftly organized into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on September 29 At that time, the system was located about 535 mi (860 km) south of Cabo Verde The newly formed cyclone moved west-northwest on the south side of a ridge While ocean temperatures and wind shear values were conducive, the storm was surrounded by some dry air that intermittently became entrained into its circulation The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Victor at 18:00 UTC on September 29 and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) about two days later As Victor turned northwest, it encountered starkly higher wind shear which resulted in its weakening Its convection became displaced and its low-level circulation elongated, which led to its degeneration to a trough around 12:00 UTC on October 4 The remnants turned west and dissipated over the open Atlantic the next day [56]\n\n\nTropical Storm Wanda\nOn October 24, the NHC began monitoring a non-tropical disturbance just off the East Coast of the United States, anticipating that it would shortly develop into a strong low-pressure system, a nor'easter, as it moved northward up the coast, and then possibly develop tropical or subtropical characteristics afterward while moving away from the coast [94] [95] After bringing heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and coastal flooding to areas in the Northeastern United States between October 25 and October 27, the storm acquired subtropical characteristics early on October 31, while located roughly 595 mi (960 km) off Cape Race, Newfoundland, and was given the name Wanda That same day, Wanda peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 983 mbar (29.0 inHg) By 12:00 UTC on November 1, the system transitioned into a tropical storm [58] After meandering well west of the Azores for several days, Wanda turned southward on November 5 due to a narrow, strengthening ridge to the northwest, before accelerating northeastward late on November 6 as it interacted with a mid-level trough over the northern Atlantic [58] By November 7, Wanda had lost its deep convection and became a post-tropical low at 12:00 UTC about 430 mi (690 km) west-northwest of the westernmost islands of the Azores, several hours before merging with a frontal system [58]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2021 [97] This was the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exceptions of Elsa and Julian, which replaced Erika and Joaquin, respectively [98] Both new names were used for the first time this year, along with Rose, Sam, Teresa, Victor, and Wanda [99]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn April 27, 2022, during the 44th Session of the RA IV Hurricane Committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ida from its rotating name lists due to the catastrophic damage it caused, and it will not be used again in the North Atlantic basin Ida was replaced with Imani, which will first appear on the 2027 season list [100]\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example

following this outline:\n\n\nSeasonal forecasts\nIn advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Climate Prediction Center, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), the United Kingdom's Met Office (UKMO), and Philip J Klotzbach, William M Gray and their associates at Colorado State University (CSU) The forecasts discuss weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1991 and 2020 contained roughly 14 tropical storms, seven hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 72–111 units [6] Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h) [1] NOAA typically categorizes a season as above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is sometimes also considered [1]\n\n\nPre-season forecasts\nOn December 9, 2020, TSR issued an extended range forecast for the 2021 hurricane season, predicting slightly above-average activity with 16 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of about 127 units TSR cited the expected development of a weak La Niña during the third quarter of 2021 as the main factor behind their forecast [6] CSU released their first predictions on April 8, 2021, predicting an above-average season with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 150 units, citing the unlikelihood of an El Niño and much warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the subtropical Atlantic [7] On the same day, Pennsylvania State University predicted 9–15 named storms, anticipating slightly above-average sea surface temperatures and a neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation [8] TSR updated their forecast on April 13, with 17 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, with an ACE index of 134 units [9] On the same day, the University of Arizona (UA) issued its seasonal prediction of above-average hurricane activities, with 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 137 units [10] North Carolina State University (NCSU) made its prediction for the season on April 14, calling for an above-average season with 15 to 18 named storms, 7 to 9 hurricanes, and 2 to 3 major hurricanes [11] The Weather Company (TWC) issued their first predictions on April 15, forecasting 18 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes, citing warm sea surface temperatures, a La Niña, and other active seasons with similar atmospheric conditions [12]\n\n\nMid-season forecasts\nThe second prediction by CSU, issued on June 3, increased the number of named storms to 18, while leaving the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes unchanged at 8 and 4, respectively [17] On June 16, UA updated their forecast for the season, with 19 named storms, 6 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 183 units [18] On July 6, TSR released their third forecast for the season, slightly increasing their numbers to 20 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes This prediction was largely based on their expectation for a weak La Niña to develop by the third quarter of the year [19] On July 8, CSU updated their prediction to 20 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes [20] UKMO's updated forecast on August 2 called for 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes [21] The second and final forecast by NOAA, issued on August 4, predicted 15 to 21 named storms, 7 to 10 hurricanes, and 3 to 5 major hurricanes [22] On August 5, CSU's final seasonal predictions decreased the number of named storms to 18 and hurricanes to 8, while the number of major hurricanes remained unchanged [23] TSR issued their final forecast for the season on the same day, lowering their numbers to 18 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes [24]\n\n\nSeasonal summary\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to November 30 [7] A total of 21 tropical depressions formed, all of which reached at least tropical or subtropical intensity This made it the third-most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, behind only 2005 and 2020 And, like both those seasons, the 2021 season exhausted its primary list of storm names [nb 4] [25] Nine of the systems lasted for two days or less, tied with 2007 for the most since the NHC began monitoring subtropical systems in 1968 Although the season was highly active in terms of the number of named storms, seven of those tropical or subtropical systems intensified into a hurricane and four of those became a major hurricane, which is near-average and just slightly above-average, respectively Nonetheless, 2021 marked the record sixth consecutive above-average season in the Atlantic [26] The ongoing warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, which began in 1995, contributed to the season's high level of activity, as it led to above-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [27]\n\n\nBackground\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially ran from June 1 to

temperatures in the Atlantic basin Other factors included the presence of a La Niña and abnormally heavy West African Monsoon precipitation [27]\n\n\nPre/early season activity\nTropical Storm Ana formed on May 22, making 2021 the seventh consecutive year in which a tropical or subtropical cyclone formed before the season's official start Ana formed in a location where no tropical storms within the month of May had been documented since before 1950 [33] In mid-June, a rapidly developing non-tropical low offshore of the North Carolina coast became Tropical Storm Bill The system lasted for only two days before becoming extratropical [34] Later that month, Tropical Storm Claudette formed just off the coast of Louisiana and Tropical Storm Danny developed offshore South Carolina [35] [36] Overall, there were three named storms during the month, tying 1886, 1909, 1936, 1959, 1966, 1968, and later 2023, for most named storms in June [37] Elsa formed on June 30 and became a tropical storm on the following day, making it the earliest fifth-named storm on record, surpassing the previous record by five days, set by Tropical Storm Edouard in 2020 [38] It soon became the first hurricane of the season before impacting the Caribbean and making landfall in Cuba Later, Elsa brought impacts to the Eastern United States, striking Florida on July 7 and New York and Rhode Island on July 9 [39] Thereafter, activity came to a monthlong halt due to unfavorable conditions across the basin [40]\n\n\nPeak to late season activity\nAs the mid-point of the hurricane season approached, [nb 5] Mindy formed on September 8 and struck the Florida Panhandle shortly thereafter [49] It was followed by Nicholas, which developed on September 12 and made landfall along the central Texas coast two days later as a hurricane [50] Three tropical storms—Odette, Peter, and Rose—then formed in quick succession and were steered by prevailing winds away from any interaction with land [51] [52] [53] The busy pace of storm-formation continued late into September Sam, a long-lived major hurricane, developed in the central tropical Atlantic and proceeded to rapidly intensify from a tropical depression to a hurricane within 24 hours on September 23 and 24 Sam peaked in strength on September 26 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane [54] It remained a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) for nearly eight consecutive days, the longest continuous stretch at that intensity for an Atlantic hurricane since Ivan, in 2004 [54] Meanwhile, Subtropical Storm Teresa formed north of Bermuda on September 24 [55] Short-lived Victor developed late in the month at an unusually low latitude of 8.1°N, [56] tying Kirk in 2018 and behind only an unnamed 1902 hurricane (7.7°N) for the southernmost location in which an Atlantic system has reached tropical storm intensity [57]\n\n\nSystems\nAn upper-level trough drifted across the western Atlantic on May 19, inducing the formation of a low-pressure area along a stalled front the next day This system became co-located with an upper-level low, reducing wind shear and causing atmospheric instability, which allowed convection to develop despite cold sea surface temperatures After the disturbance shed its frontal characteristics, it became Subtropical Storm Ana at 06:00 UTC on May 22 about 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda Ana then made counter-clockwise loop due to weak steering currents After the wind field became more symmetrical and convection organized further by early on May 23, Ana transitioned into a tropical storm as it accelerated northeastward amid southwesterly mid-level flow Ana peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) before it encountered increasing wind shear and began losing convection By 18:00 UTC on May 23, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 605 mi (975 km) northeast of Bermuda The extratropical cyclone merged with a trough early on May 24 and was then absorbed by a frontal system later that day [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Ana\nAn upper-level trough drifted across the western Atlantic on May 19, inducing the formation of a low-pressure area along a stalled front the next day This system became co-located with an upper-level low, reducing wind shear and causing atmospheric instability, which allowed convection to develop despite cold sea surface temperatures After the disturbance shed its frontal characteristics, it became Subtropical Storm Ana at 06:00 UTC on May 22 about 200 mi (320 km) northeast of Bermuda Ana then made counter-clockwise loop due to weak steering currents After the wind field became more symmetrical and convection organized further by early on May 23, Ana transitioned into a tropical storm as it accelerated northeastward amid southwesterly mid-level flow Ana peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) before it encountered increasing wind shear and began losing convection By 18:00 UTC on May 23, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 605 mi (975 km) northeast of Bermuda The extratropical cyclone merged with a trough early on May 24 and was then absorbed by a frontal system later that day [59]\n\n\nTropical Storm Bill\nIn mid-June, a cold front sagged southward across the Mid-Atlantic United States Shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced offshore South Carolina, leading to the formation of an area of low pressure there This low, and the associated convection, became better defined while being directed northeast by a shortwave trough, and a tropical depression formed about 125 mi (200 km) east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, around 06:00 UTC on June 14 Though sheared, the incipient cyclone strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill twelve hours later Banding features became better defined, especially across the northern and western quadrants of the storm, and Bill reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) early on June 15 while paralleling the Northeast United States coastline Its northeast track soon brought the system over colder waters and into higher wind shear, resulting in Bill's transition to an extratropical cyclone approximately 370 mi (595 km) east-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, around 00:00 UTC on June 16 The low dissipated into a trough six hours later before progressing across southeastern Newfoundland [34]\n\n\nTropical Storm Claudette\nIn mid-June, a tropical wave crossed the Caribbean and eventually interacted with the enhanced portion of the monsoon trough in the East Pacific This resulted in a large cyclonic gyre over Central America, with distinct disturbances over the East Pacific and in the Bay of Campeche The latter system moved north, though it struggled with wind shear, resulting in a broad center with multiple swirls and winds largely confined in a rainband to the east Around 00:00 UTC on June 19, the system organized into Tropical Storm Claudette and promptly moved onshore about 30 mi (48 km) south-southwest of Houma, Louisiana, with peak winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) The cyclone weakened to a depression as it moved northeastward over Alabama, but it regained tropical storm intensity while crossing North Carolina and reached a secondary peak intensity just offshore By June 22, Claudette was accelerating northeast and undergoing an extratropical transition, a process it completed around 06:00 UTC that day The extratropical low dissipated on June 23 to the southeast of Nova Scotia [35]\n\n\nTropical Storm Danny\nOn June 22, an upper-level trough detached from the mid-latitude jet stream The system transitioned into an upper-level low over the subtropical central Atlantic during the next few days while trekking southwestward Warmer waters caused convective activity to increase on June 24 while a deep-layer ridge moved the system westward By June 27, the trough developed a closed low-level circulation as it continued to track west-northwestward, and it is estimated that Tropical Depression Four formed by 18:00 UTC that day about 460 mi (740 km) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina Approximately 12 hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny The storm intensified slightly further a few hours later and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1009 mb (29.80 inHg) At 23:20 UTC on June 28, Danny made landfall just north of Hilton Head on Pritchards Island, South Carolina, with sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) The cyclone rapidly weakened while moving inland, falling to tropical depression intensity just 40 minutes later [36] Danny dissipated over eastern Georgia early on June 29, after satellite imagery revealed that its low-level circulation was no longer well defined [61]\n\n\nHurricane Elsa\nOn June 27, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa The wave initially produced disorganized convection while tracking quickly westward, though a marked increase in convection occurred on June 30 Later that day, satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that a tropical depression formed at 18:00 UTC, about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Elsa [39] The storm continued westward due to a strong subtropical ridge to the north After banding features became more defined and a small inner core developed, Elsa intensified into a hurricane on July 2 Passing near Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent shortly thereafter, the cyclone then reached the Caribbean and attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 991 mbar (29.3 inHg) [39]\n\n\nTropical Storm Fred\nThree tropical waves emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa in late July and early August The waves slowly consolidated and organized while moving generally west-northwestward across the Atlantic The system passed through the Leeward Islands without a well-defined center on August 10 By 00:00 UTC the next day, however, the system developed into Tropical Storm Fred over the northeastern Caribbean just south of Puerto Rico Fred then made landfall near San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, with winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) at 17:00 UTC The storm deteriorated to a tropical depression early on August 12, hours before emerging into the Atlantic off the north coast of Haiti Fred briefly re-intensified into a tropical storm on August 13, but strong wind shear weakened it back to a tropical depression before striking Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 12:00 UTC Land interaction then caused the system to degrade into an open trough early on August 14, but the storm began re-organizing after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico several hours later Fred re-developed into a tropical storm over the eastern Gulf of Mexico around 12:00 UTC the next day as it headed generally northward At 18:00 UTC on August 16, Fred peaked with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (29.3 inHg), just over an hour before making landfall near Cape San Blas, Florida Fred weakened to a tropical depression over Alabama on August 17, before weakening into a remnant low over Tennessee at 00:00 UTC on August 18 The remnant low became extratropical about 24 hours later over Pennsylvania This system persisted until dissipating over Massachusetts on August 20 [41]\n\n\nHurricane Grace\nOn August 9, a tropical wave entered the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa Although satellite imagery noted a mid-level circulation, scatterometer data indicated that the system did not have a surface circulation Tracking quickly westward, the system acquired sufficient convective organization and a surface circulation, and thus, it became a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 13, approximately 1,015 mi (1,635 km) east of the Leeward Islands Moving westward due to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Grace on August 14 following a significant increase in deep convection However, dry air and the storm's quick motion caused Grace to weaken back to a tropical depression early the next day as it approached the Leeward Islands Grace soon entered the Caribbean and initially remained weak, but the cyclone reintensified into a tropical storm on August 16 Around 16:30 UTC, the system made landfall near Oviedo, Dominican Republic, with winds of 40 mph (64 km/h), and subsequently brushed Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula [42]\n\n\nHurricane Henri\nBetween August 11 and August 12, a mid-level disturbance and its associated convection moved offshore the Mid-Atlantic The system spawned a weak surface trough on August 14, which became a surface low-pressure area early the following day After deep convection organized further, a tropical depression formed at 18:00 UTC on August 15 about 230 mi (370 km) north-northeast of Bermuda Tracking southward due to a nearby mid-level high-pressure area, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Henri about 24 hours later Due to persistent wind shear, the center was consistently near the western edge of its convection Late on August 18, however, Henri intensified into a high-end tropical storm as the convection organized and wrapped around the mid-level circulation center For the next three days, Henri remained as a strong tropical storm whilst curving northwards as it rounded the western edge of the Azores High At 12:00 UTC on August 21, Henri strengthened to a hurricane as wind shear relaxed, [43] allowing the low-level and the mid-level circulation centers to align [73] Henri weakened to a tropical storm on August 22, shortly before making two landfalls in Rhode Island, first on Block Island and later near Westerly with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) After landfall, Henri rapidly weakened to a tropical depression as it made a small loop Late on August 23, Henri degenerated into a remnant low over southeastern New York The remnant low moved eastward and dissipated in the Atlantic east of New England on the next day [43]\n\n\nHurricane Ida\nMultiple systems, including a westward-moving tropical wave and a broad low-pressure area, began interacting in the Caribbean near the ABC islands on August 24 Convection associated with the disturbance increased and concentrated further over the next few days, resulting in the formation of a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 26 just southwest of Jamaica Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ida, based on reconnaissance flight data Moving northwestward, Ida strengthened quicker after passing the Cayman Islands, reaching hurricane status late on August 27 At 18:00 UTC, the cyclone struck Isla de la Juventud, Cuba, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and then the mainland at 23:25 UTC near Playa Dayaniguas, Pinar del Río Province After crossing Cuba and entering the Gulf of Mexico, Ida entered a region of light wind shear and water temperatures exceeding 86 °F (30 °C), resulting in rapid intensification, with the storm strengthening to a Category 2 hurricane early on August 29 and to a Category 3 hurricane within six hours as the system cleared out a warm eye Thereafter, Ida became a Category 4 hurricane at 12:00 UTC as it neared the Louisiana coast Simultaneously, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 929 mbar (27.4 inHg) [44]\n\n\nTropical Storm Kate\nOn August 22, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic The wave, accompanied by a broad area of low pressure, moved quickly to the west and west-northward, passing well south of the Cabo Verde Islands After decelerating and curving northwestward due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, the system organized into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 28 while situated approximately 805 mi (1,295 km) east of the Leeward Islands The depression moved generally northward and remained weak due to strong wind shear generated by a broad mid-to-upper-level trough A temporary burst in convection allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Kate early on August 30 and soon peaked with winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004 mbar (29.6 inHg) However, strong wind shear and very dry mid-level air caused Kate to weaken to a tropical depression on August 31 By 18:00 UTC on September 1, Kate degenerated into a trough about 960 mi (1,545 km) northeast of the Leeward Islands The remnants continued north-northwestward until dissipating a few days later [46]\n\n\nTropical Storm Julian\nA tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 20 After the wave split between August 23 and August 24, its northern portion tracked northwestward toward a subtropical ridge and later northward around the ridge's western periphery Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear allowed the disturbance to acquire deep convection and a low-level circulation Consequently, the system became a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 28 approximately 890 mi (1,430 km) east of Bermuda Early the next day, the depression attained wind speeds of a tropical storm and was named Julian Although wind shear left convection displaced to the northeast of Julian's center, seas remained warm, allowing some intensification as the storm headed rapidly northeastward due to an approaching cold front Late on August 29, Julian peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 993 mbar (29.3 inHg) However, the storm soon began interacting with the cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC on August 30 about 865 mi (1,390 km) east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland The remnants of Julian turned northward on August 31 and merged with a large extratropical system over the far north Atlantic later that day [45]\n\n\nHurricane Larry\nOn August 30, a strong tropical wave and an accompanying broad area of low pressure emerged off the west coast of Africa Deep convection quickly began to increase around the eastern portion of the circulation as it moved over the far eastern tropical Atlantic The system organized into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 31 while located about 320 mi (520 km) south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Larry six hours later Located within favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions, the cyclone steadily strengthened while moving generally westward across the Atlantic to the south of a strong mid-level ridge A small inner-core developed late on September 1, and, by 06:00 UTC on September 2, a well-defined low- to midlevel eye feature became apparent, indicating that Larry had attained hurricane status The storm intensified to Category 2 strength late on September 3 Then, after battling against some shear and an intrusion of dry mid-level air during an eyewall replacement cycle, Larry became a Category 3 major hurricane by 00:00 UTC on September 4 [47] While maintaining Category 3 status for multiple days, Larry gained annular characteristics and completed two eyewall replacement cycles [75] [76] [77]\n\n\nTropical Storm Mindy\nOn August 22, a tropical wave and its associated broad low-pressure area exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic The wave moved westward across the Atlantic for nearly a week, while a portion of it split-off and became Tropical Storm Kate on August 28 Thereafter, the system crossed the Caribbean and reached Central America by September 2 Part of the wave then detached again and contributed to the development of Hurricane Olaf in the eastern Pacific The remainder of the wave moved slowly northwestward and reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 5 A burst in deep convection late on September 8 resulted in the formation of Tropical Storm Mindy over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico Moderate wind shear and warm water temperatures allowed Mindy to peak with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,000 mbar (30 inHg) before it made landfall on St Vincent Island, Florida, at 01:15 UTC on the following day Heading east-northeastward, the storm weakened to a tropical depression over southeast Georgia around 12:00 UTC and degenerated into a remnant low late on September 9 after emerging into the Atlantic The remnant circulation merged with a baroclinic zone area on September 11 [49]\n\n\nHurricane Nicholas\nA tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic on August 28 For several days, convection remained disorganized while the system trekked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean Although the wave struck Central America on September 9, a surface trough remained in the western Caribbean The trough reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 11 and quickly developed a circulation and additional convection by the next day With reconnaissance aircraft flights observing tropical storm-force winds, the system became Tropical Storm Nicholas around 12:00 UTC on September 12 over the Bay of Campeche Despite warm seas and unstable atmospheric conditions, Nicholas only strengthened gradually due to moderate wind shear as it headed north-northwestward around a subtropical ridge On September 13, a weakness in the ridge caused the cyclone to curve north-northeastward Based on a weather station at Matagorda Bay reporting sustained hurricane-force winds, Nicholas intensified into a hurricane around 00:00 UTC on September 14 Shortly thereafter, at 05:30 UTC, Nicholas made landfall near Sargent Beach, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (121 km/h) The system quickly weakened inland to tropical storm strength as it moved east-northeastward towards Galveston Bay Around 00:00 UTC on September 15, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, approximately 18 hours prior to degenerating into a remnant low over southwestern Louisiana The remnant low meandered over Louisiana and briefly re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a mid-latitude trough on September 20 [50]\n\n\nTropical Storm Odette\nOn September 11, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather over the southeastern Bahamas [83] As the system moved northwestward to north-northwestward, a low-pressure area formed well east of northeast Florida early on September 16 Despite the low having a relatively well-defined circulation, convection was disorganized and displaced from the center due to wind shear By 18:00 UTC on September 17, the system organized into Tropical Storm Odette about 175 mi (280 km) east of the North Carolina–Virginia state line Early on the following day, however, the cyclone was already beginning to lose tropical characteristics due to colder and drier air [51] During this process, its deep convection was consistently displaced well to the east of a poorly-defined center due to strong westerly wind shear The system's circulation was elongated from southwest to northeast and contained multiple low-cloud swirls [84] Odette completed an extratropical transition by 12:00 UTC on September 18, about 290 mi (465 km) east-southeast of Atlantic City, New Jersey The remnants of Odette retained gale-force winds and continued moving out into the central Atlantic, curving northeastward, before turning southward, making a slow counterclockwise curve During this time, the NHC monitored Odette's remnants for the potential to redevelop into a subtropical or tropical cyclone [85] However, the remnants of Odette failed to organize further, and it succumbed to high upper-level winds [86] Thereafter, a strengthening ridge situated over the northwestern Atlantic caused the remnants of Odette to turn south-southeastward and later to the south-southwest The extratropical low degenerated into a trough on September 27 [51]\n\n\nTropical Storm Peter\nOn September 8, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave over west Africa [87] The wave emerged into the Atlantic between September 13 and September 14, producing a large burst of convection but lacking a closed circulation Moving westward, convection became more concentrated over the next few days, and by late on September 18, the system acquired a closed circulation according to a NOAA buoy and satellite imagery As a result, a tropical depression developed by 00:00 UTC on September 19 about 605 mi (975 km) east of the Leeward Islands Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Peter Relatively light wind shear and warm seas allowed Peter to reach a peak intensity with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,005 mbar (29.7 inHg) late on September 19 However, as the storm approached the northern Leeward Islands on September 20, it encountered nearly 35 mph (55 km/h) of southwesterly wind shear from a nearby upper low As a result, Peter's low-level center was displaced west of its showers and thunderstorms Later on September 21, the system weakened to a tropical depression and degenerated into a trough about 230 mi (370 km) north of Puerto Rico around 00:00 UTC on September 23 [52] Although the NHC monitored the remnants due to the potential for redevelopment, [88] the system dissipated well south of Newfoundland on September 29 [52]\n\n\nTropical Storm Rose\nThe National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave approaching the Atlantic coast of Africa on September 14 [90] After moving into the far eastern tropical Atlantic early on September 16, the wave acquired a low-pressure center, though it remained disorganized By 00:00 UTC on September 19, the disturbance had acquired a well-defined circulation and enough organized deep convection for it to be designated a tropical depression around 375 mi (605 km) south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands Despite wind shear and dry air impacting the depression's eastern quadrants, [53] satellite images showed that the deep convection increased within the cyclone and that its overall structure continued to improve, [91] with the system becoming Tropical Storm Rose late on September 19 Around 00:00 UTC on September 21, Rose peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,004 mbar (29.6 inHg) However, a sharp increase in wind shear weakened the cyclone to a minimal tropical storm several hours later and to a tropical depression early the next day By 12:00 UTC on September 22, Rose degenerated into a remnant low while situated roughly 980 mi (1,575 km) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands The low moved northwestward until curving northward on the following day Early on September 24, the low became an open trough [53]\n\n\nHurricane Sam\nOn September 19, a tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa and into the Atlantic The wave consisted of fairly concentrated convective activity as it moved westward to the south of the Capo Verde Islands on the following day By 18:00 UTC on September 22, the wave organized enough to become a tropical depression approximately 660 mi (1,060 km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde's southernmost islands The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Sam around 06:00 UTC on September 23 Thereafter, very low wind shear and warm waters allowed Sam to reach hurricane status about 24 hours later as it tracked westward to west-northward along the eastern periphery of a mid-tropospheric anticyclone Intensification then briefly ceased, but by 12:00 UTC on September 25, Sam reached Category 3 hurricane status Satellite images showed a well-defined eye embedded in a developing central dense overcast, and following an increase in Dvorak intensity estimates, Sam became a Category 4 hurricane late on September 25 [54]\n\n\nSubtropical Storm Teresa\nA weak cold front first began pushing into the western Atlantic on September 19 As this front interacted with an upper-level low moving in from the west, it generated an area of disturbed weather, with increasing convection located near a developing surface center That disturbance, nestled underneath the upper-level low, developed into a subtropical depression around 06:00 UTC on September 24 while located about 175 mi (280 km) east-southeast of Bermuda Over the next 12 hours, the depression intensified into Subtropical Storm Teresa and reached peak winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) As the cyclone moved northwest but then veered northeast, it encountered dry air and wind shear promptly causing it to weaken Teresa degenerated to a remnant low around 18:00 UTC on September 25 The low weakened to a trough the next day, and that trough was absorbed by a frontal system on September 27 [55]\n\n\nTropical Storm Victor\nA vigorous tropical wave moved off Africa on September 27 and swiftly organized into a tropical depression around 12:00 UTC on September 29 At that time, the system was located about 535 mi (860 km) south of Cabo Verde The newly formed cyclone moved west-northwest on the south side of a ridge While ocean temperatures and wind shear values were conducive, the storm was surrounded by some dry air that intermittently became entrained into its circulation The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Victor at 18:00 UTC on September 29 and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) about two days later As Victor turned northwest, it encountered starkly higher wind shear which resulted in its weakening Its convection became displaced and its low-level circulation elongated, which led to its degeneration to a trough around 12:00 UTC on October 4 The remnants turned west and dissipated over the open Atlantic the next day [56]\n\n\nTropical Storm Wanda\nOn October 24, the NHC began monitoring a non-tropical disturbance just off the East Coast of the United States, anticipating that it would shortly develop into a strong low-pressure system, a nor'easter, as it moved northward up the coast, and then possibly develop tropical or subtropical characteristics afterward while moving away from the coast [94] [95] After bringing heavy rainfall, damaging winds, and coastal flooding to areas in the Northeastern United States between October 25 and October 27, the storm acquired subtropical characteristics early on October 31, while located roughly 595 mi (960 km) off Cape Race, Newfoundland, and was given the name Wanda That same day, Wanda peaked with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 983 mbar (29.0 inHg) By 12:00 UTC on November 1, the system transitioned into a tropical storm [58] After meandering well west of the Azores for several days, Wanda turned southward on November 5 due to a narrow, strengthening ridge to the northwest, before accelerating northeastward late on November 6 as it interacted with a mid-level trough over the northern Atlantic [58] By November 7, Wanda had lost its deep convection and became a post-tropical low at 12:00 UTC about 430 mi (690 km) west-northwest of the westernmost islands of the Azores, several hours before merging with a frontal system [58]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2021 [97] This was the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exceptions of Elsa and Julian, which replaced Erika and Joaquin, respectively [98] Both new names were used for the first time this year, along with Rose, Sam, Teresa, Victor, and Wanda [99]\n\n\nRetirement\nOn April 27, 2022, during the 44th Session of the RA IV Hurricane Committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ida from its rotating name lists due to the catastrophic damage it caused, and it will not be used again in the North Atlantic basin Ida was replaced with Imani, which will first appear on the 2027 season list [100]\n\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2021 USD.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Juliet [4] He proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between an Irish Catholic family and a Jewish family living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, [4] during the Easter–Passover season The girl has survived the Holocaust and emigrated from Israel; the conflict was to be centered on antisemitism of the Catholic \"Jets\" towards the Jewish \"Emeralds\" (a name that made its way into the script as a reference) [5] Eager to write his first musical, Laurents immediately agreed Bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form, but Robbins and Laurents resisted the suggestion They described the project as \"lyric theater\", and Laurents wrote a first draft he called East Side Story Only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like Abie's Irish Rose When Robbins opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years [6]

in plays like Abie's Irish Rose When Robbins opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years [6] [7]\n\n\nCollaboration and development\nIn New York City, Laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by Ugo Betti There he met Sondheim, who had heard that East Side Story, now retitled West Side Story, was back on track Bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on Peter Pan instead Laurents asked Sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (Saturday Night had been scrapped) But Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted [11] Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: the male lead, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish female lead had become Puerto Rican [12]\n\n\nProduction period\nPrince began cutting the budget and raising money Robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show, but changed his mind when Prince agreed to an eight-week dance rehearsal period (instead of the customary four), since there was to be more dancing in West Side Story than in any previous Broadway show, [16] and allowed Robbins to hire Peter Gennaro as his assistant [21] Originally, when considering the cast, Laurents wanted James Dean for the lead role of Tony, but the actor soon died Sondheim found Larry Kert and Chita Rivera, who created the roles of Tony and Anita, respectively Getting the work on stage was still not easy Bernstein said:\n\n\nSynopsis\nTwo rival teenage gangs, [29] the Jets (white Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Ricans), struggle for control of their neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (Prologue) Police officers Krupke and Lt Schrank warn them to stop fighting on their beat The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance Riff wants to convince his best friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (\"Jet Song\") Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (\"Something's Coming\").\n\n\nAct 1\n\n\n\nAct 2\n\n\n\nCharacters\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\n\nMusical numbers\n\n\n\nProductions\nAfter tryouts in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia beginning in August 1957, the original

conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway\" [99] It was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein, is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University) [100] Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show The original orchestra consisted of 31 players: a large Broadway pit orchestra enhanced to include 5 percussionists, a guitarist and a piano/celesta player [101]\n\n\nAnalysis of the book\nAs in Romeo and Juliet, the love between members of two rival groups in West Side Story leads to violent confrontations \"and a tragic ending with an underlying message: Violence breeds violence, so make peace and learn to share turf\" [99] Among the social themes explored in the musical are \"bigotry, cultural misunderstanding and the social failure to fully integrate and empower young people in constructive ways\" [99]\n\n\nRecordings\nRecordings of West Side Story include the following:\n\n\nFilms\nThe 1961 film adaptation of the musical received praise from critics and the public and

{"title": "Iron_Dome", "content": "\nBackground\nHezbollah, based in Lebanon, fired rockets into northern Israeli population centers in the 1990s, posing a security challenge for the Israel Defense Forces Israel had floated the idea of its own short-range antimissile system, but U.S defense officials cautioned that it would be \"doomed to fail\" [20]\n\n\nName\n\nProject leader Colonel S and his team in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) needed an appropriate name for the system According to Colonel S., \n\nSpecifications\nThe system is designed to counter short-range rockets and 155 mm artillery shells with a range of up to 70 kilometers (43 mi) According to its manufacturer, Iron Dome will operate day and night, under adverse weather conditions, and can respond to multiple threats simultaneously [1]\n\n\nComparison to a typical battery\nThe typical air defense missile battery consists of a radar unit, missile control unit, and several launchers, all located at the same site.\n\n\nFunding\nThe initial funding and development of the Iron Dome system was provided and undertaken by Israel [31] This allowed for the deployment of the first two Iron Dome systems [32] Subsequently, funding for additional Iron Dome systems—along with repeated funding for the supply of the interception missiles—has been provided by the United States [32] From 2011 to 2021, the US contributed a total of US$1.6 billion to the Iron Dome defense system, [11] with another US$1 billion approved by the US Congress in 2022 [12]\n\n\nCo-production with the United States\nWith the United States on track to greatly increase funding for Iron Dome, there have been calls for technology transfer and co-production of Iron Dome in the United States In fact by August 2011 the joint-venture (JV) was announced to market a variant of this system [50] The JV is known as Area Protection Systems [51] Just as the US and Israel share co-production of the Arrow 3 missile system, with Boeing manufacturing 40–50 percent of the production content, there was support in the U.S Congress, media and think tanks in favor of co-production [52] The U.S House of Representatives included report language in its FY-2013 Defense Authorization Act supporting Iron Dome with $680 million but also instructing that the Director of the U.S Missile Defense Agency, Lt Gen Patrick O'Reilly, \"should explore any opportunity to enter into co-production of the Iron Dome system with Israel, in light of the significant U.S investment in this system.\" [53] There were media reports that the Pentagon was requesting similar language in the Senate Defense Authorization Act as well as the respective House and Senate defense appropriations bills for 2013 [31] Adding Iron Dome to the list of high-tech military programs built jointly by both nations would help further strengthen ties between Israel and the United States [54]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn 2005, Brig Gen Danny Gold, then head of\nMaf'at, decided to start the program that would include the system's research and a demonstration of the intercepting system [16] [17] In 2007, Israel commissioned the development of Iron Dome, choosing Israeli contractor Rafael over the American giant Lockheed Martin Israeli company mPrest Systems was put in charge of programming the core of Iron Dome's battle management system Iron Dome went from the drawing board to combat readiness within less than four years, a remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts [67]\n\n\nDesign\nIn 2005, Brig Gen Danny Gold, then head of\nMaf'at, decided to start the program that would include the system's research and a demonstration of the intercepting system [16] [17] In 2007, Israel commissioned the development of Iron Dome, choosing Israeli contractor Rafael over the American giant Lockheed Martin Israeli company mPrest Systems was put in charge of programming the core of Iron Dome's battle management system Iron Dome went from the drawing board to combat readiness within less than four years, a remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts [67]\n\n\nTesting\nDuring the first stage of Iron Dome's operational duty, the Israeli Air Force included many soldiers from Sderot, citing high motivation among the city's pre-army youth to be part of the project [77] The 947th \"Marksmen\" Stinger Battalion of the Israeli Air Defense Network was chosen as the first unit to become familiar with and operate Iron Dome [78]\n\n\nEnergy weapons\nAlthough Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness against rocket attacks, Defense Ministry officials are concerned it will not be able to handle more massive arsenals possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon should a conflict arise Although in Operation Protective Edge it had a 90 percent hit rate against only rockets determined to be headed for populated areas, 735 intercepts were made at a cost of $70,000–100,000 per interceptor; with an estimated 100,000 rockets possessed by Hezbollah, Iron Dome systems could be fiscally and physically overwhelmed by dozens of incoming salvos In 2014 Directed-energy weapons were being investigated as a complement to Iron Dome, with lower system cost and lower cost per shot Solid-state lasers worldwide have power levels ranging from 10 to 40 kW; to destroy a rocket safely from 15–20 km (9.3–12.4 mi) away, several low-power beams could coordinate and converge on one spot to burn through its outer shell and destroy it Because laser beams become distorted and ineffective in foggy or heavy cloud conditions, any laser weapon would need to be complemented by Iron Dome [79]\n\n\nC-Dome\nIn October 2014, Rafael unveiled a naval version of the Iron Dome called C-Dome It is designed to protect vessels in blue and littoral waters from ballistic trajectory and direct attack weapons fired in saturation attacks C-Dome includes a 10-round canister loaded with vertically launched Tamir interceptors for 360-degree coverage, a feature not supported by the land-based Iron Dome system; the ship's own surveillance radar is used to negate the need for a dedicated fire control radar The system has a small footprint to enable installation on small ships like offshore patrol vessels, corvettes, and even stationary oil rigs [84] In the very early stages of concept development, Rafael estimated that it could take less than a year to build a prototype C-Dome system Preliminary discussions with potential users have already been launched [18] The C-Dome will be used on the Israeli Navy's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes [85] On 18 May 2016 Col Ariel Shir, head of Israeli Naval operation systems announced that the system had successfully intercepted and destroyed a salvo of short range missiles while deployed on a naval vessel at sea [86] On 27 November 2017, the Israeli military declared initial operational capability for the C-Dome, completing more than 18 months of integration and design work [87]\n\n\nCounter-UAV\nThe Iron Dome has been pitched to the IDF as a more cost-effective anti-aircraft system to intercept unmanned aerial vehicles Some estimates of the cost of a Tamir interceptor are around $100,000, but it is still 95 percent cheaper than using a MIM-104 Patriot, the primary Israeli interceptor, costing $2–3 million Although the Patriot has broader coverage, the low cost of UAVs and operational scenarios they would be encountered in would make Iron Dome equally effective against them No material upgrades would be needed to optimize the system for drone-killing missions, as this role and capability has been publicized from its inception [88]\n\n\nOther uses\nIn June 2016, it was revealed that the Iron Dome had been tested to successfully intercept salvos of artillery shells, which are typically difficult to destroy because of the need to penetrate the thickness of their metal casings to get to the warhead, and \"multiple\" air-to-ground precision guided munitions (PGMs) similar to the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) [90]\n\n\nDeployment\nThe Iron Dome system began operating in early 2011, [76] initially deployed at air force bases in southern Israel It was designated to be set up in other areas, such as the town of Sderot, during significant escalations along the Gaza border [91]\n\n\n2011\nOn 27 March 2011, Al Jazeera English reported that Iron Dome had been deployed for the first time Brigadier-General Doron Gavish, commander of Israel's air defense corps, said Iron Dome had passed a series of tests and reached its \"evaluation phase\" in the field It was stationed near Beersheba, following two rocket attacks on the area that month [13]\n\n\nResponse by Palestinian militants\nOn 22 August 2011, Haaretz reported that according to Israeli security sources, Palestinian militants changed their rocket-launching tactics in an attempt to evade the two Iron Dome batteries deployed in southern Israel The new tactics included aiming more frequently at areas beyond the Iron Dome protection range After the Palestinian launch teams realized that the systems deployed in the previous two weeks around Ashkelon and Be'er Sheva provided near-perfect protection from rockets, they began firing more frequently at Ashdod and Ofakim When they did target Beersheba on 21 August, they did not fire rockets individually as they had in the past, but rather a volley of seven rockets almost simultaneously Iron Dome intercepted five of them successfully, but one penetrated the defense system, exploding in a residential area and killing a man [97]\n\n\nAugust 2011 Supreme Court decision\nOn 8 August 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition asking that the government be ordered to deploy the system in Gaza border communities In rejecting the petition, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch and Justices Salim Joubran and Uzi Fogelman ruled that in balancing all relevant considerations including budgets, changing security realities and operational matters, the government's decision not to deploy the Iron Dome in the area was reasonable The panel of justices also said that the court had no reason to intervene in operational decisions regarding where to deploy the Iron Dome system \"We believe the  [government] will make the necessary decisions in accordance with the time and place requirements,\" they said [107]\n\n\nDecember 2011 accident\nOn 26 December 2011, an accident occurred during a maintenance drill involving one of the systems While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, [108] two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to fall from a height of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable [109] [110] Ynetnews reported that the soldiers were never in danger because the interceptor missiles are equipped with a security mechanism that prevents premature explosions The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the Air Force commander, Maj Gen Ido Nehushtan, appointed a committee to examine the accident and ordered an immediate stop to all Air Defense Network maintenance work until a preliminary investigation was concluded [110] It also said that during the following week actions would be taken to \"improve skills and safety awareness\" [108] [109] A security official told Reshet Bet that the failure was twofold in that the soldiers and their commander deviated from severely strict safety protocols, and 20 costly interceptors were lost [109] Walla! website reported that the soldiers made a mistake in loading the missiles and they fell backwards The website calculated the damage at US$1 million (at $50,000 per missile) The missiles were transferred back to Rafael to determine whether they could be repaired [108]\n\n\n2012\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel Some 177 fell on Israeli territory The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n\nMarch 2012 intensive attacks\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel Some 177 fell on Israeli territory The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n\nJuly 2012 first Eilat deployment\nOn 11 July 2012, Ynetnews reported that on that day the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area as a part of an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel [112] The IDF published on its website that the Iron Dome battery will be temporarily stationed there as part of an effort to test and prepare different sites across the country for the possibility of permanently stationing there additional batteries \"Since the system continues to grow and improve, it is important to test potential sites,\" said a commander from the Air Defense Formation \"After stationing Iron Dome batteries in numerous regions in southern Israel, including Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and Gush Dan—it is time to test the southernmost region in the country, Eilat.\" [113] Haaretz reported that an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the interceptors were set up on 9 July [114] Three weeks beforehand, two Katyhusha rockets were fired into southern Israel, and according to The Jerusalem Post the IDF believes that they originated from the Sinai According to the report, IDF assessments are that they were either fired by a Palestinian rocket cell from Gaza—affiliated either with Hamas or Islamic Jihad—or by Bedouin freelancers who work for them The launches followed an earlier one in April 2012, when at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from the Sinai to Eilat [115] Ynetnews reported that according to a military source, following these rocket attacks, the IDF decided not to take any chances and calibrated the system to the region's topography, before finally deploying it The system's deployment was coordinated with local communities and the City of Eilat, to prevent public panic [112]\n\n\nNovember 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense\nAccording to the Israeli Air Force, during operation \"Pillar of Defense\" (14–21 November 2012) Iron Dome made 421 interceptions [116] On 17 November, after two rockets targeted Tel Aviv during the operation, a battery was deployed in the area Within hours, a third rocket was intercepted by the system This fifth battery had not been scheduled to come into service until early 2013 [117]\n\n\n2014\nThe system was employed during operation \"Protective Edge\", intercepting rockets launched from Gaza towards southern, central and northern parts of Israel [119] As of August 2014, ten Iron Dome batteries had been deployed throughout Israel [4] During the 50 days of the conflict 4,594 rockets and mortars were fired at Israeli targets; Iron Dome systems intercepted 735 projectiles that it determined were threatening, achieving an intercept success rate of 90 percent Only 70 rockets fired at Israel from Gaza failed to be intercepted One civilian was killed and three others and nine servicemen were wounded by mortar bombs, but they were not in areas protected by Iron Dome Only 25 percent of rockets fired were determined to be threatening due to the low accuracy and unstable trajectory of the poor-quality rockets fired Six systems had been deployed prior to hostilities, and three more were rushed into service for a total of nine batteries used during the conflict; a tenth system was delivered, but not deployed

11 to 21 May In the first 24 hours of the conflict 470 rockets were fired, a much higher rate than had been attained in previous conflicts Of the rockets, 17% were long-range attacks on Tel Aviv, again more than previously [26] About 680 of the rockets fired during hostilities fell short and landed in Gaza; the Iron Dome system intercepted about 90% of the rockets heading to populated areas within Israel [126] During the operation Iron Dome shot down a bomb-laden drone [127]\n\n\n2021 Israel–Palestine crisis\nDuring the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, over 4,300 rockets were fired at

was deployed and intercepted attacks from Iran [128]\n\n\nDeployment at sea\nIn 2017 it was reported that Israel was planning to deploy Iron Dome batteries at sea to protect off-shore gas platforms, working in conjunction with Israel's Barak 8 missile system [19] Two Iron Dome batteries were to be deployed on each of the Israeli Navy's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes, [19] which are in charge of guarding the natural gas platforms off Israel's coast and its shipping lanes \nDuring a military exercise in February 2022, an advanced model of the Iron Dome installed on the Sa'ar-6 corvettes was able to shoot down rockets, drones and cruise missiles at sea [130]\n\n\nForeign sales\nSome Iron Dome systems have been exported A weakness for most potential markets is that each Iron Dome system protects no more than 100–150 square kilometres (39–58 square miles); this is effective in a small country like Israel, but not for larger states Even in Israel, the batteries have to be moved around according to perceived risk of attack Singapore, a sovereign island city-state, is reported to have purchased the Iron Dome, and the US Army has bought two batteries to protect overseas bases [132]\n\n\nPossible foreign sales\nFollowing the system's deployment in April 2011, Iron Dome was used to successfully intercept Katyusha rockets fired by Palestinian militants [168] In August that year, Iron Dome intercepted 20 missiles and rockets fired into Israel However, in one instance the system destroyed four rockets fired at the city of Beersheba but failed to stop a fifth, which killed one man and injured several others [169]\n\n\nEffectiveness\nFollowing the system's deployment in April 2011, Iron Dome was used to successfully intercept Katyusha rockets fired by Palestinian

failed to stop a fifth, which killed one man and injured several others [169]\n\n\nCost\nIn 2010, before the system was declared operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and professor of political science at Tel Aviv University [181] for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means [182] Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are worth the cost [183]\n\n\nVulnerabilities\nIron Dome can potentially be overcome by swarms of many missiles that exceed its capability to intercept them, and by sheer numbers of attacking missiles during a campaign if not enough interceptors are available to counter them Also, the cost of each interception is high, while attacking rockets can be relatively inexpensive These are among the reasons encouraging the development of the Iron Beam energy weapon to complement Iron Dome, which is cheap to fire, has unlimited \"ammunition\", and is effective at short range [3] Iron Dome is also significantly less effective against very short-distance saturation strikes Hamas is aware of these vulnerabilities In addition to having very large numbers of rockets and using saturation strikes, they consistently fire rockets at low trajectories to make them harder to intercept [189]\n\n\nAnalysis\nPrior to its deployment, the Iron Dome was criticized as ineffective in countering the Qassam threat for the southern city of Sderot, given the short distance—840m, half a mile, from the closest point in Sderot to Gaza [195]—and flight time between the much-attacked city and the rocket launching pads in the Gaza Strip [182] [187] Israeli defense officials insisted in 2008 that with recent improvements to Iron Dome, the system was fully able to intercept Qassams [187] [196]\n\n\nPrior to deployment\nPrior to its deployment, the Iron Dome was criticized as ineffective in countering the Qassam threat for the

video footage\nAn unpublished 2013 report [197] by Theodore Postol, Mordechai Shefer and Richard Lloyd, [198] argued that the official effectiveness figures for Iron Dome during Operation Pillar of Defense were incorrect [199] Although Postol had earlier lauded Iron Dome's effectiveness, [200] after studying YouTube videos of the warhead interceptions as well as police reports and other data, he argued that \"Iron Dome's intercept rate, defined as destruction of the rocket's warhead, was relatively low, perhaps as low as 5%, but could well be lower.\" [199] [201] Postol reached this conclusion mainly from an analysis of non-official footage of interceptions taken by civilians and published on YouTube.\n\n\nAnalysis of damage reports\nPostol additionally used the amount of claims filed by the Property Tax Authority and the number of Israeli Police Reports (taken from the Israeli Police website) relating to rockets to support his argument In relation to Postol's argument based on the number of reports the Israeli Police received, Israeli Institute of National Security Studies wrote: \"However, Israel Police reports on calls from citizens, and these include reports on falling fragments, rocket parts, and duds.\" [204]\n\n\nAnalysis of losses per rocket\nResearch published in 2018 analyzed the numbers of deaths, injuries, and property damage claims per rocket fired for four conflicts [205] These were the Second Lebanon War of 2006, Operation Cast Lead in 2008–2009, Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014 By comparing the loss rates per rocket of the latter two operations (which had Iron Dome batteries) to the first two (which did not), it estimated the interceptor batteries' overall effectiveness at reducing Israeli losses from rockets [206]\n\n\nEffects on Israeli society\nYoav Fromer of Tel Aviv University argued that the success of Iron Dome provided \"both a physical and a psychological solace that enables Israelis to go about their business,\" which in the long term would reduce the urgency of establishing a broader regional political and diplomatic solution [207]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Iron Dome\n\nThe Iron Dome is a mobile air defense system developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) for the Israeli military. It is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells, and has been operational since 2011.\n\n# Background\nThe Iron Dome system was developed in response to the threat posed by Hezbollah, a Shia Islamist militant group based in Lebanon, which had been firing rockets into northern Israeli population centers in the 1990s. The Israeli military had floated the idea of developing its own short-range antimissile system, but U.S. defense officials cautioned that it would be \"doomed to fail.\" Despite this, Israel decided to pursue the development of a system that could counter the threat posed by short-range rockets.\n\n# Name\nThe project leader, Colonel S, and his team in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) needed an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S, the name \"Iron Dome\" was chosen because it is a reference to the \"Iron Dome\" of the biblical story of David and Goliath, where David hits Goliath with a stone that penetrates the \"dome\" of his helmet.\n\n# Specifications\nThe Iron Dome system is designed to counter short-range rockets and artillery shells with a range of up to 70 kilometers (43 mi). According to its manufacturer, the system will operate day and night, under adverse weather conditions, and can respond to multiple threats simultaneously.\n\n## Radar Unit\nThe Iron Dome system consists of a radar unit that detects and tracks incoming rockets and artillery shells. The radar unit uses a combination of active and passive sensors to detect and track the targets.\n\n## Missile Control Unit\nThe missile control unit is responsible for calculating the trajectory of the incoming target and selecting the optimal intercept point. The unit uses a combination of software and hardware algorithms to calculate the intercept point and select the optimal missile configuration.\n\n## Launchers\nThe Iron Dome system consists of several launchers, each of which can carry up to 20 Tamir interceptors. The launchers are mounted on a truck or trailer and can be easily transported and deployed.\n\n## Interceptors\nThe Tamir interceptor is a small, lightweight missile that is designed to intercept and destroy incoming rockets and artillery shells. The interceptor is equipped with a guidance system that uses a combination of infrared and radar sensors to track the target and a warhead that is designed to penetrate the target's armor.\n\n# Comparison to a Typical Battery\nA typical air defense missile battery consists of a radar unit, missile control unit, and several launchers, all located at the same site. In contrast, the Iron Dome system is a distributed system, with multiple launchers and radar units that can be deployed at different locations.\n\n# Funding\nThe initial funding and development of the Iron Dome system was provided and undertaken by Israel. This allowed for the deployment of the first two Iron Dome systems. Subsequently, funding for additional Iron Dome systems, along with repeated funding for the supply of the interception missiles, has been provided by the United States. From 2011 to 2021, the US contributed a total of $1.6 billion to the Iron Dome defense system, with another $1 billion approved by the US Congress in 2022.\n\n# Co-production with the United States\nWith the United States on track to greatly increase funding for Iron Dome, there have been calls for technology transfer and co-production of Iron Dome in the United States. In fact, by August 2011, the joint-venture Area Protection Systems was announced to market a variant of this system.\n\n# Development\nIn 2005, Brig. Gen. Danny Gold, then head of Maf'at, decided to start the program that would include the system's research and a demonstration of the intercepting system. In 2007, Israel commissioned the development of Iron Dome, choosing Israeli contractor Rafael over the American giant Lockheed Martin. Israeli company mPrest Systems was put in charge of programming the core of Iron Dome's battle management system. Iron Dome went from the drawing board to combat readiness within less than four years, a remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts.\n\n# Design\nIn 2005, Brig.

Israeli company mPrest Systems was put in charge of programming the core of Iron Dome's battle management system. Iron Dome went from the drawing board to combat readiness within less than four years, a remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts.\n\n# Testing\nDuring the first stage of Iron Dome's operational duty, the Israeli Air Force included many soldiers from Sderot, citing high motivation among the city's pre-army youth to be part of the project. The 947th \"Marksmen\" Stinger Battalion of the Israeli Air Defense Network was chosen as the first unit to become familiar with and operate Iron Dome.\n\n# Energy Weapons\nAlthough Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness against rocket attacks, Defense Ministry officials are concerned it will not be able to handle more massive arsenals possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon should a conflict arise. In Operation Protective Edge, Iron Dome had a 90 percent hit rate against only rockets determined to be headed for populated areas, but 735 intercepts were made at a cost of $70,000–100,000 per interceptor. With an estimated 100,000 rockets possessed by Hezbollah, Iron Dome systems could be fiscally and physically overwhelmed by dozens of incoming salvos. In 2014, directed-energy weapons were being investigated as a complement to Iron Dome, with lower system cost and lower cost per shot.\n\n# C-Dome\nIn October 2014, Rafael unveiled a naval version of the Iron Dome called C-Dome. It is designed to protect vessels in blue and littoral waters from ballistic trajectory and direct attack weapons fired in saturation attacks. C-Dome includes a 10-round canister loaded with vertically launched Tamir interceptors for 360-degree coverage, a feature not supported by the land-based Iron Dome system; the ship's own surveillance radar is used to negate the need for a dedicated fire control radar.\n\n# Counter-UAV\nThe Iron Dome has been pitched to the IDF as a more cost-effective anti-aircraft system to intercept unmanned aerial vehicles. Some estimates of the cost of a Tamir interceptor are around $100,000, but it is still 95 percent cheaper than using a MIM-104 Patriot, the primary Israeli interceptor, costing $2–3 million.\n\n# Other Uses\nIn June 2016, it was revealed that the Iron Dome had been tested to successfully intercept salvos of artillery shells, which are typically difficult to destroy because of the need to penetrate the thickness of their metal casings to get to the warhead, and \"multiple\" air-to-ground precision guided munitions (PGMs) similar to the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).\n\n# Deployment\nThe Iron Dome system began operating in early 2011, initially deployed at air force bases in southern Israel. It was designated to be set up in other areas, such as the town of Sderot, during significant escalations along the Gaza border.\n\n# 2011\nOn 27 March 2011, Al Jazeera English reported that Iron Dome had been deployed for the first time. Brigadier-General Doron Gavish, commander of Israel's air defense corps, said Iron Dome had passed a series of tests and reached its \"evaluation phase\" in the field. It was stationed near Beersheba, following two rocket attacks on the area that month.\n\n# Response by Palestinian Militants\nOn 22 August 2011, Haaretz reported that according to Israeli security sources, Palestinian militants changed their rocket-launching tactics in an attempt to evade the two Iron Dome batteries deployed in southern Israel. The new tactics included aiming more frequently at areas beyond the Iron Dome protection range.\n\n# August 2011 Supreme Court Decision\nOn 8 August 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition asking that the government be ordered to deploy the system in Gaza border communities. In rejecting the petition, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch and Justices Salim Joubran and Uzi Fogelman ruled that in balancing all relevant considerations, including budgets, changing security realities, and operational matters, the government's decision not to deploy the Iron Dome in the area was reasonable.\n\n# December 2011 Accident\nOn 26 December 2011, an accident occurred during a maintenance drill involving one of the systems. While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to fall from a height of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable.\n\n# 2012\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel. Some 177 fell on Israeli territory. The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n# March 2012 Intensive Attacks\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel. Some 177 fell on Israeli territory. The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n# July 2012 First Eilat Deployment\nOn 11 July 2012, Ynetnews reported that on that day the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area as a part of an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel. The IDF published on its website that the Iron Dome battery will be temporarily stationed there as part of an effort to test and prepare different sites across the country for the possibility of permanently stationing there additional batteries.\n\n# November 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense\nAccording to the Israeli Air Force, during operation \"Pillar of Defense\" (14–21 November 2012) Iron Dome made 421 interceptions. On 17 November, after two rockets targeted Tel Aviv during the operation, a battery was deployed in the area. Within hours, a third rocket was intercepted by the system. This fifth battery had not been scheduled to come into service until early 2013.\n\n# 2014\nThe system was employed during operation \"Protective Edge\", intercepting rockets launched from Gaza towards southern, central and northern parts of Israel. As of August 2014, ten Iron Dome batteries had been deployed throughout Israel. During the 50 days of the conflict, 4,594 rockets and mortars were fired at Israeli targets; Iron Dome systems intercepted 735 projectiles that it determined were threatening, achieving an intercept success rate of 90 percent. Only 70 rockets fired at Israel from Gaza failed to be intercepted. One civilian was killed and three others and nine servicemen were wounded by mortar bombs, but they were not in areas protected by Iron Dome.\n\n# 2018\nOn 10 May 2018, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran allegedly launched 20 rockets from Syria toward Israel in retaliation for recent Israeli airstrikes against IRGC facilities. According to an IDF spokesperson, 16 of the rockets fell short of the Israeli border, and Iron Dome intercepted the other four. Israel reported no casualties or damage.\n\n# 2019\nOn 21 January 2019, the IDF released footage online of a Syrian Arab Army rocket attack on the Golan Heights being intercepted by Iron Dome. The video was shot by skiers at Mount Hermon ski resort; Israeli authorities announced that the resort was closed until further notice.\n\n# 2021\nDuring the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, over 4,300 rockets were fired at Israel by Hamas from Gaza. From 11 to 21 May, in the first 24 hours of the conflict, 470 rockets were fired, a much higher rate than had been attained in previous conflicts. Of the rockets, 17% were long-range attacks on Tel Aviv, again more than previously. About 680 of the rockets fired during hostilities fell short and landed in Gaza; the Iron Dome system intercepted about 90% of the rockets heading to populated areas within Israel.\n\n# 2024\nDuring the April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel, the Iron Dome was deployed and intercepted attacks from Iran.\n\n# Deployment at Sea\nIn 2017, it was reported that Israel was planning to deploy Iron Dome batteries at sea to protect off-shore gas platforms, working in conjunction with Israel's Barak 8 missile system. Two Iron Dome batteries were to be deployed on each of the Israeli Navy's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes.\n\n# Foreign Sales\nSome Iron Dome systems have been exported. A weakness for most potential markets is that each Iron Dome system protects no more than 100–150 square kilometers; this is effective in a small country like Israel, but not for larger states. Even in Israel, the batteries have to be moved around according to perceived risk of attack. Singapore, a sovereign island city-state, is reported to have purchased the Iron Dome, and the US Army has bought two batteries to protect overseas bases.\n\n# Possible Foreign Sales\nFollowing the system's deployment in April 2011, Iron Dome was used to successfully intercept Katyusha rockets fired by Palestinian militants.

remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts [67]\n\n\nDesign\nIn 2005, Brig Gen Danny Gold, then head of\nMaf'at, decided to start the program that would include the system's research and a demonstration of the intercepting system [16] [17] In 2007, Israel commissioned the development of Iron Dome, choosing Israeli contractor Rafael over the American giant Lockheed Martin Israeli company mPrest Systems was put in charge of programming the core of Iron Dome's battle management system Iron Dome went from the drawing board to combat readiness within less than four years, a remarkably short period of time for a weapons system designed from scratch, according to military experts [67]\n\n\nTesting\nDuring the first stage of Iron Dome's operational duty, the Israeli Air Force included many soldiers from Sderot, citing high motivation among the city's pre-army youth to be part of the project [77] The 947th \"Marksmen\" Stinger Battalion of the Israeli Air Defense Network was chosen as the first unit to become familiar with and operate Iron Dome [78]\n\n\nEnergy weapons\nAlthough Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness against rocket attacks, Defense Ministry officials are concerned it will not be able to handle more massive arsenals possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon should a conflict arise Although in Operation Protective Edge it had a 90 percent hit rate against only rockets determined to be headed for populated areas, 735 intercepts were made at a cost of $70,000–100,000 per interceptor; with an estimated 100,000 rockets possessed by Hezbollah, Iron Dome systems could be fiscally and physically overwhelmed by dozens of incoming salvos In 2014 Directed-energy weapons were being investigated as a complement to Iron Dome, with lower system cost and lower cost per shot Solid-state lasers worldwide have power levels ranging from 10 to 40 kW; to destroy a rocket safely from 15–20 km (9.3–12.4 mi) away, several low-power beams could coordinate and converge on one spot to burn through its outer shell and destroy it Because laser beams become distorted and ineffective in foggy or heavy cloud conditions, any laser weapon would need to be complemented by Iron Dome [79]\n\n\nC-Dome\nIn October 2014, Rafael unveiled a naval version of the Iron Dome called C-Dome It is designed to protect vessels in blue and littoral waters from ballistic trajectory and direct attack weapons fired in saturation attacks C-Dome includes a 10-round canister loaded with vertically launched Tamir interceptors for 360-degree coverage, a feature not supported by the land-based Iron Dome system; the ship's own surveillance radar is used to negate the need for a dedicated fire control radar The system has a small footprint to enable installation on small ships like offshore patrol vessels, corvettes, and even stationary oil rigs [84] In the very early stages of concept development, Rafael estimated that it could take less than a year to build a prototype C-Dome system Preliminary discussions with potential users have already been launched [18] The C-Dome will be used on the Israeli Navy's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes [85] On 18 May 2016 Col Ariel Shir, head of Israeli Naval operation systems announced that the system had successfully intercepted and destroyed a salvo of short range missiles while deployed on a naval vessel at sea [86] On 27 November 2017, the Israeli military declared initial operational capability for the C-Dome, completing more than 18 months of integration and design work [87]\n\n\nCounter-UAV\nThe Iron Dome has been pitched to the IDF as a more cost-effective anti-aircraft system to intercept unmanned aerial vehicles Some estimates of the cost of a Tamir interceptor are around $100,000, but it is still 95 percent cheaper than using a MIM-104 Patriot, the primary Israeli interceptor, costing $2–3 million Although the Patriot has broader coverage, the low cost of UAVs and operational scenarios they would be encountered in would make Iron Dome equally effective against them No material upgrades would be needed to optimize the system for drone-killing missions, as this role and capability has been publicized from its inception [88]\n\n\nOther uses\nIn June 2016, it was revealed that the Iron Dome had been tested to successfully intercept salvos of artillery shells, which are typically difficult to destroy because of the need to penetrate the thickness of their metal casings to get to the warhead, and \"multiple\" air-to-ground precision guided munitions (PGMs) similar to the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) [90]\n\n\nDeployment\nThe Iron Dome system began operating in early 2011, [76] initially deployed at air force bases in southern Israel It was designated to be set up in other areas, such as the town of Sderot, during significant escalations along the Gaza border [91]\n\n\n2011\nOn 27 March 2011, Al Jazeera English reported that Iron Dome had been deployed for the first time Brigadier-General Doron Gavish, commander of Israel's air defense corps, said Iron Dome had passed a series of tests and reached its \"evaluation phase\" in the field It was stationed near Beersheba, following two rocket attacks on the area that month [13]\n\n\nResponse by Palestinian militants\nOn 22 August 2011, Haaretz reported that according to Israeli security sources, Palestinian militants changed their rocket-launching tactics in an attempt to evade the two Iron Dome batteries deployed in southern Israel The new tactics included aiming more frequently at areas beyond the Iron Dome protection range After the Palestinian launch teams realized that the systems deployed in the previous two weeks around Ashkelon and Be'er Sheva provided near-perfect protection from rockets, they began firing more frequently at Ashdod and Ofakim When they did target Beersheba on 21 August, they did not fire rockets individually as they had in the past, but rather a volley of seven rockets almost simultaneously Iron Dome intercepted five of them successfully, but one penetrated the defense system, exploding in a residential area and killing a man [97]\n\n\nAugust 2011 Supreme Court decision\nOn 8 August 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition asking that the government be ordered to deploy the system in Gaza border communities In rejecting the petition, Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch and Justices Salim Joubran and Uzi Fogelman ruled that in balancing all relevant considerations including budgets, changing security realities and operational matters, the government's decision not to deploy the Iron Dome in the area was reasonable The panel of justices also said that the court had no reason to intervene in operational decisions regarding where to deploy the Iron Dome system \"We believe the  [government] will make the necessary decisions in accordance with the time and place requirements,\" they said [107]\n\n\nDecember 2011 accident\nOn 26 December 2011, an accident occurred during a maintenance drill involving one of the systems While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, [108] two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to fall from a height of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable [109] [110] Ynetnews reported that the soldiers were never in danger because the interceptor missiles are equipped with a security mechanism that prevents premature explosions The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the Air Force commander, Maj Gen Ido Nehushtan, appointed a committee to examine the accident and ordered an immediate stop to all Air Defense Network maintenance work until a preliminary investigation was concluded [110] It also said that during the following week actions would be taken to \"improve skills and safety awareness\" [108] [109] A security official told Reshet Bet that the failure was twofold in that the soldiers and their commander deviated from severely strict safety protocols, and 20 costly interceptors were lost [109] Walla! website reported that the soldiers made a mistake in loading the missiles and they fell backwards The website calculated the damage at US$1 million (at $50,000 per missile) The missiles were transferred back to Rafael to determine whether they could be repaired [108]\n\n\n2012\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel Some 177 fell on Israeli territory The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n\nMarch 2012 intensive attacks\nAfter the IDF killing of Zohair al-Qaisi, the secretary general of the Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza on 9 March 2012, more than 300 rockets were fired on Israel Some 177 fell on Israeli territory The Iron Dome system had successfully intercepted at least 56 rockets (directed at population centers) in 71 attempts.\n\n\nJuly 2012 first Eilat deployment\nOn 11 July 2012, Ynetnews reported that on that day the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area as a part of an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel [112] The IDF published on its website that the Iron Dome battery will be temporarily stationed there as part of an effort to test and prepare different sites across the country for the possibility of permanently stationing there additional batteries \"Since the system continues to grow and improve, it is important to test potential sites,\" said a commander from the Air Defense Formation \"After stationing Iron Dome batteries in numerous regions in southern Israel, including Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and Gush Dan—it is time to test the southernmost region in the country, Eilat.\" [113] Haaretz reported that an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the interceptors were set up on 9 July [114] Three weeks beforehand, two Katyhusha rockets were fired into southern Israel, and according to The Jerusalem Post the IDF believes that they originated from the Sinai According to the report, IDF assessments are that they were either fired by a Palestinian rocket cell from Gaza—affiliated either with Hamas or Islamic Jihad—or by Bedouin freelancers who work for them The launches followed an earlier one in April 2012, when at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from the Sinai to Eilat [115] Ynetnews reported that according to a military source, following these rocket attacks, the IDF decided not to take any chances and calibrated the system to the region's topography, before finally deploying it The system's deployment was coordinated with local communities and the City of Eilat, to prevent public panic [112]\n\n\nNovember 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense\nAccording to the Israeli Air Force, during operation \"Pillar of Defense\" (14–21 November 2012) Iron Dome made 421 interceptions [116] On 17 November, after two rockets targeted Tel Aviv during the operation, a battery was deployed in the area Within hours, a third rocket was intercepted by the system This fifth battery had not been scheduled to come into service until early 2013 [117]\n\n\n2014\nThe system was employed during operation \"Protective Edge\", intercepting rockets launched from Gaza towards southern, central and northern parts of Israel [119] As of August 2014, ten Iron Dome batteries had been deployed throughout Israel [4] During the 50 days of the conflict 4,594 rockets and mortars were fired at Israeli targets; Iron Dome systems intercepted 735 projectiles that it determined were threatening, achieving an intercept success rate of 90 percent Only 70 rockets fired at Israel from Gaza failed to be intercepted One civilian was killed and three others and nine servicemen were wounded by mortar bombs, but they were not in areas protected by Iron Dome Only 25 percent of rockets fired were determined to be threatening due to the low accuracy and unstable trajectory of the poor-quality rockets fired Six systems had been deployed prior to hostilities, and three more were rushed into service for a total of nine batteries used during the conflict; a tenth system was delivered, but not deployed due to a shortage of staff [120]\n\n\nJuly 2014 Operation Protective Edge\nThe system was

delivered, but not deployed due to a shortage of staff [120]\n\n\n2018\nOn 10 May 2018, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran allegedly launched 20 rockets from Syria toward Israel in retaliation for recent Israeli airstrikes against IRGC facilities According to an IDF spokesperson, 16 of the rockets fell short of the Israeli border, and Iron Dome intercepted the other four Israel reported no casualties or damage [121]\n\n\nMay 2018 Israel–Iran incidents\nOn 10 May 2018, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran allegedly launched 20 rockets from Syria toward Israel in retaliation for recent Israeli airstrikes against IRGC facilities According to an IDF spokesperson, 16 of the rockets fell short of the Israeli border, and Iron Dome intercepted the other four Israel reported no casualties or damage [121]\n\n\nGaza-Israel clashes\nThe Iron Dome system intercepted 100 rockets that were launched from the Gaza Strip in mid-November 2018 [122]\n\n\n2019\nOn 21 January 2019, the IDF released footage online of a Syrian Arab Army rocket attack on the Golan Heights being intercepted by Iron Dome The video was shot by skiers at Mount Hermon ski resort; Israeli authorities announced that the resort was closed until further notice The attack was in response to Israel's launching of nine rockets at SAA targets in western Damascus [123] [124] [125]\n\n\nMount Hermon video\nOn 21 January 2019, the IDF released footage online of a Syrian Arab Army rocket attack on the Golan Heights being intercepted by Iron Dome The video was shot by skiers at Mount Hermon ski resort; Israeli authorities announced that the resort was closed until further notice The attack was in response to Israel's launching of nine rockets at SAA targets in western Damascus [123] [124] [125]\n\n\n2021\nDuring the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, over 4,300 rockets were fired at Israel by Hamas from Gaza [126] from 11 to 21 May In the first 24 hours of the conflict 470 rockets were fired, a much higher rate than had been attained in previous conflicts Of the rockets, 17% were long-range attacks on Tel Aviv, again more than previously [26] About 680 of the rockets fired during hostilities fell short and landed in Gaza; the Iron Dome system intercepted about 90% of the rockets heading to populated areas within Israel [126] During the operation Iron Dome shot down a bomb-laden drone [127]\n\n\n2021 Israel–Palestine crisis\nDuring the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, over 4,300 rockets were fired at Israel by Hamas from Gaza [126] from 11 to 21 May In the first 24 hours of the conflict 470 rockets were fired, a much higher rate than had been attained in previous conflicts Of the rockets, 17% were long-range attacks on Tel Aviv, again more than previously [26] About 680 of the rockets fired during hostilities fell short and landed in Gaza; the Iron Dome system intercepted about 90% of the rockets heading to populated areas within Israel [126] During the operation Iron Dome shot down a bomb-laden drone [127]\n\n\n2024\nDuring the April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel, the Iron Dome was deployed and intercepted attacks from Iran [128]\n\n\nDeployment at sea\nIn 2017 it was reported that Israel was planning to deploy Iron Dome batteries at sea to protect off-shore gas platforms, working in conjunction with Israel's Barak 8 missile system [19] Two Iron Dome batteries were to be deployed on each of the Israeli Navy's Sa'ar 6-class corvettes, [19] which are in charge of guarding the natural gas platforms off Israel's coast and its shipping lanes \nDuring a military exercise in February 2022, an advanced model of the Iron Dome installed on the Sa'ar-6 corvettes was able to shoot down rockets, drones and cruise missiles at sea [130]\n\n\nForeign sales\nSome Iron Dome systems have been exported A weakness for most potential markets is that each Iron Dome system protects no more than 100–150 square kilometres (39–58 square miles); this is effective in a small country like Israel, but not for larger states Even in Israel, the batteries have to be moved around according to perceived risk of attack Singapore, a sovereign island city-state, is reported to have purchased the Iron Dome, and the US Army has bought two batteries to protect overseas bases [132]\n\n\nPossible foreign sales\nFollowing the system's deployment in April 2011, Iron Dome was used to successfully intercept Katyusha rockets fired by Palestinian militants [168] In August that year, Iron Dome intercepted 20 missiles and rockets fired into Israel However, in one instance the system destroyed four rockets fired at the city of Beersheba but failed to stop a fifth, which killed one man and injured several others [169]\n\n\nEffectiveness\nFollowing the system's deployment in April 2011, Iron Dome was used to successfully intercept Katyusha rockets fired by Palestinian militants [168] In August that year, Iron Dome intercepted 20 missiles and rockets fired into Israel However, in one instance the system destroyed four rockets fired at the city of Beersheba but failed to stop a fifth, which killed one man and injured several others [169]\n\n\nCost\nIn 2010, before the system was declared operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a military analyst, former fighter pilot and professor of political science at Tel Aviv University [181] for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means [182] Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are worth the cost [183]\n\n\nVulnerabilities\nIron Dome can potentially be overcome by swarms of many missiles that exceed its capability to intercept them, and by sheer numbers of attacking missiles during a campaign if not enough interceptors are available to counter them Also, the cost of each interception is high, while attacking rockets can be relatively inexpensive These are among the reasons encouraging the development of the Iron Beam energy weapon to complement Iron Dome, which is cheap to fire, has unlimited \"ammunition\", and is effective at short range [3] Iron Dome is also significantly less effective against very short-distance saturation strikes Hamas is aware of these vulnerabilities In addition to having very large numbers of rockets and using saturation strikes, they consistently fire rockets at low trajectories to make them harder to intercept [189]\n\n\nAnalysis\nPrior to its deployment, the Iron Dome was criticized as ineffective in countering the Qassam threat for the southern city of Sderot, given the short distance—840m, half a mile, from the closest point in Sderot to Gaza [195]—and flight time between the much-attacked city and the rocket launching pads in the Gaza Strip [182] [187] Israeli defense officials insisted in 2008 that with recent improvements to Iron Dome, the system was fully able to intercept Qassams [187] [196]\n\n\nPrior to deployment\nPrior to its deployment, the Iron Dome was criticized as ineffective in countering the Qassam threat for the southern city of Sderot, given the

defense officials insisted in 2008 that with recent improvements to Iron Dome, the system was fully able to intercept Qassams [187] [196]\n\n\nAnalysis based on YouTube video footage\nAn unpublished 2013 report [197] by Theodore Postol, Mordechai Shefer and Richard Lloyd, [198] argued that the official effectiveness figures for Iron Dome during Operation Pillar of Defense were incorrect [199] Although Postol had earlier lauded Iron Dome's effectiveness, [200] after studying YouTube videos of the warhead interceptions as well as police reports and other data, he argued that \"Iron Dome's intercept rate, defined as destruction of the rocket's warhead, was relatively low, perhaps as low as 5%, but could well be lower.\" [199] [201] Postol reached this conclusion mainly from an analysis of non-official footage of interceptions taken by civilians and published on YouTube.\n\n\nAnalysis of damage reports\nPostol additionally used the amount of claims filed by the Property Tax Authority and the number of Israeli Police Reports (taken from the Israeli Police website) relating to rockets to support his argument In relation to Postol's argument based on the number of reports the Israeli Police received, Israeli Institute of National Security Studies wrote: \"However, Israel Police reports on calls from citizens, and these include reports on falling fragments, rocket parts, and duds.\" [204]\n\n\nAnalysis of losses per rocket\nResearch published in 2018 analyzed the numbers of deaths, injuries, and property damage claims per rocket fired for four conflicts [205] These were the Second Lebanon War of 2006, Operation Cast Lead in 2008–2009, Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, and Operation Protective Edge in 2014 By comparing the loss rates per rocket of the latter two operations (which had Iron Dome batteries) to the first two (which did not), it estimated the interceptor batteries' overall effectiveness at reducing Israeli losses from rockets [206]\n\n\nEffects on Israeli society\nYoav Fromer of Tel Aviv University argued that the success of Iron Dome provided \"both a physical and a psychological solace that enables Israelis to go about their business,\" which in the long term would reduce the urgency of establishing a broader regional political and diplomatic solution [207]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

some primary controls were seen used in episodes such as Season 1's \"The Keeper (Parts 1 and 2)\", \"His Majesty Smith\", and Season 3's \"A Day At The Zoo\", and \"The Promised Planet\".\n\n\nCharacter development\nDespite being credited as a \"special guest star\" in every episode, Smith became the pivotal character of the series The show's writers expected Smith to be a temporary villain who would only appear in early episodes Harris, on the other hand, hoped to stay longer on the show, but found his character to be boring, and feared it would also quickly bore viewers Harris \"began rewriting his lines and redefining his character\", by playing Smith in an attention-getting, flamboyant style, and ad-libbing his scenes with ripe, colorful dialogue By the end of the first season, the character was established as a self-serving coward whose moral haughtiness and contrasting deceitfulness, along with his alliterative insults largely aimed at the Robot, were staple elements of each episode  [10]\n\n\nCatchphrases\nLost in Space is remembered for the Robot's oft-repeated lines such as \"Warning! Warning!\" and \"It does not compute\" [11] Smith's frequent put-downs of the Robot were also popular Harris was proud to talk about how he used to lie in bed at night dreaming them up for use on the show \"You Bubble-headed Booby!\", \" You Cowardly Clump!\", \"You Tin-Plated Traitor!\", \"You Cackling Cacophony\", \"You Blithering Blatherskyte\", and \"Traitorous Transistorized Toad\" are but a few, alongside his signature lines: \"Oh, the pain .. the pain!\" and \"Never fear, Smith is here!\" One of Harris's last roles was providing the voice of the praying mantis Manny in Disney's A Bug's Life, who also says the line \"Oh, the pain .. the pain!\" near the end of the film [12]\n\n\nLegal issues\nIn 1962, Gold Key comics, a division of Western Publishing Company, began publishing a series of comic books under the title Space Family Robinson The story was largely inspired by The Swiss Family Robinson but with a space-age twist The film and television rights to the comic book were then purchased by noted television writer Hilda Bohem (The Cisco Kid), who created a treatment under the title Space Family 3000.\n\n\nSeries history\nThe show was conceptualized in 1965 with the filming of an unaired pilot episode titled \"No Place to Hide\" The plot of the pilot episode followed the mission of a ship called the Gemini 12, which was to take a single family on a 98-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri The Gemini 12 was pushed off course due to an encounter with an asteroid, and the story centered on the adventures of the Robinson family, depicting them as a happy crew without internal conflicts [17] While many storylines in the later series focused primarily on Dr Zachary Smith, a stowaway and saboteur played by Jonathan Harris, he was absent from the unaired pilot His character was added after the series was commissioned for production [17] The pilot episode was first aired on television during a 1997 retrospective [17]\n\n\nEpisodes\nIn early 1968, after the final third-season episode \"Junkyard in Space\" completed filming, the cast and crew were informally led to believe the series had been renewed for a fourth season Allen had ordered new scripts for the coming season A few weeks later, however, CBS announced the complete list of returning television series for the 1968–69 season, and Lost in Space was not included CBS executives failed to offer any reasons why Lost in Space was cancelled.\n\n\nCancellation\nIn early 1968, after the final third-season episode \"Junkyard in Space\" completed

Earth, the United States is gearing up to colonize space. The Jupiter 2, a futuristic saucer-shaped spacecraft, stands on its launchpad undergoing final preparations. Its mission is to take a single family on a five-and-a-half-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe show was conceptualized in 1965 with the filming of an unaired pilot episode titled \"No Place to Hide.\" The plot of the pilot episode followed the mission of a ship called the Gemini 12, which was to take a single family on a 98-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.\n\n**Season 1**\n\nThe first season begins as the Robinson family and their pilot are about to set out from Earth for a planet circling the star Alpha Centauri. Dr. Smith saves himself from the post-launch crisis of his own making by prematurely reviving the crew from suspended animation. The ship survives, but the damage caused by Smith's earlier sabotage of the robot leaves the crew lost in space. The Jupiter 2 crash-lands on an alien world, later identified by Will as Priplanus, where they spend the rest of the season and survive a host of adventures. Smith remains with the crew and acts as a source of comedic cowardice and villainy, exploiting the eternally forgiving nature of Professor Robinson.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nAt the start of the second season, the repaired Jupiter 2 launches into space once more, to escape the destruction of Priplanus following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes. The Robinsons crash-land on a strange new world, to become planet-bound again for another season.\n\n**Season 3**\n\nIn the third season, a format change was introduced. In this season, the Jupiter 2 travels freely in space in seven episodes, visiting a planet but leaving at the end, or encountering an adventure in space. They visit new worlds in several episodes, with both crash and controlled landings, as the family attempts to either return to Earth or else at least reach their original destination in the Alpha Centauri system. A newly introduced \"Space Pod\" provides a means of transportation between the ship and passing planets, allowing for various escapades.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nDuring its three-season run, a number of actors made guest appearances.\n\n**Main Cast**\n\n* Will Robinson (Bill Mumy)\n* Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris)\n* Professor John Robinson (Guy Williams)\n* Judy Robinson (Marta Kristen)\n* Penny Robinson (Buffy Sainte-Marie)\n\n**Guest Stars**\n\n* Michael Ansara\n* John Milner\n* Jean-Claude Drouot\n* Ray Teal\n* Davy Jones\n* Diana Muldaur\n\n**Production**\n\nProps and monsters were regularly recycled from other Irwin Allen shows. A sea monster outfit that had been featured on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea might get a spray paint job for its Lost in Space appearance, while space monster costumes were reused on Voyage as sea monsters.\n\n**Props**\n\nProps and monsters were regularly recycled from other Irwin Allen shows. A sea monster outfit that had been featured on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea might get a spray paint job for its Lost in Space appearance, while space monster costumes were reused on Voyage as sea monsters.\n\n**Character Development**\n\nDespite being credited as a \"special guest star\" in every episode, Smith became the pivotal character of the series. The show's writers expected Smith to be a temporary villain who would only appear in early episodes. Harris, on the other hand, hoped to stay longer on the show, but found his character to be boring, and feared it would also quickly bore viewers. Harris \"began rewriting his lines and redefining his character\", by playing Smith in an attention-getting, flamboyant style, and ad-libbing his scenes with ripe, colorful dialogue.\n\n**Catchphrases**\n\nLost in Space is remembered for the Robot's oft-repeated lines such as \"Warning! Warning!\" and \"It does not compute.\" Smith's frequent put-downs of the Robot were also popular. Harris was proud to talk about how he used to lie in bed at night dreaming them up for use on the show.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nIn 1962, Gold Key comics, a division of Western Publishing Company, began publishing a series of comic books under the title Space Family Robinson. The story was largely inspired by The Swiss Family Robinson but with a space-age twist.\n\n**Series History**\n\nThe show was conceptualized in 1965 with the filming of an unaired pilot episode titled \"No Place to Hide.\" The plot of the pilot episode followed the mission of a ship called the Gemini 12, which was to take a single family on a 98-year journey to an Earth-like planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nIn early 1968, after the final third-season episode \"Junkyard in Space\" completed filming, the cast and crew were informally led to believe the series had been renewed for a fourth season. Allen had ordered new scripts for the coming season. A few weeks later, however, CBS announced the complete list of returning television series for the 1968–69 season, and Lost in Space was not included.\n\n**Cancellation**\n\nIn early 1968, after the final third-season episode \"Junkyard in Space\" completed filming, the cast and crew were informally led to believe the series had been renewed for a fourth season.

original network television run The more cerebral Star Trek never averaged higher than 52nd in the ratings during its three seasons, [31] [32] while Lost in Space finished season one 35th in the Nielsen ratings, season two in 44th place, and the third and final season in 53rd place [33]\n\n\nAwards\nLost in Space received a 1966 Emmy Award nomination for Cinematography-Special Photographic

lakhs, the company was established as a partnership firm with the flagship company Adani Enterprises, previously Adani Exports [24]\nIn 1990, the Adani Group developed its own port in Mundra to provide a base for its trading operations It began construction at Mundra in 1995 In 1998, it became the top net foreign exchange earner for India Inc [25] The company began coal trading in 1999, followed by a joint venture in edible oil refining in 2000 with the formation of Adani Wilmar [26]\n\n\nEvents\nThe Adani Group launched in 2014, with the support of the Australian and Queensland Governments, a mining and rail project, the Carmichael coal mine, in Queensland's Galilee Basin, for $21.5 billion over the life of the project, i.e 60 years [51] Its annual capacity would be 10 Mt of

in Queensland's Galilee Basin, for $21.5 billion over the life of the project, i.e 60 years [51] Its annual capacity would be 10 Mt of thermal coal [52]\n\n\nCronyism\nChairman and MD Gautam Adani has been described as being close to former Chief Minister of Gujarat and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) [67] This has led to allegations of cronyism as his firms have won many Indian energy and infrastructure government contracts [68] In 2012, an Indian government auditor accused Modi of giving low cost fuel from a Gujarat state-run gas company to the Adani group and other companies [69] [70] In Jharkhand, the BJP-led state government made an exception to its energy policy for Adani's Godda power plant [13] Both the Adani Group and Modi's government have denied allegations of cronyism [70]\n\n\nLeverage\nThe company's corporate debt totaled $30 billion in 2022 [80] In August 2022, CreditSights, a unit of Fitch Ratings, warned that Adani's recent aggressive expansion had hurt the group's cash flow and credit metrics It also stated that a potential \"worst-case scenario\" could lead the group to end up in a debt trap and a potential default [81] [82] The CreditSights report garnered significant attention for its dire assessment of Adani's \"deeply overleveraged” book; after outreach by Adani, CreditSights softened its language but kept its main conclusion [83]\n\n\nStock market rigging\nIn 2007, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) prohibited multiple Adani companies from engaging in the purchase or sale of securities for a period of two years [84] This action was taken due to their involvement in a manipulation scheme that occurred between 1999 and 2001 to artificially influence stock prices This manipulation was carried out through entities overseen by Ketan Parekh, the stockbroker who was the main accused in India’s biggest stock market scandal [85] After paying a fine of $140,000, the companies were eventually permitted to recommence their trading activities [84]\n\n\nAllegations of Bid rigging\nIn March 2023, Adani group won a bid for the coal block North West of Madheri, where the only other bidder was Cavill Mining Private Limited, a minimum of two bidders are required for the first time auction of a commercial mine According to an investigation by Scroll.in, Cavill Mining Private Limited is the main promoter of Adicorp Enterprises Adicorp Enterprises has also been alleged by Hindenburg to have funnelled funds between Adani companies This has raised concerns of bid rigging and collusion [86] Adani group also faced accusations of bid-rigging by the Indian National Congress after winning a contract to supply 6,600 MW of electricity to Maharashtra [87] [88]\n\n\nTax evasion\nOn 27 February 2010, Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Rajesh Adani, managing director of Adani Enterprises Ltd., on charges of custom duty evasion amounting to ₹80 lakh [89]\n\n\nCorporate governance issue\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the group has been found to be maintaining dubious business relations with an engineering contracting firm, Howe Engineering Projects [101] This firm acquired the engineering business of PMC Project in 2016 In the past, PMC Projects, an Adani contractor, was accused of inflating the value of imported power and infrastructure goods by nearly ₹1,500 crore Howe, now a separate entity, continues to work as an Adani contractor (just like PMC Projects) for major ports and railway lines being built in India Deloitte raised concerns in May 2023 about payments made by Adani's ports company to Howe, unable to determine whether Howe should be considered a related party [102] Also, Adani Group had not publicly disclosed these payments until Deloitte highlighted them [103]\n\n\nStock manipulation and accounting fraud allegations\nIn January 2023, Hindenburg Research published the findings of a two-year investigation alleging that Adani had engaged in market manipulation and accounting malpractices The report accused Adani of pulling \"the largest con in corporate history\" [17] [104] and \"brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades\" [17] [105] Hindenburg also disclosed that it was holding short positions on Adani Group companies [106] [107] [108] Bonds and shares of companies associated with Adani experienced a decline of more than $104 billion in market value after the accusations, [109] [110] [111] representing approximately half of the market value [112] Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Hindenburg's Adani Report was \"highly credible and extremely well researched.\" [113] [114] Adani denied the fraud allegations as without merit [115]\n\n\nPresence in Kenya\nIn July 2024, a whistleblower alleged that the Kenya Airports Authority had signed a $1.85 billion deal for the Adani Group to manage the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a period of 30 years in a build–operate–transfer move The alleged deal was brokered by ALG Global, a Spanish firm, and would be financed majorly by Kenyan taxpayers with full control of the airport granted to Adani Group for the 30 years [147] Following widespread protests, in September 2024, the Kenyan High Court temporarily suspended the proposal, to allow for judicial review [148] The whistleblower, Nelson Amenya, fears for his life [149]\n\n\nArms export to Israel\nIn 2018, Adani Defence & Aerospace announced a joint venture with Elbit Systems, Israel's primary defence manufacturer, to produce Hermes

a multinational conglomerate company founded by Gautam Adani in 1988. The company has its roots in commodity trading and has since expanded into various sectors such as energy, infrastructure, transportation, and agriculture. The group is headquartered in Ahmedabad, India, and has a significant presence in several countries, including Australia, the United States, and Kenya.\n\n**History**\n\nAdani Exports Limited, the precursor to the Adani Group, was established in 1988 with a capital of ₹5 lakhs. The company started as a commodity trading firm and gradually expanded its operations into importing and exporting multiple commodities. In the early 1990s, the Adani Group developed its own port in Mundra, Gujarat, to provide a base for its trading operations. The port, which was built in 1995, became a key location for the group's logistics and transportation activities.\n\nIn 1998, the Adani Group became the top net foreign exchange earner for India Inc, with a turnover of over $1 billion. The company's coal trading business was launched in 1999, followed by a joint venture in edible oil refining in 2000 with the formation of Adani Wilmar. The joint venture marked the group's entry into the manufacturing sector and expanded its presence in the food processing industry.\n\n**Events**\n\nIn 2014, the Adani Group launched the Carmichael coal mine project in Queensland, Australia, with the support of the Australian and Queensland governments. The project, which was valued at $21.5 billion, aimed to extract 10 million tons of thermal coal per year. The project was a significant development for the group and marked its entry into the coal mining industry.\n\n**Coal Mining in Australia**\n\nThe Carmichael coal mine project was a major undertaking for the Adani Group and was seen as a significant development in the coal mining industry. The project aimed to extract 10 million tons of thermal coal per year and was valued at $21.5 billion. The project was supported by the Australian and Queensland governments, who saw it as an opportunity to boost the local economy.\n\nHowever, the project faced significant opposition from environmental groups and local communities, who raised concerns about the impact of the mine on the environment and the local water supply. The project was also criticized for its potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef and the local wildlife.\n\n**Cronyism**\n\nGautam Adani, the chairman and managing director of the Adani Group, has been accused of cronyism due to his close ties with the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The group has won several government contracts, including a contract to supply electricity to the state of Maharashtra, which has raised concerns about favoritism and bias.\n\nIn 2012, an Indian government auditor accused Modi of giving low-cost fuel to the Adani Group and other companies, which was seen as a case of cronyism. The auditor's report was widely criticized, and the Adani Group denied any wrongdoing.\n\n**Leverage**\n\nThe Adani Group's corporate debt totaled $30 billion in 2022, which raised concerns about the group's financial stability. In August 2022, CreditSights, a unit of Fitch Ratings, warned that the group's recent aggressive expansion had hurt its cash flow and credit metrics. The report also stated that a potential \"worst-case scenario\" could lead the group to end up in a debt trap and a potential default.\n\n**Stock Market Rigging**\n\nIn 2007, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) prohibited several Adani companies from engaging in the purchase or sale of securities for a period of two years due to their involvement in a manipulation scheme. The scheme, which occurred between 1999 and 2001, was carried out through entities overseen by Ketan Parekh, the stockbroker who was the main accused in India's biggest stock market scandal.\n\n**Allegations of Bid Rigging**\n\nIn March 2023, the Adani Group won a bid for the coal block North West of Madheri, where the only other bidder was Cavill Mining Private Limited. However, an investigation by Scroll.in raised concerns about bid rigging and collusion, as Cavill Mining Private Limited is the main promoter of Adicorp Enterprises, which has been alleged to have funnelled funds between Adani companies.\n\n**Tax Evasion**\n\nOn 27 February 2010, the Central Bureau of Investigation arrested Rajesh Adani, the managing director of Adani Enterprises Ltd., on charges of custom duty evasion amounting to ₹80 lakh.\n\n**Corporate Governance Issue**\n\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg News, the group has been found to be maintaining dubious business relations with an engineering contracting firm, Howe Engineering Projects. The firm acquired the engineering business of PMC Project in 2016 and continues to work as an Adani contractor for major ports and railway lines being built in India.\n\n**Stock Manipulation and Accounting Fraud Allegations**\n\nIn January 2023, Hindenburg Research published a report alleging that the Adani Group had engaged in market manipulation and accounting malpractices. The report accused the group of pulling \"the largest con in corporate history\" and \"brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\"\n\n**Presence in Kenya**\n\nIn July 2024, a whistleblower alleged that the Kenya Airports Authority had signed a $1.85 billion deal for the Adani Group to manage the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a period of 30 years. However, following widespread protests, the Kenyan High Court temporarily suspended the proposal to allow for judicial review.\n\n**Arms Export to Israel**\n\nIn 2018, the Adani Defence & Aerospace announced a joint venture with Elbit Systems, Israel's primary defence manufacturer, to produce Hermes 900 military drones in India. However, in April 2024, the Indian government under the BJP abstained from the UN vote calling for an arms embargo on Israel, which has been linked to the group's military exports to Israel.\n\n**Manipulating Wikipedia Entries**\n\nA report in The Signpost in February 2023 alleged that the Adani team had been manipulating Wikipedia entries using sock puppet accounts to insert promotional material and remove or edit criticism.\n\n**Bribery Allegations**\n\nIn March 2024, the United States expanded its probe into the Adani Group, particularly focusing on founder Gautam Adani's conduct and potential bribery by his group companies in exchange for favorable treatment regarding an energy project.\n\n**Coal Price Inflation**\n\nAccording to an investigation by the Financial Times, the Adani Group had imported $5 billion worth of coal at more than double the market prices through offshore intermediaries in Singapore, Taiwan, and Dubai.

The comic gained widespread attention and notoriety for its storyline, which involved a character's miscarriage. This article provides an overview of the comic's background, reception, and legacy as an internet meme.\n\n**Background**\n\nCtrl+Alt+Del, abbreviated as CAD, is a webcomic series that was created by Tim Buckley. Prior to the publication of \"Loss\", the comic focused on gaming humor, often featuring characters sitting on a couch riffing about the game they were playing. The comic alternated between multi-strip story arcs and one-off gags, which were typically humorous and lighthearted in nature.\n\nThe earlier tone of the strip was described as \"amusing at best and puerile at worst\" by Brian Feldman of the magazine New York. Feldman noted that the comic often relied on violence as a punchline, which was a common criticism of the series during its early years.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe publication of \"Loss\" was met with a negative reaction from some webcomic creators and critics. The creators of the webcomic series Penny Arcade, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins, were asked about the strip during an interview with Joystiq. Both men criticized \"Loss\", with Holkins describing Buckley as the \"Antichrist\" and humorously citing the comic as the first horseman of the Apocalypse.\n\nBen \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw, the creator of the video game review series Zero Punctuation, referenced CAD in an episode on video game webcomics. Croshaw noted that the storyline of a character's miscarriage in a webcomic known for humor would be considered \"an awkward tonal shift at best and hugely disrespectful of the subject matter at worst\".\n\nKotaku's Mike Fahey, who was a self-declared fan of the webcomic, agreed with Croshaw's complaints. Fahey noted that he was unable to read the series like he used to, and that the publication of \"Loss\" was a \"miscarriage of comic publishing\".\n\n**Legacy as an Internet Meme**\n\nAfter the publication of \"Loss\", it immediately became an internet meme. Users from sites such as 4chan and Tumblr created edits of the strip, recreating it using scenes from other works such as Futurama and Pokémon. The 4chan video game board /v/ would later ban users who created new threads about these edits.\n\nParodies of the strip became more abstract, representing it with objects placed generally in the same position as the characters. For example, hot dogs, pipes from Super Mario Bros., or the text from \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn\" were used to recreate the comic.\n\nA minimalist version of the meme involves the sequence in the same four-panel style; first panel with a single vertical line, second panel with two vertical lines, the second line slightly shorter, third panel with two equal vertical lines, and the fourth panel with a vertical line and a horizontal line.\n\nA response to recognizing the meme, a meme in of itself, was \"Is this Loss?\" This meme saw a resurgence around 2017, with users continuing to create and share parodies of the strip.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nLoss is a webcomic series that gained widespread attention and notoriety for its storyline involving a character's miscarriage. The comic's reception was mixed, with some critics praising its bold and humorous approach to a difficult subject, while others criticized its tone and handling of the topic.

admission began in August of that year [31] South Africa officially became a member nation on 24 December 2010, after being formally invited by China to join [32] and was subsequently accepted by other BRIC countries [31] The group was renamed BRICS –with the \"S\" standing for South Africa– to reflect the group's expanded membership [33] In April 2011, the President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, attended the 2011 BRICS summit in Sanya, China as a full member [34] [35] [36]\n\n\nNew Development Bank\nThe New Development Bank (NDB), formally referred to as the BRICS Development Bank, [143] is a multilateral development bank operated by the five BRICS states The bank's primary focus of lending is infrastructure projects [144] [145] with authorized lending of up to $34 billion annually [145] South Africa hosts the African headquarters of the bank [146] The bank has a starting capital of $50 billion, with wealth increased to $100 billion over time [147] Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa initially contributed $10 billion each to bring the total to $50 billion [146] [147] As of 2020, it had 53 projects underway worth around $15 billion [148]\n\n\nOther initiatives\nSince 2011, the National Institutes of Statistics of the BRICS group of countries (IBGE, Rosstat, the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the Central Statistics Office (India) and Statistics South Africa) produce an annual joint statistical publication to put statistical production in perspective, compare adopted methodologies and statistical results The publication serves as a single data platform for the mutual benefit of participating countries.\n\n\n2024 expansion\nIn August 2023, at the 15th BRICS Summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that 6 emerging market group countries (Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) had been invited to join the bloc Full membership was scheduled to take effect on 1 January 2024 [52] [53] [54] However, the Argentine general election in November 2023 led to a change in president to Javier Milei, who had committed to withdraw the country's membership application [55] On 30 November 2023, incoming Foreign Minister of Argentina Diana Mondino confirmed that Argentina would not join the BRICS [56] On 29 December 2023 the Government of Argentina sent a letter to all BRICS leaders to officially announce its withdrawal from the application process [57]\n\n\nSummits\nThe grouping has held annual summits since 2009, with member countries taking turns to host Before South Africa's admission, two BRIC summits were held, in 2009 and 2010 The first five-member BRICS summit was held in 2011 in China The first nine-member BRICS summit was held in 2024 in Russia The 2020, 2021, and 2022 summits were held via video-conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nMember states\nWhile there is currently no formal application process to join BRICS, any hopeful government must receive the unanimous backing of all member states to receive an invitation It was not until the early 2020s that discussions regarding allowing new states to join the club were widely held Leaders and senior diplomats from the participating members began to discuss the prospect of adding additional members to the organization at that point [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nApplication and expansion process\nWhile there is currently no formal application process to join BRICS, any hopeful government must receive the unanimous backing of all member states to receive an invitation It was not until

additional members to the organization at that point [81] [82] [83]\n\n\nPotential candidates for future membership\nThe following countries have either expressed interest in joining BRICS or have already applied for membership: [citation needed]\n\n\nFinancial architecture\nThe financial architecture of BRICS is made of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) These components were signed into a treaty in 2014 and became active in 2015.\n\n\nNew Development Bank\nThe New Development Bank (NDB), formally referred to as the BRICS Development Bank, [143]

Reserve Arrangement\nThe BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) is a framework for protecting against global liquidity pressures [144] [147] [150] This includes currency issues where members' national currencies are being adversely affected by global financial pressures [144] [150] Emerging economies that experienced rapid economic liberalization went through increased economic volatility, bringing an uncertain macroeconomic environment [151] The CRA competes with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Along with the New Development Bank, it is an example of increasing South-South cooperation [144] It was established in 2015 by the BRICS countries The legal basis is formed by the Treaty for the Establishment of a BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement, signed in Fortaleza in July 2014 With its inaugural meetings of the BRICS CRA Governing Council and Standing Committee, held on 4 September 2015, in Ankara, Turkey [152] It entered into force upon ratification by all BRICS states, announced at the 7th BRICS summit in July 2015.\n\n\nBRICS payment system\nAt the 2015 BRICS summit in Russia, ministers from the BRICS states initiated consultations for a payment system that would be an alternative to the SWIFT system The stated goal was to initially move to settlements in national currencies [153] The Central Bank of Russia highlighted the main benefits as backup and redundancy in case there were disruptions to the SWIFT system [154]\n\n\nPotential common currency\nBRICS countries committed to study the feasibility of a new common currency or similar, at the 2023 BRICS summit in South Africa [156] [157] [158] Fair and easier international trade as well as a major reduction in costs of transactions would be some of the reasons why the countries could forge a currency union [159]\n\n\nReception\nIn 2012, Hu Jintao, the then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, described the BRICS countries as defenders and promoters of developing countries and a force for world peace [160] Western analysts have highlighted potential divisions and weaknesses in the grouping, including significant economic instabilities, [161] [162] [163] [164] disagreements among the members over UN Security Council reform, [165] and India and China's disputes [166] over territorial issues [167]\n\n\nChina\nIn 2012, Hu Jintao, the then General

the American think tank Council on Foreign Relations, and later U.S representative to the UN, claimed that the BRICS members share a lack of consensus They uphold drastically different political systems, from vibrant liberal democracies in Brazil and South Africa to entrenched oligarchy in Russia, and their economies are poorly integrated and differ in size by orders of magnitude She also claimed that the significant difference in GDP influences the reserves: China accounts for over 41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to its bigger political say within the association [168]\n\n\nIndia\nIn 2014, the Indian Marxist author Vijay Prashad raised the limitations of the BRICS as a political and economic \"locomotive of the South\" because they follow neoliberal policies They have neither established new counter-balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative ideology Furthermore, the BRICS project, argues Prashad, cannot challenge the primacy of the United States and NATO [172]\n\n\nGlobal Opinion\nAccording to a Gallup International poll conducted between October and December 2023, almost a third of people around the world had never heard of BRICS but Western countries were much more negative towards the alliance than elsewhere The most negative attitudes were found in Sweden (45%), Spain (30%), the USA (30%), Portugal (29%), and Ukraine (29%) while the most positive net attitudes were in Russia (38%), Iran (37%), Nigeria (36%), Saudi Arabia (33%) and Malaysia (32%) In India, 36% had a positive view of BRICS while 29% had a negative view [173] [174]\n\n\nBRICS Pro Tempore Presidency\nThe group at each summit elects one of the heads of state of the component countries to serve as President Pro Tempore of the BRICS In 2019, the position

The film follows a group of mercenaries on the planet of Pandora as they embark on a perilous quest to uncover the secrets of a mysterious corporation. The movie has generated significant buzz among fans of the video game series, but its reception has been mixed among critics. In this article, we will explore the plot, cast, production, release, and reception of the film.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place on the planet of Pandora, where a group of mercenaries, including Roland, a rogue soldier, and Tiny Tina, a teenage girl, are on a mission to kidnap a powerful figure. However, things take a turn when they are ambushed by a group of psycho killers, led by Krieg, a former inmate of a psychiatric facility. The group soon discovers that they are not alone on Pandora, and that a powerful corporation, known as Hyperion, is also searching for the same figure.\n\nAs they navigate the treacherous landscape of Pandora, the group encounters various characters, including Wainwright Jakobs, a wealthy entrepreneur, and Alistair Hammerlock, a scientist. However, their journey is threatened by the corporation's agents, who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including Cate Blanchett as Lilith, a powerful warrior, and Kevin Hart as Jack, a lovable but awkward mercenary. Additionally, Penn Jillette was set to make a cameo appearance as a preacher overseeing a wedding, but the scene was ultimately cut from the final version of the film.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe idea for a film adaptation of Borderlands was first discussed in 2011 by Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford and producers Avi and Ari Arad of Arad Productions. However, it wasn't until 2015 that the project was officially announced, with Leigh Whannell set to write and direct the film. However, Whannell's involvement was later dropped, and the project was taken over by Eli Roth.\n\nThe film was produced by Lionsgate Films, with a budget of $110-120 million. The production company reportedly spent an additional $30 million on print and advertising costs. International presales accounted for 60% of the production costs, with the remaining 40% covered by Lionsgate.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was initially scheduled for release in 2022, but it was later pushed back to August 9, 2024. It premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on August 6, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by Lionsgate Films.\n\nThe film's release was accompanied by a marketing campaign that highlighted the film's action-packed sequences and stunning visuals. The trailer for the film was released in June 2024, and it quickly generated buzz among fans of the video game series.\n\n**Theatrical**\n\nThe film was released in 3,200 theaters in the United States and Canada, with an average ticket price of $12.50. The film's opening weekend gross was $7.5 million, with a per-screen average of $2,350.\n\n**Home media**\n\nThe film was released on Digital HD and platforms on August 30, 2024, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The home media release includes a variety of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Glitching out in every department, Borderlands is balderdash.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 26 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 46% positive score, with 31% saying they would definitely recommend it.\n\n**Box office**\n\nAs of October 3, 2024, the film has grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $17.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33 million. Following its opening weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film would likely lose the studio $20-30 million.\n\n**Critical response**\n\nThe film's critical reception has been mixed, with some critics praising its visuals and action sequences, while others have criticized its storytelling and characters. Some critics have also noted that the film's tone is inconsistent, veering wildly from humor to drama to action.\n\nOverall, the film's reception has been disappointing, especially considering the popularity of the video game series. However, the film's release has generated significant buzz among fans of the series, and it remains to be seen whether the film will ultimately be a commercial success.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Borderlands (video game series)\n* Eli Roth\n* Lionsgate Films\n* Cate Blanchett\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Borderlands on IMDb\n* Borderlands on Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Borderlands_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nOn the planet of Pandora, Roland, a mercenary soldier apparently gone rogue, kidnaps teenager Tiny Tina with the help of Krieg, a \"Psycho\" who was institutionalized in the same facility.\n\n\nCast\nAdditionally, Penn Jillette was going to have a cameo in the film as a preacher overseeing a wedding, after voicing Pain in the video game Borderlands 3 (2019); [16] however, this scene was not included in the final version of the film [17] Scenes with Cheyenne Jackson as Wainwright Jakobs and Charles Babalola as Alistair Hammerlock were also cut [18]\n\n\nProduction\nIn 2011, Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford had his first conversation about a possible film adaptation of Borderlands with producers Avi and Ari Arad of Arad Productions [19] Pitchford was convinced that a film adaption would work after the release of Tales from the Borderlands [20] He later planned on starting a Borderlands cinematic universe [21] In May 2015, Leigh Whannell was in talks with Lionsgate to write and direct an adaptation of the video game series [22] The film was officially announced in August 2015; however, Whannell's involvement was left omitted [23]\n\n\nRelease\nBorderlands was initially planned to be released in 2022 [47] [48] It premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on August 6, 2024 [49] It was theatrically released in the United States by Lionsgate Films on August 9, 2024 [50] The film cost $110–120 million to produce, and Lionsgate spent $30 million on print and advertising International presales reportedly covered 60% of production costs [51] Sales of Borderlands 3 on Steam rose after the film's release and the concurrent player amount doubled from around 6,000 to a peak of 12,231 [52]\n\n\nTheatrical\nBorderlands was initially planned to be released in 2022 [47] [48] It premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on August 6, 2024 [49] It was theatrically released in the United States by Lionsgate Films on August 9, 2024 [50] The film cost $110–120 million to produce, and Lionsgate spent $30 million on print and advertising International presales reportedly covered 60% of production costs [51] Sales of Borderlands 3 on Steam rose after the film's release and the concurrent player amount doubled from around 6,000 to a peak of 12,231 [52]\n\n\nHome media\nOn August 18, 2024, Lionsgate Home Entertainment announced that Borderlands would be released on Digital HD and platforms on August 30, 2024 [53]\n\n\nReception\nAs of October 3, 2024 [update], Borderlands has grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $17.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33 million [2] [3] Following its opening weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported the film would likely lose the studio $20–30 million [54]\n\n\nBox office\nAs of October 3, 2024 [update], Borderlands has grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $17.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $33 million [2] [3] Following its opening weekend, Deadline Hollywood reported the film would likely lose the studio $20–30 million [54]\n\n\nCritical response\nBorderlands received negative reviews [59] [60] [61] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 10% of 162 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 3.3/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Glitching out in every department, Borderlands is balderdash.\" [62] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 26 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable\" reviews [63] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 46% positive score, with 31% saying they would definitely recommend it [54]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

his father was a disciplinarian and his mother overprotective [4]\n\n\nAdolescence\nBy 1957, Fred and his brother John frequently socialised at a youth club in nearby Ledbury, where his distinct and guttural Herefordshire accent marked him as a \"country bumpkin\" He aggressively pestered women and girls, whom he objectified as sources of pleasure to be used as he saw fit, and would abruptly approach and fondle them [12] When a girl accepted his advances, she would find his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification [13]\n\n\nCatherine \"Rena\" Costello\nFred became re-acquainted with Catherine (Rena) Bernadette Costello [21] in September 1962, when he was 21 He had first met Costello, who came from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, [22] at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland [23] Costello was pregnant by an Asian bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from Glasgow to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed-race child [24] She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John [21] The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963; [24] to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a miscarriage and that Charmaine was adopted Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow [25]\n\n\nMarriage\nFred became re-acquainted with Catherine (Rena) Bernadette Costello [21] in September 1962, when he was 21 He had first met Costello, who came from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, [22] at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland [23] Costello was pregnant by an Asian bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from Glasgow to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed-race child [24] She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John [21] The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963; [24] to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a miscarriage and that Charmaine was adopted Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow [25]\n\n\nMurder of Anne McFall\nIn July 1967, [43] McFall, aged 18 and eight months pregnant with Fred's child, vanished She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried at the edge of a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994 Her limbs had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalanges (finger bones) were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb [44] Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder [45]\n\n\nRosemary Letts\nFred first encountered Rosemary Letts in early 1969, shortly after her 15th birthday [47] The pair first met while waiting for the same bus in Cheltenham [48] Initially, Rose was repulsed by the then-27-year-old Fred's unkempt appearance and deduced he was a tramp, [49] but she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred, but allowed him to accompany her home In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children [50]\n\n\nRelationship\nRose's parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was dating an older man, and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at his caravan [55] In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969, [56] and only allowed to leave under controlled conditions When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred [56]\n\n\nMurder of Charmaine West\nRose is believed to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred's prison release date of 24 June 1971 She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June It is believed to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered As well as forensic odontology confirmation that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Tracey Giles' mother, Shirley, corroborated the fact that Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June In her later testimony at Rose's trial, Shirley stated she and her family had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road in 1971 and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie She stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: \"She's gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!\" [66] before Tracey began to weep [67] Giles was adamant Fred was still in prison on this occasion [68]\n\n\nMurder of Catherine \"Rena\" West\nRena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated She is also known to have visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children's whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971 [71] Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was depressed and extremely anxious about her children's welfare Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him—likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters This was the final time Rena was seen alive She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred's Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated [72] When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder Rena's body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at Letterbox Field, about one mile (1.6 km; 1,600 m) from Much Marcle [73] [74]\n\n\nMarriage to Letts\nOn 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary married The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself upon the marriage certificate as a bachelor No family or friends were invited apart from Fred's brother John, who acted as best man [75] Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for £7,000 [76] To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms were initially converted into bedsits to supplement the household income To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only he and his family were permitted access to the garden of the property On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June [77]\n\n\nProstitution\nShortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at their residence and advertising her services in a local contact magazine Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester's West Indian community through these advertisements [78] In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in casual sex with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her [79] When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner with acts such as partially suffocating her partner, or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner's body If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: \"Aren't you woman enough to take it?\" [80]\n\n\nDomestic violence\nWhen each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were rarely allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either of their parents were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules The children feared being the recipients of violence from their parents, the vast majority inflicted by Rose, occasionally by Fred The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose's gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults Firstly Heather, and subsequently her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), ran away from home; both returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends, and both were beaten when they returned home [88] Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services [89] [90]\n\n\nInitial sexual assaults\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was forced to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation [94] She was restrained before Fred raped her [95] with Rose's active encouragement [96] After the rape, Rose followed Anna Marie to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary towel, explaining to the child: \"I'm sorry Everybody does it to every girl It's a father's job Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\" [97] Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands [98] [n 2]\n\n\nAnna Marie West\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was forced to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation [94] She was restrained before Fred raped her [95] with Rose's active encouragement [96] After the rape, Rose followed Anna Marie to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary towel, explaining to the child: \"I'm sorry Everybody does it to every girl It's a father's job Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\" [97] Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands [98] [n 2]\n\n\nCaroline Owens\nIn October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children's nanny They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she hitchhiked from Tewkesbury to her Cinderford home, having visited her boyfriend Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, the Wests offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street, sharing a room with Anna Marie, who Owens noted was \"very withdrawn\" [104]\n\n\nMurders\nThree months after the Wests' assault trial, the couple committed their first known murder The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973 Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and engaged in affairs with two male lodgers On 19 April, she moved into their home on Cromwell Street On or about 20 April, [112] other tenants were told that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children This story was later repeated to Gough's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire about her daughter's whereabouts [113] [n 3]\n\n\nAbuse\nHeather and Mae West became the focus of Fred's incestuous [59] sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home in 1979 [128] after enduring a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an ectopic pregnancy [129] The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls reached puberty Fred was overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: \"I made you; I can do what I like with you.\" [130] He further referred to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped Both girls also developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door Stephen was also informed by his father that he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (in the event, his parents evicted him from their home when he was 16) [131]\n\n\nMurder of Heather West\nHeather did complain to friends about the abuse she and her siblings endured, and her external signs of psychological distress were noted by several of them Staff at the Hucclecote Secondary School, which Heather and her siblings attended, are also known to have expressed concern as to why Heather—a studious and obedient pupil—refused to obey orders either to change her clothing for, or shower after, sporting activities On one occasion, she was forced to take a shower, resulting in her peers and staff noting her arms, legs and torso were covered in welts and bruises in various stages of healing [138] Heather attempted to excuse these injuries as having been obtained in fights with her siblings, but confided in one close friend that they had been inflicted by her parents, adding that her mother considered her a \"little bitch\" who deserved her beatings [139]\n\n\nArrest\nIn May 1992, Fred asked his 13-year-old daughter, Louise, to bring some bottles to a room on the first floor of their home Rose was not present in the home at the time Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, \"No, don't!\" Later, Fred returned downstairs Louise was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her [146] When Rose returned home, Louise confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred; Rose replied, \"Oh well You were asking for it.\" Over the following weeks, Louise was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, \"Well, what did you expect?\" [147] Fred also filmed one of these rapes Several weeks later, Louise garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend told her own mother what had happened on 4 August In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.\n\n\nInvestigation\nPolice began a full-scale investigation, eventually leading to Fred being charged with three counts of rape, and one of buggery, with Rose as an accomplice She was also charged with child cruelty, inciting her husband to engage in sex with their daughter, [149] and obstructing the police The Wests were questioned as to the whereabouts of their eldest daughter, and although Fred claimed Heather was \"alive and well\" and supporting herself via prostitution, Rose initially claimed to have no knowledge of Heather's whereabouts, or why she had left home She claimed on 11 August that she could \"remember now\" that her daughter had left home at her own persuasion due to Rose's concerns her other children may discover Heather's supposed lesbian inclinations Rose then added she had also given her daughter £600 to incentivise her to leave the household, before further claiming to have maintained sporadic telephone contact with her daughter over the years The following day, Rose was granted bail on the condition she did not maintain contact with her children, her stepdaughter, or her husband prior to her upcoming trial [150]\n\n\nSearch warrant\nAlthough the Wests were acquitted of all charges, all their younger children remained in foster care, albeit with permitted supervised visitations to Cromwell Street Despite the Wests claiming to the few relatives from whom they were not already estranged by 1993 that the charges had been fabricated by police, almost all of their remaining family members severed contact with them [155] Meanwhile, police continued investigating the disappearance of Heather, noting no records existed indicating she was still alive When Anna Marie was questioned as to the colloquial \"family joke\" regarding Heather being buried beneath the patio, she confirmed that the sole time she had heard her father recite this claim, he had immediately burst into laughter, leading to her refusing to take this claim seriously [156]\n\n\nDiscoveries\nAt 11:15 that morning, Fred formally admitted to police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit in an act of manslaughter He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage, then dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body [162] Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and Janet Leach, his appointed appropriate adult, [163] informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister [134]\n\n\nArrest of Rose West\nDespite Fred's insistence that his wife held no knowledge of any of the murders, [173] investigators suspected otherwise Rose was arrested on 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy—both charges dating from the mid-1970s The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to Pucklechurch Prison to be held in the maximum security wing Here, she was questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter Heather and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough's murder [174]\n\n\nFormal charges\nFred and Rose West were brought before a magistrates' court in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; he was charged with 12 murders and she with nine [176] This was the first time the couple had seen each other since Fred's February arrest Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred leaned toward his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose—having ignored her husband's presence—visibly winced in discomfort Both were ordered held on remand [177]\n\n\nDiversion of culpability\nAs he was held on remand at HM Prison Birmingham in the months following his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed This became worse after Rose's public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates' Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter to her husband and in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him [180]\n\n\nDeath\nTo Rose West, Steve and Mae,\n\n\nTrial of Rose West\nAt pretrial proceedings in February, Rose pleaded not guilty to ten charges of murder (the murder of Charmaine West having been added to the original nine after Fred's suicide, and two counts of rape and indecent assault of young girls having been dropped with a view for later resubmission), though her counsel conceded that circumstantial evidence indicated Rose's willingness to subject young girls to sadistic physical and sexual abuse [186] [187]\nHer trial at Winchester Crown Court began on 3 October 1995 She was tried before Mr Justice Mantell [188]\n\n\nProsecution\nIn his opening statement, prosecutor Brian Leveson portrayed the Wests as sex-obsessed sadistic murderers, terming the bodies discovered at Cromwell Street and Midland Road \"secrets more terrible than words can express ..  [The victims'] last moments on Earth were as objects of the depravity of this woman and her husband\" [190]\nHe pointed out that Fred was incarcerated when Charmaine West was killed; claimed that the Wests had each learned from their mistake in allowing Caroline Owens to live (they \"would never be so trusting again\"); [190] and said that the gag on victim Thérèse Siegenthaler had a \"feminine\" touch‍—‌a scarf tied in a bow [191] He promised to demonstrate Rose's controlling and sexually sadistic character and her efforts to deflect suspicion about the disappearance of their victims [192]\n\n\nDefence testimony\nFerguson emphasised that Fred, before meeting Rose, had committed at least one murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution's case was largely circumstantial He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred's sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner [196]\n\n\nConviction\nAfter seven weeks of evidence the judge instructed the jury, emphasising that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for a finding of guilt, and that if two people take part in a murder, the law considers them equally guilty regardless of which of them did the deed [204]\nOn 21 and 22 November, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts for all ten murders [205] [206] Terming her crimes \"appalling and depraved\", [207] Mr Justice Mantell sentenced Rosemary to life in prison, emphasising that she should never be paroled [208]\nInitially, Rose was incarcerated at HMP Bronzefield as a Category A prisoner; [209] she was later transferred to HM Prison Low Newton before, in 2019, being transferred to HM Prison New Hall, [210] where she continues to protest her innocence [208] [211]\n\n\nVictims\nFred and Rose West are known to have committed at least 12 murders between 1967 and 1987; many investigators, authors, and journalists who have studied the case believe there are other victims whose bodies have never been found [212] Prior to his suicide, police had recorded over 108 hours of tape-recorded interviews with Fred, both when he had claimed to have acted alone in the commission of the murders, and when he had attempted to portray Rose as being the more culpable participant On several occasions, Fred made cryptic hints he had murdered several other girls, but refused to divulge any further information beyond that he had murdered 15-year-old Mary Bastholm in 1968 and buried the body on farmland near Bishop's Cleeve He also claimed to have killed one victim while working on a construction project in Birmingham, and that other bodies had been buried in Scotland and Herefordshire [213] [n 7]\n\n\n1967\nFootnotes\n\n\n1968\nFootnotes\n\n\n1971\nFootnotes\n\n\n1973\nFootnotes\n\n\n1974\nFootnotes\n\n\n1975\nFootnotes\n\n\n1978\nFootnotes\n\n\n1979\nFootnotes\n\n\n1987\nFootnotes\n\n\nPossible additional victims\nPolice firmly believe the Wests were responsible for further unsolved murders and disappearances They believed they committed ten murders between 1971 and 1979, at least seven of which were for sexual purposes Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978 They committed one further murder in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until they murdered their daughter in 1987 Police do not know of any further murders they committed before their 1994 arrest although Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, indicating up to 18 other undiscovered victims [244]\n\n\nAftermath\nFred's body was cremated in Coventry on 29 March 1995 in a funeral that was attended by just four of his children In a five-minute service, in which no hymns were sung, the Reverend Robert Simpson quoted sections of Psalm 23, then added a solemn reminder to those present that they must \"also remember everyone else who has also suffered because of these tragic events\" His ashes are believed to have been scattered at the Welsh seaside resort of Barry Island, a location he had regularly visited both as a child and as an adult with his family [252]\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited works and further reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fred_West\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nFrederick Walter Stephen West was born on 29 September 1941, [1] at Bickerton Cottage, Much Marcle, Herefordshire, [2] the first surviving child of Walter Stephen West (1914–1992) and Daisy Hannah Hill (1922–1968) [3] Fred was from a poor family of farm workers, close-knit and mutually protective; his father was a disciplinarian and his mother overprotective [4]\n\n\nChildhood\nFrederick Walter Stephen West was born on 29 September 1941, [1] at Bickerton Cottage, Much Marcle, Herefordshire, [2] the first surviving child of Walter Stephen West (1914–1992) and Daisy Hannah Hill (1922–1968) [3] Fred was from a poor family of farm workers, close-knit and mutually protective; his father was a disciplinarian and his mother overprotective [4]\n\n\nAdolescence\nBy 1957, Fred and his brother John frequently socialised at a youth club in nearby Ledbury, where his distinct and guttural Herefordshire accent marked him as a \"country bumpkin\" He aggressively pestered women and girls, whom he objectified as sources of pleasure to be used as he saw fit, and would abruptly approach and fondle them [12] When a girl accepted his advances, she would find his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification [13]\n\n\nCatherine \"Rena\" Costello\nFred became re-acquainted with Catherine (Rena) Bernadette Costello [21] in September 1962, when he was 21 He had first met Costello, who came from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, [22] at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland [23] Costello was pregnant by an Asian bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from Glasgow to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed-race child [24] She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John [21] The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963; [24] to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a miscarriage and that Charmaine was adopted Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow [25]\n\n\nMarriage\nFred became re-acquainted with Catherine (Rena) Bernadette Costello [21] in September 1962, when he was 21 He had first met Costello, who came from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, [22] at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland [23] Costello was pregnant by an Asian bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from Glasgow to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed-race child [24] She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John [21] The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963;

her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb [44] Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder [45]\n\n\nRosemary Letts\nFred first encountered Rosemary Letts in early 1969, shortly after her 15th birthday [47] The pair first met while waiting for the same bus in Cheltenham [48] Initially, Rose was repulsed by the then-27-year-old Fred's unkempt appearance and deduced he was a tramp, [49] but she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred, but allowed him to accompany her home In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children [50]\n\n\nRelationship\nRose's parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was dating an older man, and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at his caravan [55] In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969, [56] and only allowed to leave under controlled conditions When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred [56]\n\n\nMurder of Charmaine West\nRose is believed to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred's prison release date of 24 June 1971 She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June It is believed to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered As well as forensic odontology confirmation that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Tracey Giles' mother, Shirley, corroborated the fact that Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June In her later testimony at Rose's trial, Shirley stated she and her family had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road in 1971 and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie She stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: \"She's gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!\" [66] before Tracey began to weep [67] Giles was adamant Fred was still in prison on this occasion [68]\n\n\nMurder of Catherine \"Rena\" West\nRena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated She is also known to have visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children's whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971 [71] Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was depressed and extremely anxious about her children's welfare Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him—likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters This was the final time Rena was seen alive She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred's Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated [72] When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder Rena's body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at Letterbox Field, about one mile (1.6 km; 1,600 m) from Much Marcle [73] [74]\n\n\nMarriage to Letts\nOn 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary married The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself upon the marriage certificate as a bachelor No family or friends were invited apart from Fred's brother John, who acted as best man [75] Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for £7,000 [76] To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms were initially converted into bedsits to supplement the household income To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only he and his family were permitted access to the garden of the property On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June [77]\n\n\nProstitution\nShortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at their residence and advertising her services in a local contact magazine Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester's West Indian community through these advertisements [78] In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in casual sex with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her [79] When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner with acts such as partially suffocating her partner, or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner's body If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: \"Aren't you woman enough to take it?\" [80]\n\n\nDomestic violence\nWhen each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were rarely allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either of their parents were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules The children feared being the recipients of violence from their parents, the vast majority inflicted by Rose, occasionally by Fred The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose's gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults Firstly Heather, and subsequently her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), ran away from home; both returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends, and both were beaten when they returned home [88] Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services [89] [90]\n\n\nInitial sexual assaults\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was forced to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation [94] She was restrained before Fred raped her [95] with Rose's active encouragement [96] After the rape, Rose followed Anna Marie to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary towel, explaining to the child: \"I'm sorry Everybody does it to every girl It's a father's job Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\" [97] Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands [98] [n 2]\n\n\nAnna Marie West\nIn September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was forced to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child's hesitation [94] She was restrained before Fred raped her [95] with Rose's active encouragement [96] After the rape, Rose followed Anna Marie to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary towel, explaining to the child: \"I'm sorry Everybody does it to every girl It's a father's job Don't worry, and don't say anything to anybody.\" [97] Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands [98] [n 2]\n\n\nCaroline Owens\nIn October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children's nanny They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she hitchhiked from Tewkesbury to her Cinderford home, having visited her boyfriend Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, the Wests offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street, sharing a room with Anna Marie, who Owens noted was \"very withdrawn\" [104]\n\n\nMurders\nThree months after the Wests' assault trial, the couple committed their first known murder The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973 Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and engaged in affairs with two male lodgers On 19 April, she moved into their home on Cromwell Street On or about 20 April, [112] other tenants were told that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children This story was later repeated to Gough's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire about her daughter's whereabouts [113] [n 3]\n\n\nAbuse\nHeather and Mae West became the focus of Fred's incestuous [59] sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home in 1979 [128] after enduring a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an ectopic pregnancy [129] The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls reached puberty Fred was overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: \"I made you; I can do what I like with you.\" [130] He further referred to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped Both girls also developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door Stephen was also informed by his father that he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (in the event, his parents evicted him from their home when he was 16) [131]\n\n\nMurder of Heather West\nHeather did complain to friends about the abuse she and her siblings endured, and her external signs of psychological distress were noted by several of them Staff at the Hucclecote Secondary School, which Heather and her siblings attended, are also known to have expressed concern as to why Heather—a studious and obedient pupil—refused to obey orders either to change her clothing for, or shower after, sporting activities On one occasion, she was forced to take a shower, resulting in her peers and staff noting her arms, legs and torso were covered in welts and bruises in various stages of healing [138] Heather attempted to excuse these injuries as having been obtained in fights with her siblings, but confided in one close friend that they had been inflicted by her parents, adding that her mother considered her a \"little bitch\" who deserved her beatings [139]\n\n\nArrest\nIn May 1992, Fred asked his 13-year-old daughter, Louise, to bring some bottles to a room on the first floor of their home Rose was not present in the home at the time Shortly thereafter, the girl's siblings heard her scream, \"No, don't!\" Later, Fred returned downstairs Louise was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her [146] When Rose returned home, Louise confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred; Rose replied, \"Oh well You were asking for it.\" Over the following weeks, Louise was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, \"Well, what did you expect?\" [147] Fred also filmed one of these rapes Several weeks later, Louise garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend told her own mother what had happened on 4 August In response, the friend's mother anonymously informed the police.\n\n\nInvestigation\nPolice began a full-scale investigation, eventually leading to Fred being charged with three counts of rape, and one of buggery, with Rose as an accomplice She was also charged with child cruelty, inciting her husband to engage in sex with their daughter, [149] and obstructing the police The Wests were questioned as to the whereabouts of their eldest daughter, and although Fred claimed Heather was \"alive and well\" and supporting herself via prostitution, Rose initially claimed to have no knowledge of Heather's whereabouts, or why she had left home She claimed on 11 August that she could \"remember now\" that her daughter had left home at her own persuasion due to Rose's concerns her other children may discover Heather's supposed lesbian inclinations Rose then added she had also given her daughter £600 to incentivise her to leave the household, before further claiming to have maintained sporadic telephone contact with her daughter over the years The following day, Rose was granted bail on the condition she did not maintain contact with her children, her stepdaughter, or her husband prior to her upcoming trial [150]\n\n\nSearch warrant\nAlthough the Wests were acquitted of all charges, all their younger children remained in foster care, albeit with permitted supervised visitations to Cromwell Street Despite the Wests claiming to the few relatives from whom they were not already estranged by 1993 that the charges had been fabricated by police, almost all of their remaining family members severed contact with them [155] Meanwhile, police continued investigating the disappearance of Heather, noting no records existed indicating she was still alive When Anna Marie was questioned as to the colloquial \"family joke\" regarding Heather being buried beneath the patio, she confirmed that the sole time she had heard her father recite this claim, he had immediately burst into laughter, leading to her refusing to take this claim seriously [156]\n\n\nDiscoveries\nAt 11:15 that morning, Fred formally admitted to police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit in an act of manslaughter He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage, then dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body [162] Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and Janet Leach, his appointed appropriate adult, [163] informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister [134]\n\n\nArrest of Rose West\nDespite Fred's insistence that his wife held no knowledge of any of the murders, [173] investigators suspected otherwise Rose was arrested on 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy—both charges dating from the mid-1970s The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to Pucklechurch Prison to be held in the maximum security wing Here, she was questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter Heather and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough's murder [174]\n\n\nFormal charges\nFred and Rose West were brought before a magistrates' court in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; he was charged with 12 murders and she with nine [176] This was the first time the couple had seen each other since Fred's February arrest Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred leaned toward his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose—having ignored her husband's presence—visibly winced in discomfort Both were ordered held on remand [177]\n\n\nDiversion of culpability\nAs he was held on remand at HM Prison Birmingham in the months following his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed This became worse after Rose's public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates' Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter to her husband and in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him [180]\n\n\nDeath\nTo Rose West, Steve and Mae,\n\n\nTrial of Rose West\nAt pretrial proceedings in February, Rose pleaded not guilty to ten charges of murder (the murder of Charmaine West having been added to the original nine after Fred's suicide, and two counts of rape and indecent assault of young girls having been dropped with a view for later resubmission), though her counsel conceded that circumstantial evidence indicated Rose's willingness to subject young girls to sadistic physical and sexual abuse [186] [187]\nHer trial at Winchester Crown Court began on 3 October 1995 She was tried before Mr Justice Mantell [188]\n\n\nProsecution\nIn his opening statement, prosecutor Brian Leveson portrayed the Wests as sex-obsessed sadistic murderers, terming the bodies discovered at Cromwell Street and Midland Road \"secrets more terrible than words can express ..  [The victims'] last moments on Earth were as objects of the depravity of this woman and her husband\" [190]\nHe pointed out that Fred was incarcerated when Charmaine West was killed; claimed that the Wests had each learned from their mistake in allowing Caroline Owens to live (they \"would never be so trusting again\"); [190] and said that the gag on victim Thérèse Siegenthaler had a \"feminine\" touch‍—‌a scarf tied in a bow [191] He promised to demonstrate Rose's controlling and sexually sadistic character and her efforts to deflect suspicion about the disappearance of their victims [192]\n\n\nDefence testimony\nFerguson emphasised that Fred, before meeting Rose, had committed at least one murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution's case was largely circumstantial He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred's sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner [196]\n\n\nConviction\nAfter seven weeks of evidence the judge instructed the jury, emphasising that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for a finding of guilt, and that if two people take part in a murder, the law considers them equally guilty regardless of which of them did the deed [204]\nOn 21 and 22 November, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts for all ten murders [205] [206] Terming her crimes \"appalling and depraved\", [207] Mr Justice Mantell sentenced Rosemary to life in prison, emphasising that she should never be paroled [208]\nInitially, Rose was incarcerated at HMP Bronzefield as a Category A prisoner; [209] she was later transferred to HM Prison Low Newton before, in 2019, being transferred to HM Prison New Hall, [210] where she continues to protest her innocence [208] [211]\n\n\nVictims\nFred and Rose West are known to have committed at least 12 murders between 1967 and 1987; many investigators, authors, and journalists who have studied the case believe there are other victims whose bodies have never been found [212] Prior to his suicide, police had recorded over 108 hours of tape-recorded interviews with Fred, both when he had claimed to have acted alone in the commission of the murders, and when he had attempted to portray Rose as being the more culpable participant On several occasions, Fred made cryptic hints he had murdered several other girls, but refused to divulge any further information beyond that he had murdered 15-year-old Mary Bastholm in 1968 and buried the body on farmland near Bishop's Cleeve He also claimed to have killed one victim while working on a construction project in Birmingham, and that other bodies had been buried in Scotland and Herefordshire [213] [n 7]\n\n\n1967\nFootnotes\n\n\n1968\nFootnotes\n\n\n1971\nFootnotes\n\n\n1973\nFootnotes\n\n\n1974\nFootnotes\n\n\n1975\nFootnotes\n\n\n1978\nFootnotes\n\n\n1979\nFootnotes\n\n\n1987\nFootnotes\n\n\nPossible additional victims\nPolice firmly believe the Wests were responsible for further unsolved murders and disappearances They believed they committed ten murders between 1971 and 1979, at least seven of which were for sexual purposes Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978 They committed one further murder in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until they murdered their daughter in 1987 Police do not know of any further murders they committed before their 1994 arrest although Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, indicating up to 18 other undiscovered victims [244]\n\n\nAftermath\nFred's body was cremated in Coventry on 29 March 1995 in a funeral that was attended by just four of his children In a five-minute service, in which no hymns were sung, the Reverend Robert Simpson quoted sections of Psalm 23, then added a solemn reminder to those present that they must \"also remember everyone else who has also suffered because of these tragic events\" His ashes are believed to have been scattered at the Welsh seaside resort of Barry Island, a location he had regularly visited both as a child and as an adult with his family [252]\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited works and further reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal, Shaista Khan, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the world's first Industrial Revolution [13] [14]  The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era [54] [55]\n\n\nColonial period\nSeveral European traders reached this area in the late 15th century The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 The

1764 [56] The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company [57] Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India company, was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773 [58] The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown, [59] administered by the Viceroy of India [60]\n\n\nIndian independence and afterwards\nWhen India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956), becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971 [65] In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal [66] In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after the partition

narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta [91]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe \"India State of Forest Report 2017\", recorded forest area in the state is 16,847 km2 (6,505 sq mi), [98] [99] while in 2013, forest area was 16,805 km2 (6,488 sq mi), which was 18.93% of

According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya (c. 543-505 BCE), a Vanga kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala kingdom.\n\nAncient and Classical Period\n---------------------------\n\nStone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state, showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought. According to the Indian epic Mahabharata, the region was part of the Vanga kingdom. Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region, including Vanga, Rarh, Pundravardhana, and the Suhma kingdom. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges. Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, the Lower Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra). According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa, Prince Vijaya (c. 543-505 BCE), a Vanga kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka) and named the country Sinhala kingdom.\n\nMedieval and Early Modern Periods\n--------------------------------\n\nSubsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. It was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16th century, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal, Shaista Khan, the proto-industrialized Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the world's first Industrial Revolution. The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.\n\nColonial Period\n-----------------\n\nSeveral European traders reached this area in the late 15th century. The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah (province) in 1765 with the signing of the treaty between the East India company and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764. The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company. Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India company, was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown, administered by the Viceroy of India.\n\nIndian Independence and Afterwards\n----------------------------------\n\nWhen India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal. The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed East Pakistan in 1956), becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1950, the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. In 1955, the former French enclave of Chandannagar, which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to play a significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\nWest Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a total area of 88,752 square kilometers (34,267 square miles). The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of the eastern Himalayas mountain range. In this region is Sandakfu, which, at 3,636 meters (11,929 feet), is the highest peak in the state. The narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands. A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n-----------------\n\nThe \"India State of Forest Report 2017\" recorded forest area in the state is 16,847 square kilometers (6,505 square miles), while in 2013, forest area was 16,805 square kilometers (6,488 square miles), which was 18.93% of the state's geographical area, compared to the then national average of 21.23%. Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8%, and 8.9%, respectively, of forested areas, as of 2009.

Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor. The Governor is the Head of State appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 members, or MLAs, including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for five years unless the Assembly is dissolved before the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament.\n\nDistricts and Cities\n----------------------\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, West Bengal is divided into 23 districts.

Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished.\n\nCuisine\n--------\n\nRice and fish are traditional favorite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, \"machhe bhate bangali,\" that translates as \"fish and rice make a Bengali.\" Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favorite among Bengalis. Most people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chilies, and turmeric. Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including Rôshogolla, Chômchôm, Kalojam, and several kinds of sondesh. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread, or dim sum, is a specialty of the winter season. Sweets such as narkol-naru, til-naru, moa, and payesh are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja.\n\nClothing\n---------\n\nBengali women commonly wear the sari, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs.

Nazrul Islam) are popular Also prominent are Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta's songs, and adhunik or modern music from films and other composers [191] From the early 1990s, new genres of music have emerged, including what has been called Bengali Jeebonmukhi Gaan (a modern genre based on realism) Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions Chhau dance of Purulia is a rare form of masked dance [192]\n\n\nFilms\nWest Bengali films are shot mostly in studios in the Kolkata neighbourhood of Tollygunge; the name \"Tollywood\" (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood) is derived from that name The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films, and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray who is widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, [193] Mrinal Sen whose films were known for their artistic depiction of social reality, Tapan Sinha, [194] and Ritwik Ghatak Some contemporary directors include veterans such as: Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Tarun Majumdar, Goutam Ghose, Aparna Sen, and Rituparno Ghosh, and a newer pool of directors such as Kaushik Ganguly and Srijit Mukherji [195] [196] [197] Uttam Kumar was the most popular lead actor for decades, and his romantic pairing with actress Suchitra Sen in films attained legendary status [198] Soumitra Chatterjee, who acted in many Satyajit Ray-films, and Prosenjit Chatterjee are among other popular lead male actors As of 2020 [update], Bengali films have won India's annual National Film Award for Best Feature Film twenty-two times in sixty seven years, the highest among all Indian languages.\n\n\nFine arts\nThere are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times, including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts Abanindranath Tagore, called the father of modern Indian art, started the Bengal School of Art, one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration The movement had many adherents, including: Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy and Rabindranath Tagore After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India [199] [200]\n\n\nReformist heritage\nThe capital, Kolkata, was the workplace of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to be abolished [201] The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda [201]\n\n\nCuisine\nRice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, \"machhe bhate bangali\", that translates as \"fish and rice make a Bengali\" [202] Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on its texture, size, fat content and bones [203] Most of the people also consume eggs, chicken, mutton, and shrimp Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas [204] Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies and turmeric [205] Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including Rôshogolla, Chômchôm, Kalojam and several kinds of sondesh Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread, or dim sum, are specialties of the winter season Sweets such as narkol-naru, til-naru, moa and payesh are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja [206] Popular street foods include Aloor Chop, Beguni, Kati roll, biryani, and phuchka [207] [208]\n\n\nClothing\nBengali women commonly wear the sari, often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs In urban areas, many women and men wear western attire Among men, western dress has greater acceptance Particularly on cultural occasions, men also wear traditional costumes such as the panjabi with dhuti while women wear salwar kameez or sari [209]\n\n\nFestivals\nDurga Puja is the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal [211] The five-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state Pandals are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout West Bengal The city of Kolkata transforms Durga Puja It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities [212] On Vijayadashami, the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers [213]\n\n\nEducation\nWest Bengal schools are run by the state government or private organisations, including religious institutions Instruction is mainly in English or Bengali, though Urdu is also used, especially in Central Kolkata Secondary schools are affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open School (NIOS), West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, or the West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education [220]\n\n\nMedia\nIn 2005 West Bengal had 505 published newspapers, [240] of which 389 were in Bengali [240] Ananda Bazar Patrika, published in Kolkata with 1,277,801 daily copies, has the largest circulation for a single-edition, regional language newspaper in India [240] Other major Bengali newspapers are: Bartaman, Ei Samay, Sangbad Pratidin, Aajkaal and Uttarbanga Sambad Major English language newspapers include The Telegraph, The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Hindu, The Statesman, The Indian Express and Asian Age Some prominent financial dailies such as: The Economic Times, Financial Express, Business Line and Business Standard are widely circulated Vernacular newspapers such as those in Hindi, Nepali, Gujarati, Odia, Urdu and Punjabi also exist [241]\n\n\nSports\nCricket and association football are popular West Bengal, unlike most other states of India, is noted for its passion and patronage of football [245] [246] [247] Kolkata is one of the major centres for football in India [248] and houses top national clubs such as Mohun Bagan Super Giant, East Bengal Club and Mohammedan Sporting Club [249]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

that might influence him while making Tenet, instead relying upon his memories [23]\n\n\nCasting\nWashington, Pattinson, and Debicki were cast in March 2019 [32] [33] Each of them were only permitted to read the screenplay while locked in a room [9] [19] [34] Nolan chose Washington based on his performance in BlacKkKlansman (2018) [35] Washington kept diaries in which he expanded the Protagonist's backstory [36] Pattinson took some of Neil's mannerisms from political journalist and author Christopher Hitchens [37] Kat was originally going to be an older woman, but Debicki's appearance in Widows (2018) convinced the filmmakers otherwise [4]\n\n\nDesign and special effects\nSpecial effects supervisor Scott R Fisher watched World War II films and documentaries to find reference points for the film that were based in reality [44] Prop prototypes were often 3D printed Costume designer Jeffrey Kurland and his team cut and stitched the clothing for the film in the United States, manufacturing it for the main cast and thousands of extras [45] Production designer Nathan Crowley ordered around thirty military wristwatches from Hamilton Watch Company, each analog with a digital countdown [46]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography, involving a crew that Pattinson estimated at 500 people, [37] began on May 22, 2019, [38] [47] in a soundstage in Los Angeles, [48] and eventually incorporated seven countries [47]—Denmark, Estonia, [nb 1] India, [nb 2] Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States [51] [nb 3] Filming in Estonia took place in June and July, with the Linnahall, Pärnu Highway (E67), and adjacent streets closed to facilitate the production [52] [53] Kumu Art Museum doubled as the fictional Oslo Freeport [54] Barbara's office was built in a former law court, the Tallinn Freeport exterior was at the city docks, and a room at the Hilton Tallinn Park Hotel was also used [55] Mayor of Tallinn Mihhail Kõlvart expressed concerns about potential disruptions, as the shooting schedule required that the arterial Laagna Road be closed for one month [56] A compromise was eventually reached, involving temporary road closures and detours [57] [58]\n\n\nPost-production\nDuring filming, sound designer Richard King sent a team to Eagle Mountain to record the Chinooks and Mi-8, and to Southampton to record the F50 catamarans [77] Others were hired to capture the aural atmosphere of Oslo, Mumbai, and Tallinn [77] King got audio of both live and blank automatic weapon rounds at a gun range in San Francisquito Canyon and rented a runway to test how the vehicles in the film sound [78]\n\n\nMusic\nLudwig Göransson was chosen to compose the film's music after Nolan's frequent collaborator and first choice, Hans Zimmer, turned down the offer in favor of the 2021 film Dune [81] [82] Researching retrograde composition led Göransson to generate melodies that would sound the same forward and backward He experimented with distorted industrial noise and, to represent Sator's irradiated breathing, asked Nolan to tape his own breath in a studio Göransson produced ten to fifteen minutes of music each week The first scoring session was held in November 2019, and sessions continued into early 2020 [83] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Göransson recorded musicians at their homes [9] The Tenet soundtrack contains \"The Plan\", a song by Travis Scott, [84] which plays over the film's closing credits [85]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn August 2019, Warner Bros debuted a forty-second teaser ahead of Hobbs & Shaw previews, [86] which was published online in December [87] Yohana Desta of Vanity Fair called it an \"old-school surprise\" and praised Göransson's score, [88] while Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as \"Inception with time travel\" [89] Both Vejvoda and IndieWire's Zack Sharf noted the trailer's stylization of the film's title as TENƎT to emphasize the palindromic nature [89] [90] The film's prologue also played in select IMAX theaters before screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, [87] which Kyle Kizu of The Hollywood Reporter favorably compared to the prolog of Nolan's other films [91] The film's logo was altered in May 2020 to remove the inverted stylization due to its similarity with that of a bicycle components manufacturer [92] The final trailer was released in August and featured Scott's single [93] A making-of video was released on August 26 [14]\n\n\nRelease\nWarner Bros originally scheduled Tenet for a July 17, 2020, release in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm film [98] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed to July 31, [99] [100] and then August 12 [101] Nolan desired that the film be released in theatres as the first Hollywood tent-pole following the prolonged shutdown, instead of being released on the HBO Max streaming service [102] [103] [104] Following a negotiation between Nolan and Warner Bros executives,  the studio arranged for the film to be released in seventy countries, with a run time of 150 minutes, on August 26, [105] [106] [107] following preview screenings in Australia and South Korea on August 22 and 23 [108] [109] The film opened in select cities in the United States on September 3, gradually expanding in the ensuing weeks [105] On September 4, it was released in China [110] The lack of available movies afforded it more screens per multiplex than

divided critics, with USA Today's Jenna Ryu and the Los Angeles Times's Christi Carras respectively describing the reviews as \"mixed\" and \"all over the place\" [143] [144] The Independent's Clémence Michallon wrote that the film was perceived as \"both entertaining and 'cerebral' by some, but lacking and confusing by others\" [145] Ellise Shafer of Variety found that, while some were weary of the film's \"metaphysical babble\", reviews were \"largely positive\", with critics overall naming it \"a mind-blowing addition to Nolan's already-impressive arsenal\" [146] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of 378 critics gave Tenet a positive review, with an average rating of 7/10; the website's critical consensus reads: \"A visually dazzling puzzle for film lovers to unlock, Tenet serves up all the cerebral spectacle audiences expect from a Christopher Nolan production.\" [147] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [148]\n\n\nAudience reception\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, [170] and PostTrak reported that 80% of those gave the film a positive score, with 65% saying they would recommend it [171] Some publications reported that the film gained a cult following among science fiction enthusiasts and Nolan's fanbase [172] [173] [174]\n\n\nAccolades\nTenet received nominations for Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning the latter [175] At the 74th British Academy Film Awards, the film won the Best Special Visual Effects award, [176] and also won an award in the same category at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards, out of its five nominations [177] [178] It received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 78th Golden Globe Awards [179] Other nominations include five Satellite Awards (winning one), [180] nine Saturn Awards (winning one), [181] and one Hugo Award nomination [182]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nTenet's complex plot and character timelines, ambiguities and hidden details have been analyzed, leading to various fan theories and interpretations [183]\n\n\nPalindromes and anadromes\nPalindromes (words which are spelled the same forward and backward) and anadromes (words which when spelled backward produce another word) appear throughout the film in various guises The five-letter words from the palindromic Sator Square appear as names and locations in the film: \"Sator\" (the Russian oligarch); \"Arepo\" (the art forger); \"Tenet\" (the name of the film and the Protagonist's organization); \"Opera\" (the opening scene takes place at the Kyiv Opera House); and \"Rotas\" (the name of the security company running Oslo Freeport) [184] There is a further nod to the word \"Tenet\" in the film's final battle in which the red and blue teams each have \"ten\" minutes to carry out their non-inverted (\"ten\") and inverted (\"net\") operations in Stalsk-12 [185] When the Protagonist is being tortured, trains pass by in opposite directions Ludwig Göransson's score includes melodies that sound the same forward and backward The film itself is a form of \"temporal palindrome\", as it ends at the same time as the events of the beginning of the film were taking place, \"the 14th\" [186]\n\n\nTemporal paradoxes and free will\nSeveral characters have complex timelines in the film due to inverting and reverting, notably Neil, the Protagonist, Sator and Kat [187] [186] [188] Inversion allows multiple versions of a character to exist simultaneously; for instance, there are five simultaneous Neils (that are known) in the world during the moments of the climactic scene inside the Stalsk-12 hypocenter where he dies (two inverted and one normal on the battlefield, one inverted at the opera siege and one more normal somewhere else in the world who will later meet the Protagonist in Neil's first appearance of the film), [188] and the implication is that an older future Protagonist is orchestrating the events of the film behind the scenes without ever being seen by the viewer or his past self, in an example of a temporal pincer movement [189] Inversion also sets up bootstrap paradoxes, whereby events are caused by themselves in a \"chicken or the egg\" scenario [190]\n\n\nScientific accuracy\nThe plot revolves around reversing the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility, [24] and the film references physics concepts including the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, and Feynman and Wheeler's notion of a one-electron universe; nonetheless,  Christopher Nolan stated in the film's press notes: \"we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate\" [24]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Tenet**\n\nTenet is a 2020 science fiction action spy film written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, and Michael Caine.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTenet is a complex and thought-provoking film that explores the concept of time inversion, where objects and people move backwards through time. The film follows a secret agent, known as the Protagonist (played by John David Washington), as he navigates a world where the rules of time are constantly changing. With its intricate plot, stunning visuals, and impressive action sequences, Tenet has become a cult classic among fans of science fiction and action films.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a prologue set during a staged terrorist siege at the Kyiv Opera House. The Protagonist, a secret agent working for a top-secret organization known as Tenet, is sent to extract a valuable artifact from the opera house. However, things go awry, and the Protagonist is forced to flee, leaving behind a trail of clues and puzzles that set the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe Protagonist soon finds himself in a world where objects and people can move backwards through time, a phenomenon known as \"inversion.\" He is aided by Neil (played by Robert Pattinson), a linguist who specializes in deciphering the language of time inversion. Together, they embark on a mission to prevent a catastrophic event that threatens to destroy the world.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the world of time inversion, the Protagonist and Neil encounter a cast of characters, including Kat (played by Elizabeth Debicki), a mysterious woman with ties to a powerful oligarch named Sator (played by Kenneth Branagh). Along the way, they uncover a complex web of conspiracies and allegiances that threaten to upend the very fabric of time itself.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, and Michael Caine.

The film's director, Christopher Nolan, is known for his meticulous attention to detail, and the film's production was marked by a number of challenges, including the need to film complex action sequences and the use of state-of-the-art special effects.\n\n**Post-Production**\n\nDuring post-production, the film's sound design was created by Richard King, who used a combination of field recordings and sound effects to create the film's immersive soundtrack. The film's score was composed by Ludwig Göransson, who used a number of unconventional techniques to create the film's distinctive sound.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in August 2019, with the release of a 40-second teaser trailer that was shown in front of screenings of Hobbs & Shaw. The trailer was well-received by critics, who praised its stylish and atmospheric visuals.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in IMAX, 35mm, and 70mm film on August 26, 2020, in a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

However, the film has developed a cult following among fans of science fiction and action films, and has become a classic of the genre.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film received a number of awards and nominations, including nominations for Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects at the 93rd Academy Awards, and a win for Best Visual Effects. The film also won the Best Special Visual Effects award at the 74th British Academy Film Awards.\n\n**Themes and Analysis**\n\nThe film explores a number of complex themes, including the nature of time, the consequences of playing with the fundamental laws of physics, and the human condition. The film's complex plot and multiple timelines have led to a number of fan theories and interpretations, and the film has become a subject of fascination and debate among fans and scholars alike.\n\n**Palindromes and Anadromes**\n\nThe film features a number of palindromes and anadromes, including the five-letter words from the palindromic Sator Square, which appear throughout the film as names and locations. The film itself is a form of \"temporal palindrome,\" as it ends at the same time as the events of the beginning of the film were taking place, \"the 14th\".\n\n**Temporal Paradoxes and Free Will**\n\nThe film explores a number of complex temporal paradoxes and free will concepts, including the idea of multiple timelines and the concept of bootstrap paradoxes.

for the film in the United States, manufacturing it for the main cast and thousands of extras [45] Production designer Nathan Crowley ordered around thirty military wristwatches from Hamilton Watch Company, each analog with a digital countdown [46]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography, involving a crew that Pattinson estimated at 500 people, [37] began on May 22, 2019, [38] [47] in a soundstage in Los Angeles, [48] and eventually incorporated seven countries [47]—Denmark, Estonia, [nb 1] India, [nb 2] Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States [51] [nb 3] Filming in Estonia took place in June and July, with the Linnahall, Pärnu Highway (E67), and adjacent streets closed to facilitate the production [52] [53] Kumu Art Museum doubled as the fictional Oslo Freeport [54] Barbara's office was built in a former law court, the Tallinn Freeport exterior was at the city docks, and a room at the Hilton Tallinn Park Hotel was also used [55] Mayor of Tallinn Mihhail Kõlvart expressed concerns about potential disruptions, as the shooting schedule required that the arterial Laagna Road be closed for one month [56] A compromise was eventually reached, involving temporary road closures and detours [57] [58]\n\n\nPost-production\nDuring filming, sound designer Richard King sent a team to Eagle Mountain to record the Chinooks and Mi-8, and to Southampton to record the F50 catamarans [77] Others were hired to capture the aural atmosphere of Oslo, Mumbai, and Tallinn [77] King got audio of both live and blank automatic weapon rounds at a gun range in San Francisquito Canyon and rented a runway to test how the vehicles in the film sound [78]\n\n\nMusic\nLudwig Göransson was chosen to compose the film's music after Nolan's frequent collaborator and first choice, Hans Zimmer, turned down the offer in favor of the 2021 film Dune [81] [82] Researching retrograde composition led Göransson to generate melodies that would sound the same forward and backward He experimented with distorted industrial noise and, to represent Sator's irradiated breathing, asked Nolan to tape his own breath in a studio Göransson produced ten to fifteen minutes of music each week The first scoring session was held in November 2019, and sessions continued into early 2020 [83] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Göransson recorded musicians at their homes [9] The Tenet soundtrack contains \"The Plan\", a song by Travis Scott, [84] which plays over the film's closing credits [85]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn August 2019, Warner Bros debuted a forty-second teaser ahead of Hobbs & Shaw previews, [86] which was published online in December [87] Yohana Desta of Vanity Fair called it an \"old-school surprise\" and praised Göransson's score, [88] while Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as \"Inception with time travel\" [89] Both Vejvoda and IndieWire's Zack Sharf noted the trailer's stylization of the film's title as TENƎT to emphasize the palindromic nature [89] [90] The film's prologue also played in select IMAX theaters before screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, [87] which Kyle Kizu of The Hollywood Reporter favorably compared to the prolog of Nolan's other films [91] The film's logo was altered in May 2020 to remove the inverted stylization due to its similarity with that of a bicycle components manufacturer [92] The final trailer was released in August and featured Scott's single [93] A making-of video was released on August 26 [14]\n\n\nRelease\nWarner Bros originally scheduled Tenet for a July 17, 2020, release in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm film [98] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed to July 31, [99] [100] and then August 12 [101] Nolan desired that the film be released in theatres as the first Hollywood tent-pole following the prolonged shutdown, instead of being released on the HBO Max streaming service [102] [103] [104] Following a negotiation between Nolan and Warner Bros executives,  the studio arranged for the film to be released in seventy countries, with a run time of 150 minutes, on August 26, [105] [106] [107] following preview screenings in Australia and South Korea on August 22 and 23 [108] [109] The film opened in select cities in the United States on September 3, gradually expanding in the ensuing weeks [105] On September 4, it was released in China [110] The lack of available movies afforded it more screens per multiplex than would otherwise have been possible [111]\n\n\nTheatrical\nWarner Bros originally scheduled Tenet for a July 17, 2020, release in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm film [98] Due to the

May 1, 2021 [119]\n\n\nReception\nAs of January 29, 2024, Tenet has grossed $58.5 million in the United States and Canada and $306.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.7 million [2] [1]\n\n\nBox office\nAs of January 29, 2024, Tenet has grossed $58.5 million in the United States and Canada and $306.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.7 million [2] [1]\n\n\nCritical response\nTenet divided critics, with USA Today's Jenna Ryu and the Los Angeles Times's Christi Carras respectively describing the reviews as \"mixed\" and \"all over the place\" [143] [144] The Independent's Clémence Michallon wrote that the film was perceived as \"both entertaining and 'cerebral' by some, but lacking and confusing by others\" [145] Ellise Shafer of Variety found that, while some were weary of the film's \"metaphysical babble\", reviews were \"largely positive\", with critics overall naming it \"a mind-blowing addition to Nolan's already-impressive arsenal\" [146] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of 378 critics gave Tenet a positive review, with an average rating of 7/10; the website's critical consensus reads: \"A visually dazzling puzzle for film lovers to unlock, Tenet serves up all the cerebral spectacle audiences expect from a Christopher Nolan production.\" [147] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [148]\n\n\nAudience reception\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, [170] and PostTrak reported that 80% of those gave the film a positive score, with 65% saying they would recommend it [171] Some publications reported that the film gained a cult following among science fiction enthusiasts and Nolan's fanbase [172] [173] [174]\n\n\nAccolades\nTenet received nominations for Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning the latter [175] At the 74th British Academy Film Awards, the film won the Best Special Visual Effects award, [176] and also won an award in the same category at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards, out of its five nominations [177] [178] It received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 78th Golden Globe Awards [179] Other nominations include five Satellite Awards (winning one), [180] nine Saturn Awards (winning one), [181] and one Hugo Award nomination [182]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nTenet's complex plot and character timelines, ambiguities and hidden details have been analyzed, leading to various fan theories and interpretations [183]\n\n\nPalindromes and anadromes\nPalindromes (words which are spelled the same forward and backward) and anadromes (words which when spelled backward produce another word) appear throughout the film in various guises The five-letter words from the palindromic Sator Square appear as names and locations in the film: \"Sator\" (the Russian oligarch); \"Arepo\" (the art forger); \"Tenet\" (the name of the film and the Protagonist's organization); \"Opera\" (the opening scene takes place at the Kyiv Opera House); and \"Rotas\" (the name of the security company running Oslo Freeport) [184] There is a further nod to the word \"Tenet\" in the film's final battle in which the red and blue teams each have \"ten\" minutes to carry out their non-inverted (\"ten\") and inverted (\"net\") operations in Stalsk-12 [185] When the Protagonist is being tortured, trains pass by in opposite directions Ludwig Göransson's score includes melodies that sound the same forward and backward The film itself is a form of \"temporal palindrome\", as it ends at the same time as the events of the beginning of the film were taking place, \"the 14th\" [186]\n\n\nTemporal paradoxes and free will\nSeveral characters have complex timelines in the film due to inverting and reverting, notably Neil, the Protagonist, Sator and Kat [187] [186] [188] Inversion allows multiple versions of a character to exist simultaneously; for instance, there are five simultaneous Neils (that are known) in the world during the moments of the climactic scene inside the Stalsk-12 hypocenter where he dies (two inverted and one normal on the battlefield, one inverted at the opera siege and one more normal somewhere else in the world who will later meet the Protagonist in Neil's first appearance of the film), [188] and the implication is that an older future Protagonist is orchestrating the events of the film behind the scenes without ever being seen by the viewer or his past self, in an example of a temporal pincer movement [189] Inversion also sets up bootstrap paradoxes, whereby events are caused by themselves in a \"chicken or the egg\" scenario [190]\n\n\nScientific accuracy\nThe plot revolves around reversing the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility, [24] and the film references physics concepts including the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, and Feynman and Wheeler's notion of a one-electron universe; nonetheless,  Christopher Nolan stated in the film's press notes: \"we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate\" [24]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Vietnam", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Việt Nam (pronounced  [viə̂tˀ nāːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order [15] A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC [16] The term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: Yuè; Cantonese Yale: Yuht; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4; Vietnamese: Việt) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 BC), and later as \"越\" [17] At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang [18] In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south [18] Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people [17] [18] From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, Chinese: 百越; pinyin: Bǎiyuè; Cantonese Yale: Baak Yuet; Vietnamese: Bách Việt; lit 'Hundred Yue/Viet') [17] [18] [19] The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book Lüshi Chunqiu compiled around 239 BC [20] By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as người Việt (Viet people) or người Nam (southern people) [21]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago, [27] based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam [28] Homo erectus fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces in northern Vietnam [29] The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum [30] [31] [32] Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, [33] and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, [34] [35] Lang Gao [36] [37] and Lang Cuom [38] Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research [39] [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nPrehistory and early history\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early

comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research [39] [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nDynastic Vietnam\nAccording to Vietnamese legends, Hồng Bàng dynasty of the Hùng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later Văn Lang) [49] [50] In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán He consolidated the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt tribes to form the Âu Lạc, proclaiming himself An Dương Vương [51] In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (\"Triệu Đà\") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into Nanyue [44] However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han–Nanyue War [24] [52] For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule [53] [54] Early independence movements, such as those of the Trưng Sisters and Lady Triệu, [55] were temporarily successful, [56] though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the Anterior Lý dynasty between AD 544 and 602 [57] [58] [59] By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Khúc family [60]\n\n\nFrench Indochina\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Chàm Islands to mark their presence [77] By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan [77] After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with Hội An [77] Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the Padroado system were active in both Vietnamese realms of Đàng Trong (Cochinchina or Quinan) and Đàng Ngoài (Tonkin) in the 17th century [78] The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk [79] Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the East India Company By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Phố Hiến [80]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nIn 1941, the Việt Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh The Việt Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation [110] [111] After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon's administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread [112] The Việt Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September [111]\n\n\nVietnam War\nFrom 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression [126] This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions [127] [128] In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centres\" [129] [130] This program incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time [131] The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957 [132] The pro-Hanoi Việt Cộng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government [133] From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support [134] [135] [136]\n\n\nReunification and reforms\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [153] The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8 million people [154] [155] [156] A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed [157] [158] In its aftermath, under Lê Duẩn's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears, [159] but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour [160] The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories [161] Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war [162] In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Kiên Giang, [163] the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh [164] The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989 [165] However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated [166]\n\n\nGeography\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8° and 24°N, and the longitudes 102° and 110°E It covers a total area of 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi) [8] or 331,699 km2 (128,070 sq mi) [9] The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long [176] At its narrowest point in the central Quảng Bình province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north [177] Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20% Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, [178] and tropical forests cover around 42% [179] The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), [180] is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits [181] [182] The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year [183] [184] The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea [185]\n\n\nClimate\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region [195] During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture [196] The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 °C (70 and 95 °F) over the year [197] In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 °C (59 and 91 °F) [197] Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 °C (37 °F) in December and January to 37 °C (99 °F) in July and August [198] During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border [199] Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 to 2,000 mm (60 to 80 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems [200] The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons [200] Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas [201] [202]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005 [203] It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic Vietnam's fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic [203] Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites—the Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park—together with nine biosphere reserves, including Cần Giờ Mangrove Forest, Cát Tiên, Cát Bà, Kiên Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Nghệ An, Cà Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park [204] [205] [206]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia [232] Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, [233] [234] with The Economist characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\" [235] Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society [232] The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy [232]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: Tỉnh, chữ Hán: 省) [245] There are also five municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc trung ương), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties [246] Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc [246] Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"Nam quốc sơn hà\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"Bình Ngô đại cáo\" Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, [246] significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea [247] Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO) It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations [248] As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries [249]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000 [263] In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending [264] Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, [265] India, [266] Japan, [267] Laos, [268] Russia, [269] Singapore [265] and the US [270] In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons [271] [272]\n\n\nHuman rights and sociopolitical issues\nUnder the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer Lê Công Định was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested [273] [274] Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience [273] Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues [275] [276] [277]\n\n\nEconomy\nThroughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture—primarily wet rice cultivation [278] Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam [279] Since reunification, the country's economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses [280] The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises Under strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction [281] [282] [283] With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, [284] [285] Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development [286]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; [309] the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; [310] and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s [311] Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee [312] The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion [313] Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\n\nSeafood\nThe overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016 The output of Vietnam's fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector [314]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP [317] Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics Hoàng Tụy pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, [318] while Ngô Bảo Châu won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms [319] [320] Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight program especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018 [321] [322] Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model [315] [316] One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by Vương Quang Khải, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group [323]\n\n\nTourism\n16°N 108°E﻿ / ﻿16°N 108°E﻿ / 16; 108\n\n\nTransport\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam [331] Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level [332] In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads [332] The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved [332]\n\n\nEnergy\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN) As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW [350] Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build–operate–transfer (BOT) investors [351]\n\n\nTelecommunication\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company [356] The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986 The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT [356] VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree [357] By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone [358] With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure [359]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m3 The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge [360] Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply [361] There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water [361]\n\n\nDemographics\nEthnic groups of Vietnam [369]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%) [2] Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic program, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively [380] The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census [2] Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate [381] Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities [382]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon–Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: Tày, Mường, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng and Hmong The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families [387] In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Vietnam (2019) [2]\n\n\nEducation\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008 [415] Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance [416] Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world [417] [418] The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005 In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them [419] [420]Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education [421] A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia) The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education [422]\n\n\nHealth\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources [423] In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births [424] [425] [426] Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level [427] After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established [174] In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges [300] Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry [428] The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today [429] [430] For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated [431]\n\n\nCulture\nVietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base [43] [46] Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy [440] [441] Vietnamese society is structured around làng (ancestral villages); [442] all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month [443] [444] The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture [445] Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Chợ Lớn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them [446] In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Huỳnh culture [447] [448] In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese [441]\n\n\nLiterature\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six–to-eight-verse poetic form (lục bát) called ca dao which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes [460] Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguyễn Trãi, Hồ Xuân Hương, Nguyễn Du and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as hát nói in ca trù [461] Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the tao đàn Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of thơ mới emerging in 1932 [462] Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed) Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life [463] They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ), culture heroes (Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales [446] [464]\n\n\nMusic\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions [465] Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal The origins of Vietnamese classical opera (tuồng) can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe [466] Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia [467] Nhã nhạc is the most popular form of imperial court music, Chèo is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while Xẩm or hát xẩm (xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music Quan họ (alternate singing) is popular in the former Hà Bắc province (which is now divided into Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam Another form of music called Hát chầu văn or hát văn is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies Nhạc dân tộc cải biên is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while ca trù (also known as hát ả đào) is a popular folk music Hò can be thought of as the southern style of Quan họ There is a range of traditional instruments, including the đàn bầu (a monochord zither), the đàn gáo (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the đàn nguyệt (a two-stringed fretted moon lute) In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music—especially folk music—with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles [468] Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style—a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements [469] In the 21st century, the modern Vietnamese pop music industry known as V-pop incorporates elements of many popular genres worldwide, such as electronic, dance and R&B [470] [471]\n\n\nMedia\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication [472] It is generally perceived that the country's media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken [473] [474] The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\" [475] The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\", [476] while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\" [477] Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked [478]\n\n\nCuisine\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: ngũ vị): spicy (metal), sour (wood), salty (water), bitter (fire) and sweet (earth) [479] Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves [480] Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide [481] The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country [482] Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as gỏi cuốn (salad roll), bánh cuốn (rice noodle roll), bún riêu (rice vermicelli soup) and phở noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants [483] [484] Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices [485] Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include cà phê đá (Vietnamese iced coffee), cà phê trứng (egg coffee), chanh muối (salted pickled lime juice), cơm rượu (glutinous rice wine), nước mía (sugarcane juice) and trà sen (Vietnamese lotus tea) [486]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hùng Kings' Festival on the 10th day of the third lunar month;

The name Việt Nam (pronounced  [viə̂tˀ nāːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet of the South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order. A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: Yuè; Cantonese Yale: Yuht; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4; Vietnamese: Việt) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 BC), and later as \"越\". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, Chinese: 百越; pinyin: Bǎiyuè; Cantonese Yale: Baak Yuet; Vietnamese: Bách Việt; lit 'Hundred Yue/Viet').\n\nThe history of Vietnam began with the early paleolithic age, with stone tools found in Gia Lai province dating back to 780,000 years ago. The region was later inhabited by Homo erectus, with fossils found in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces dating to around 500,000 BC. The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia were found at Tham Om and Hang Hum, dating to the Middle Pleistocene. Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, while those from the Early Holocene have been found at Mai Da Dieu, Lang Gao, and Lang Cuom.\n\nThe Red River Delta in the north is a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2. It has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits. The delta is a low-level plain, no more than 3m above sea level, and is crisscrossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60-80m into the sea every year.\n\nVietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region, due to differences in latitude and topographical relief. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge. The country has a total of 2,360 rivers, with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m3.\n\nThe national language of Vietnam is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon-Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. Vietnamese culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base.\n\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history, with a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six-to-eight-verse poetic form (lục bát) called ca dao, which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes. Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including Nguyễn Trãi, Hồ Xuân Hương, Nguyễn Du, and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu.\n\nThe country has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country. Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as gỏi cuốn (salad roll), bánh cuốn (rice noodle roll), bún riêu (rice vermicelli soup), and phở noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants.\n\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays, including New Year's Day, Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán), Hùng Kings' Festival, Reunification Day, International Workers' Day, and National Day.\n\nVietnam has been a member of the United Nations since 1977, and is a member of many international organizations, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vietnam\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name Việt Nam (pronounced  [viə̂tˀ nāːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order [15] A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC [16] The term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: Yuè; Cantonese Yale: Yuht; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4; Vietnamese: Việt) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone),

[17] [18] [19] The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book Lüshi Chunqiu compiled around 239 BC [20] By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as người Việt (Viet people) or người Nam (southern people) [21]\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago, [27] based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam [28] Homo erectus fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces in northern Vietnam [29] The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum [30] [31] [32] Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, [33] and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, [34] [35] Lang Gao [36] [37] and Lang Cuom [38] Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research [39] [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nPrehistory and early history\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence

Lang Gao [36] [37] and Lang Cuom [38] Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research [39] [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nDynastic Vietnam\nAccording to Vietnamese legends, Hồng Bàng dynasty of the Hùng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later Văn Lang) [49] [50] In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán He consolidated the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt tribes to form the Âu Lạc, proclaiming himself An Dương Vương [51] In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (\"Triệu Đà\") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into Nanyue [44] However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han–Nanyue War [24] [52] For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule [53] [54] Early independence movements, such as those of the Trưng Sisters and Lady Triệu, [55] were temporarily successful, [56] though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the Anterior Lý dynasty between AD 544 and 602 [57] [58] [59] By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Khúc family [60]\n\n\nFrench Indochina\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Chàm Islands to mark their presence [77] By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan [77] After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with Hội An [77] Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the Padroado system were active in both Vietnamese realms of Đàng Trong (Cochinchina or Quinan) and Đàng Ngoài (Tonkin) in the 17th century [78] The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk [79] Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the East India Company By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Phố Hiến [80]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nIn 1941, the Việt Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh The Việt Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation [110] [111] After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon's administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread [112] The Việt Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September [111]\n\n\nVietnam War\nFrom 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression [126] This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions [127] [128] In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centres\" [129] [130] This program incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time [131] The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957 [132] The pro-Hanoi Việt Cộng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government [133] From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support [134] [135] [136]\n\n\nReunification and reforms\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [153] The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8 million people [154] [155] [156] A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed [157] [158] In its aftermath, under Lê Duẩn's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears, [159] but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour [160] The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories [161] Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war [162] In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Kiên Giang, [163] the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh [164] The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989 [165] However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated [166]\n\n\nGeography\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8° and 24°N, and the longitudes 102° and 110°E It covers a total area of 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi) [8] or 331,699 km2 (128,070 sq mi) [9] The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long [176] At its narrowest point in the central Quảng Bình province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north [177] Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20% Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, [178] and tropical forests cover around 42% [179] The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), [180] is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits [181] [182] The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year [183] [184] The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea [185]\n\n\nClimate\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region [195] During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture [196] The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 °C (70 and 95 °F) over the year [197] In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 °C (59 and 91 °F) [197] Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 °C (37 °F) in December and January to 37 °C (99 °F) in July and August [198] During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border [199] Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 to 2,000 mm (60 to 80 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems [200] The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons [200] Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas [201] [202]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005 [203] It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic Vietnam's fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic [203] Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites—the Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park—together with nine biosphere reserves, including Cần Giờ Mangrove Forest, Cát Tiên, Cát Bà, Kiên Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Nghệ An, Cà Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park [204] [205] [206]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia [232] Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, [233] [234] with The Economist characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\" [235] Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society [232] The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy [232]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nVietnam is divided into 58 provinces (Vietnamese: Tỉnh, chữ Hán: 省) [245] There are also five municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc trung ương), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\n\nForeign relations\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties [246] Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc [246] Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"Nam quốc sơn hà\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"Bình Ngô đại cáo\" Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, [246] significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea [247] Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO) It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations [248] As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries [249]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000 [263] In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending [264] Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, [265] India, [266] Japan, [267] Laos, [268] Russia, [269] Singapore [265] and the US [270] In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons [271] [272]\n\n\nHuman rights and sociopolitical issues\nUnder the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer Lê Công Định was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested [273] [274] Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience [273] Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues [275] [276] [277]\n\n\nEconomy\nThroughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture—primarily wet rice cultivation [278] Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam [279] Since reunification, the country's economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses [280] The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises Under strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction [281] [282] [283] With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, [284] [285] Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development [286]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; [309] the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; [310] and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s [311] Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee [312] The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion [313] Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\n\nSeafood\nThe overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016 The output of Vietnam's fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector [314]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP [317] Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics Hoàng Tụy pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, [318] while Ngô Bảo Châu won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms [319] [320] Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight program especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018 [321] [322] Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model [315] [316] One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by Vương Quang Khải, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group [323]\n\n\nTourism\n16°N 108°E﻿ / ﻿16°N 108°E﻿ / 16; 108\n\n\nTransport\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam [331] Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level [332] In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads [332] The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved [332]\n\n\nEnergy\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN) As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW [350] Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build–operate–transfer (BOT) investors [351]\n\n\nTelecommunication\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company [356] The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986 The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT [356] VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree [357] By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone [358] With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure [359]\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m3 The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge [360] Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply [361] There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water [361]\n\n\nDemographics\nEthnic groups of Vietnam [369]\n\n\nUrbanisation\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%) [2] Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic program, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively [380] The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census [2] Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate [381] Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities [382]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon–Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: Tày, Mường, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng and Hmong The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families [387] In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Vietnam (2019) [2]\n\n\nEducation\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008 [415] Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance [416] Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world [417] [418] The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005 In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them [419] [420]Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education [421] A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia) The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education [422]\n\n\nHealth\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources [423] In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births [424] [425] [426] Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level [427] After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established [174] In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges [300] Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry [428] The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today [429] [430] For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated [431]\n\n\nCulture\nVietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base [43] [46] Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy [440] [441] Vietnamese society is structured around làng (ancestral villages); [442] all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month [443] [444] The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture [445] Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Chợ Lớn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them [446] In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Huỳnh culture [447] [448] In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese [441]\n\n\nLiterature\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six–to-eight-verse poetic form (lục bát) called ca dao which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes [460] Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguyễn Trãi, Hồ Xuân Hương, Nguyễn Du and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as hát nói in ca trù [461] Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the tao đàn Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of thơ mới emerging in 1932 [462] Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed) Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life [463] They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ), culture heroes (Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales [446] [464]\n\n\nMusic\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions [465] Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal The origins of Vietnamese classical opera (tuồng) can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe [466] Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia [467] Nhã nhạc is the most popular form of imperial court music, Chèo is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while Xẩm or hát xẩm (xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music Quan họ (alternate singing) is popular in the former Hà Bắc province (which is now divided into Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam Another form of music called Hát chầu văn or hát văn is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies Nhạc dân tộc cải biên is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while ca trù (also known as hát ả đào) is a popular folk music Hò can be thought of as the southern style of Quan họ There is a range of traditional instruments, including the đàn bầu (a monochord zither), the đàn gáo (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the đàn nguyệt (a two-stringed fretted moon lute) In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music—especially folk music—with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles [468] Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style—a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements [469] In the 21st century, the modern Vietnamese pop music industry known as V-pop incorporates elements of many popular genres worldwide, such as electronic, dance and R&B [470] [471]\n\n\nMedia\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication [472] It is generally perceived that the country's media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken [473] [474] The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\" [475] The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\", [476] while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\" [477] Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked [478]\n\n\nCuisine\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: ngũ vị): spicy (metal), sour (wood), salty (water), bitter (fire) and sweet (earth) [479] Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves [480] Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide [481] The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country [482] Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as gỏi cuốn (salad roll), bánh cuốn (rice noodle roll), bún riêu (rice vermicelli soup) and phở noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants [483] [484] Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices [485] Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include cà phê đá (Vietnamese iced coffee), cà phê trứng (egg coffee), chanh muối (salted pickled lime juice), cơm rượu (glutinous rice wine), nước mía (sugarcane juice) and trà sen (Vietnamese lotus tea) [486]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hùng Kings' Festival on the 10th day of the third lunar month; Reunification Day on 30 April; International Workers' Day on 1 May; and National Day on 2 September [487] [488] [489] During Tết, many Vietnamese from the major cities will return to their villages for family reunions and to pray for dead ancestors [490] [491] Older people will usually give the young a lì xì (red envelope) while special holiday food, such as bánh chưng (rice cake) in a square shape together with variety of dried fruits, are presented in the house for visitors [492] Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the Tết Nguyên Tiêu, Tết Trung Thu and various temple and nature festivals [493] In the highlands, Elephant Race Festivals are held annually during the spring; riders will ride their elephants for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and the winning elephant will be given sugarcane [494] Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular [495]\n\n\nSports\nThe Vovinam, Kim Kê and Võ Bình Định are widespread in Vietnam, [496] [497] while football is the country's most popular sport [498] Its national team won the ASEAN Football Championship twice in 2008 and 2018 and reached the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, quarter-finals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup, [499] [500] [501] its junior team of under-23 became the runners-up of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and reached fourth place in 2018 Asian Games, while the under-20 managed to qualify the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their football history And the under-17 achieved the fourth place per 10 Teams of the 2000 AFC U-16 Championship [502] [503] The women's national football team had first appearance at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, became the first 11-a-side national football team to participate in a World Cup tournament, and also traditionally dominates the Southeast Asian Games, along with its chief rival, Thailand Other Western sports such as badminton, tennis, volleyball, ping-pong and chess are also widely popular Vietnam has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1952 After the partition of the country in 1954, only South Vietnam competed in the games, sending athletes to the 1956 and 1972 Olympics Since the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, it has competed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, attending every Summer Olympics from 1988 onwards The present Vietnam Olympic Committee was formed in 1976 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979 [504] Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games In 2016, Vietnam won their first gold medal at the Olympics [505] Basketball has become an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Sóc Trăng [506]\n\n\nSee also\n This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed under CC BY-SA IGO

as David Brent from the British series [14] [15]\n\n\nDevelopment and writing\nBefore the second episode airing, the writers spent time conducting research in offices [20] This process was used for Daniels' other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation [20] The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the original British series [21] Daniels chose to go this route because \"completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do\" owing to the show being an adaptation [21] He had briefly considered using the idea for \"The Dundies\" as the pilot episode [22] After the writers knew who the cast was, they were allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, \"Diversity Day\" [21] Following the mixed reaction toward the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more \"optimistic\" and to make Michael Scott more likable [23] They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them relatable personalities They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British series [23]\n\n\nCasting\nAccording to Jenna Fischer, the series used an unusual casting process that did not involve a script For example, the producers asked the actors several questions and they responded as the characters they were auditioning for [27] NBC programmer Kevin Reilly originally suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman for the role of Michael Scott, but the actor declined Martin Short, Hank Azaria and Bob Odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part [28]\n\n\nFilming\nThe Office was filmed with a single-camera setup in cinéma vérité style to create the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track, allowing its \"deadpan\" and \"absurd\" humor to fully come across [48] The show's primary premise is that a camera crew is filming Dunder Mifflin and its employees, seemingly around the clock [48] The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters, especially Michael Scott, who enthusiastically participates in the filming [49] The characters, especially Jim and Pam, also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation [27] The show's main action is supplemented with talking-head interviews or \"confessionals\" where characters speak one-on-one with the camera [27] Actor John Krasinski shot the footage of Scranton for the opening credits when he found out he was cast as Jim He visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies [50]\n\n\nMusic\nWhen it came to choosing the theme music for The Office, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using: [55] existing songs including \"Better Things\" by The Kinks, \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse, and \"Mr Blue Sky\" by Electric Light Orchestra, [56] and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call [57] Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices [55] Most of them wanted \"Mr Blue Sky\", but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX (2004–2005) [56] Thus, the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones [58]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Office features an ensemble cast.\n\n\nSeason synopses\nA typical episode for a half-hour time slot runs 20+1⁄2 minutes [68] The final episode of season two introduced the first of what would be several \"super-sized\" episodes that had an approximately 28-minute running time for a 40-minute time slot [69] Season three introduced the first of occasional hour-long episodes (approximately 42-minute running time, also suitable for being shown as two separate normal episodes in reruns) [70]\n\n\nSeason 1 (2005)\nThe first season consists of six episodes; the shortest season of the series.\n\n\nSeason 2 (2005–2006)\nThe second season is the series' first 22-episode season and has its first 28-minute \"super-sized\" episode.\n\n\nSeason 3 (2006–2007)\nThe third season consists of 17 half-hour episodes, four 40-minute \"super-sized\" episodes, and two one-hour episodes The total number of episodes is 25.\n\n\nSeason 4 (2007–2008)\nNBC ordered a fourth full season of thirty half-hour episodes but ended with only 19 due to a halt in production caused by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike [79] [80] The season consists of nine half-hour and five hour-long episodes for a total of 19 episodes of material created.\n\n\nSeason 5 (2008–2009)\nThe fifth season consists of 28 half-hours of material, divided into 24 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes, one of which aired after Super Bowl XLIII [85]\n\n\nSeason 6 (2009–2010)\nThe sixth season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 22 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes.\n\n\nSeason 7 (2010–2011)\nThe seventh season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 21 half-hour episodes, one \"super-sized\" episode, and two hour-long episodes [91]\n\n\nSeason 8 (2011–2012)\nThe eighth season consists of 24 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 9 (2012–2013)\nThe final season consists of 25 episodes.\n\n\nProduct placement\nThe Office has had product placement deals with Staples [99] and Olympic balers, [100] as well as mentioning in dialogue or displaying clear logos for products such as Sandals Resorts, HP, Apple, and Gateway computers, and Activision's Call of Duty video game series In certain versions of \"The Merger\", Kevin Malone uses a Staples-branded shredding machine to shred a Staples-branded CD-R and many other nonpaper items, including a salad [99] Cisco Systems, a supplier of networking and telephone equipment, paid for product placement, which can be seen on close-up shots of the Cisco IP telephones Some products have additional branding labels attached; this can be clearly seen with the HP photo printer on Toby's desk in season 6, and less noticeably with the Cisco phones [101] In \"The Secret\" Michael takes Jim to Hooters [102] to discuss Jim's feelings for Pam.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBefore the show aired, Ricky Gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers [110] The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling, which was also based on a British version [111] [112] The New York Daily News called it \"so diluted there's little left but muddy water,\" and USA Today called it a \"passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original.\" [113] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating that Steve Carell \"just seems to be trying too hard... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own But right now he's a pale imitation.\" [114] Tom Shales of The Washington Post said it was \"not the mishmash that  [the Americanized version of Coupling] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out.\" [112]\n\n\nCritical reviews and commentary\nBefore the show aired, Ricky Gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers [110] The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling, which was also based on a British version [111] [112] The New York Daily News called it \"so diluted there's little left but muddy water,\" and USA Today called it a \"passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original.\" [113] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating that Steve Carell \"just seems to be trying too hard...

The show is a mockumentary-style sitcom that follows the daily lives of the employees at the Dunder Mifflin paper company. The series is an adaptation of the British series of the same name, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. The American version was developed by Greg Daniels and stars Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, and Jenna Fischer.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe Office was developed by Greg Daniels, who served as the showrunner for the first four seasons. He then left the position to co-create the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur. Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season, and Celotta left the series after the sixth season. Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons before leaving to develop the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, The Farm, which was eventually passed on by NBC. Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season.\n\nOther executive producers include cast members B.J. Novak and Mindy Kaling, who also served as writers, directors, and actors on the show. Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff, credited with 24 episodes. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series, are credited as executive producers and wrote both the pilot and the third-season episode \"The Convict.\" Merchant later directed the episode \"Customer Survey,\" and Gervais appeared in the episodes \"The Seminar\" and \"Search Committee,\" reprising his role as David Brent from the British series.\n\n**Crew**\n\nThe Office was filmed with a single-camera setup in cinéma vérité style to create the look of an actual documentary.

outline:\n\n\nProduction\nGreg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons He then left the position when he co-created the comedy series Parks and Recreation with fellow Office writer Michael Schur and divided his time between both series [4] Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta were named the showrunners for the fifth season [5] Celotta left the series after the sixth season and Lieberstein stayed on as showrunner for the following two seasons He left the showrunner spot after the eighth season for the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off, The Farm, which was eventually passed on by NBC [6] [7] Daniels returned to the showrunner position for the ninth and final season [8] Other executive producers include cast members B J Novak and Mindy Kaling [9] [10] Kaling, Novak, Daniels, Lieberstein and Schur made up the original team of writers [11] Kaling, Novak, and Lieberstein also served multiple roles on the series, as they played regular characters on the show, as well as wrote, directed, and produced episodes [12] Credited with twenty-four episodes, Kaling is the most prolific writer among the staff [12] Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series, are credited as executive producers and wrote both pilot and the third-season episode \"The Convict\" [13] Merchant later directed the episode \"Customer Survey\", while Gervais appeared in the episodes \"The Seminar\" and \"Search Committee\", reprising his role as David Brent from the British series [14] [15]\n\n\nCrew\nGreg Daniels developed the British Office series for American television and served as the showrunner for the first four seasons He then left the position when he co-created the comedy

directed the episode \"Customer Survey\", while Gervais appeared in the episodes \"The Seminar\" and \"Search Committee\", reprising his role as David Brent from the British series [14] [15]\n\n\nDevelopment and writing\nBefore the second episode airing, the writers spent time conducting research in offices [20] This process was used for Daniels' other series King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation [20] The pilot is a direct adaptation of the first episode of the original British series [21] Daniels chose to go this route because \"completely starting from scratch would be a very risky thing to do\" owing to the show being an adaptation [21] He had briefly considered using the idea for \"The Dundies\" as the pilot episode [22] After the writers knew who the cast was, they were allowed to write for the actors, which allowed the show to be more original for the following episode, \"Diversity Day\" [21] Following the mixed reaction toward the first season, the writers attempted to make the series more \"optimistic\" and to make Michael Scott more likable [23] They also established the supporting characters of the series more, giving them relatable personalities They also made the lights in the office brighter, which allowed the series to differentiate itself from the British series [23]\n\n\nCasting\nAccording to Jenna Fischer, the series used an unusual casting process that did not involve a script For example, the producers asked the actors several questions and they responded as the characters they were auditioning for [27] NBC programmer Kevin Reilly originally suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman for the role of Michael Scott, but the actor declined Martin Short, Hank Azaria and Bob Odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part [28]\n\n\nFilming\nThe Office was filmed with a single-camera setup in cinéma vérité style to create the look of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track, allowing its \"deadpan\" and \"absurd\" humor to fully come across [48] The show's primary premise is that a camera crew is filming Dunder Mifflin and its employees, seemingly around the clock [48] The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters, especially Michael Scott, who enthusiastically participates in the filming [49] The characters, especially Jim and Pam, also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation [27] The show's main action is supplemented with talking-head interviews or \"confessionals\" where characters speak one-on-one with the camera [27] Actor John Krasinski shot the footage of Scranton for the opening credits when he found out he was cast as Jim He visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies [50]\n\n\nMusic\nWhen it came to choosing the theme music for The Office, producer Greg Daniels had several tracks he was thinking of using: [55] existing songs including \"Better Things\" by The Kinks, \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse, and \"Mr Blue Sky\" by Electric Light Orchestra, [56] and several original pieces artists contributed to the producers via a cattle call [57] Daniels decided that the cast would vote on what song to use and gave them four of the choices [55] Most of them wanted \"Mr Blue Sky\", but that option turned out to be invalid as it was already used in the drama series LAX (2004–2005) [56] Thus, the final choice was an original track written by Jay Ferguson and performed by The Scrantones [58]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe Office features an ensemble cast.\n\n\nSeason synopses\nA typical episode for a half-hour time slot runs 20+1⁄2 minutes [68] The final episode of season two introduced the first of what would be several \"super-sized\" episodes that had an approximately 28-minute running time for a 40-minute time slot [69] Season three introduced the first of occasional hour-long episodes (approximately 42-minute running time, also suitable for being shown as two separate normal episodes in reruns) [70]\n\n\nSeason 1 (2005)\nThe first season consists of six episodes; the shortest season of the series.\n\n\nSeason 2 (2005–2006)\nThe second season is the series' first 22-episode season and has its first 28-minute \"super-sized\" episode.\n\n\nSeason 3 (2006–2007)\nThe third season consists of 17 half-hour episodes, four 40-minute \"super-sized\" episodes, and two one-hour episodes The total number of episodes is 25.\n\n\nSeason 4 (2007–2008)\nNBC ordered a fourth full season of thirty half-hour episodes but ended with only 19 due to a halt in production caused by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike [79] [80] The season consists of nine half-hour and five hour-long episodes for a total of 19 episodes of material created.\n\n\nSeason 5 (2008–2009)\nThe fifth season consists of 28 half-hours of material, divided into 24 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes, one of which aired after Super Bowl XLIII [85]\n\n\nSeason 6 (2009–2010)\nThe sixth season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 22 half-hour episodes and two hour-long episodes.\n\n\nSeason 7 (2010–2011)\nThe seventh season consists of 26 half-hours of material, divided into 21 half-hour episodes, one \"super-sized\" episode, and two hour-long episodes [91]\n\n\nSeason 8 (2011–2012)\nThe eighth season consists of 24 episodes.\n\n\nSeason 9 (2012–2013)\nThe final season consists of 25 episodes.\n\n\nProduct placement\nThe Office has had product placement deals with Staples [99] and Olympic balers, [100] as well as mentioning in dialogue or displaying clear logos for products such as Sandals Resorts, HP, Apple, and Gateway computers, and Activision's Call of Duty video game series In certain versions of \"The Merger\", Kevin Malone uses a Staples-branded shredding machine to shred a Staples-branded CD-R and many other nonpaper items, including a salad [99] Cisco Systems, a supplier of networking and telephone equipment, paid for product placement, which can be seen on close-up shots of the Cisco IP telephones Some products have additional branding labels attached; this can be clearly seen with the HP photo printer on Toby's desk in season 6, and less noticeably with the Cisco phones [101] In \"The Secret\" Michael takes Jim to Hooters [102] to discuss Jim's feelings for Pam.\n\n\nReception and legacy\nBefore the show aired, Ricky Gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers [110] The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling, which was also based on a British version [111] [112] The New York Daily News called it \"so diluted there's little left but muddy water,\" and USA Today called it a \"passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original.\" [113] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating that Steve Carell \"just seems to be trying too hard... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own But right now he's a pale imitation.\" [114] Tom Shales of The Washington Post said it was \"not the mishmash that  [the Americanized version of Coupling] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out.\" [112]\n\n\nCritical reviews and commentary\nBefore the show aired, Ricky Gervais acknowledged that there were feelings of hesitation from certain viewers [110] The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics with some of them comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling, which was also based on a British version [111] [112] The New York Daily News called it \"so diluted there's little left but muddy water,\" and USA Today called it a \"passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original.\" [113] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating that Steve Carell \"just seems to be trying too hard...

Series (Greg Daniels for \"Gay Witch Hunt\"), Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series (Jeffrey Blitz for \"Stress Relief\"), and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series (David Rogers and Claire Scanlon for \"Finale\") Many cast and crew members have expressed anger that Carell did not receive an Emmy award for his performance in the series [150] [151] Despite this, Carell

intended Tuesday night slot for its official series premiere, it lost nearly half its audience with only 5.9 million viewers [155] The program averaged 5.4 million viewers, ranking it #102 for the

[18] this was an unrealistic expectation because entry to other trades was generally restricted [19] Edward I attempted to convert Jews by compelling them to listen to Christian preachers [20]\n\n\nExpulsion of the Jews from Gascony\nLocal or temporary expulsions of Jews had taken place in other parts of Europe, [f] and regularly in England For example, Simon de Montfort expelled the Jews of Leicester in 1231, [30] and in 1275, Edward I had permitted the Queen mother Eleanor to expel Jews from her lands and towns [31] [g]\n\n\nExpulsion\nBy the time he returned to England from Gascony in 1289, Edward I was deeply in debt [39] At the same time, his experiment to convert the Jews to Christianity and remove their dependence on lending at interest had failed; the fifteen-year period in which Jews were allowed to lease farms had ended Also, raising significant sums of money from the Jewish population had become increasingly difficult because they had been repeatedly overtaxed [40]\n\n\nThe Jewish refugees\nThe Jewish population in England at the time of the expulsion was relatively small, perhaps as few as 2,000 people, although estimates vary [53] Decades of privations had caused many Jews to emigrate or convert [54] Although it is believed most of the Jews were able to leave England in safety, there are some records of piracy leading to the death of some expelled Jews On 10 October, a ship of poor London Jews had chartered, which a chronicler described as \"bearing their scrolls of the law\", [h] sailed toward the mouth of the Thames near Queenborough en route to France While the tide was low, the captain persuaded the Jews to walk with him on a sandbank; as the tide rose, he returned to the ship, telling the Jews to call upon Moses for help It appears those involved in this incident were punished [56] Another incident occurred in Portsmouth, where sailors received a pardon in 1294, [57] and a ship is recorded as drifting ashore near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, the Jewish passengers having been robbed and murdered [58] The condition of the sea in autumn was also dangerous; around 1,300 poor Jewish passengers crossed the English Channel to Wissant near Calais for 4d each [i] Tolls were collected by the constable of the Tower of London from those leaving on their departure, of 4d or 2d for \"poor Jews\" [60] Some ships were lost at sea and others arrived with their passengers destitute [61]\n\n\nDisposal of Jewish property\nFollowing the expulsion, the Crown seized Jewish property Debts with a value of £20,000 were collated from the archae from each town with a Jewish settlement In December, Hugh of Kendall was appointed to dispose of the property seized from the Jewish refugees, the most-valuable of which consisted of houses in London Some of the property was given away to courtiers, the Church and the royal family's circle in a total of 85 grants William Burnell received property in Oxford which he later gave to Balliol College; for example, Queen Eleanor's tailor was granted the synagogue in Canterbury Sales were mostly completed by early 1291 and around £2,000 was raised, £100 of which was used to glaze windows and decorate the tomb of Henry III in Westminster Abbey [64] It appears there was no systematic attempt to collect the £20,000 worth of seized debts The reasons for this could include the death of Queen Eleanor in November 1290, concerns over a possible war with Scotland, or an attempt to win political favour by providing benefit to those previously indebted [65]\n\n\nAfter the Expulsion\nIt is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the Domus Conversorum, which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity [66] The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family [67] Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the Domus Conversorum up to and after 1551 The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable [68] Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews [66]\n\n\nJewish presence in England after the Expulsion\nIt is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the Domus Conversorum, which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity [66] The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family [67] Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the Domus Conversorum up to and after 1551 The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable [68] Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews [66]\n\n\nPropagandising the Expulsion\nAfter the expulsion, Edward I sought to position himself as the defender of Christians against the supposed criminality of Jews Most prominently, he continued personal veneration of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, a child who whose death had been falsely attributed to ritual murder by Jews [69] After the death of his wife Queen Eleanor in late 1290, Edward reconstructed the shrine, incorporating the Royal Coat of Arms, in the same style as the Eleanor crosses [70] It appears to have been an attempt by Edward to associate himself and Eleanor with the cult According to historian Joe Hillaby, this \"propaganda coup\" boosted the circulation of the Saint Hugh myth, the most famous of the English blood libels, which is repeated in literature and the \"Sir Hugh\" folk songs into the twentieth century [71] Other efforts to justify the expulsion can be found in the Church, for instance in the canonisation evidence submitted for Thomas de Cantilupe, [72] and on the Hereford Mappa Mundi [73]\n\n\nSignificance\nThe permanent expulsion of Jews from England and tactics employed before it, such as attempts at forced conversion, are widely seen as setting a significant precedent and an example for the 1492 Alhambra Decree [74] Traditional narratives of Edward I have sought to downplay the event, emphasising the peacefulness of the expulsion or placing its roots in Edward's pragmatic need to extract money from Parliament; [75] more recent work on the Anglo-Jewish community's experience have framed it as the culmination of a policy of state-sponsored antisemitism [76] These studies place the expulsion in the context of the execution of Jews for coin clipping and the first royal-sponsored attempts at converting Jews to Christianity, saying this was the first time a state had permanently expelled all Jews from its territory [77]\n\n\nApology\nIn May 2022, the Church of England held a service that the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described as a formal \"act of repentance\" on the 800th anniversary of the Synod of Oxford in 1222 The Synod passed a set of laws that restricted the right of Jews in England to engage with Christians, which directly contributed to the expulsion of 1290 [84]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Edict of Expulsion**\n\nThe Edict of Expulsion, also known as the Expulsion of the Jews from England, was a decree issued by King Edward I of England in 1290, which permanently expelled all Jews from the country.

While the tide was low, the captain persuaded the Jews to walk with him on a sandbank; as the tide rose, he returned to the ship, telling the Jews to call upon Moses for help. Those involved in this incident were punished. Another incident occurred in Portsmouth, where sailors received a pardon in 1294, and a ship is recorded as drifting ashore near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, the Jewish passengers having been robbed and murdered. The condition of the sea in autumn was also dangerous; around 1,300 poor Jewish passengers crossed the English Channel to Wissant near Calais for 4d each. Tolls were collected by the constable of the Tower of London from those leaving on their departure, of 4d or 2d for \"poor Jews\". Some ships were lost at sea and others arrived with their passengers destitute.\n\n**Disposal of Jewish property**\n\nFollowing the expulsion, the Crown seized Jewish property. Debts with a value of £20,000 were collated from the archae from each town with a Jewish settlement. In December, Hugh of Kendall was appointed to dispose of the property seized from the Jewish refugees, the most-valuable of which consisted of houses in London. Some of the property was given away to courtiers, the Church and the royal family's circle in a total of 85 grants. William Burnell received property in Oxford which he later gave to Balliol College; for example, Queen Eleanor's tailor was granted the synagogue in Canterbury. Sales were mostly completed by early 1291 and around £2,000 was raised, £100 of which was used to glaze windows and decorate the tomb of Henry III in Westminster Abbey.\n\n**After the Expulsion**\n\nIt is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts. At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the Domus Conversorum, which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity. The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family. Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the Domus Conversorum up to and after 1551. The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable. Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews.\n\n**Propagandising the Expulsion**\n\nAfter the expulsion, Edward I sought to position himself as the defender of Christians against the supposed criminality of Jews. Most prominently, he continued personal veneration of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, a child who whose death had been falsely attributed to ritual murder by Jews. After the death of his wife Queen Eleanor in late 1290, Edward reconstructed the shrine, incorporating the Royal Coat of Arms, in the same style as the Eleanor crosses. It appears to have been an attempt by Edward to associate himself and Eleanor with the cult. According to historian Joe Hillaby, this \"propaganda coup\" boosted the circulation of the Saint Hugh myth, the most famous of the English blood libels, which is repeated in literature and the \"Sir Hugh\" folk songs into the twentieth century. Other efforts to justify the expulsion can be found in the Church, for instance in the canonisation evidence submitted for Thomas de Cantilupe, and on the Hereford Mappa Mundi.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe permanent expulsion of Jews from England and tactics employed before it, such as attempts at forced conversion, are widely seen as setting a significant precedent and an example for the 1492 Alhambra Decree. Traditional narratives of Edward I have sought to downplay the event, emphasising the peacefulness of the expulsion or placing its roots in Edward's pragmatic need to extract money from Parliament; more recent work on the Anglo-Jewish community's experience have framed it as the culmination of a policy of state-sponsored antisemitism. These studies place the expulsion in the context of the execution of Jews for coin clipping and the first royal-sponsored attempts at converting Jews to Christianity, saying this was the first time a state had permanently expelled all Jews from its territory.\n\n**Apology**\n\nIn May 2022, the Church of England held a service that the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described as a formal \"act of repentance\" on the 800th anniversary of the Synod of Oxford in 1222. The Synod passed a set of laws that restricted the right of Jews in England to engage with Christians, which directly contributed to the expulsion of 1290.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Synod of Oxford\n* Alhambra Decree\n* Edict of Expulsion of 1492\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Edict of Expulsion is also known as the Expulsion of the Jews from England.\n* The event was the culmination of a long history of anti-Jewish sentiment and persecution in England.\n* The permanent expulsion of Jews from England and tactics employed before it, such as attempts at forced conversion, are widely seen as setting a significant precedent and an example for the 1492 Alhambra Decree.\n* The Synod of Oxford in 1222 passed a set of laws that restricted the right of Jews in England to engage with Christians, which directly contributed to the expulsion of 1290.\n* In May 2022, the Church of England held a service that the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described as a formal \"act of repentance\" on the 800th anniversary of the Synod of Oxford in 1222.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* Hillaby, J.

[18] this was an unrealistic expectation because entry to other trades was generally restricted [19] Edward I attempted to convert Jews by compelling them to listen to Christian preachers [20]\n\n\nExpulsion of the Jews from Gascony\nLocal or temporary expulsions of Jews had taken place in other parts of Europe, [f] and regularly in England For example, Simon de Montfort expelled the Jews of Leicester in 1231, [30] and in 1275, Edward I had permitted the Queen mother Eleanor to expel Jews from her lands and towns [31] [g]\n\n\nExpulsion\nBy the time he returned to England from Gascony in 1289, Edward I was deeply in debt [39] At the same time, his experiment to convert the Jews to Christianity and remove their dependence on lending at interest had failed; the fifteen-year period in which Jews were allowed to lease farms had ended Also, raising significant sums of money from the Jewish population had become increasingly difficult because they had been repeatedly overtaxed [40]\n\n\nThe Jewish refugees\nThe Jewish population in England at the time of the expulsion was relatively small, perhaps as few as 2,000 people, although estimates vary [53] Decades of privations had caused many Jews to emigrate or convert [54] Although it is believed most of the Jews were able to leave England in safety, there are some records of piracy leading to the death of some expelled Jews On 10 October, a ship of poor London Jews had chartered, which a chronicler described as \"bearing their scrolls of the law\", [h] sailed toward the mouth of the Thames near Queenborough en route to France While the tide was low, the captain persuaded the Jews to walk with him on a sandbank; as the tide rose, he returned to the ship, telling the Jews to call upon Moses for help It appears those involved in this incident were punished [56] Another incident occurred in Portsmouth, where sailors received a pardon in 1294, [57] and a ship is recorded as drifting ashore near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, the Jewish passengers having been robbed and murdered [58] The condition of the sea in autumn was also dangerous; around 1,300 poor Jewish passengers crossed the English Channel to Wissant near Calais for 4d each [i] Tolls were collected by the constable of the Tower of London from those leaving on their departure, of 4d or 2d for \"poor Jews\" [60] Some ships were lost at sea and others arrived with their passengers destitute [61]\n\n\nDisposal of Jewish property\nFollowing the expulsion, the Crown seized Jewish property Debts with a value of £20,000 were collated from the archae from each town with a Jewish settlement In December, Hugh of Kendall was appointed to dispose of the property seized from the Jewish refugees, the most-valuable of which consisted of houses in London Some of the property was given away to courtiers, the Church and the royal family's circle in a total of 85 grants William Burnell received property in Oxford which he later gave to Balliol College; for example, Queen Eleanor's tailor was granted the synagogue in Canterbury Sales were mostly completed by early 1291 and around £2,000 was raised, £100 of which was used to glaze windows and decorate the tomb of Henry III in Westminster Abbey [64] It appears there was no systematic attempt to collect the £20,000 worth of seized debts The reasons for this could include the death of Queen Eleanor in November 1290, concerns over a possible war with Scotland, or an attempt to win political favour by providing benefit to those previously indebted [65]\n\n\nAfter the Expulsion\nIt is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the Domus Conversorum, which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity [66] The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family [67] Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the Domus Conversorum up to and after 1551 The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable [68] Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews [66]\n\n\nJewish presence in England after the Expulsion\nIt is likely the few Jews remaining in England after the expulsion were converts At the time of the expulsion, there were around 100 converted Jews in the Domus Conversorum, which provided accommodation to Jews who had converted to Christianity [66] The last of the pre-1290 converts Claricia, the daughter of Jacob Copin, died in 1356, having spent the early part of the 1300s in Exeter, where she raised a family [67] Between the Expulsion of the Jews in 1290 and their informal return in 1655, there continue to be records of Jews in the Domus Conversorum up to and after 1551 The expulsion is unlikely to have been wholly enforceable [68] Four complaints were made to the king in 1376 that some of those trading as Lombards were actually Jews [66]\n\n\nPropagandising the Expulsion\nAfter the expulsion, Edward I sought to position himself as the defender of Christians against the supposed criminality of Jews Most prominently, he continued personal veneration of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln, a child who whose death had been falsely attributed to ritual murder by Jews [69] After the death of his wife Queen Eleanor in late 1290, Edward reconstructed the shrine, incorporating the Royal Coat of Arms, in the same style as the Eleanor crosses [70] It appears to have been an attempt by Edward to associate himself and Eleanor with the cult According to historian Joe Hillaby, this \"propaganda coup\" boosted the circulation of the Saint Hugh myth, the most famous of the English blood libels, which is repeated in literature and the \"Sir Hugh\" folk songs into the twentieth century [71] Other efforts to justify the expulsion can be found in the Church, for instance in the canonisation evidence submitted for Thomas de Cantilupe, [72] and on the Hereford Mappa Mundi [73]\n\n\nSignificance\nThe permanent expulsion of Jews from England and tactics employed before it, such as attempts at forced conversion, are widely seen as setting a significant precedent and an example for the 1492 Alhambra Decree [74] Traditional narratives of Edward I have sought to downplay the event, emphasising the peacefulness of the expulsion or placing its roots in Edward's pragmatic need to extract money from Parliament;

Lovecraft and Stephen King as major influences on his writing.\n\n**Career**\n\nFlanagan's student films were more oriented toward melodrama. He later characterized them as \"unfit for public consumption\" but called them \"incredible learning experiences.\" After graduating, he directed \"Ghosts of Hamilton Street\" (2003), filmed in Maryland with local actors, including Scott Graham, whom Flanagan met at Towson.

Her father's Italian roots have been influential in shaping her cultural identity. Growing up in Rio de Janeiro, Baccarin was exposed to the rich cultural heritage of Brazil, which has had a lasting impact on her work.\n\nBaccarin's early life was marked by her mother's activism for women's rights in Brazil. Vera Setta was a prominent figure in the Brazilian feminist movement, and her daughter's interest in social justice was sparked by her mother's work.

Her performances have been praised for their depth and nuance, and she has become known for her ability to bring complex characters to life.\n\n**Political Views and Activism**\n\nIn 2019, Baccarin wrote an opinion piece for Newsweek magazine, detailing her experiences working with the International Rescue Committee on behalf of refugees. During a trip to Colombia, she interviewed refugees from Venezuela, warning of an evolving situation that could lead to an increase in refugees seeking asylum in the United States.\n\nBaccarin's advocacy for refugees and women's rights has been influenced by her mother's work in the Brazilian feminist movement. Her own activism has taken on a personal dimension, with a focus on women's empowerment and social justice.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn November 2011, Baccarin married American film producer and director Austin Chick.

This is in contrast to multiplayer games, which are designed to be played by multiple players, either locally or online. Single-player games have been a staple of the video game industry since the early days of gaming, and continue to be a popular choice for gamers around the world.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest video games, such as Tennis for Two (1958), Spacewar! (1962), and Pong (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players. However, it wasn't until later that single-player games gained popularity. One of the earliest single-player games was Speed Race (1974), a driving game that allowed players to compete against the clock. Another early single-player game was Space Invaders (1978), a classic shooter that became a huge hit in the late 1970s.\n\n**Game Elements**\n\nOne of the key differences between single-player games and multiplayer games is the way that the narrative and conflict are created. In single-player games, the computer creates the narrative and conflict, whereas in multiplayer games, human players create the conflict and interact with each other. This allows single-player games to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent or de-emphasized in multiplayer games.\n\nFor example, single-player games often rely on storytelling to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment. This can be achieved through the use of cutscenes, dialogue, and other narrative devices. In contrast, multiplayer games tend to focus more on action and interaction between players, rather than on a linear narrative.\n\n**Story**\n\nSingle-player games often have a strong focus on storytelling, with many games featuring complex and engaging narratives. These narratives can be used to explore themes and ideas, and to create a sense of emotional connection with the player. In addition, the storytelling in single-player games can be used to create a sense of investment and engagement, encouraging players to continue playing and to see the story through to its conclusion.\n\nMany single-player games are built around a compelling story, with the narrative driving the gameplay and the player's experience. This can be seen in games such as The Last of Us, which features a powerful and emotional story that explores the relationship between two characters in a post-apocalyptic world. Similarly, games like BioShock and Portal feature complex and thought-provoking narratives that challenge the player to think critically about the world and the story.\n\n**Characters**\n\nIn single-player games, the characters are often more developed and nuanced than in multiplayer games. This is because the player is not interacting with other players, and therefore the game does not need to rely on human-human interaction to create conflict and interest. Instead, the game can focus on creating complex and engaging characters that the player can interact with and care about.\n\nRole-playing games (RPGs) are a great example of this, with games like Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy featuring deep and complex characters that drive the story and gameplay. These characters are often developed over the course of the game, with the player learning more about their motivations, desires, and flaws as the story unfolds. This creates a sense of connection and investment in the characters, and encourages the player to care about what happens to them.\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nWhile single-player games often focus on storytelling and character development, there are certainly exceptions to this rule. Puzzle games, for example, often focus squarely on gameplay and challenge, rather than on narrative or character development. Similarly, racing games and sports games often focus on competition and action, rather than on storytelling or character development.\n\nIn these types of games, the gameplay is often the primary focus, with the narrative and characters taking a backseat. However, even in these games, there can be elements of storytelling and character development that add depth and interest to the gameplay.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Multiplayer Video Game\n* Role-Playing Game\n* Puzzle Game\n* Racing Game\n* Sports Game\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nNote: This article does not include any bibliography.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Single-player_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest video games, such as Tennis for Two (1958), Spacewar!

understood Japanese and heard them making fun of her Bayley was then kicked out of Damage CTRL after Asuka and Sane attacked her, turning face for the first time since 2019 After fighting off the rest of Damage CTRL, Bayley decided that she would challenge Sky for the WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania XL [42] Kai was absent when Sky, Asuka, and Sane turned on Bayley and although she

It was the company's first PPV produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. WrestleMania is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history, held annually between mid-March to mid-April, featuring wrestlers from WWE's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. Along with Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, it is one of the company's five biggest events of the year, referred to as the \"Big Five.\" WrestleMania was ranked the sixth-most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host WrestleMania.\n\n**Background**\n\nWrestleMania XL was the culmination of a year-long storyline that saw multiple championships change hands and alliances form and break. The event featured a total of 14 matches, split evenly between both nights, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n**Broadcast Outlets**\n\nWrestleMania XL was broadcast live on traditional pay-per-view worldwide.

Also at WrestleMania 38, Roman Reigns became the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion by retaining the WWE Universal Championship and winning the WWE Championship. Rhodes subsequently won the 2023 Royal Rumble match but failed to defeat Reigns for the undisputed title at WrestleMania 39. A year later, prior to the 2024 Royal Rumble at Raw: Day 1 on January 1, The Rock made a surprise appearance and seemingly called out Reigns by asking if he should sit at the \"head of the table,\" a reference to their relationship through the Anoa'i family, as for over three years, Reigns had claimed he was the Head of the Table and Tribal Chief of The Bloodline, a faction of wrestlers from the family that, at the time, included Reigns and his cousins Jimmy Uso and Solo Sikoa, managed by Paul Heyman.\n\n**Undercard Matches**\n\nAt SummerSlam in July 2022, Bayley made her return from injury alongside Dakota Kai and Iyo Sky with the trio dubbing themselves Damage CTRL.

The group would attain success on SmackDown, including multiple WWE Women's Tag Team Championship reigns, as well as Sky winning the WWE Women's Championship. Bayley then won the 2024 women's Royal Rumble match, thus earning a women's championship match of her choice at WrestleMania XL. Bayley had previously said she would be going after Raw's women's championship so that Damage CTRL would hold all the women's titles of Raw and SmackDown; however, on the February 2 episode of SmackDown, after Bayley overheard Sky, Asuka, and Sane talking behind her back, Bayley revealed she understood Japanese and heard them making fun of her. Bayley was then kicked out of Damage CTRL after Asuka and Sane attacked her, turning face for the first time since 2019. After fighting off the rest of Damage CTRL, Bayley decided that she would challenge Sky for the WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania XL.\n\n**Cancelled Matches**\n\nBrock Lesnar, who last appeared at SummerSlam in August 2023, was planned to return at the Royal Rumble and be featured in a match at WrestleMania XL, reportedly against Gunther for the WWE Intercontinental Championship.

A first attempt was made to start the race at 15:25 CEST, with two formation laps (that did not count towards a race classification) being completed behind the safety car before the starting procedure was suspended with cars queueing in the pit lane, in line with the regulations [50] At 17:00 CEST, the stewards used the powers given to them under article 11.9.3.o of the 2021 edition of the FIA

finish\nAfter over three hours of delays and suspended starts, at 18:17 CEST the race officially commenced from the pit lane and two more laps were completed under the safety car, with these laps being considered as race laps by race control, which allowed for the results to be classified and half points to be awarded [54] During the third lap, the race was suspended again and the race not resumed The race result was taken after the first lap, in compliance with Formula One regulations which required a two-lap countback [55] Max Verstappen was declared the race winner (scoring his 16th

lap completed, and an official completed distance of 6.880 km (4.275 mi), it is the shortest ever race in the history of the sport, eclipsing the previous records set in terms of kilometres of distance covered at the 1991 Australian Grand Prix (which was raced over 52.920 km (32.883 mi) and 14 laps) [62] and in terms of official lap count at the 1971 German Grand Prix (which lasted 12 laps) [63] For the sixth time in Formula One history and for the first time since the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix, half points were awarded [64] Russell's second place was his first career podium and the first for the Williams Racing team since Lance Stroll finished third for the team at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix [65] Stroll finished this race 18th on the road but was classified in 20th, having been handed a 10-second time penalty for a rear wing change under parc fermé conditions during the first red flag period This promoted Kimi Räikkönen to 18th and Pérez to 19th Charles Leclerc was investigated for a change of tyres during the start delays but was not penalised as the change was quickly reversed [66] As of 2022 [update], this race is the only World Championship Grand Prix where there is no officially recognised fastest lap [67] This was the eleventh Formula One World Championship Grand Prix where there were no retirements during the race, [68] and the twelfth World Championship Grand Prix to finish under the safety car [69]\n\n\nRace classification\nIn addition to admitting to making mistakes on qualifying day, Masi also faced criticism from drivers, teams and media for how he ran the race On race day, due to poor weather and after numerous delays, Masi made the decision to run two full laps behind the safety car before abandoning the race on the third lap, which Masi said was a genuine attempt to go racing [72] Media and drivers criticised Masi's decision to hold two laps under the safety car in still-raining conditions, [73] [74] [75] with seven-time World Champion Hamilton calling the race \"a farce\" and criticised, among others, the alleged attempt to fulfill the requirements for awarding points They argued that points should never have been awarded [76] Sebastian Vettel, [77] Fernando Alonso, [78] and Alfa Romeo Racing [79] criticised the decision to award half points for the race [80] [81] Daniel Ricciardo defended the decision to do so, [82] as did Red Bull's Pérez [83] Ricciardo's McLaren teammate Lando Norris was left conflicted by the FIA's decision to award points since this benefited his fellow driver but thought it was not a race \"deserving of points\" [84] Verstappen commented that it was not \"the way you want to win\" [85] Russell was pleased to achieve his first Formula One podium despite the unusual circumstances, saying: \"You don't get rewarded for this very often.\" He added that he had been rewarded for a strong qualifying on Saturday, whilst also sympathising with, and apologising to, the attending fans for the lack of action in the Grand Prix itself [86] Despite his driver winning the event, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner felt the decision to award points was not right [87] Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff called the decision to award half points \"annoying\" [88]\n\n\nPost-race reactions\nIn addition to admitting to making mistakes on qualifying day, Masi also faced criticism from

mandated that a minimum of two laps must be completed to award any points [76] Masi stated there was a genuine attempt to race under green-flag conditions before the rain got worse, and Hamilton said that \"money talks\" [120] The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile noted that it was \"impractical\" to delay the race until the following day [121] [122] There was post-race confusion as to whether points would be awarded given that the classification showed one was completed, but the regulations stated that a minimum of two laps must be completed for a race to be eligible for points Masi clarified that race was eligible for points as, \"three laps were completed .. The third lap was completed when cars crossed the control line in the  [pit lane] .. And then the classification for points is taken on the penultimate lap before the lap the signal was given  [, the end of the first lap].\" [123]\n\n\nRegulation changes\nFormula One Management stated in the race aftermath that it intended to have discussions with the teams and the FIA regarding changes to sporting regulations to prevent such an occurrence from happening again [124] The proposed changes would attempt to formulate a more satisfactory minimum requirement for a classification to be achieved than was required under the 2021 rules, as well as discussing the possibility of written provisions in the rules enabling race organisers to reschedule a race if it were unsuitable to run the race on its original date [125] After one of the races of the 2021 Sochi Formula 3 round had its start time changed due to poor weather, Masi suggested that Formula One could adopt a similar rule to reduce the chances of having to abandon a race for bad weather [126] [127] In January 2022, McLaren CEO Zak Brown cited the aborted Spa race, alongside the last minute cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix and the controversial restart at the subsequent 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, as signs that the FIA had suffered organisational and rule-making problems for a significant period of time which needed to urgently be resolved [128]\n\n\nChampionship standings after the race\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2021 Belgian Grand Prix**\n\nThe 2021 Belgian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 29 August 2021 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Spa, Belgium.

Racing mechanics were able to repair Pérez's car during the delay following the first red flag [49] A first attempt was made to start the race at 15:25 CEST, with two formation laps (that did not count towards a race classification) being completed behind the safety car before the starting procedure was suspended with cars queueing in the pit lane, in line with the regulations [50] At 17:00 CEST, the stewards used the powers given to them under article 11.9.3.o of the 2021 edition of the FIA International Sporting Code (which allowed the stewards to permanently or temporarily stop an event) to suspend the race clock on grounds of force majeure [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nRace report\nThe race was due to start at 15:00 CEST on 29 August but was delayed multiple times due to persistent rain

[52] [53]\n\n\nRace start and finish\nAfter over three hours of delays and suspended starts, at 18:17 CEST the race officially commenced from the pit lane and two more laps were completed under the safety car, with these laps being considered as race laps by race control, which allowed for the results to be classified and half points to be awarded [54] During the third lap, the race was suspended again and the race not resumed The race result was taken after the first lap, in compliance with Formula One regulations which required a two-lap countback [55] Max Verstappen was declared the race winner (scoring his 16th career F1 win and sixth win of the season as a result) [56] ahead of George Russell in second and Lewis Hamilton third [57] [58] [59] The remaining points scorers were Daniel Ricciardo in fourth, Sebastian Vettel in fifth, Pierre Gasly in sixth, Esteban Ocon in seventh, Charles Leclerc in eighth, Nicholas Latifi in ninth and Carlos Sainz Jr in tenth [60] Verstappen's win was Red Bull Racing's fourth Belgian Grand Prix win and their first at the venue since Ricciardo's 2014 win as well as the first F1 win at Spa for a Honda powered car since the 1991 event [61] With only a single official lap completed, and an official completed distance of 6.880 km (4.275 mi), it is the shortest ever race in the history of the sport, eclipsing the previous records set in terms of kilometres of distance covered at the 1991 Australian Grand Prix (which was raced over 52.920 km (32.883 mi) and 14 laps) [62] and in terms of official lap count at the 1971 German Grand Prix (which lasted 12 laps) [63] For the sixth time in Formula One history and for the first time since the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix, half points were awarded [64] Russell's second place was his first career podium and the first for the Williams Racing team since Lance Stroll finished third for the team at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix [65] Stroll finished this race 18th on the road but was classified in 20th, having been handed a 10-second time penalty for a rear wing change under parc fermé conditions during the first red flag period This promoted Kimi Räikkönen to 18th and Pérez to 19th Charles Leclerc was investigated for a change of tyres during the start delays but was not penalised as the change was quickly reversed [66] As of 2022 [update], this race is the only World Championship Grand Prix where there is no officially recognised fastest lap [67] This was the eleventh Formula One World Championship Grand Prix where there were no retirements during the race, [68] and the twelfth World Championship Grand Prix to finish under the safety car [69]\n\n\nRace classification\nIn addition to admitting to making mistakes on qualifying day, Masi also faced criticism from drivers, teams and media for how he ran the race On race day, due to poor weather and after numerous delays, Masi made the decision to run two full laps behind the safety car before abandoning the race on the third lap, which Masi said was a genuine attempt to go racing [72] Media and drivers criticised Masi's decision to hold two laps under the safety car in still-raining conditions, [73] [74] [75] with seven-time World Champion Hamilton calling the race \"a farce\" and criticised, among others, the alleged attempt to fulfill the requirements for awarding points They argued that points should never have been awarded [76] Sebastian Vettel, [77] Fernando Alonso, [78] and Alfa Romeo Racing [79] criticised the decision to award half points for the race [80] [81] Daniel Ricciardo defended the decision to do so, [82] as did Red Bull's Pérez [83] Ricciardo's McLaren teammate Lando Norris was left conflicted by the FIA's decision to award points since this benefited his fellow driver but thought it was not a race \"deserving of points\" [84] Verstappen commented that it was not \"the way you want to win\" [85] Russell was pleased to achieve his first Formula One podium despite the unusual circumstances, saying: \"You don't get rewarded for this very often.\" He added that he had been rewarded for a strong qualifying on Saturday, whilst also sympathising with, and apologising to, the attending fans for the lack of action in the Grand Prix itself [86] Despite his driver winning the event, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner felt the decision to award points was not right [87] Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff called the decision to award half points \"annoying\" [88]\n\n\nPost-race reactions\nIn addition to admitting to making

principal Christian Horner felt the decision to award points was not right [87] Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff called the decision to award half points \"annoying\" [88]\n\n\nClarification of race management\nThe Formula One regulations at the time of the race mandated that a minimum of two laps must be completed to award any points [76] Masi stated there was a genuine attempt to race under green-flag conditions before the rain got worse, and Hamilton said that \"money talks\" [120] The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile noted that it was \"impractical\" to delay the race until the following day [121] [122] There was post-race confusion as to whether points would be awarded given that the classification showed one was completed, but the regulations stated that a minimum of two laps must be completed for a race to be eligible for points Masi clarified that race was eligible for points as, \"three laps were completed .. The third lap was completed when cars crossed the control line in the  [pit lane] .. And then the classification for points is taken on the penultimate lap before the lap the signal was given  [, the end of the first lap].\" [123]\n\n\nRegulation changes\nFormula One Management stated in the race aftermath that it intended to have discussions with the teams and the FIA regarding changes to sporting regulations to prevent such an occurrence from happening again [124] The proposed changes would attempt to formulate a more satisfactory minimum requirement for a classification to be achieved than was required under the 2021 rules, as well as discussing the possibility of written provisions in the rules enabling race organisers to reschedule a race if it were unsuitable to run the race on its original date [125] After one of the races of the 2021 Sochi Formula 3 round had its start time changed due to poor weather, Masi suggested that Formula One could adopt a similar rule to reduce the chances of having to abandon a race for bad weather [126] [127] In January 2022, McLaren CEO Zak Brown cited the aborted Spa race, alongside the last minute cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix and the controversial restart at the subsequent 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, as signs that the FIA had suffered organisational and rule-making problems for a significant period of time which needed to urgently be resolved [128]\n\n\nChampionship standings after the race\n\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Janet_Yellen", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nYellen was born on August 13, 1946, [4] to a family of Polish Jewish [5] ancestry in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, neighborhood of New York City, and grew up there [6] Her mother was Anna Ruth (née Blumenthal; 1907–1986), an elementary school teacher who gave up her teaching job to become a stay-at-home mother Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation [7] [8]\n\n\nAcademic career\nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Yellen obtained the position of assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976 [20] At that time, she was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard's economics department; the other woman was Rachel McCulloch The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together [18] In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M Truman, who had known her from Yale Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen's oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed's Division of International Finance She was assigned to research international monetary reform [21]\n\n\nContributions to economics\nYellen's academic career has largely focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade She has written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating on research with her husband, Professor George Akerlof [28] [29]\n\n\nEfficiency wage models\nSince the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof have addressed what's known in the economics literature as \"efficiency wage theory\" – the idea that paying people more than the market wage does increase their productivity Their 1990 paper, entitled \"The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment\", coined \"the fair wage effort hypothesis\" and was considered by economists to be a significant contribution to the topic: \"A precursor to the efficiency wage literature...it had an influence, although the work on efficiency wage theory has had a bigger influence.\" [30] Akerlof and Yellen introduced the gift-exchange game, which argues that workers who are paid less than what they consider to be a fair wage will purposefully work less hard to exact revenge on their employer [30] [28]\n\n\nReproductive technology shock\nAnother work, \"An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States\", co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out-of-wedlock births have grown considerably in previous decades in the United States A research study led to a theory called \"reproductive technology shock\", arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood [31] At the same time, this transformation encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations [32]\n\n\nFederal Reserve (1994–1997)\nOn April 22, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Yellen as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, alongside Alan Blinder, who has been designated as vice chairman They were the first Democratic appointees to the Board since 1980 [33] [34] In an issued statement, the president praised her as \"one of the most prominent economists of her generation on the intersection of macroeconomics and labor markets.\" [35] President Clinton played an indirect role in the selection process, delegating most of the responsibility to NEC Director Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and CEA Chair Laura Tyson, who was a colleague of Yellen's at Berkeley The group settled on her candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names [33] In July 1994, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates [36] The Senate panel approved her nomination without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that her concerns should be limited to inflation [37] The nomination was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94–6 [38] On August 12, 1994, Yellen was appointed to a full 14-year term and assumed the seat vacated by Republican Wayne Angell [37] She was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board simultaneously [39]\n\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (1997–1999)\nOn December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office [41] She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, \"We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.\" [42] Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997, [43] thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson [44] [42] While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999 [25]\n\n\nReturn to the Federal Reserve (2004–2018)\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14 [48] She was the first woman to hold this position [18] While serving as Federal Reserve District president, she sat on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and was a voting member once every three years on a rotating basis, with her first being in 2006 [48] During her time at the San Francisco Fed, the largest of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in terms of population and economic output, Yellen publicly downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of the boom in housing prices; at FOMC meetings, on the contrary, she sounded the alarm on banks' heavy concentration in risky construction and home-development loans [49] On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to \"move to check  [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending\" of Countrywide Financial, the United States' largest lender [50] [51]\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14 [48]

risky construction and home-development loans [49] On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to \"move to check  [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending\" of Countrywide Financial, the United States' largest lender [50] [51]\n\n\nVice Chair of the Federal Reserve\nOn April 28, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to succeed Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve [56] In July 2010, the Senate Banking Committee voted 17–6 to confirm her, though the top Republican on the panel, Sen Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted no, saying \"President Yellen presided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the excesses.\" [57]\n\n\nChair of the Federal Reserve\nOn October 9, 2013, Yellen was officially nominated to replace Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve, [73] [74] the first vice chair ever to be elevated to that post [75] While announcing his decision, President Obama called her \"one of the nation's foremost economists and policymakers\" and said that \"America's workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen.\" [76] During the nomination hearings held in November, Yellen defended the more than $3 trillion in stimulus funds that the central bank had been injecting into the U.S economy [77] She also said that it is important for the Fed to try to detect asset bubbles and that if she saw one, she would work to address it [78]\n\n\nAfter the Federal Reserve (2018–2020)\nOn February 2, 2018, the Brookings Institution announced that Yellen would join the think tank as a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program, effective February 5, 2018 [104] She's been affiliated with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings [105] On July 31, 2018, the Hutchins Center announced Yellen, James H Stock, and Louise Sheiner as co-chairs of the newly launched Productivity Measurement Initiative, aimed at improving the quality of economic statistics [106]\n\n\nPaid corporate speaking\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Yellen received $7.2 million in speaking fees for 50 speeches at various Wall Street, technology and consulting companies This included $1 million for giving nine speeches to Citi and $800,000 from the hedge fund Citadel LLC, as well as other paid speeches with Wall Street companies Barclays, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Credit Suisse [115] [116] [117] [118] Paid speeches with technology companies included Google and Salesforce [115]\n\n\nSecretary of the Treasury (2021–present)\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration [120] [121] She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov Lael Brainard and Roger W Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman [114] [122]\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration [120] [121] She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov Lael Brainard and Roger W Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman [114] [122]\n\n\nTenure\nIn April 2021, Yellen proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance [136] In an accompanying written piece for The Wall Street Journal, she outlined the enormous benefits of the discussed tax system for the US economy as well as the global economy [137] On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a minimum worldwide corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while \nFrance's Bruno Le Maire called it \"a starting point\" that could be increased in the future [138]  A few days later, Treasury Secretary Yellen co-wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post with four of her international counterparts, describing the new agreement as \"an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when they are most needed.\" [139] The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\" [140]\n\n\nProposed international tax reform\nIn April

leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\" [140]\n\n\nDebt ceiling crisis\nOn July 23, 2021, Yellen sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which she urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation's debt limit as soon as possible before it hit its statutory limit in August and the government would be unable to pay its bills She warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause \"irreparable harm\" to the U.S economy and that the Treasury Department would take \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the United States from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default [142]\n\n\nSanctions against Russia and oil price cap\nIn November 2021, Yellen and senior Treasury personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on Russia's economy while limiting, if possible, \nthe expected negative impact on the United States and its allies if a potential aggression began [152] The Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 [152]\n\n\nDigital Assets Regulation\nOn April 7, 2022, at American University's Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, Yellen addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy Yellen outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include \"first, the U.S financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it's often society's vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it'll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.\" [155]\n\n\nFriendshoring of supply chains\nIn a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2022, Yellen advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries She said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia accountable for its aggression would draw the ire of the U.S and its allies [157] Yellen also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that they could meet the world's 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order [158]\n\n\nComments on Roe v. Wade overturning\nOn May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Yellen made comments on the economic consequences of Roe v Wade overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule its previous decisions that legalized abortion in the United States Sen Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing the landmark ruling would mean economically for the United States; Yellen responded, \"I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\" She added that keeping women from accessing abortions \"increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.\" Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, \"I think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of our country is harsh.\" She replied, \"This is not harsh This is the truth.\" [160]\n\n\nInternal Revenue Service reforms\nAfter the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, Yellen directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees [163]\n\n\nVisit to Ukraine\nOn February 27, 2023, Yellen made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which she reaffirmed ongoing U.S economic support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the federal government has provided over the past year as Ukraine's largest bilateral donor She met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others [165]\n\n\nBanking crisis\nOn March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, Yellen made an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure it remained safe and well-capitalized Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, she said she had been working with bank regulators to \"design appropriate policies\" to tackle the issue, though  declining to provide further details She stressed that the possibility of a bailout was off the table [167] Despite her statement, on the same day, Yellen approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender [168] These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S banking system and prevent spreading of a bank run [169]\n\n\nEconomic approach to China\nIn a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, Yellen laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China Those principles are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change [174] Though she emphasized that national security would always take priority if it collided with economics, her address ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in relations between the two nations Yellen's speech attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as she made clear her desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the countries' previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track However, its ultimate success is not at all obvious [175]\n\n\nEconomic philosophy\nYellen is widely considered to be a \"dove\" on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates [182] [183] [184] She was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system [185] Yellen was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934 [7] On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to her as \"sort of\" a deficit hawk [184] [186] She expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, she said, \"If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\" [184] The following year, she again suggested that she favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending [184] In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Yellen lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the borrowing cap is \"very destructive\" and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy [187]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nYellen has received numerous honors in recognition of her career in academia and politics These

write a Hamiltonesque musical about her [249] In addition, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert premiered a parody of Hamilton's opening song about Yellen [250]\n\n\nSelected

policymaker who served as the 78th United States Secretary of the Treasury from 2021 to 2023. She is the first woman to hold the position. Prior to her tenure as Secretary of the Treasury, Yellen served as the 15th Chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, making her the first woman to hold the position. She is also a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nYellen was born on August 13, 1946, in Brooklyn, New York, to a family of Polish Jewish ancestry. Her mother was an elementary school teacher, and her father was a family physician. Yellen grew up in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn and developed an interest in economics at an early age.\n\nYellen received her undergraduate degree in economics from Brown University in 1967. She then went on to earn her Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 1971. Her dissertation, titled \"Theories of the Determination of the Optimal Rate of Inflation,\" was published in 1972.\n\n**Academic Career**\n\nAfter completing her Ph.D., Yellen obtained a position as an assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976. She was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard's economics department at the time. During her tenure at Harvard, Yellen collaborated with her colleague Rachel McCulloch on several academic papers.\n\nIn 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, where she was recruited as a staff economist by Edwin M. Truman. She was assigned to research international monetary reform and quickly became a prominent voice on the topic.\n\n**Contributions to Economics**\n\nYellen's academic career has focused on the analysis of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade. She has written several widely cited papers, often collaborating with her husband, George Akerlof.\n\nOne of Yellen's most significant contributions to economics is her work on the \"efficiency wage theory.\" In the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof developed a model that suggests that paying workers more than the market wage can increase productivity. Their 1990 paper, \"The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment,\" introduced the concept of the \"fair wage effort hypothesis\" and was considered a significant contribution to the field.\n\nYellen has also worked on the topic of reproductive technology shock, which suggests that the increased availability of abortion and contraception in the 1960s and 1970s led to a decline in the stigma surrounding unwed motherhood. This transformation, in turn, encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations.\n\n**Federal Reserve (1994-1997)**\n\nIn 1994, Yellen was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, where she served as a member until 1997. During her tenure, she was a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee and advocated for policies to keep the economy growing without accelerating inflation.\n\n**Council of Economic Advisers (1997-1999)**\n\nIn 1997, Yellen was appointed chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, a position she held until 1999. During her tenure, she worked closely with the president's economic team to develop policies to promote economic growth and job creation.\n\n**Return to the Federal Reserve (2004-2018)**\n\nIn 2004, Yellen was appointed president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a position she held until 2010. During her tenure, she was a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee and advocated for policies to stabilize the financial system.\n\n**Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve (2010-2014)**\n\nIn 2010, Yellen was appointed vice chair of the Federal Reserve, a position she held until 2014. During her tenure, she played a key role in shaping the Fed's policies to respond to the financial crisis.\n\n**Chair of the Federal Reserve (2014-2018)**\n\nIn 2014, Yellen was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve, a position she held until 2018. During her tenure, she led the Fed's efforts to promote economic growth and job creation, while also maintaining price stability.\n\n**Secretary of the Treasury (2021-2023)**\n\nIn 2021, Yellen was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, a position she held until 2023. During her tenure, she played a key role in shaping the administration's economic policies, including its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nYellen is married to George Akerlof, a Nobel laureate in economics. The couple has one son, Robert, who is also an economist.\n\n**Awards and Recognition**\n\nYellen has received numerous awards and honors for her contributions to economics and public service. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received the John Bates Clark Medal, the Federal Reserve System's Award for Outstanding Service, and the American Economic Association's Distinguished Fellow Award.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nYellen's legacy as a leading economist and policymaker is marked by her commitment to promoting economic growth and stability. Her work on the efficiency wage theory and her advocacy for policies to promote job creation and economic growth have had a lasting impact on the field of economics. As Secretary of the Treasury, she played a key role in shaping the administration's economic policies, including its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Janet_Yellen\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nYellen was born on August 13, 1946, [4] to a family of Polish Jewish [5] ancestry in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, neighborhood of New York City, and grew up there [6] Her mother was Anna Ruth (née Blumenthal; 1907–1986), an elementary school teacher who gave up her teaching job to become a stay-at-home mother Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation [7] [8]\n\n\nAcademic career\nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Yellen obtained the position of assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976 [20] At that time, she was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard's economics department; the other woman was Rachel McCulloch The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together [18] In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M Truman, who had known her from Yale Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen's oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed's Division of International Finance She was assigned to research international monetary reform [21]\n\n\nContributions to economics\nYellen's academic career has largely focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade She has written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating on research with her husband, Professor George Akerlof [28] [29]\n\n\nEfficiency wage models\nSince the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof have addressed what's known in the economics literature as \"efficiency wage theory\" – the idea that paying people more than the market wage does increase their productivity Their 1990 paper, entitled \"The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment\", coined \"the fair wage effort hypothesis\" and was considered by economists to be a significant contribution to the topic: \"A precursor to the efficiency wage literature...it had an influence, although the work on efficiency wage theory has had a bigger influence.\" [30] Akerlof and Yellen introduced the gift-exchange game, which argues that workers who are paid less than what they consider to be a fair wage will purposefully work less hard to exact revenge on their employer [30] [28]\n\n\nReproductive technology shock\nAnother work, \"An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States\", co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out-of-wedlock births have grown considerably in previous decades in the United States A research study led to a theory called \"reproductive technology shock\", arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood [31] At the same time, this transformation encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations [32]\n\n\nFederal Reserve (1994–1997)\nOn April 22, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Yellen as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, alongside Alan Blinder, who has been designated as vice chairman They were the first Democratic appointees to the Board since 1980 [33] [34] In an issued statement, the president praised her as \"one of the most prominent economists of her generation on the intersection of macroeconomics and labor markets.\" [35] President Clinton played an indirect role in the selection process, delegating most of the responsibility to NEC Director Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and CEA Chair Laura Tyson, who was a colleague of Yellen's at Berkeley The group settled on her candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names [33] In July 1994, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates [36] The Senate panel approved her nomination without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that her concerns should be limited to inflation [37] The nomination was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94–6 [38] On August 12, 1994, Yellen was appointed to a full 14-year term and assumed the seat vacated by Republican Wayne Angell [37] She was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board simultaneously [39]\n\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers (1997–1999)\nOn December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office [41] She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, \"We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.\" [42] Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997, [43] thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson [44] [42] While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999 [25]\n\n\nReturn to the Federal Reserve (2004–2018)\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14 [48] She was the first woman to hold this position [18] While serving as Federal Reserve District president, she sat on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and was a voting member once every three years on a rotating basis, with her first being in 2006 [48] During her time at the San Francisco Fed, the largest of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in terms of population and economic output, Yellen publicly downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of the boom in housing prices; at FOMC meetings, on the contrary, she sounded the alarm on banks' heavy concentration in risky construction and home-development loans [49] On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to \"move to check  [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending\" of Countrywide Financial, the United States' largest lender [50] [51]\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14

the United States' largest lender [50] [51]\n\n\nVice Chair of the Federal Reserve\nOn April 28, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to succeed Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve [56] In July 2010, the Senate Banking Committee voted 17–6 to confirm her, though the top Republican on the panel, Sen Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted no, saying \"President Yellen presided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the excesses.\" [57]\n\n\nChair of the Federal Reserve\nOn October 9, 2013, Yellen was officially nominated to replace Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve, [73] [74] the first vice chair ever to be elevated to that post [75] While announcing his decision, President Obama called her \"one of the nation's foremost economists and policymakers\" and said that \"America's workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen.\" [76] During the nomination hearings held in November, Yellen defended the more than $3 trillion in stimulus funds that the central bank had been injecting into the U.S economy [77] She also said that it is important for the Fed to try to detect asset bubbles and that if she saw one, she would work to address it [78]\n\n\nAfter the Federal Reserve (2018–2020)\nOn February 2, 2018, the Brookings Institution announced that Yellen would join the think tank as a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program, effective February 5, 2018 [104] She's been affiliated with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings [105] On July 31, 2018, the Hutchins Center announced Yellen, James H Stock, and Louise Sheiner as co-chairs of the newly launched Productivity Measurement Initiative, aimed at improving the quality of economic statistics [106]\n\n\nPaid corporate speaking\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Yellen received $7.2 million in speaking fees for 50 speeches at various Wall Street, technology and consulting companies This included $1 million for giving nine speeches to Citi and $800,000 from the hedge fund Citadel LLC, as well as other paid speeches with Wall Street companies Barclays, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Credit Suisse [115] [116] [117] [118] Paid speeches with technology companies included Google and Salesforce [115]\n\n\nSecretary of the Treasury (2021–present)\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration [120] [121] She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov Lael Brainard and Roger W Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman [114] [122]\n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a

Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman [114] [122]\n\n\nTenure\nIn April 2021, Yellen proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance [136] In an accompanying written piece for The Wall Street Journal, she outlined the enormous benefits of the discussed tax system for the US economy as well as the global economy [137] On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a minimum worldwide corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while \nFrance's Bruno Le Maire called it \"a starting point\" that could be increased in the future [138]  A few days later, Treasury Secretary Yellen co-wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post with four of her international counterparts, describing the new agreement as \"an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when they are most needed.\" [139] The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\" [140]\n\n\nProposed international tax reform\nIn April

leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\" [140]\n\n\nDebt ceiling crisis\nOn July 23, 2021, Yellen sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which she urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation's debt limit as soon as possible before it hit its statutory limit in August and the government would be unable to pay its bills She warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause \"irreparable harm\" to the U.S economy and that the Treasury Department would take \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the United States from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default [142]\n\n\nSanctions against Russia and oil price cap\nIn November 2021, Yellen and senior Treasury personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on Russia's economy while limiting, if possible, \nthe expected negative impact on the United States and its allies if a potential aggression began [152] The Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 [152]\n\n\nDigital Assets Regulation\nOn April 7, 2022, at American University's Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, Yellen addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy Yellen outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include \"first, the U.S financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it's often society's vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it'll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.\" [155]\n\n\nFriendshoring of supply chains\nIn a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2022, Yellen advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries She said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia accountable for its aggression would draw the ire of the U.S and its allies [157] Yellen also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that they could meet the world's 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order [158]\n\n\nComments on Roe v. Wade overturning\nOn May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Yellen made comments on the economic consequences of Roe v Wade overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule its previous decisions that legalized abortion in the United States Sen Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing the landmark ruling would mean economically for the United States; Yellen responded, \"I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\" She added that keeping women from accessing abortions \"increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.\" Sen Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, \"I think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of our country is harsh.\" She replied, \"This is not harsh This is the truth.\" [160]\n\n\nInternal Revenue Service reforms\nAfter the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, Yellen directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees [163]\n\n\nVisit to Ukraine\nOn February 27, 2023, Yellen made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which she reaffirmed ongoing U.S economic support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the federal government has provided over the past year as Ukraine's largest bilateral donor She met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others [165]\n\n\nBanking crisis\nOn March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, Yellen made an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure it remained safe and well-capitalized Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, she said she had been working with bank regulators to \"design appropriate policies\" to tackle the issue, though  declining to provide further details She stressed that the possibility of a bailout was off the table [167] Despite her statement, on the same day, Yellen approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender [168] These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S banking system and prevent spreading of a bank run [169]\n\n\nEconomic approach to China\nIn a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, Yellen laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China Those principles are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change [174] Though she emphasized that national security would always take priority if it collided with economics, her address ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in relations between the two nations Yellen's speech attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as she made clear her desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the countries' previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track However, its ultimate success is not at all obvious [175]\n\n\nEconomic philosophy\nYellen is widely considered to be a \"dove\" on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates [182] [183] [184] She was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system [185] Yellen was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934 [7] On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to her as \"sort of\" a deficit hawk [184] [186] She expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, she said, \"If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\" [184] The following year, she again suggested that she favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending [184] In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Yellen lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the borrowing cap is \"very destructive\" and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy [187]\n\n\nHonors and awards\nYellen has received numerous honors in recognition of her career in academia and politics These include:\n\n\nAcademic\nYellen is married to George Akerlof, an economist who is a university professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and Koshland Professor of

Unlike conventional shaped charges, which have a conical metal liner, EFPs are designed to form a more efficient and effective penetrator.\n\n## Difference from Conventional Shaped Charges\n\nConventional shaped charges generally have a conical metal liner that is forced by an explosive blast into a hypervelocity jet of superplastic metal. This jet is capable of penetrating thick armor and knocking out vehicles. However, a disadvantage of this arrangement is that the jet of metal loses effectiveness the further it travels, as it breaks up into disconnected particles that drift out of alignment.\n\nEFPs, on the other hand, are designed to form a more compact and cohesive metal jet, which maintains its velocity and effectiveness over a longer distance. This is achieved through the use of a specially designed liner, which is typically made of a high-strength metal such as steel or copper.\n\n## Use in Improvised Explosive Devices\n\nEFPs have been used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against armored vehicles, particularly in urban warfare scenarios. They have been employed by various groups, including insurgent organizations in Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nIn the 1980s, EFPs were used in the assassination of German banker Alfred Herrhausen, attributed to the Red Army Faction. In the 1990s, Hezbollah used EFPs in IEDs against Israeli troops. More recently, EFPs have been used by insurgents in Iraq against coalition vehicles.\n\nThe use of EFPs in IEDs has been a significant concern for military forces, as they can penetrate armor and cause significant damage. However, the effectiveness of EFPs in IEDs depends on various factors, including the design of the EFP, the explosive charge, and the target armor.\n\n## Non-Circular Explosively Formed Penetrators\n\nNon-circular explosively formed penetrators can be formed based on modifications to the liner construction. For example, U.S. patents 6606951 and 4649828 describe non-circular EFPs with unique liner designs.\n\nUS 6606951 describes an EFP designed to launch multiple asymmetric explosively forged penetrators horizontally in 360 degrees. This design allows for increased effectiveness against targets with varying armor thickness.\n\nUS 4649828 describes an EFP designed to form several clothespin-shaped EFPs, increasing the hit probability against armor. The unique liner design of this EFP allows for improved performance against targets with complex armor layouts.\n\n## Asteroid Impactor\n\nThe spacecraft Hayabusa2 carried a small carry-on impactor, which was dropped off onto an asteroid and detonated. The explosion created a copper explosively formed penetrator, which hit the asteroid with a velocity of 2 km/s.\n\nThe crater created by the impact was a target for further observations by the onboard instruments.

The D66 and CDA were seen as strong contenders, while the GL and SP were struggling to gain ground.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the election showed a significant shift in the Dutch political landscape.

{"title": "Mars_2020", "content": "\nConception\nThe Mars 2020 mission was announced by NASA on December 4, 2012, at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco [20] The selection of Mars as the target of NASA's flagship mission elicited surprise from some members of the scientific community Some criticized NASA for continuing to focus on Mars exploration instead of other Solar System destinations in constrained budget times [21] [22] Support came from California U.S Representative Adam Schiff, who said he was interested in the possibility of advancing the launch date, which would enable a larger payload [20] Science educator Bill Nye endorsed the Mars sample-return role, saying this would be \"extraordinarily fantastic and world-changing and worthy.\" [23]\n\n\nObjectives\nThe mission is aimed at seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, and also at searching for evidence—or biosignatures—of past microbial life, and water The mission was launched July 30, 2020, on an Atlas V-541, [20] and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the mission The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program [24] [25] [26] [16] The Science Definition Team proposed that the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and surface soil for a later mission to bring back for definitive analysis on Earth [27] In 2015, they expanded the concept, planning to collect even more samples and distribute the tubes in small piles or caches across the surface of Mars [28]\n\n\nSpacecraft\nThe three major components of the Mars 2020 spacecraft are the 539 kg (1,188 lb) [45] cruise stage for travel between Earth and Mars;

The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program and is centered around exploring Jezero crater, which was once home to a lake about 3.9 billion to 3.5 billion years ago.\n\n**Conception**\n\nThe Mars 2020 mission was announced by NASA on December 4, 2012, at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The selection of Mars as the target of NASA's flagship mission elicited surprise from some members of the scientific community, as some criticized NASA for continuing to focus on Mars exploration instead of other Solar System destinations in constrained budget times. However, support came from California U.S Representative Adam Schiff, who expressed interest in the possibility of advancing the launch date, which would enable a larger payload. Science educator Bill Nye also endorsed the Mars sample-return role, stating that it would be \"extraordinarily fantastic and world-changing and worthy.\"\n\n**Objectives**\n\nThe mission is aimed at seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past and searching for evidence or biosignatures of past microbial life and water. The mission was launched on July 30, 2020, on an Atlas V-541 rocket, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the mission. The Science Definition Team proposed that the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and surface soil for a later mission to bring back for definitive analysis on Earth. In 2015, they expanded the concept, planning to collect even more samples and distribute the tubes in small piles or caches across the surface of Mars.\n\n**Spacecraft**\n\nThe three major components of the Mars 2020 spacecraft are the cruise stage, the Entry, Descent, and Landing System (EDLS), and the descent stage. The cruise stage is responsible for travel between Earth and Mars, while the EDLS consists of the aeroshell and descent vehicle, which protect the rover during entry, descent, and landing (EDL). The descent stage carries the landing propellant for the final soft landing burn after being slowed down by a 21.5-meter-wide parachute. The rover, Perseverance, is based on the design of Curiosity and is equipped with a five-jointed robotic arm, a sampling and caching system, and a suite of scientific instruments.\n\n**Cruise Stage and EDLS**\n\nThe cruise stage and EDLS are critical components of the Mars 2020 spacecraft. The cruise stage is responsible for traveling between Earth and Mars, while the EDLS is responsible for protecting the rover during EDL. The EDLS consists of the aeroshell, descent vehicle, and heat shield, which are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of EDL. The descent stage carries the landing propellant for the final soft landing burn after being slowed down by a 21.5-meter-wide parachute.\n\n**Perseverance Rover**\n\nPerseverance is the rover that will explore Jezero crater and search for signs of past or present life on Mars. The rover is based on the design of Curiosity and is equipped with a five-jointed robotic arm, a sampling and caching system, and a suite of scientific instruments. Perseverance will also carry the Ingenuity helicopter, which will be the first aircraft to fly on another planet.\n\n**Ingenuity Helicopter**\n\nIngenuity is a defunct robotic coaxial helicopter that will be the first aircraft to fly on another planet. The helicopter will be carried by Perseverance and will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of rotorcraft flight on Mars.\n\n**Mission**\n\nThe mission is centered around exploring Jezero crater, which was once home to a lake about 3.9 billion to 3.5 billion years ago. The rover will search for signs of past or present life on Mars and will collect samples of rock cores and surface soil for a later mission to bring back for definitive analysis on Earth.\n\n**Launch and Cruise**\n\nThe launch window for the Mars 2020 mission opened on July 17, 2020, and lasted through August 15, 2020. The rocket was launched on July 30, 2020, at 11:50 UTC, and the rover landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, at 20:55 UTC.\n\n**Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL)**\n\nThe EDL sequence of the Mars 2020 mission was detected by InSight's seismometers, which are designed to detect the impact of objects on Mars. The EDL sequence was detected despite the fact that InSight is more than 3,400 kilometers away from the Mars landing site.\n\n**Major Mission Milestones and Works**\n\nNASA plans to expend roughly $2.8 billion on the Mars 2020 mission over 10 years. The mission is centered around exploring Jezero crater, which was once home to a lake about 3.9 billion to 3.5 billion years ago. The rover will search for signs of past or present life on Mars and will collect samples of rock cores and surface soil for a later mission to bring back for definitive analysis on Earth.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nThe Mars 2020 mission is a robotic space mission launched by NASA in July 2020, with the primary objective of searching for signs of past or present life on Mars.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and primary songwriter of the British folk-rock band Mumford & Sons.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n--------------------\n\nMumford was born on 31 January 1987 in Yorba Linda, California, to English parents, John and Eleanor (née Weir-Breen) Mumford. As a result, he has held both UK and US citizenship from birth. He has an older brother, James, who has also been involved in music. Mumford's family moved back to the UK when Marcus was six months old. He grew up on Chatsworth Avenue in Wimbledon Chase, southwest London, and was educated at King's College School in Wimbledon, where he met future band member Ben Lovett.\n\n### Education and Early Musical Influences\n\nMumford's early musical influences were shaped by his family's love of music. His parents, who were both involved in Christian music, exposed him to a wide range of genres, from folk to rock to gospel. Mumford has credited his parents with introducing him to the works of Bob Dylan, The Beatles, and other influential musicians.\n\nMumford's time at King's College School was a formative period in his musical development. He began to write his own songs and perform with his friends, including Ben Lovett. The two musicians would often play together, sharing a love of folk and bluegrass music. This early collaboration laid the foundation for the sound that would later become Mumford & Sons.\n\n### University Years and Early Career\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, Mumford attended the University of Edinburgh to study English Literature. However, he soon became disillusioned with academic life and dropped out to focus on his music career. It was during this period that he began to collaborate with Ben Lovett and other musicians, including Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane.\n\nTogether, the four musicians formed Mumford & Sons, and began to develop their unique sound, which blended elements of folk, rock, and bluegrass. The band's early years were marked by gigging in small venues and clubs, and building a loyal following among fans of folk and acoustic music.\n\nProduction Work\n----------------\n\nIn addition to his work with Mumford & Sons, Marcus Mumford has also pursued a career as a producer and songwriter. In 2014, he produced Hold Fast by Christian Letts (Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros), released in February 2015. Mumford co-wrote four tracks from the record – \"Copper Bells\", \"La Mer\", \"Emeralds\" and \"Matches\".\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nIn April 2012, Mumford married actress Carey Mulligan in Somerset. The couple had been childhood pen pals, reconnecting as adults when they worked together on the Coen brothers' film Inside Llewyn Davis. They have three children together.\n\nMumford and Mulligan's relationship has been the subject of media attention, with many praising the couple's love of music and their commitment to their family. In interviews, Mumford has spoken about the challenges of balancing his music career with family life, but has also emphasized the importance of his role as a husband and father.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Studio Albums\n\n* Sigh No More (2009) – Mumford & Sons\n* Babel (2012) – Mumford & Sons\n* Wilder Mind (2015) – Mumford & Sons\n* Delta (2018) – Mumford & Sons\n* (Sandy) Alex G (2020) – Mumford & Sons (soundtrack)\n* The Decemberists (2020) – Mumford & Sons (soundtrack)\n\n### Singles\n\n* \"Little Lion Man\" (2009) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"The Cave\" (2010) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Roll Away Your Stone\" (2010) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"I Will Wait\" (2012) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Babel\" (2012) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Whispers in the Dark\" (2013) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Fool You've Loved\" (2015) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Just Noise\" (2015) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Guiding Light\" (2018) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Woman\" (2019) – Mumford & Sons\n* \"Sigh No More\" (2020) – Mumford & Sons (live version)\n\n### As Featured Artist\n\n* \"Stay with Me\" (2014) – Sam Smith (feat.
