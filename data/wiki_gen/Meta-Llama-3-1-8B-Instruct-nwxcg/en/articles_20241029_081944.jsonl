The storm caused widespread damage and disruption in Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar, with the latter being the most severely affected.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nCyclone Batsirai was first identified as a tropical disturbance on February 2, 2022, by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. At the time, it was located about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Madagascar. The disturbance gradually intensified into a tropical depression, and on February 5, it was upgraded to a tropical cyclone by the Réunion Meteorological Service.\n\nThe cyclone continued to strengthen as it moved westward, reaching Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale on February 7. At this point, it was located about 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Mauritius. The storm's maximum sustained winds were estimated to be around 175 kilometers per hour (109 miles per hour), with gusts reaching as high as 220 kilometers per hour (137 miles per hour).\n\nAs Batsirai approached the coast of Madagascar, it began to weaken, but it still maintained Category 3 status. The storm made landfall on February 8 near the city of Mananjary, which is located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of the capital city of Antananarivo.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nThe Mauritian government took immediate action to prepare for the storm, issuing a red alert for the entire island nation. The National Disaster Risk Management Office (NDRMO) activated its emergency response plan, which included evacuating people from coastal areas and providing shelter to those in need. The government also imposed a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am to prevent people from venturing out during the storm.\n\nThe Mauritius Meteorological Services issued warnings for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, which were expected to affect the entire island. The public was advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nThe Malagasy government also took steps to prepare for the storm, declaring a state of emergency in the southeastern regions of the country. The government evacuated people from coastal areas and provided shelter to those in need. The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research closed all schools and universities in the affected regions.\n\nThe Madagascar Meteorological Service issued warnings for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, which were expected to affect the entire island. The public was advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai caused significant damage and disruption in Mauritius, particularly in the coastal areas. Strong winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread power outages, with over 90% of households losing electricity. The storm also caused significant damage to buildings, with many roofs being torn off and windows shattered.\n\nThe cyclone also caused flooding in several areas, including the capital city of Port Louis. The flooding was exacerbated by the storm surge, which caused seawater to inundate the city.\n\n### Réunion\n\nRéunion was also affected by the cyclone, with strong winds and heavy rainfall causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. The storm caused a power outage in the island's capital city, Saint-Denis, and left thousands of households without electricity.\n\n### Madagascar\n\nMadagascar was the most severely affected by Cyclone Batsirai. The storm caused widespread destruction and disruption in the southeastern regions of the country, particularly in the provinces of Atsimo-Atsinanana and Vatovavy-Fitovinany.\n\nThe cyclone caused significant damage to buildings, including homes, schools, and hospitals. The storm also caused flooding in several areas, including the city of Mananjary, which was severely affected by the storm surge.\n\nThe cyclone also caused a significant number of deaths, with reports suggesting that over 200 people lost their lives as a result of the storm. Many more people were injured, and thousands were left homeless.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Mauritius\n\nThe Mauritian government took immediate action to respond to the aftermath of the cyclone, deploying personnel and equipment to affected areas.

It involves a complex web of claims, theories, and speculation about alleged conspiracies involving high-ranking government officials, politicians, and celebrities.\n\n## Introduction\nThe QAnon conspiracy theory is a product of the internet age, born from a combination of online communities, social media, and the chaos of modern politics. It has evolved over time, incorporating various elements and adapting to changing circumstances. At its core, QAnon is a narrative about a supposed \"deep state\" or \"cabal\" that seeks to undermine the United States and its institutions. This narrative has attracted a wide range of followers, from disillusioned Trump supporters to anti-establishment activists.\n\n## Background\n\n### Pizzagate\nOne of the earliest precursors to QAnon was the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016. Pizzagate centered on the claim that Hillary Clinton and her associates were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria. This theory gained significant attention on social media and online forums, particularly on 4chan and Reddit. The Pizzagate narrative laid some of the groundwork for the more elaborate and complex claims that would later become QAnon.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n4chan, an imageboard website known for its anonymous and often provocative content, played a significant role in the development of QAnon. The website's users, known as \"anons,\" often engage in speculative and conspiratorial discussions about politics and current events. This culture of speculation and conspiracy has contributed to the spread of QAnon, as well as other similar theories.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\nQAnon is not the first conspiracy theory to emerge from the online communities of 4chan and other imageboards. Previous \"anons\" have given rise to various conspiracy theories, including the \"Paul\" conspiracy theory and the \"John Titor\" conspiracy theory. These earlier theories share some similarities with QAnon, including the use of cryptic messages and the emphasis on alleged conspiracies involving high-ranking officials.\n\n## Origin and spread\n\n### Mainstream attention\nQAnon gained significant attention in the United States in 2020, particularly after a post on 4chan's /pol/ board claimed to be from a high-ranking government official known as \"Q.\" The posts, which would become known as \"Q-drops,\" were cryptic and often cryptic, but appeared to be a call to action for followers to uncover the truth about the supposed \"cabal\" and its alleged plans to undermine the United States.\n\n### International following\nQAnon has attracted followers from around the world, particularly in Europe and Australia. The theory has been translated into various languages, including German, French, and Italian, and has gained significant traction on social media platforms.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon emerged, known as \"Pastel QAnon.\" This version of the theory emphasizes the idea that Q is a benevolent figure who is working to save humanity from the alleged cabal. Pastel QAnon has become a more mainstream and appealing version of the theory, with many followers seeing it as a more positive and uplifting narrative.\n\n## Claims\n\n### Q's posts\nQ's posts, which are often cryptic and open to interpretation, have been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some believe that Q is a single individual, while others think that Q may be a group or even a single entity. The posts often reference alleged conspiracies involving high-ranking officials, politicians, and celebrities.\n\n### The cabal and \"the Storm\"\nThe cabal, a central theme in QAnon, refers to a supposed group of high-ranking officials and politicians who allegedly seek to un", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"QAnon\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Pizzagate\n##Influence of 4chan culture\n##Previous \"anons\"\n#Origin and spread\n##Mainstream attention\n##International following\n##Pastel QAnon\n#Claims\n##Q's posts\n##The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n##Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n##Other QAnon beliefs\n#Analysis\n##Identity of Q\n###Multiple people\n###Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n##Slogans and vocabulary\n##Derivative elements\n###Christian themes\n###Antisemitism\n##Appeal\n###Disillusionment\n##Demographics\n#Incidents\n##Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n##German coup attempt\n#Reactions\n##Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n##Official responses\n###FBI domestic terrorism assessment\n###Congressional resolution\n##Republican politicians and organizations\n##Connected individuals\n###Donald Trump\n###Mike Pence\n###Michael Flynn\n###Lin Wood\n###Sidney Powell\n###Kelly Townsend\n###Liz Harris\n#Online\n##QDrops app\n##Anti-QAnon subreddits\n##Removal of content\n##Migration to alt-tech\n##Return to Twitter/X\n#See also\n#Further reading\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Thomas's early career was marked by his advocacy for conservative principles, including limited government intervention in the economy and individual liberties.\n\n**District of Columbia Court of Appeals**\n\nIn 1981, Thomas was appointed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where he served for 10 years. During his time on the court, Thomas became known for his conservative opinions, which often conflicted with those of his liberal colleagues.\n\n**Nomination to the Supreme Court**\n\nIn 1990, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. The nomination was met with intense scrutiny, particularly in light of Thomas's conservative views and his relatively short time on the bench.\n\n**Anita Hill Accusations**\n\nDuring the confirmation hearings, Thomas's former colleague, Anita Hill, accused him of making unwanted advances and using pornographic language. Thomas denied the allegations, and the Senate ultimately voted to confirm him by a margin of 52-48.\n\n### Second Hearing\n\nIn the aftermath of the initial charges, the Senate voted to hold a second hearing to investigate the allegations. Thomas again denied the charges, and the Senate ultimately voted to confirm him.\n\n## Senate Votes\n\nThe Senate voted to confirm Thomas on October 15, 1991, by a margin of 52-48. The vote was largely along party lines, with Democrats opposing Thomas's nomination.\n\n**Supreme Court of the United States**\n\nThomas took office on October 23, 1991, as the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court. Since his appointment, he has been a key vote in many significant decisions, often siding with the Court's conservative majority.\n\n### Government Powers and Legal Structure\n\nThomas has written extensively on the doctrine of judicial restraint, which holds that the judiciary should generally defer to the other branches of government. He has also been a strong advocate for limited government and individual liberties.\n\n### Court Precedent\n\nThomas has been a critic of the Court's use of precedent, which he believes can lead to judicial activism. He has argued that the Court should instead focus on interpreting the Constitution as written.\n\n### Executive Power\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for executive power, particularly in the areas of foreign policy and national security. He has argued that the executive branch has significant discretion in these areas.\n\n### Federalism and States' Rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights, arguing that the federal government should generally defer to state and local authority.\n\n### Individual Rights\n\n#### First Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the First Amendment, arguing that it should be interpreted broadly to protect individual freedoms.\n\n#### Second Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment, arguing that it guarantees an individual's right to bear arms.\n\n#### Fourth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Fourth Amendment, arguing that it protects individual privacy and limits government surveillance.\n\n#### Sixth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Sixth Amendment, arguing that it guarantees the right to a fair trial.\n\n#### Eighth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Eighth Amendment, arguing that it prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n#### Fourteenth Amendment\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for the Fourteenth Amendment, arguing that it guarantees equal protection under the law.\n\n### Abortion and Family Planning\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for anti-abortion policies, arguing that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to abortion.\n\n### LGBTQ Rights\n\nThomas has been a strong critic of LGBTQ rights, arguing that the Constitution does not guarantee equal protection for LGBTQ individuals.\n\n## Oral Arguments\n\nThomas has written extensively on the importance of oral arguments, arguing that they provide a crucial opportunity for the Court to explore the implications of a case.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nThomas is married to Virginia Lamp Thomas, a former lobbyist for the Monsanto Company. The couple has no children.\n\n### Family\n\nThomas's family has been the subject of some controversy, particularly in light of his wife's lobbying activities.\n\n### Religion\n\nThomas is a devout Catholic and has been open about the influence of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\n### Literary Influences\n\nThomas has been influenced by a range of literary figures, including Friedrich Hayek and Robert Bork.\n\n### Moira Smith Allegations\n\nIn 2007, Moira Smith, a former law clerk, accused Thomas of making unwanted advances and using pornographic language. Thomas denied the allegations.\n\n### Nondisclosure of Finances\n\nThomas has been criticized for his nondisclosure of finances, which some have argued is a breach of judicial ethics.\n\n**Honors and Recognition**\n\nThomas has received a range of honors and recognition for his service on the Court, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThomas has been the subject of a range of popular culture references, including a book by Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter and a documentary by filmmaker Ken Burns.\n\n**Writings**\n\nThomas has written extensively on a range of topics, including judicial philosophy and constitutional interpretation.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States**\n* **Supreme Court of the United States**\n* **Judicial philosophy**\n* **Constitutional interpretation**\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* **Biographical information**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Clarence_Thomas\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n#Early legal career\n#District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n##Anita Hill accusations\n###Second hearing\n##Senate votes\n#Supreme Court of the United States\n##Government powers and legal structure\n###Court precedent\n###Executive power\n###Federalism and states' rights\n##Individual rights\n###First Amendment\n###Second Amendment\n###Fourth Amendment\n###Sixth Amendment\n###Eighth Amendment\n###Fourteenth Amendment\n###Abortion and family planning\n###LGBTQ rights\n##Oral arguments\n#Personal life\n##Family\n##Religion\n##Literary influences\n##Moira Smith allegations\n##Nondisclosure of finances\n#Honors and recognition\n#In popular culture\n#Writings\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Biographical\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She rose to fame in the 1970s with her unique blend of pop, country, and folk music, and became one of the most successful and enduring artists of her generation.\n\n**Early Life and Family**\n\nNewton-John was born to Brinley Newton-John, a British medical professor, and Irene Born, a Welsh mother who had emigrated to New Zealand. When Olivia was five years old, her family moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she grew up in a close-knit family. She had an older brother, Hugh, and a younger sister, Rona. Newton-John's early life was marked by her love of music, dance, and performing, and she was exposed to a wide range of musical styles and influences.\n\n**Career**\n\nNewton-John's music career began in the late 1960s, but it was her early 1970s albums that brought her international recognition. Her unique voice and style, which blended elements of pop, country, and folk, set her apart from other artists of the time.\n\n**Career Beginnings**\n\nNewton-John's music career began in the late 1960s, when she sang in a folk band called Sol Four. She later moved to the United Kingdom and became a member of the band Toomorrow, which was formed to capitalize on the popularity of her solo work. Newton-John's solo debut album, _If Not for You_, was released in 1971 and was moderately successful.\n\n**1971–1974: Early Success**\n\nNewton-John's breakthrough came with her 1972 album _Olivia_, which included the hit singles \"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\" and \"Banks of the Ohio\". This album marked the beginning of her successful partnership with producer Bruce Welch, who would work with her on many of her subsequent albums. The success of _Olivia_ led to Newton-John's first headlining tour in the United States, which was met with critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n**1975–1977: Have You Never Been Mellow, Clearly Love, and Continued Success**\n\nNewton-John's 1975 album _Have You Never Been Mellow_ was a huge commercial success, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Have You Never Been Mellow\" and \"Every Face Tells a Story\". This album cemented Newton-John's status as a global superstar and marked the beginning of her long-term partnership with songwriter and producer John Farrar.\n\nNewton-John's 1976 album _Clearly Love_ was another huge success, selling over 5 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"You're the One Love\" and \"Every Face Tells a Story\". This album marked a new direction in Newton-John's music, with a greater emphasis on soul and funk influences.\n\n**1978–1979: Grease and Totally Hot**\n\nNewton-John's 1978 album _Totally Hot_ was a commercial success, but was also marked by controversy. Newton-John had been cast in the film adaptation of the musical _Grease_, which was a major box office success and cemented her status as a global superstar. The album _Totally Hot_ was released in conjunction with the film and included the hit single \"Totally Hot\".\n\nNewton-John's performance in _Grease_ earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and the film's soundtrack was a huge commercial success, selling over 20 million copies worldwide. Newton-John's rendition of the song \"You're the One That I Want\" with John Travolta became one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\n**Lawsuit Against MCA Records**\n\nIn the late 1970s, Newton-John became embroiled in a highly publicized lawsuit with her record label, MCA Records. Newton-John claimed that MCA had cheated her out of millions of dollars in royalties and had unfairly controlled her career. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but it marked a turning point in Newton-John's career, as she began to take more control over her music and finances.\n\n**1980–1988: Physical, Soul Kiss, and The Rumour**\n\nNewton-John's 1981 album _Physical_ was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Physical\" and \"Make It Last Forever\". This album marked a new direction in Newton-John's music, with a greater emphasis on dance and electronic influences.\n\nNewton-John's 1983 album _Soul Kiss_ was a moderate success, selling over 2 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Soul Kiss\" and \"Twist of Fate\". This album marked a new direction in Newton-John's music, with a greater emphasis on rock and new wave influences.\n\nNewton-John's 1985 album _The Rumour_ was a moderate success, selling over 1 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Here and Now\" and \"Can't Stop Dancing\". This album marked a new direction in Newton-John's music, with a greater emphasis on pop and R&B influences.\n\n**1989–1998: Motherhood, Cancer, and Advocacy**\n\nIn the late 1980s, Newton-John became a mother when her daughter, Chloe Lattanzi, was born.

As it moved eastward, it merged with a cold front that had been stalled over the Great Plains, resulting in a powerful winter storm system. The storm brought heavy snowfall, strong winds, and freezing temperatures to areas across the central and eastern United States, as well as parts of Canada.\n\n## Development and intensification\n\nThe storm's intensification was fueled by the combination of cold air from the Arctic and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm moved eastward, it tapped into a pool of cold air that had been building over the Canadian Prairies, resulting in a significant drop in temperature and an increase in snowfall rates.\n\n## Peak intensity\n\nAt its peak, the storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of the Midwest and Northeast, with sustained winds of up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour (5 cm/h). The storm's central pressure dropped to around 970 mbar (28.64 inHg), indicating a strong and intense low-pressure system.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs the storm's track became clear, authorities and emergency management officials began to prepare for the worst. Snowplows and salt trucks were deployed throughout the region, and emergency responders were placed on standby.\n\n## Governments and emergency services\n\nGovernments at the local, state, and federal levels issued declarations of emergency and activated their emergency operations centers. Emergency management officials warned residents to prepare for power outages, flight cancellations, and road closures.\n\n## Public preparedness\n\nResidents were advised to stock up on food, water, and medications, and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. Many schools and businesses closed early or cancelled events in anticipation of the storm.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe storm brought significant disruptions to communities across the region, with widespread power outages, flight cancellations, and road closures.\n\n## Deaths\n\nAt least 20 people lost their lives due to the storm, with most deaths attributed to hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and traffic accidents.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n### Flight delays and cancellations\n\nOver 5,000 flights were delayed or cancelled due to the storm, with many airports experiencing delays of up to 24 hours.\n\n### Road closures and crashes\n\nThousands of roads were closed due to snow and ice, with many major highways and interstates experiencing significant delays. At least 100 vehicles were involved in accidents, resulting in multiple fatalities.\n\n### Intra-city transit disruptions\n\nPublic transportation systems in many cities were severely disrupted, with many buses and trains suspended or delayed.\n\n### Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n\nMajor rail lines were affected, with many trains delayed or cancelled due to the storm.\n\n### Energy emergencies\n\nOver 1 million households lost power due to the storm, with many areas experiencing extended outages.\n\n### Power outages\n\nThe storm caused widespread power outages, with many areas experiencing extended outages.\n\n## Sports\n\nMany sporting events were cancelled or postponed due to the storm, including several NFL and college football games.\n\n## Corporate and institutional closures\n\nMany businesses and institutions closed early or cancelled events due to the storm, including schools, universities, and government offices.\n\n## Animals\n\nThe storm caused significant disruptions to animal populations, with many animals seeking shelter and food in response to the harsh weather conditions.\n\n# Post-storm cold wave\n\nThe storm was followed by a prolonged cold wave that affected the region, with temperatures dropping to record lows in some areas.\n\n## Rocky Mountain region\n\nThe Rocky Mountain region experienced some of the coldest temperatures, with lows of -40°F (-40°C) reported in several areas.\n\n## Central United States\n\nThe central United States experienced a prolonged period of cold weather, with temperatures remaining below freezing for several days.\n\n## Eastern United States\n\nThe eastern United States experienced a less severe cold wave, but still experienced significant disruptions and damage due to the storm.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of North American winter storms\n* List of notable winter storms in the United States\n* List of blizzards in the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the December 2022 North American winter storm, which affected a large portion of the North American continent.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_North_American_winter_storm\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Deaths\n##Infrastructure\n###Flight delays and cancellations\n###Road closures and crashes\n###Intra-city transit disruptions\n###Inter-city train delays and cancellations\n###Energy emergencies\n###Power outages\n##Sports\n##Corporate and institutional closures\n##Animals\n#Post-storm cold wave\n##Rocky Mountain region\n##Central United States\n##Eastern United States\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The bank was founded in 1983 in Santa Clara, California, and has since grown to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with a presence in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Los Angeles.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank has a long history of providing financial services to the technology and life science industries, with a focus on supporting the growth and development of innovative companies. The bank's commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship has made it a go-to financial institution for many technology and life science companies, and its expertise in providing capital markets, cash management, and banking services has earned it a reputation as a trusted partner for companies in these industries.\n\n**Foundation and Early Growth**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Roger B. Smith, a former executive at IBM, and Robert H. Fox, a seasoned banking executive. The bank's mission was to provide financial services to the growing number of technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area, many of which were struggling to secure traditional banking services. In its early years, the bank focused on providing basic banking services, such as checking and savings accounts, to technology companies, as well as providing them with access to capital through loans and lines of credit.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Silicon Valley Bank began to expand its services to include cash management and treasury services, which allowed technology companies to manage their cash flows and make payments more efficiently. The bank also established a network of correspondent banks, which allowed it to provide banking services to technology companies in other parts of the United States.\n\n**Expansion**\n\nIn the 1990s, Silicon Valley Bank began to expand its services to include capital markets and investment banking. The bank established a team of investment bankers who worked with technology companies to raise capital through initial public offerings (IPOs) and private placements. The bank also established a team of capital markets professionals who worked with technology companies to raise debt capital through bond offerings and loan facilities.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Silicon Valley Bank began to expand its services to include private equity and venture capital clients. The bank established a team of private equity and venture capital professionals who worked with clients to raise capital and provide strategic advice. The bank also established a network of relationships with private equity and venture capital firms, which allowed it to provide its clients with access to capital and strategic advice.\n\n**Operations in Lead-up to Collapse**\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, Silicon Valley Bank's business model was focused on providing financial services to technology, life science, private equity, and venture capital clients. The bank's business model was based on a combination of fee-based services and interest income from loans and investments.\n\n### Business Model\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's business model was based on a combination of fee-based services and interest income from loans and investments. The bank provided a range of fee-based services, including capital markets, cash management, and banking services, to its clients. The bank also generated interest income from loans and investments, including loans to technology companies, investments in venture capital and private equity funds, and investments in the securities market.\n\n### Facilities\n\nSilicon Valley Bank had a network of facilities located throughout the United States, including its headquarters in Santa Clara, California, as well as offices in San Francisco, New York City, and Los Angeles. The bank's facilities included a data center, which housed its core banking system, as well as a team of IT professionals who supported the bank's technology infrastructure.\n\n### Affiliations and Community Involvement\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a member of the Federal Reserve System and the American Bankers Association. The bank was also a sponsor of several industry conferences and events, including the annual NVCA Venture Summit. The bank was also a supporter of several community organizations, including the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program, which provided financial assistance to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank announced that it had experienced a significant loss on the sale of its investment portfolio, resulting in a net loss of $1.8 billion. The bank's stock price plummeted, and investors began to withdraw their deposits, which further exacerbated the bank's financial difficulties. On March 12, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took control of Silicon Valley Bank, and the bank was subsequently shut down by the FDIC.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank led to a significant loss of deposits and a disruption to the financial services provided to its clients. The bank's failure also led to a loss of confidence in the financial markets, and investors began to question the stability of other financial institutions.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank also led to calls for increased regulation of the financial industry, including stricter capital requirements and more robust oversight of financial institutions. The incident highlighted the need for financial institutions to maintain strong risk management practices and to be prepared for unexpected events.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank also had a significant impact on the technology and life science industries, which had come to rely on the bank for financial services. Many companies were forced to seek alternative financial institutions, and some were forced to seek additional capital to replace the funds that had been lost in the collapse.\n\n**References**\n\nSee also:\n\n* \"Silicon Valley Bank: A History\" by Robert H.

Breathing apparatuses are used in a wide range of applications, including underwater diving, industrial settings, and medical procedures.\n\n**Definition and Scope**\n\nBreathing apparatuses can be broadly classified into two categories: breathing gas source and breathing gas regulator.\n\n### Breathing Gas Source\n\nThe breathing gas source is the component of the breathing apparatus that provides the air or gas that the user breathes. This can be a tank of compressed air, a cylinder of oxygen, or a device that generates oxygen from the air.\n\n### Breathing Gas Regulator\n\nThe breathing gas regulator is the component of the breathing apparatus that controls the flow of gas from the source to the user. This can be a simple valve, a pressure regulator, or a complex system of valves and sensors.\n\n**Breathing Circuit Type**\n\nBreathing apparatuses can be classified into several different types based on the type of breathing circuit used.\n\n### Constant Flow\n\nConstant flow breathing apparatuses deliver a constant flow of gas to the user, regardless of the user's breathing rate. These apparatuses are often used in industrial settings, such as in mines or factories.\n\n### Demand\n\nDemand breathing apparatuses deliver a flow of gas that is proportional to the user's breathing rate. These apparatuses are often used in diving and medical applications, where the user needs to be able to breathe easily and naturally.\n\n### Open Circuit\n\nOpen circuit breathing apparatuses release the exhaled gas into the atmosphere, rather than reusing it. These apparatuses are often used in industrial settings, such as in mines or factories.\n\n### Enriched Gas\n\nEnriched gas breathing apparatuses deliver a mixture of gases that is enriched with oxygen, rather than pure oxygen. These apparatuses are often used in medical applications, such as in anesthesia or oxygen therapy.\n\n### Closed and Semi-Closed Circuit\n\nClosed and semi-closed circuit breathing apparatuses reuse the exhaled gas, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere.

These colonies were founded by Greeks who were drawn to the African continent by the wealth and trade opportunities it offered, as well as by the desire for new lands to conquer and settle.\n\n**Ancient Egypt**\n\nAncient Egypt was one of the earliest destinations of Greek colonization in Africa. The first historical colonies in Egypt date back to the 7th century BC, when Greeks from the city-state of Naucratis established a settlement on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. This settlement was strategically located near the entrance to the Nile River delta, making it an ideal hub for trade and commerce.\n\n### **First Historical Colonies**\n\nThe first Greek colonies in Egypt were established in the 7th century BC, during the 26th dynasty of Ancient Egypt. The Greeks were attracted to Egypt by the wealth and trade opportunities it offered, as well as by the desire for new lands to conquer and settle. The most famous of these early colonies was the city of Naucratis, which was founded by the Greeks from the city-state of Naucratis in the delta region of Egypt.\n\nNaucratis was a significant commercial center and a major hub for trade between Egypt and the Mediterranean world. The city was home to a large Greek community, and its inhabitants were known for their wealth, culture, and commerce. The city's strategic location made it an important center for the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between Egypt and the Mediterranean world.\n\n### **Hellenistic Times**\n\nThe period of Hellenistic rule in Egypt, following the conquest of the country by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, saw the establishment of a series of Greek colonies and cities throughout the country. The most significant of these was the city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great himself and established as the capital of the Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\n### **Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)**\n\nAlexander the Great's conquest of Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of a new era of Greek dominance in the country. Alexander's army was comprised of Macedonian and Greek soldiers, and the king himself was known for his admiration of Greek culture and learning. During his brief reign in Egypt, Alexander founded several Greek cities, including Alexandria, which would go on to become one of the most important cultural and intellectual centers of the ancient world.\n\n### **The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)**\n\nFollowing Alexander's death in 323 BC, his general Ptolemy I Soter established the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, which would rule the country for the next three centuries. The Ptolemies were Macedonian Greeks who were known for their patronage of the arts and sciences, as well as their extensive trade and diplomatic networks throughout the Mediterranean world.\n\nDuring the Ptolemaic period, Alexandria became a major hub for Greek culture and learning, attracting scholars, philosophers, and intellectuals from all over the Mediterranean world. The city was home to the famous Library of Alexandria, which was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world.\n\n### **Roman and Byzantine Egypt**\n\nIn 30 BC, the Roman Empire conquered Egypt, marking the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the beginning of Roman rule in the country. During the Roman period, Egypt continued to be an important center for Greek culture and learning, with the city of Alexandria remaining a major hub for trade, commerce, and intellectual activity.\n\n### **Coptic Greeks**\n\nThe Coptic Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods. They were known for their unique blend of Greek and Egyptian cultures, and their distinctive dialect of Greek, known as Coptic. The Coptic Greeks were an important part of the cultural and intellectual life of Egypt, and their legacy can still be seen in the many churches, monasteries, and other buildings that they constructed throughout the country.\n\n**Ancient Ethiopia**\n\nEthiopia was another important destination of Greek colonization in Africa. The Axumites, who ruled Ethiopia from the 1st century AD, were known for their extensive trade and diplomatic networks throughout the Mediterranean world.\n\n### **Axumites of Ethiopia**\n\nThe Axumites were a powerful and influential kingdom that ruled Ethiopia from the 1st century AD. They were known for their extensive trade and diplomatic networks throughout the Mediterranean world, and their capital city, Axum, was a major center for commerce and culture.\n\n### **Abyssinian Greeks**\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Ethiopia during the Axumite period. They were known for their unique blend of Greek and Ethiopian cultures, and their distinctive dialect of Greek, known as Abyssinian Greek.\n\n**Ancient Libya**\n\nLibya was another important destination of Greek colonization in Africa.

They were known for their unique blend of Greek and Berber cultures, and their distinctive dialect of Greek, which was influenced by the indigenous Berber language.\n\n### **Libyan Greek Culture**\n\nThe Libyan Greeks were known for their distinctive culture, which was influenced by the indigenous Berber language and culture. They were skilled craftsmen and traders, and their cities were major centers for commerce and culture.\n\n**Ancient Nubia**\n\nNubia was a region in northeastern Africa that was known for its powerful kingdoms and extensive trade networks. The Nubians were a distinct ethnic group that was influenced by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks.\n\n### **Axumite Subjugation of Nubia**\n\nThe Axumites conquered Nubia in the 5th century AD, marking the beginning of a new era of Axumite dominance in the region.

The film is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and Mattel Films, and stars Margot Robbie as the titular character. The movie is a comedy that satirizes societal norms and expectations, particularly those placed on women.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie), a perfect and idealized doll who lives in a world where everything is perfect and beautiful. However, she begins to question her existence and the world around her when she is expelled from her perfect town for being \"imperfect.\" Barbie then travels to the real world, where she experiences new things and meets new people, including a woman named Gloria (Ruth Negga) who becomes her friend and confidant.\n\nAs Barbie navigates the real world, she begins to realize that she has been living in a fantasy world and that the real world is not as perfect as she thought it was. She also meets a man named Ken (Ryan Gosling), who is initially portrayed as a sexist and shallow character but later becomes a more nuanced and empathetic person.\n\nThroughout the film, Barbie challenges societal norms and expectations, particularly those placed on women. She also explores themes of identity, self-discovery, and the constraints placed on women by societal expectations.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a star-studded cast, including:\n\n* Margot Robbie as Barbie\n* Ryan Gosling as Ken\n* Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel\n* Kate McKinnon as a scientist\n* America Ferrera as a mother\n* Simu Liu as a video game character\n* Issa Rae as a news anchor\n* Alexandra Shipp as a friend of Barbie's\n* Ritu Arya as a woman who helps Barbie\n* Jamie Demetriou as a man who helps Ken\n* Marisa Abela as a young woman\n* Dua Lipa as a singer\n* Rina Sawayama as a singer\n* Ariana Greenblatt as a young Barbie\n* Sharon Rooney as a woman who helps Barbie\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with Greta Gerwig set to direct and write the screenplay. The project was initially developed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Mattel Films, with Robbie producing through her production company, LuckyChap Entertainment.\n\n## Writing\n\nGerwig and Baumbach wrote the screenplay, which was heavily influenced by Gerwig's own experiences as a woman and her observations of societal norms and expectations. The script was also influenced by the classic fairy tale \"The Ugly Duckling,\" which tells the story of a character who is rejected by society but ultimately finds acceptance.\n\n## Casting\n\nRobbie was cast as Barbie in 2019, and Gosling was cast as Ken in 2020. The rest of the cast was assembled over the next few years, with many actors and actresses playing themselves or portraying characters that are loosely based on themselves.\n\n## Set design\n\nThe film was shot on location in various parts of the world, including California, New York, and London. The sets were designed to be visually stunning and to reflect the fantasy world of Barbie. The production team used a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the sets and characters.\n\n## Costumes, hair, and makeup\n\nThe costumes, hair, and makeup for the film were designed to be visually striking and to reflect the characters' personalities and traits. The costume designer, Jacqueline Durran, worked closely with Gerwig and the cast to create costumes that were both authentic and visually stunning.\n\n## Filming\n\nFilming took place over several months, with a cast and crew of over 100 people. The film was shot using a combination of digital and film cameras, and the production team used a range of techniques to create the film's visual effects.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production took place over several months, with the film's editors, sound designers, and visual effects artists working tirelessly to create the final product. The film's score was composed by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack features a range of popular and contemporary artists, including Dua Lipa, Rina Sawayama, and Ariana Grande. The soundtrack was released in 2023 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was extensive and included a range of promotional materials, including posters, trailers, and social media ads. The campaign was designed to appeal to a wide range of audiences, including fans of the Barbie franchise and newcomers to the series.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nThe film was released in theaters in July 2023 and was a commercial success, grossing over $1 billion at the box office.\n\n## \"Barbenheimer\"\n\nThe film's release coincided with the release of another highly anticipated film, Oppenheimer, which was directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Cillian Murphy. The two films were released on the same day and were billed as the \"Barbenheimer\" weekend, in reference to the two films' highly anticipated releases.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media in September 2023 and was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies in its first week of release.\n\n## Censorship\n\n### Nine-dash line controversy\n\nThe film's depiction of a map of the world that includes the nine-dash line, which is a disputed maritime boundary claimed by China, was met with controversy in some countries. In Vietnam, the film was banned due to its perceived criticism of China's territorial claims.\n\n### Vietnam\n\nThe film was banned in Vietnam due to its perceived criticism of China's territorial claims. The ban was met with criticism from some Vietnamese citizens, who argued that the film was not critical of China and that the ban was an overreaction.\n\n### The Philippines\n\nThe film's depiction of a map of the world that includes the nine-dash line was also met with controversy in the Philippines. Some Filipinos argued that the film was critical of China's territorial claims and that it was an insult to the country's sovereignty.\n\n### World map drawing and Warner Bros.' statement\n\nIn response to the controversy, Warner Bros. released a statement saying that the film was not intended to be critical of China's territorial claims and that the depiction of the nine-dash line was simply a reference to a historical map. The statement was met with skepticism by some critics, who argued that the film's depiction of the nine-dash line was intentional and that it was a commentary on China's territorial claims.\n\n### Religious interpretation and LGBTQ+ themes\n\nThe film's themes of identity and self-discovery were met with controversy in some countries, particularly in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n### Pakistan\n\nThe film's depiction of a same-sex relationship was met with controversy in Pakistan, where same-sex relationships are illegal. Some Pakistanis argued that the film was promoting a \"Western\" agenda and that it was an insult to Islamic values.\n\n### Middle East\n\nThe film's themes of identity and self-discovery were also met with controversy in some Middle Eastern countries, where they were seen as a challenge to traditional values.\n\n### Algeria\n\nThe film's depiction of a same-sex relationship was also met with controversy in Algeria, where same-sex relationships are illegal.

This provision was designed to ensure that judges are not beholden to the whims of the electorate and can make decisions without fear of reprisal. However, it also means that federal judges can serve for many years, potentially leading to a situation where a judge dies while still in active service. When this occurs, the consequences can be significant, as a vacancy on the federal bench must be filled by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\n**Political consequences**\n\nThe deaths of federal judges in active service can have significant political consequences, particularly if the vacancy occurs during a time of great controversy or partisanship. In such cases, the President and the Senate may engage in a high-stakes battle over the nomination and confirmation of a replacement judge. This can reflect the broader political divisions in the country and can have implications for the balance of power on the federal bench.\n\nFor example, the death of Judge Antonin Scalia in 2016 led to a highly partisan battle over the nomination and confirmation of his replacement. The Republican-led Senate refused to hold a hearing or vote on President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, citing the upcoming presidential election. This decision was seen as a partisan power play and reflected the deep divisions in the country at the time.\n\n**Logistical consequences**\n\nIn addition to the political consequences, the deaths of federal judges in active service can also have significant logistical consequences. When a vacancy occurs, the court must find a way to continue hearing cases and managing its workload. This can be a challenge, particularly if the judge's death occurs suddenly or without warning.\n\nIn some cases, the court may rely on senior judges or visiting judges to help manage the workload. However, this can be a temporary solution at best, and the court may still face significant challenges in managing its caseload.\n\n**Lists**\n\nThe following lists provide a comprehensive overview of the deaths of federal judges in active service:\n\n### 1789–1869\n\nDuring this period, there were several notable deaths of federal judges in active service, including:\n\n* Oliver Ellsworth (1796–1800): Ellsworth was the third Chief Justice of the United States and died in office in 1800.\n* John Jay (1795–1796): Jay was the first Chief Justice of the United States and died in office in 1796.\n* William Paterson (1831–1836): Paterson was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1836.\n* Joseph Story (1812–1845): Story was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1845.\n\n### 1870–1919\n\nDuring this period, there were several notable deaths of federal judges in active service, including:\n\n* Stephen J.

Day (1903–1922): Day was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1922.\n\n### 1920–1954\n\nDuring this period, there were several notable deaths of federal judges in active service, including:\n\n* James Clark McReynolds (1914–1925): McReynolds was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1925.\n* Harlan F. Stone (1925–1946): Stone was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1946.\n* Owen Josephus Roberts (1930–1945): Roberts was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1945.\n* Felix Frankfurter (1939–1962): Frankfurter was an associate justice of the Supreme Court and died in office in 1962.\n\n### 1954–present\n\nDuring this period, there have been several notable deaths of federal judges in active service, including:\n\n* William O.

These standards have evolved over the years, with new resolutions emerging to accommodate the growing demands of high-definition (HD) and ultra-high-definition (UHD) content.\n\n**Overview**\n\nDisplay resolution standards are essential for ensuring that images are displayed correctly and in a manner that is pleasing to the viewer. The resolution of a display is typically measured in pixels, with higher resolutions resulting in more detailed and sharper images. The aspect ratio of a display, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the image, is also an important consideration, as it can affect the way the image is displayed on different devices.\n\n**Aspect Ratio**\n\nAspect ratios are crucial in determining how images are displayed on different devices. A 4:3 aspect ratio, for example, is commonly used in older televisions and computer monitors, while a 16:9 aspect ratio is more commonly used in modern TVs and computer monitors.

It is considered one of the most iconic and historic steam locomotives in the United States.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a significant example of the locomotive technology of the mid-20th century, showcasing the power and efficiency of steam locomotives during the prime of their use. With its distinctive 4-8-4 wheel arrangement and 2,286-gallon tender, the 611 was a powerful and versatile machine that played a crucial role in the transportation of goods and people across the eastern United States.\n\n**Design and Abilities**\n\nThe 611 was designed with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement, featuring four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. This arrangement provided a high degree of stability and traction, allowing the locomotive to pull heavy loads at high speeds. The 611 was also equipped with a 2,286-gallon tender, which provided a long range and allowed the locomotive to operate for extended periods without refueling.\n\nThe 611 was powered by a 55 x 26 inch cylinder steam engine, which produced 4,600 horsepower at 65 mph. It had a total weight of 364,000 pounds and a maximum speed of 80 mph. The locomotive was also equipped with a modern air braking system, which allowed for safe operation on steep grades and heavy loads.\n\n**History**\n\nThe 611 was built in 1950 by the Norfolk and Western Railway's Roanoke shops, and it entered service on August 28, 1950. It was initially assigned to the Roanoke Shops yard, where it was used for light duty and testing.\n\n### Revenue Service\n\nThe 611 entered revenue service in 1951, where it was used on the Norfolk and Western Railway's main line from Roanoke to Washington, D.C. It quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and powerful locomotive, and it was often used for high-priority freight and passenger trains.\n\nDuring its revenue service, the 611 was also used for special excursions and fan trips, where it was often paired with other historic locomotives. These excursions allowed the public to experience the thrill of riding behind a historic steam locomotive, and they helped to generate interest and excitement for the Norfolk and Western Railway.\n\n### First Retirement\n\nThe 611 was retired from service in 1959, when it was replaced by more modern diesel-electric locomotives. It was placed in storage at the Roanoke Shops yard, where it remained for several years.\n\n### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1971, the 611 was restored to operational condition and began its first mainline excursion service. It was operated by the Norfolk and Western Railway, and it ran on a series of special excursions and fan trips across the eastern United States.\n\nThe 611 quickly became a popular attraction, with thousands of people attending its excursions and events. It was often paired with other historic locomotives, and it helped to generate interest and excitement for the Norfolk and Western Railway.\n\n### Second Retirement\n\nThe 611 was retired from service again in 1979, when it was placed in storage at the Norfolk Southern Railway's Roanoke Shops yard. It remained in storage for several years, where it was used as a static display and a museum piece.\n\n### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1982, the 611 was restored to operational condition and began its second mainline excursion service. It was operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, and it ran on a series of special excursions and fan trips across the eastern United States.\n\nThe 611 continued to be a popular attraction, with thousands of people attending its excursions and events. It was often paired with other historic locomotives, and it helped to generate interest and excitement for the Norfolk Southern Railway.\n\n### Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nIn 2014, the 611 was sold to the Virginia Museum of Transportation, where it was placed on display. The museum began operating the 611 on a series of excursion services, which have been highly successful and well-received by the public.\n\n**Accidents and Incidents**\n\nThe 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents during its operational history. In 1955, it was involved in a collision with a freight train, which caused significant damage to the locomotive. In 1971, it was involved in a derailment, which caused minor damage to the locomotive.\n\nIn 1982, the 611 was involved in a collision with a passenger train, which caused significant damage to the locomotive. However, it was quickly repaired and returned to service.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nThe 611 has been featured in several films and television shows, including \"The Age of Steam\" and \"The Railway Series\". It has also been featured in several books and documentaries, including \"The Norfolk and Western Railway\" and \"The Steam Locomotive\".\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J steam locomotive\n* Steam locomotive\n* Railroad museum\n* Vintage locomotive\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The 611 is considered one of the most historic and iconic steam locomotives in the United States.\n* It is a significant example of the locomotive technology of the mid-20th century.\n* The 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents during its operational history.\n* It has been featured in several films and television shows, and has been the subject of several books and documentaries.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Norfolk_and_Western_611\" following this outline:\n\n#Design and abilities\n#History\n##Revenue service\n##First retirement\n##First mainline excursion service\n##Second retirement\n##Second mainline excursion service\n##Post-NS excursion service\n#Accidents and incidents\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
