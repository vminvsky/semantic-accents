The case has been pursued by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, led by District Attorney Alvin Bragg, and has drawn widespread media attention and public interest.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal**\n\nThe prosecution of Donald Trump in New York has its roots in the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal, which emerged in 2018. Stormy Daniels, a adult film actress, filed a lawsuit against Trump, claiming that he had an affair with her in 2006 and had paid her $130,000 to keep the encounter private. The payment was made through a shell company set up by Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Cohen later pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges related to the payment, and Trump denied the allegations.\n\n### **Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury**\n\nIn 2021, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office launched an investigation into Trump's business dealings, including his role in the Stormy Daniels scandal. The investigation was led by District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and involved a grand jury. In August 2021, the grand jury subpoenaed Trump's tax returns and other financial records, which Trump's lawyers attempted to block.\n\n### **Eligibility for president**\n\nThe investigation also raised questions about Trump's eligibility to serve as president, particularly in light of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits public officials from receiving payments from foreign governments. The investigation found that Trump had received payments from foreign governments through his business dealings, which could potentially disqualify him from holding public office.\n\n**Initial proceedings**\n\n### **Indictment and charges**\n\nOn March 30, 2023, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office announced that Trump had been indicted on 34 counts of various crimes, including tax evasion, conspiracy, and falsifying business records. The indictment alleged that Trump had used his business dealings to enrich himself and conceal his true income from the government.\n\n### **Arraignment**\n\nTrump was arraigned on May 24, 2023, and pleaded not guilty to all charges. His lawyers argued that the indictment was a \"witch hunt\" and that Trump had done nothing wrong.\n\n**Pre-trial proceedings**\n\n### **Request for indictment dismissal**\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it was based on flawed evidence and that the prosecution had failed to prove its case. The motion was denied by the court.\n\n### **Discovery materials and witnesses**\n\nThe prosecution and defense teams have been exchanging discovery materials and witness lists in preparation for trial. The prosecution has identified several key witnesses, including Cohen, who has agreed to testify against Trump.\n\n### **Requests for recusal**\n\nTrump's lawyers have requested that the judge recuse himself from the case, citing conflicts of interest. The judge has denied the request.\n\n### **Request for removal to federal court**\n\nTrump's lawyers have also requested that the case be removed to federal court, citing the Constitution's emoluments clause. The request was denied by the court.\n\n### **Trial scheduling**\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin in July 2023 and is expected to last several weeks. The prosecution and defense teams will present their cases, and the jury will deliberate on the verdict.\n\n### **Gag order**\n\nThe judge has issued a gag order, prohibiting the parties from making public statements about the case.\n\n### **Statute of limitations**\n\nThe prosecution has argued that the statute of limitations does not apply to the case, as the alleged crimes took place over several years.\n\n**Overview of witnesses**\n\nThe prosecution has identified several key witnesses, including:\n\n* **David Pecker**: The former chairman and CEO of American Media, Inc., who has agreed to testify against Trump.\n* **Graff, Farro, Browning, and Thompson**: Four former Trump Organization executives who have been identified as witnesses in the case.\n* **Keith Davidson and Douglas Daus**: Two former Trump Organization lawyers who have been identified as witnesses in the case.\n* **Hope Hicks**: A former Trump Organization executive and current White House press secretary, who has been identified as a witness in the case.\n* **McConney, Tarasoff, and Franklin**: Three former Trump Organization executives who have been identified as witnesses in the case.\n* **Stormy Daniels**: The adult film actress who has filed a lawsuit against Trump and has been identified as a witness in the case.\n* **Manochio, Menzies, and Westerhout**: Three former Trump Organization executives who have been identified as witnesses in the case.\n* **Dixon, Tomalin, Longstreet, and Jarmel-Schneider**: Four former Trump Organization executives who have been identified as witnesses in the case.\n* **Michael Cohen**: Trump's former personal attorney, who has agreed to testify against Trump.\n\n**Trial**\n\n### **Jury selection and opening statements**\n\nThe trial is expected to begin in July 2023, and the jury selection process is currently underway. The prosecution and defense teams will deliver their opening statements, and the witnesses will be called to testify.\n\n### **Contempt hearings**\n\nThe judge has scheduled contempt hearings to address any issues that may arise during the trial.\n\n### **Prosecution witnesses**\n\nThe prosecution will present its case, calling witnesses such as Cohen, Stormy Daniels, and the four former Trump Organization executives mentioned earlier.\n\n### **Defense witnesses**\n\nThe defense will present its case, calling witnesses such as Daniel Sitko, a former Trump Organization executive, and Robert Costello, a lawyer who has worked with Trump.\n\n### **Closing arguments and jury instructions**\n\nThe prosecution and defense teams will deliver their closing arguments, and the judge will instruct the jury on the law.\n\n### **Jury deliberations and verdict**\n\nThe jury will deliberate on the verdict, and the judge will announce the result.\n\n**Post-trial proceedings**\n\n### **Gag order**\n\nThe judge has issued a gag order, prohibiting the parties from making public statements about the case.\n\n### **Delayed sentencing hearing**\n\nThe sentencing hearing has been delayed due to the ongoing appeal process.\n\n### **Immunity ruling**\n\nThe judge has ruled that certain witnesses will not receive immunity from prosecution.\n\n### **Firearms and liquor licenses**\n\nThe judge has ruled that Trump's firearms and liquor licenses will not be revoked.\n\n### **Potential appeal of conviction**\n\nTrump's lawyers have announced that they will appeal the conviction if Trump is found guilty.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe prosecution of Donald Trump in New York has drawn widespread media attention and public interest.

It is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and is designed to study the universe in infrared light, with a primary mirror that is 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter.\n\n**Features**\n\n### Location and orbit\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is in a halo orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2), which is a gravitationally stable location about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This orbit allows the telescope to maintain a constant temperature and avoid the interference of solar radiation.\n\n### Sunshield protection\n\nThe JWST has a large sunshield that protects the mirrors and instruments from the sun's radiation. The sunshield is made of a thin, lightweight material and is designed to maintain a temperature difference of at least 50°C (90°F) between the warm side and the cold side.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe JWST has a 6.5-meter (21.3-foot) primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal segments, which are made of gold-coated beryllium. The mirror is designed to collect and focus infrared light from distant objects in the universe.\n\n### Scientific instruments\n\nThe JWST has four main scientific instruments: the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS). These instruments are designed to study the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the universe, as well as the formation of planets and the composition of their atmospheres.\n\n### Spacecraft bus\n\nThe JWST spacecraft bus is designed to support the instruments and maintain the spacecraft's systems. It has a mass of about 6,500 kilograms (14,300 pounds) and is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG).\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe JWST does not have a planned servicing mission, unlike the Hubble Space Telescope. The spacecraft is designed to operate for at least 5 years, but could potentially operate for up to 10 years.\n\n### Software\n\nThe JWST has a complex software system that controls the spacecraft's operations and communicates with the ground station. The software is designed to handle the telescope's unique requirements, such as maintaining the sunshield and controlling the instrument temperatures.\n\n**Comparison with other telescopes**\n\nThe JWST is designed to be a more powerful and sensitive telescope than the Hubble Space Telescope. It has a larger primary mirror and is capable of observing objects in the infrared spectrum, which is not possible with Hubble. The JWST is also more expensive and complex than Hubble, with a development cost of over $8 billion.\n\n**Development history**\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first conceived in the 1990s as a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The project was initially planned to be a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), but the project was delayed and revised several times.\n\n### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nIn 2003, the JWST project was relaunched with a new design and a revised budget. The project was led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and included a team of scientists and engineers from the United States and Europe.\n\n### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe JWST detailed design and construction phase began in 2007 and lasted for 14 years. The telescope's primary mirror was made by the European Space Agency (ESA) and was launched in 2021.\n\n### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST project experienced significant cost and schedule issues during its development. The project's budget was initially estimated to be $3.5 billion, but it eventually exceeded $8 billion. The project was also delayed several times, with a launch date that was initially planned for 2011.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe JWST is a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The partnership was established in 2003 and includes a team of scientists and engineers from the United States, Europe, and Canada.\n\n### Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST was originally planned to be named the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), but the name was later changed to James Webb Space Telescope in honor of James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA.\n\n**Mission goals**\n\n### Orbit design\n\nThe JWST is in a halo orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2), which is a gravitationally stable location about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from Earth. This orbit allows the telescope to maintain a constant temperature and avoid the interference of solar radiation.\n\n### Infrared astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to study the universe in infrared light, with a primary mirror that is 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter. The telescope is capable of observing objects in the infrared spectrum, which is not possible with Hubble.\n\n**Ground support and operations**\n\n### Micrometeoroid strike\n\nThe JWST has a thin, lightweight sunshield that protects the mirrors and instruments from the sun's radiation. However, the telescope is also vulnerable to micrometeoroid strikes, which can cause damage to the sunshield and the mirrors.\n\n**From launch through commissioning**\n\n### Launch\n\nThe JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, by an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n### Transit and structural deployment\n\nAfter launch, the JWST followed a complex trajectory to the L2 (Lagrange point 2), where it deployed its sunshield and unfolded its primary mirror.\n\n### Commissioning and testing\n\nThe JWST began its commissioning and testing phase in January 2022, with a series of tests and calibrations to ensure that the telescope is functioning properly.\n\n**Allocation of observation time**\n\n### Early Release Science program\n\nThe JWST has an Early Release Science (ERS) program that allows scientists to propose and conduct observations using the telescope's instruments. The ERS program is designed to demonstrate the telescope's capabilities and to identify the most promising areas of research.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe JWST also has a General Observer (GO) program that allows scientists to propose and conduct observations using the telescope's instruments. The GO program is open to scientists from around the world and is designed to support a wide range of research projects.\n\n**Scientific results**\n\n### First full-color images\n\nThe JWST released its first full-color images in July 2022, which showed the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 in stunning detail. The images were taken using the telescope's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and demonstrate the telescope's ability to capture high-resolution images of distant objects.\n\n### Bright early galaxies\n\nThe JWST has also detected bright early galaxies in the universe, which are thought to have formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. The galaxies are seen in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and are among the most distant objects ever observed.\n\n### Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n\nThe JWST has made a number of other noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet and the observation of the most distant galaxy ever seen.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n[Insert images of the JWST, its instruments, and its observations]\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* European Space Agency\n* Canadian Space Agency\n* Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST)\n* James E.

This type of composition requires the composer to create a series of pieces, each one written in a different key, while maintaining a unified and coherent musical style. This article provides an overview of notable sets that cover all 24 keys, composers who wrote multiple sets, variants, and a history of music written in all major or minor keys.\n\n**Notable Sets That Cover All 24 Keys**\n\nOne of the most famous examples of music written in all major or minor keys is the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" by Johann Sebastian Bach. This collection of 48 preludes and fugues, composed between 1722 and 1742, is considered a masterpiece of Baroque music. Each prelude and fugue is written in a different key, creating a comprehensive and harmonically rich work.\n\nOther notable sets that cover all 24 keys include:\n\n* **Piano Sonatas in All 24 Keys** by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: This set of 24 piano sonatas, composed between 1782 and 1788, is a lesser-known but equally impressive achievement.\n* **24 Preludes in All 24 Keys** by Frédéric Chopin: Chopin's 24 preludes, composed between 1836 and 1839, are a beautiful and expressive set of pieces that demonstrate the composer's mastery of the piano.\n\n**Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets**\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music in all major or minor keys. One notable example is:\n\n* **Johann Sebastian Bach**: In addition to the \"Well-Tempered Clavier,\" Bach also composed the \"48** _Inventions and Sinfonias_**,\" which cover all 24 keys in a series of inventions and sinfonias.\n* **Ferdinand Ries**: Ries, a German composer and pupil of Beethoven, wrote a set of 24 piano sonatas in all major and minor keys.\n* **Théodore Follenius**: Follenius, a French composer, wrote a set of 24 piano sonatas in all major and minor keys.\n\n**Variants**\n\nWhile the most common form of music written in all major or minor keys is a set of individual pieces, there are also variants that include single pieces that modulate through many keys, works covering all eight church modes, and other sets of 24 pieces.\n\n* **Single Pieces That Modulate Through Many Keys**: Some composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, creating a sense of harmonic exploration and experimentation. Examples include Chopin's \"Piano Concerto No. 2\" and Ravel's \"Pavane pour une Infante Defunte.\"\n* **Works Covering All Eight Church Modes**: The eight church modes, also known as the \"authentic modes,\" are an earlier system of musical notation that was used in the Middle Ages. Some composers have written works that cover all eight church modes, such as Bach's \"Fantasias and Fugues for Organ.\"\n* **Other Sets of 24 Pieces**: In addition to the sets mentioned earlier, there are other composers who have written sets of 24 pieces in all major or minor keys. Examples include the \"24** _Preludes and Fugues for Piano_**\" by Sergei Prokofiev and the \"24** _Caprices for Solo Violin_**\" by Niccolò Paganini.\n\n**Keys**\n\nThe order of keys in published works of music written in all major or minor keys can vary depending on the composer and the specific work. However, there are some common patterns and conventions that have developed over time.\n\n* **Circular Order**: One common pattern is to arrange the keys in a circular or cyclical order, with the keys repeating in a pattern of major and minor keys. This is evident in the \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" by Bach, where the keys are arranged in a circular pattern of 24 keys.\n* **Major and Minor Keys**: Another pattern is to arrange the keys in a sequence of major and minor keys, with the major keys followed by the minor keys. This is evident in the \"24** _Preludes in All 24 Keys_**\" by Chopin, where the keys are arranged in a sequence of major and minor keys.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of music written in all major or minor keys spans several centuries, with notable composers contributing to this tradition.\n\n* **Bach and His Precursors**: The tradition of music written in all major or minor keys begins with the Baroque period, with composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and his precursors. Bach's \"Well-Tempered Clavier\" is considered a masterpiece of Baroque music and a foundational work in the tradition of music written in all major or minor keys.\n* **After Bach**: After Bach, the tradition of music written in all major or minor keys continued with composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. These composers wrote music that was influenced by Bach's innovations and expanded the tradition in new and exciting ways.\n* **18th and 19th Centuries**: In the 18th and 19th centuries, the tradition of music written in all major or minor keys continued to evolve, with composers such as Ferdinand Ries and Théodore Follenius contributing to this tradition.\n* **20th Century**: In the 20th century, the tradition of music written in all major or minor keys continued, with composers such as Sergei Prokofiev and Niccolò Paganini contributing to this tradition.\n* **21st Century**: In the 21st century, the tradition of music written in all major or minor keys continues, with composers such as Thomas Adès and George Benjamin contributing to this tradition.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMusic written in all major or minor keys is a rare and remarkable achievement in the world of classical music. This type of composition requires the composer to create a series of pieces, each one written in a different key, while maintaining a unified and coherent musical style. The tradition of music written in all major or minor keys spans several centuries, with notable composers contributing to this tradition.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bach, J. S.

Born on November 23, 1987, in Seoul, South Korea, An rose to prominence in the early 2000s, becoming one of the world's top figure skaters.\n\n#Early life and education\nViktor An's early life and education are not well-documented. However, it is known that he began figure skating at a young age and trained at the Korea National Skating Union (KNSU). An's early education and family background are not publicly available.\n\n#Career\n\n##2000s\n\n###Early career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\nAn's early career was marked by rapid improvement and success. He competed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he finished 19th in the men's singles event. An's performance at the Olympics caught the attention of the Korean skating community and led to his selection to the national team.\n\n####National team 'recommendation system'\nThe Korean skating system, known as the \"recommendation system,\" allowed coaches to nominate skaters to the national team. An's coaches, including mentor Lee Chong-sik, recommended him for the national team, which enabled him to compete at the international level.\n\n###2002–2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\nAn continued to compete for the KNSU and achieved significant success. He won several national championships and competed at international events, including the 2003 and 2004 World Championships. During this period, An also began to compete against non-KNSU skaters, which led to conflicts with the Korea Skating Union.\n\n###2005, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\nAn's conflicts with the KNSU began in 2005 when he was denied the opportunity to compete at the World Championships. The KNSU, under Lee Chong-sik's guidance, preferred to select other skaters to represent Korea. An's exclusion from the World Championships led to a rift between him and the KNSU.\n\n###2006 Winter Olympics\nAn competed at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, where he finished 20th in the men's singles event. His performance at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment, and An's conflicts with the KNSU continued.\n\n###After Torino\nAfter the 2006 Olympics, An's career began to decline. He struggled with injuries and personal issues, which affected his skating performance. An's relationship with the KNSU also deteriorated further.\n\n###Injury in early 2008\nAn suffered a severe injury in early 2008, which forced him to undergo surgery and take a break from skating. The injury was a significant setback for An, who struggled to recover and regain his form.\n\n##2010s\n\n###2010, Conflict with Korea Skating Union\nAn's conflicts with the KNSU continued in 2010 when he was denied the opportunity to compete at the World Championships. The KNSU preferred to select other skaters to represent Korea, which led to An's exclusion from the event.\n\n###Naturalization to Russia\nIn 2010, An naturalized to Russia and began competing for the Russian skating team. This move was seen as a strategic decision to distance himself from the KNSU and improve his chances of competing at international events.\n\n###2011, Conflict with the South Korean coaches\nAn's conflicts with the South Korean coaches, including Lee Chong-sik, continued in 2011. An accused the coaches of favoritism and corruption, which led to a public feud.\n\n###Heading to Sochi\nAn competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, where he finished 14th in the men's singles event. His performance at the Olympics was seen as a positive step, but An's career was still affected by his conflicts with the KNSU.\n\n###2014 Winter Olympics\nAn's performance at the 2014 Olympics was marked by controversy when he was involved in a public feud with the South Korean coaches. An accused the coaches of sabotaging his chances of competing at the Olympics.\n\n###After Sochi\nAfter the 2014 Olympics, An's career began to decline further. He struggled with injuries and personal issues, which affected his skating performance. An's relationship with the KNSU also deteriorated further.\n\n###Retirement\nAn announced his retirement from competitive figure skating in 2015. His decision to retire was seen as a positive step, but it also marked the end of his competitive career.\n\n##2020s\n\n###2022 Winter Olympics\nAn's 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, marked his last competitive event. He finished outside the top 20 in the men's singles event, which was seen as a disappointing performance.\n\n###Failure to return to South Korea for coaching\nAn was offered a coaching position with the South Korean national team but declined, citing personal reasons. An's decision not to return to South Korea for coaching was seen as a significant development in the Korean skating community.\n\n###South Korean leadership activities\nAn has remained involved in the Korean skating community, participating in leadership activities and promoting the development of figure skating in Korea.\n\n#Conflict with mentor\nAn's conflicts with his mentor, Lee Chong-sik, were a significant aspect of his career. An accused Lee of favoritism and corruption, which led to a public feud. The conflict between An and Lee was a long-standing issue that affected An's career and relationships within the Korean skating community.\n\n#Style\nAn's skating style was known for its technical difficulty and artistry. He was particularly skilled in the jumps and footwork departments, which earned him high scores at international events.\n\n#Awards and honors\nAn's awards and honors include several national championships, international medals, and a spot at the Winter Olympics.

The reform has sparked intense debate and controversy, with proponents arguing that it will increase transparency and accountability, while opponents claim that it will undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court, also known as the Supreme Court of Israel, is the highest court in Israel and has the power of judicial review. The court has the authority to interpret the laws of Israel and ensure that they are in line with the country's constitution.\n\n### 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli government approved a constitutional amendment that transferred many of the powers of the Supreme Court to the Knesset, the legislative branch of government. This move was intended to limit the court's power and increase the influence of the elected representatives. However, the move was widely criticized by the legal community and has been seen as a threat to the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nThe 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis, which saw a series of elections and failed coalition governments, paved the way for the current government led by Benjamin Netanyahu. The 2022 legislative election saw the Likud party, led by Netanyahu, emerge as the largest party in the Knesset. The government that was formed after the election has been characterized by its right-wing and ultra-Orthodox agenda, which has led to concerns about the future of the judiciary.\n\n**Legislative history**\n\n### HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nThe HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset case is a pending case before the Israeli Supreme Court, which challenges the proposed judicial reform. The case was filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a non-profit organization that aims to promote good governance and rule of law in Israel. The plaintiffs argue that the proposed reform will undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n**Proposed changes**\n\n### Judicial selection\n\n#### Current system\n\nUnder the current system, judges are selected by a committee that includes representatives from the Knesset, the Bar Association, and the Supreme Court. The committee reviews applications and selects candidates for appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\n#### Proposed system\n\nThe proposed system would give the government a greater role in selecting judges, with the leader of the Knesset having a veto power over the selection of judges. The committee that selects judges would be replaced by a new body that would be dominated by the government.\n\n#### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that it will increase transparency and accountability in the selection of judges. They claim that the current system is opaque and allows for the appointment of judges who are not qualified for the position.\n\n#### Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that it will undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They claim that the government will use its power to appoint judges who are loyal to the government and will not uphold the law.\n\n### Government legal advisors\n\nThe government has proposed a new system of government legal advisors, who would be responsible for advising the government on legal matters. The advisors would be appointed by the government and would have a significant role in shaping the country's legal policies.\n\n### Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed reform would also change the way the Supreme Court reviews constitutional matters. The court would no longer have the power to review laws that have been passed by the Knesset, unless there is a clear violation of a fundamental right.\n\n### Override clause\n\nThe proposed reform would also introduce an override clause, which would allow the Knesset to override a decision of the Supreme Court. The clause would require a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn a Supreme Court decision.\n\n### Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed reform would also abolish the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" as a basis for the Supreme Court to strike down laws. The grounds of \"unreasonableness\" are a key tool used by the court to review laws and ensure that they are in line with the Constitution.\n\n#### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds will reduce the power of the Supreme Court and increase the authority of the Knesset.\n\n#### Arguments against the reform\n\nOpponents of the reform argue that the abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds will undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reform would also change the status of the Attorney-General, who is the chief legal advisor to the government. The Attorney-General would no longer have the power to advise the government on constitutional matters.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### National\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has sparked intense debate and controversy in Israel. The opposition parties have characterized the reform as a threat to the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. The reform has also been criticized by the legal community and civil society organizations, who argue that it will undermine the country's democratic institutions.\n\n### International\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has also sparked concern and criticism from international bodies and governments. The United States has expressed concern about the reform, with the US State Department stating that it is \"monitoring the situation closely\". The European Union has also expressed concern, with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stating that the reform \"could undermine the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary\".\n\n### Connection to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has also been linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some critics of the reform argue that it will further entrench the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and undermine the possibility of a two-state solution.\n\n**Suspension and overruling**\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has been suspended by the Israeli Supreme Court, pending a hearing on the matter. The court has also overruled some of the provisions of the reform, stating that they are unconstitutional.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Israeli judicial system\n* Rule of law\n* Independence of the judiciary\n* Constitutionalism\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not include any references or citations)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Justice: Judicial Reform\n* Movement for Quality Government in Israel: Judicial Reform\n* Israeli Supreme Court: Judicial Reform", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

It is the fourth main installment in the Jackass film series and follows the team as they continue their brand of outrageous and often dangerous stunts.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe film features the same chaos and mayhem as its predecessors, with the cast members performing various stunts and pranks on each other. The movie also includes a few new cast members, including Sean \"Sweet\" Casey, Zach Holmes, and Rachel Wolfson. The stunts are often graphic and disturbing, but the film is presented in a way that is meant to be humorous and entertaining.\n\nThe film's storyline is loose and meandering, with the cast members frequently interrupting each other and deviating from the planned script. This is a hallmark of the Jackass franchise, which is known for its improvisational style and willingness to push the boundaries of good taste.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe main cast of Jackass Forever includes:\n\n* Johnny Knoxville as himself\n* Steve-O as himself\n* Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña as himself\n* Dave England as himself\n* Ehren McGhehey as himself\n* Preston Lacy as himself\n* Jeff Tremaine as himself\n* Bam Margera did not appear in the film\n* Sean \"Sweet\" Casey as himself\n* Zach Holmes as himself\n* Rachel Wolfson as herself\n\n**Guest appearances**\n\nSeveral guest stars appear in the film, including:\n\n* Tony Hawk\n* Travis Pastrana\n* Weezer\n* Machine Gun Kelly\n* Tony Romano\n* Ryan Dunn (in archival footage)\n\n**Crew**\n\nThe crew of Jackass Forever includes:\n\n* Jeff Tremaine as director\n* Spike Jonze as executive producer\n* Johnny Knoxville as executive producer\n* Jeff Nicholas as executive producer\n* Jason Clodd as producer\n* Ryan Lynch as associate producer\n* Ryan Polito as associate producer\n* Michael Bloom as cinematographer\n* Brian Stehens as film editor\n* Robert S. Allen as sound editor\n\n**Production**\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for Jackass Forever was conceived by Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine, who began working on the film in 2019. The film was initially meant to be a more low-key, experimental project, but it eventually evolved into a full-fledged feature film with a bigger budget and a more extensive cast.\n\n**Bam Margera's firing**\n\nBam Margera was a member of the main cast of Jackass Forever, but he was fired from the film in 2020 due to a series of incidents, including a fight with Johnny Knoxville and a disagreement over the direction of the film. Margera has since spoken out about his experiences on the set of the film, saying that he was mistreated and disrespected by the other cast members.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe casting process for Jackass Forever was a lengthy and sometimes contentious one, with the cast members frequently butting heads over who should be included in the film. Sean \"Sweet\" Casey and Zach Holmes were eventually added to the main cast, while Rachel Wolfson was brought in as a new cast member.\n\n**Filming**\n\nThe principal photography for Jackass Forever took place in 2020 and 2021, with the cast members performing various stunts and pranks on each other. The filming process was often chaotic and unpredictable, with the cast members frequently deviating from the planned script and improvising their stunts.\n\n**Injuries**\n\nSeveral members of the cast were injured during the filming of Jackass Forever, including Johnny Knoxville, who broke his collarbone, and Steve-O, who suffered a concussion. The injuries were a result of the film's signature stunts, which are often graphic and disturbing.\n\n**Release**\n\n**Home media**\n\nJackass Forever was released on digital platforms on February 4, 2022, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD on March 1, 2022. The home media release includes a number of bonus features, including a making-of documentary and a behind-the-scenes look at the film's production.\n\n**Reception**\n\n**Box office**\n\nJackass Forever opened at number one at the box office, grossing over $23 million in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $65 million worldwide, making it a commercial success.\n\n**Critical response**\n\nThe critical response to Jackass Forever was mixed, with some critics praising the film's energy and humor, while others found it to be too graphic and disturbing. The film holds a 44% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The critical consensus on the site reads, \"Jackass Forever is a messy, chaotic, and occasionally disturbing film that will delight die-hard fans of the franchise, but may leave others feeling uneasy and unfulfilled.\"\n\n**Jackass 4.5**\n\nIn 2022, it was announced that a spin-off film, titled Jackass 4.5, is in development. The film will feature the same cast members as Jackass Forever, and will be directed by Jeff Tremaine. The film is expected to be released in 2023.\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Jackass Forever at IMDb\n* Jackass Forever at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jackass_Forever\" following this outline:\n\n#Synopsis\n#Cast\n##Guest appearances\n##Crew\n#Production\n##Development\n##Bam Margera's firing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Injuries\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Jackass 4.5\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Kennedy\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. His death was a national trauma that shocked the American public and had a profound impact on the country's politics, culture, and society. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the events leading up to the assassination, the events of that day, the subsequent investigations, and the lasting impact of the event.\n\n# Background\n\n## Kennedy\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 and served in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, he entered politics, serving in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 and in the U.S. Senate from 1953 to 1960. In 1960, he was elected as the 35th President of the United States, defeating Republican candidate Richard Nixon.\n\n## Oswald\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in a troubled home and dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. In 1959, Oswald defected to the Soviet Union, where he lived for three years before returning to the United States in 1962. He became increasingly radicalized and joined the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a group that advocated for the rights of Cuban immigrants in the United States.\n\n# November 22\n\n## Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\nOn the morning of November 22, 1963, President Kennedy arrived in Dallas, Texas, on Air Force One. He was scheduled to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart, a convention center in downtown Dallas. His motorcade route would take him through Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas, where he would make a turn onto Elm Street.\n\n## Shooting\n\nAt 12:30 PM Central Standard Time, as the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, shots rang out from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. Kennedy was struck by two bullets, one in the head and one in the neck. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy climbed onto the back of the car, and the motorcade sped away from the scene.\n\n## Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n\nAs the motorcade sped away from Dealey Plaza, chaos erupted in the surrounding streets. Witnesses reported hearing multiple shots, and some saw a man on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. Meanwhile, Secret Service agents rushed to the car to protect the President, but Kennedy's condition was rapidly deteriorating.\n\n## Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest\n\nLee Harvey Oswald fled the Texas School Book Depository building and boarded a bus, but he soon abandoned the bus and walked to his apartment building. At 1:45 PM, Oswald shot and killed Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit, who had been investigating a suspicious person.

States House of Representatives elections in California were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 52 members of the U.S. House of Representatives from the state of California, one from each of the 52 congressional districts.\n\n**Statewide**\n\nThe statewide elections were held concurrently with the congressional elections. Two ballot measures were on the ballot, Proposition 1, which would have allowed the state to provide funding for reproductive health services, and Proposition 26, which would have allowed the state to allow sports betting at tribal casinos and online. Both measures were defeated.\n\n**District**\n\nThe 52 congressional districts in California were subject to changes due to redistricting following the 2020 United States Census. The new maps were drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission and took effect for the 2022 elections.\n\n**District 1**\n\n* **Candidates:**\n\t+ **Advanced to general:**\n\t\t- Doug LaMalfa (R) -

The demonstrations have been met with a violent response from the Iranian authorities, with reports of protesters being arrested, beaten, and killed. The protests have also been notable for the use of social media, with many protesters using Twitter and other platforms to organize and coordinate their actions.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nWomen in Iran have long faced strict laws and social norms governing their behavior and dress. The Iranian government has enforced a strict dress code, requiring women to wear a hijab in public, and has also imposed strict penalties for women who are found to be in breach of this law. The government has argued that the hijab is a symbol of Islamic modesty and that it is a necessary measure to protect women from harassment and exploitation.\n\nHowever, many women in Iran have long argued that the hijab is a symbol of oppression and that it is a tool of control used by the government to suppress women's rights and freedoms. The Iranian government has also been criticized for its treatment of women, including its use of forced marriage, female genital mutilation, and other forms of violence against women.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, with many groups and individuals using various forms of resistance to challenge the government's policies and actions. The 1979 Iranian Revolution, which saw the overthrow of the Shah and the establishment of an Islamic republic, was marked by widespread protests and demonstrations.\n\nSince then, there have been numerous other protest movements, including the 2009 Green Movement, which was sparked by claims of election fraud, and the 2017-2018 protests, which were sparked by economic hardship and government repression.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, was arrested by the morality police in Tehran on September 13, 2022, for not wearing her hijab properly. She was taken to a police station, where she was reportedly beaten and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological abuse.\n\nThe following day, Amini was transferred to a hospital, where she died. The official cause of death was given as a heart attack, but many have questioned this explanation and have called for a full investigation into her death.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that began in response to Amini's death have been marked by widespread demonstrations and civil unrest. Protesters have used various slogans, including \"Women, Life, Freedom\" and \"Down with the Dictatorship,\" to express their grievances and demands.\n\nProtesters have been calling for an end to the country's strict laws governing women's dress and behavior, as well as for an end to government repression and human rights abuses. Many have also been calling for the resignation of the government and the establishment of a new, democratic government.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nOpinion in Iran is highly divided, with many people supporting the government's actions and others calling for an end to government repression and human rights abuses. Many have also been calling for greater freedoms and rights for women, including the right to choose their own dress and behavior.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nProtesters have used various techniques, including street demonstrations, sit-ins, and boycotts, to express their grievances and demands. Many have also been using social media to organize and coordinate their actions.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nProtesters have also been calling for civil boycotts, including boycotts of government institutions and businesses. Many have also been calling for a boycott of the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup, which is to be held in Qatar.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests have received widespread coverage in the Western media, with many outlets reporting on the government's violent response to the protests and the human rights abuses that have been committed.\n\n**Casualties, government response**\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe protests have been marked by widespread violence and human rights abuses, with many protesters being arrested, beaten, and killed.

The bank's collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including a sharp decline in the value of the bank's assets, a loss of confidence among depositors, and a lack of effective regulation and oversight.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a commercial bank that specialized in serving the financial needs of technology and life science companies. The bank was founded in 1983 and was headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Over the years, SVB had grown to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with assets of over $200 billion and deposits of over $150 billion.\n\nSVB had a unique business model that focused on serving the needs of technology and life science companies. The bank provided a range of financial services, including deposit accounts, investment services, and cash management services. SVB's clients included many well-known technology companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of SVB began in early 2023, when the bank announced a significant loss on the sale of its investment portfolio. The bank had invested heavily in the bond market, which had been impacted by a rise in interest rates. As a result, the value of the bank's investment portfolio declined sharply, resulting in a net loss of over $1.8 billion.\n\nThe loss of value in the bank's investment portfolio was a major blow to SVB's financial stability. The bank's management team attempted to address the issue by selling additional assets and raising new capital. However, the bank's efforts were unsuccessful, and the loss of confidence among depositors continued to grow.\n\n**Losses**\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant losses for the bank's depositors, shareholders, and the financial system as a whole. The bank's depositors lost access to their funds, while shareholders lost their investment in the bank. The collapse also had a ripple effect on the financial system, as other banks and financial institutions became concerned about their own stability.\n\nThe losses resulting from the collapse of SVB were significant. The bank's depositors lost an estimated $150 billion in deposits, while shareholders lost an estimated $10 billion in value. The collapse also resulted in a loss of confidence among depositors, which had a broader impact on the financial system.\n\n**Instability**\n\nThe collapse of SVB created instability in the financial system, as other banks and financial institutions became concerned about their own stability. The collapse of SVB was seen as a potential contagion risk, as other banks and financial institutions became concerned about their own exposure to similar risks.\n\nThe instability in the financial system was exacerbated by the fact that SVB was a significant player in the technology and life science industry. The bank's collapse had a direct impact on the companies that it served, as many of them relied on SVB for their financial services.\n\n**Receivership**\n\nIn an effort to stabilize the financial system, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) stepped in to take control of SVB. The FDIC announced that it would provide depositors with access to their funds, while also taking steps to sell off the bank's assets.\n\nThe receivership of SVB marked the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, after the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008. The collapse of SVB was a significant event in the financial industry, marking a major turning point in the history of the bank.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of SVB, the FDIC announced that it would sell off the bank's assets to other financial institutions. The sale of SVB's assets marked a significant transfer of wealth in the financial industry, as other banks and financial institutions acquired the bank's assets at a discounted price.\n\nThe acquisition of SVB's assets by other financial institutions marked a significant shift in the financial landscape. The collapse of SVB had a direct impact on the companies that it served, as many of them relied on SVB for their financial services. The acquisition of SVB's assets by other financial institutions marked a significant turning point in the history of the bank.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a significant impact on the companies that it served, as well as the broader financial system. The collapse resulted in a loss of confidence among depositors, which had a broader impact on the financial system.\n\n**Customers**\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a direct impact on the companies that it served. Many of these companies relied on SVB for their financial services, and the loss of access to these services had a significant impact on their operations.\n\nThe collapse of SVB also had a broader impact on the technology and life science industry. The bank's collapse marked a significant turn in the history of the industry, as companies began to look for alternative financial services.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in a significant loss of value for shareholders. The bank's shareholders lost an estimated $10 billion in value, as the bank's collapse marked a significant turning point in the history of the bank.\n\n**Financial system**\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a ripple effect on the financial system, as other banks and financial institutions became concerned about their own stability. The collapse of SVB marked a significant turning point in the history of the bank, as the bank's assets were sold off to other financial institutions at a discounted price.\n\n**Legal actions**\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of SVB, there were several legal actions brought against the bank and its management team. These actions included lawsuits from depositors and shareholders, as well as regulatory actions from the FDIC and other government agencies.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a significant debate about the role of government intervention in the financial system. Many experts argued that the government should have taken more aggressive action to prevent the collapse of SVB, while others argued that the government's actions were sufficient to mitigate the damage.\n\n**Official responses**\n\nThe official response to the collapse of SVB was swift and decisive. The FDIC stepped in to take control of the bank, and other government agencies began to investigate the collapse of the bank.\n\n**Debate over government intervention**\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a significant debate about the role of government intervention in the financial system. Many experts argued that the government should have taken more aggressive action to prevent the collapse of SVB, while others argued that the government's actions were sufficient to mitigate the damage.\n\n**Debate about causes**\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a significant debate about the causes of the bank's collapse. Many experts argued that the bank's collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including a sharp decline in the value of the bank's assets, a loss of confidence among depositors, and a lack of effective regulation and oversight.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of largest bank failures in the United States\n* Silicon Valley Bank\n* FDIC\n* Washington Mutual\n* Lehman Brothers", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his ill-fated Titan expedition, which ended in tragedy in 2019.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHamish Harding was born on May 2, 1964, in Hertfordshire, England. He grew up in a family of modest means, with his father working as a mechanic and his mother as a homemaker. Harding's early life was marked by a strong sense of adventure and a desire to explore the world beyond his small town. He developed a passion for geography and history, which would eventually shape his career as an explorer.\n\nHarding attended local schools in Hertfordshire, where he excelled in mathematics and science. He went on to study geography at the University of London, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1986. During his time at university, Harding became increasingly interested in the field of exploration, which led him to join the British Exploring Society (BES), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting exploration and adventure.\n\n**Career and adventures**\n\nAfter graduating from university, Harding worked in the financial sector, holding various positions in investment banking and asset management. However, he continued to pursue his passion for exploration, leading expeditions to remote regions around the world. In the late 1990s, Harding became a member of the Explorers' Club, a prestigious organization founded by American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews.\n\nHarding's early expeditions took him to various parts of Africa, Asia, and South America, where he led teams of adventurers in search of hidden treasures, lost cities, and uncharted territories. He became particularly known for his expertise in navigating treacherous terrain and his ability to manage complex teams in high-pressure situations.\n\nIn the 2000s, Harding turned his attention to the world of business, establishing a successful investment firm that specialized in private equity and venture capital. He continued to lead expeditions in his spare time, often to raise funds and awareness for charitable causes.\n\n**Titan expedition and death**\n\nIn 2019, Harding embarked on his most ambitious expedition to date: a journey to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in a submersible vessel called Titan. The expedition was intended to explore the depths of the ocean and raise awareness for marine conservation.\n\nOn June 18, 2019, the Titan submersible, carrying Harding and five others, descended to a depth of approximately 3,600 meters (11,800 feet) in the North Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, the vessel encountered a catastrophic failure, resulting in the loss of all lives on board.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in the media, with many mourning the loss of a man who had dedicated his life to exploration and adventure. The incident sparked a global outpouring of grief, with condolences pouring in from around the world.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHarding was married to a woman named Sarah, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. The family lived in a small cottage in the English countryside, where they enjoyed spending time together and exploring the surrounding countryside.\n\nHarding was known to be a private person, preferring to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. However, he was deeply committed to his family and was often seen accompanying his children on various adventures and expeditions.\n\n**Awards and recognition**\n\nHarding received numerous awards and recognition for his contributions to exploration and conservation. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2013 for his services to exploration and conservation. He was also awarded the prestigious Gold Medal of the Explorers' Club in 2015 for his outstanding contributions to the field of exploration.\n\nIn addition to his awards, Harding was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and a member of the Royal Institute of Navigation (RIN). He was also a patron of several charitable organizations, including the British Exploring Society and the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Explorers' Club\n* British Exploring Society\n* Royal Geographical Society\n* Royal Institute of Navigation\n* Wildlife Conservation Society\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This article does not contain any references or citations, as per the requirements.)\n\n**External links**\n\n* British Exploring Society\n* Explorers' Club\n* Royal Geographical Society\n* Royal Institute of Navigation\n* Wildlife Conservation Society", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamish_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and adventures\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#Awards and recognition\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team has a rich history, having won several major tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. France is one of the most successful teams in the history of the World Cup, having won the tournament twice, in 1998 and 2018.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1900–1930s)\n\nThe first game played by the French national team was in 1904, against Belgium, which they won 3-3. France's first major international tournament was the 1904 Summer Olympics, where they finished in third place. In the 1920s and 1930s, France began to establish itself as a major force in European football, with a number of notable players, including Raoul Di Leo and André Mahou.\n\n### 1950s–1980s\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of a new generation of French players, including Raymond Kopa, Just Fontaine, and Michel Hidalgo. This team, led by coach Hidalgo, reached the final of the 1958 World Cup, where they were defeated by Brazil. In the 1970s and 1980s, France experienced a decline in fortunes, failing to qualify for the World Cup in 1978 and 1982.\n\n### Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of a new generation of French players, led by the talented and charismatic midfielder, Zinedine Zidane.

The blockade has been enforced by the Azerbaijani government, which has imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. This blockade has had severe consequences for the local population, leading to a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBackground\n\n### First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1989, when the Azerbaijani government, backed by Soviet authorities, imposed restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of the region. This blockade was part of a broader effort to isolate Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia, which had been the primary source of support for the region's Armenian population. The blockade was enforced by Azerbaijani security forces, who regularly prevented Armenian civilians from crossing into Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n### Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n\nIn the 1990s, the blockade took on a new dimension, as Azerbaijani forces began to target the region's public utility infrastructure. Water and electricity supplies were frequently disrupted, and roads were regularly blocked, making it difficult for people to enter or leave Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade also affected the region's communication infrastructure, with phone and internet services frequently disrupted.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn recent years, the blockade has taken on a new form, with Azerbaijani authorities imposing restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. This has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with local residents facing severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.\n\nBlockade timeline\n\n### 2022 events\n\nIn 2022, the blockade was marked by a series of incidents, including the arrest of Armenian civilians attempting to cross into Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani authorities also imposed severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of the region, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine.\n\n### 2023 events\n\nIn 2023, the blockade continued, with Azerbaijani authorities imposing severe restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. Local residents faced severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies, leading to a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHumanitarian crisis\n\n### Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n\nThe blockade has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with local residents facing severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essential supplies. The lack of access to medical care has also been a major concern, with many residents unable to receive treatment for serious medical conditions.\n\n### Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers have attempted to transport supplies into Nagorno-Karabakh, but these efforts have been severely limited by Azerbaijani authorities. The Russian peacekeepers have been responsible for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces, but they have been unable to prevent the blockade.\n\nDamage to infrastructure\n\nThe blockade has also led to significant damage to the region's infrastructure. Roads have been regularly blocked, and public utility infrastructure has been frequently disrupted. This has made it difficult for people to enter or leave Nagorno-Karabakh, and has had a significant impact on the local economy.\n\nGenocide risk factors\n\nThe blockade has also raised concerns about the risk of genocide. Azerbaijani authorities have been accused of targeting the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, and the blockade has been seen as a means of perpetuating this violence.\n\nInaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n\nThe Russian peacekeepers have been criticized for their inaction in the face of the blockade. Despite their presence in the region, they have been unable to prevent the Azerbaijani authorities from enforcing the blockade.\n\nProposed solutions\n\nA number of proposed solutions have been put forward to address the blockade, including the establishment of a buffer zone and the creation of a corridor for the movement of people and goods into and out of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, these proposals have been met with resistance from Azerbaijani authorities.\n\nAuthenticity of the environmental activism claims\n\nThere has been controversy over the authenticity of the environmental activism claims made by Azerbaijani authorities. Many have questioned the motivations behind these claims, and the involvement of the Azerbaijani government in the blockade.\n\n### Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n\nAzerbaijani authorities have been accused of using environmental concerns as a pretext for the blockade. Many have questioned the motivations behind these claims, and the involvement of the Azerbaijani government in the blockade.\n\n### Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n\nState employees and civil servants have been accused of involvement in the blockade, with some reports suggesting that they are being used to enforce the restrictions.\n\n### Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n\nNagorno-Karabakh has been inaccessible to the public and independent journalists, making it difficult to gather accurate information about the blockade.\n\n### Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n\nThe \"protesters\" who have been involved in the blockade have been subject to scrutiny, with many questioning the authenticity of their environmental concerns.\n\nLawsuits\n\n### International Court of Justice\n\nThere have been reports that lawsuits have been filed with the International Court of Justice, alleging that the blockade is a violation of international law.\n\n### European Court of Human Rights\n\nThere have also been reports that lawsuits have been filed with the European Court of Human Rights, alleging that the blockade is a violation of human rights.\n\nReactions\n\n### Involved parties\n\nAzerbaijani authorities, Armenian authorities, and the Russian peacekeepers have all been involved in the blockade.\n\n### International\n\nThe international community has been critical of the blockade, with many countries calling for its lifting.\n\n### Supranational\n\nSupranational organizations, such as the European Union, have also been critical of the blockade.\n\n### Non-governmental organizations\n\nNon-governmental organizations, such as Amnesty International, have also been critical of the blockade.\n\nSee also\n\n* Nagorno-Karabakh conflict\n* Azerbaijan-Armenia relations\n* Russian peacekeeping in Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"Nagorno-Karabakh: A Conflict Without End\" by the International Crisis Group\n* \"Azerbaijan: The Blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh\" by the Human Rights Watch\n* \"Nagorno-Karabakh: A Humanitarian Crisis\" by the Red Cross", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the largest of all the bear species, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kilograms) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters).\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPolar bears have been an important part of the Arctic ecosystem for thousands of years. They are well adapted to their harsh, cold environment, with a thick layer of fat and a white coat that allows them to blend in with their surroundings. Despite their impressive size and strength, polar bears are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which is melting their sea ice habitat and threatening their very survival.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear has been known by many names throughout history. In the Inuit language, they are called \"nanook,\" which means \"strong one.\" They were also referred to as \"sea bears\" or \"ice bears\" by early European explorers. The scientific name Ursus maritimus, which means \"sea bear\" in Latin, was given to the species in 1774 by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carolus Linnaeus.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe polar bear is a member of the Ursidae family, which includes all the bear species. It is the largest member of this family, and is closely related to the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis). The polar bear is classified as a single species, with no subspecies.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe polar bear is believed to have evolved from a population of brown bears that lived on the northern coast of Asia and Europe during the Pleistocene era. These early bears were adapted to a marine environment, and were able to hunt and feed on seals and other marine mammals. Over time, they evolved into the modern polar bear, which is well adapted to its Arctic habitat.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe polar bear is a large and powerful animal, with a muscular body and a distinctive white coat that helps it to blend in with its surroundings. Adult males can weigh up to 1,700 pounds (770 kilograms) and reach lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters), making them the largest of all the bear species. They have a thick layer of fat, which helps to keep them warm in the cold Arctic environment. Their fur is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer that helps to repel water.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. They live on sea ice, which they use as a platform to hunt and feed on seals and other marine mammals. They are also found on land, where they feed on berries, lichens, and other terrestrial plants. The polar bear's habitat is limited to the Arctic region, where the sea ice provides them with a platform to hunt and feed.\n\n**Behaviour and Ecology**\n\nThe polar bear is a carnivorous animal that feeds on a variety of prey, including seals, walruses, and other marine mammals. They are skilled hunters, and are able to catch their prey by using their keen sense of smell and their powerful swimming ability. They are also able to feed on berries, lichens, and other terrestrial plants when they are available.\n\n### Social Life\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, and only come together to mate. Female polar bears will often give birth to a single cub each year, which will stay with them for up to two years before becoming independent. Male polar bears will often wander long distances in search of food and mates, and will occasionally come into conflict with other males.\n\n### Diet and Hunting\n\nPolar bears are skilled hunters, and are able to catch a variety of prey, including seals, walruses, and other marine mammals. They use their keen sense of smell to locate their prey, and are able to swim long distances to catch them. They are also able to feed on berries, lichens, and other terrestrial plants when they are available.\n\n### Reproduction and Development\n\nFemale polar bears will give birth to a single cub each year, which will stay with them for up to two years before becoming independent. The cub will be born after a gestation period of around 220 days, and will weigh around 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) at birth. The mother will nurse the cub for up to two years, and will teach it how to hunt and feed on its own.\n\n### Mortality\n\nPolar bears have a number of mortality factors, including habitat loss, climate change, and human activity. They are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which is melting their sea ice habitat and threatening their very survival. They are also at risk from human activity, including hunting and poaching.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nThe polar bear is listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main threats to the polar bear are habitat loss and climate change, which are melting their sea ice habitat and threatening their very survival.\n\n**Relationship with Humans**\n\nPolar bears have a complex relationship with humans. On the one hand, they are an important part of the Arctic ecosystem, and play a key role in maintaining the balance of the environment. On the other hand, they are vulnerable to the impacts of human activity, including hunting and poaching.\n\n### Exploitation\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur and body parts for thousands of years. They are also caught in fishing nets and other marine gear, which can cause them injury and death.\n\n### Conflicts\n\nPolar bears are at risk from human activity, including hunting and poaching. They are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which is melting their sea ice habitat and threatening their very survival.\n\n### Captivity\n\nPolar bears are sometimes kept in captivity in zoos and other institutions. However, this can be a challenging and expensive endeavor, and is not always successful.\n\n### Cultural Significance\n\nPolar bears have a significant cultural importance in many Arctic cultures. They are often seen as a symbol of strength and resilience, and are featured in traditional art and literature.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Climate change\n* Conservation biology\n* Habitat fragmentation\n* Human-wildlife conflict\n* Oceanic ecosystem\n* Polar bear conservation\n* Sea ice\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on polar bears.\n* The information contained in this article is intended to be accurate and up-to-date.\n* However, the situation with polar bears is constantly evolving, and new research and information may become available at any time.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not contain any references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Amaral, S.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the development of Western philosophy and theology. Boethius was born around 480 AD in Rome, Italy, to a family of noble descent. His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was a consul, and his mother, Rusticiana, was a member of the Anicii family, who were known for their intellectual and cultural achievements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBoethius received a classical education in Rome, studying grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the works of Aristotle and Plato, which would later influence his own philosophical views. Boethius' early life was marked by his family's high social standing and his own intellectual curiosity. He was exposed to the intellectual and cultural currents of the time, including the rise of Christianity and the influence of Greek philosophy on Roman thought.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius' rise to power began in the late 5th century, when he was appointed as the magister officiorum, or master of ceremonies, by the Roman Emperor Theodoric the Great. Theodoric, a Gothic king who had conquered Italy in the late 5th century, sought to establish a stable and efficient administration in Rome. Boethius was chosen for his intellectual abilities, his knowledge of Roman law and administration, and his connections to the imperial court.\n\nBoethius' appointment as magister officiorum marked the beginning of his ascent to prominence in Roman politics. He became a trusted advisor to Theodoric and played a key role in shaping the king's policies. Boethius' tenure as magister officiorum was marked by his efforts to reform the Roman administration, promote education and culture, and establish a more harmonious relationship between the Roman and Gothic populations.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius' downfall began in 523 AD, when he was accused of treason by Theodoric's court. The exact circumstances of his downfall are unclear, but it is believed that Boethius was accused of conspiring against Theodoric with the help of his son-in-law, Symmachus. Boethius was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually sentenced to death.\n\nAccording to legend, Boethius was imprisoned in a dark and damp cell, where he spent the final days of his life. During his imprisonment, Boethius wrote several works, including his famous book \"De consolatione philosophiae\" (On the Consolation of Philosophy). The book is a philosophical treatise on the nature of good and evil, the meaning of life, and the existence of God. In it, Boethius reflects on his own circumstances and explores the themes of hope, despair, and the search for meaning.\n\nBoethius was executed on October 23, 524 AD, by being strangled and then beheaded. His death marked the end of an era in Roman politics and culture, and his legacy would continue to shape the development of Western philosophy and theology for centuries to come.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius wrote several works during his lifetime, including:\n\n**De consolatione philosophiae**\n\n(On the Consolation of Philosophy)\n\nDe consolatione philosophiae is Boethius' most famous work, a philosophical treatise on the nature of good and evil, the meaning of life, and the existence of God. The book is written in the form of a conversation between Boethius and Lady Philosophy, who represents the ideal of wisdom and knowledge. In the book, Boethius reflects on his own circumstances and explores the themes of hope, despair, and the search for meaning.\n\n**De topicis differentiis**\n\n(On the Differentiae of Topics)\n\nDe topicis differentiis is a logical and philosophical treatise on the nature of language and knowledge. The book is a comprehensive overview of the categories and concepts of Aristotle's logic, and it provides a framework for understanding the relationships between words, concepts, and reality.\n\n**De arithmetica**\n\n(On Arithmetic)\n\nDe arithmetica is a mathematical treatise on the nature of numbers and arithmetic. The book is a comprehensive overview of the principles of arithmetic, including the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**De institutione musica**\n\n(On the Institution of Music)\n\nDe institutione musica is a musical treatise on the nature of music and its relationship to the human soul. The book is a comprehensive overview of the principles of music, including the concepts of melody, harmony, and rhythm.\n\n**Opuscula sacra**\n\n(Sacred Works)\n\nOpuscula sacra is a collection of theological and philosophical treatises on the nature of God, the universe, and human nature. The book is a comprehensive overview of Boethius' theological views, including his concepts of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the nature of salvation.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nThe dates of Boethius' works are as follows:\n\n* De consolatione philosophiae: 523 AD\n* De topicis differentiis: 524 AD\n* De arithmetica: 524 AD\n* De institutione musica: 524 AD\n* Opuscula sacra: 524 AD\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius' legacy is profound and far-reaching. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the development of Western philosophy and theology. His works had a significant impact on the development of medieval philosophy and theology, and his ideas continue to influence contemporary thought.\n\nBoethius' concept of the \" consolatio\" or the idea that one can find comfort and solace in the midst of suffering and adversity, has become a central theme in Western philosophy and literature. His ideas on the nature of good and evil, the meaning of life, and the existence of God have shaped the development of Western theology and continue to influence contemporary debates.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. His feast day is October 23, and he is honored as a martyr and a philosopher. His legacy has been celebrated by many prominent thinkers and writers throughout history, including St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Dante Alighieri.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius has been the subject of numerous literary and artistic works throughout history. His life and ideas have been celebrated in poetry, literature, and music, including works by Dante Alighieri, John Milton, and John Donne. His concept of the \"consolatio\" has become a central theme in Western literature and continues to influence contemporary thought.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Anicii\n* Roman Empire\n* Gothic Kingdom\n* Theodoric the Great\n* Aristotle\n* Plato\n* St. Augustine\n* St. Thomas Aquinas\n* Dante Alighieri\n* John Milton\n* John Donne\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact dates of Boethius' life and works are not known with certainty.\n* The circumstances of Boethius' downfall and execution are unclear.\n* Boethius' works were widely read and studied in the Middle Ages.\n* His ideas on the nature of good and evil, the meaning of life, and the existence of God continue to influence contemporary thought.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\n* \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" translated by Richard H.
