It is a nitrogen-fixing pioneer species that plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, particularly in the early stages of succession.\n\n## Scientific Name\n\nThe scientific name \"Anagyris foetida\" is derived from the Greek words \"anagyris,\" meaning \"without a berry,\" and \"foetidus,\" meaning \"foul-smelling.\" This refers to the plant's unpleasant odor, which is often used to deter herbivores.\n\n## Common names\n\nAnagyris foetida has several common names, including:\n\n* Stinking anagyris\n* Fetid anagyris\n* Western stinking anagyris\n* Anagyris odorata\n* Anagyris foetens\n\nThese names reflect the plant's distinctive odor and its distribution in the western Mediterranean region.\n\n## Distribution\n\nAnagyris foetida is native to the western Mediterranean region, including:\n\n* Spain\n* Portugal\n* France\n* Italy\n* Greece\n* Turkey\n* North Africa\n\nThe plant has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia, the United States, and South America.\n\n## Habitat\n\nAnagyris foetida prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in:\n\n* Dry scrublands\n* Rocky outcrops\n* Sandy dunes\n* Coastal areas\n\nThe plant is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of environments.\n\n## Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n\nAnagyris foetida has several adaptations that enable it to grow in the winter and early spring:\n\n### Summer leaf-fall\n\nThe plant sheds its leaves during the hot summer months, a process known as \"summer leaf-fall.\" This helps to conserve water and reduce transpiration.\n\n### Pollination by birds\n\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to the plant's nectar-rich flowers. The plant's flowers are shaped like a cup, making it difficult for insects to access the nectar. As a result, birds are the primary pollinators of this species.\n\n## Seed dispersal\n\nAnagyris foetida has several mechanisms for seed dispersal:\n\n### Soil seed banks\n\nThe plant's seeds are able to survive in the soil for extended periods, a process known as seed banking. This allows the plant to maintain a persistent seed bank, even in areas where the plant is no longer present.\n\n### Olive mimicry\n\nThe plant's seeds resemble those of the olive tree, making it difficult for predators to distinguish between the two species. This is an example of \"olive mimicry,\" a common strategy used by plants to avoid predation.\n\n### Role of sheep\n\nSheep play a crucial role in the seed dispersal of Anagyris foetida. The plant's seeds are often found in sheep's dung, where they are able to germinate and grow.\n\n### Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n\nOther mammals and birds may also serve as vectors for Anagyris foetida seeds. However, the role of these animals in seed dispersal is not well understood.\n\n### Unknown seed dispersal vector\n\nThere may be an unknown seed dispersal vector for Anagyris foetida, which has not been identified or studied.\n\n### Tough, waterproof seed coats\n\nThe plant's seeds have tough, waterproof seed coats that enable them to survive in a variety of environments.\n\n## Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing pioneer species, meaning that it is able to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by other plants. This makes it a valuable companion plant in agroforestry and reforestation efforts.\n\n## Medicinal use\n\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The plant's roots and leaves contain a number of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and glycosides.\n\n## Toxicity\n\nAnagyris foetida is toxic to humans and animals, particularly if ingested.

The vessel was designed to operate at depths of up to 6,500 meters and was equipped with advanced life support systems and communication equipment. However, the project was not without its challenges, and in 2015, the company's chief engineer, Greg SÃ¶hnlein, left OceanGate due to disagreements over the project's direction. Despite this setback, the company continued to work on Cyclops 1 and finally launched the vessel in 2016.\n\n#### 2016â2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n\nIn 2016, OceanGate expanded its fleet with the acquisition of Titan, a submersible vessel that was designed for deep-sea operations. The company also completed a series of successful dives to the wreck of the RMS Titanic, which helped to establish OceanGate as a leading player in the field of deep-sea exploration. Over the next few years, the company continued to expand its fleet and operations, and in 2022, it launched a new submersible vessel, Titan 1, which was designed for even deeper and more complex operations.\n\n**2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush**\n\nOn June 18, 2023, OceanGate's submersible vessel, Titan, imploded while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, resulting in the loss of all six people on board, including Stockton Rush. The incident was a tragic reminder of the risks involved in deep-sea exploration and the importance of safety in the industry. Despite this setback, OceanGate continues to operate and is committed to advancing the exploration and understanding of the world's oceans.\n\n**Submersibles**\n\nOceanGate operates a fleet of submersible vessels, each designed for specific types of operations.\n\n#### Antipodes\n\nAntipodes is a shallow-water submersible vessel that was acquired by OceanGate in 2009. The vessel is designed for operations in shallow water and has been used for a variety of tasks, including research and exploration.\n\n#### Cyclops 1\n\nCyclops 1 is a deep-sea submersible vessel that was launched by OceanGate in 2016. The vessel is designed to operate at depths of up to 6,500 meters and is equipped with advanced life support systems and communication equipment.\n\n#### Titan\n\nTitan is a deep-sea submersible vessel that was acquired by OceanGate in 2016. The vessel is designed to operate at depths of up to 12,000 meters and is equipped with advanced life support systems and communication equipment. Titan was involved in a tragic incident on June 18, 2023, when it imploded while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic, resulting in the loss of all six people on board.\n\n**Associated entities**\n\nOceanGate is associated with several other companies and organizations that share its mission and values.\n\n* OceanGate Expeditions: OceanGate Expeditions is a subsidiary of OceanGate that provides deep-sea exploration and research services to clients.\n* OceanGate Foundation: The OceanGate Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the company's mission to advance the exploration and understanding of the world's oceans.\n\n**See also**\n\n* OceanGate Expeditions\n* OceanGate Foundation\n* Deep-sea exploration\n* Manned submersible systems\n* RMS Titanic\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as per the requirements)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* OceanGate's website\n* OceanGate Expeditions' website\n* OceanGate Foundation's website\n\n**External links**\n\n* OceanGate's website\n* OceanGate Expeditions' website\n* OceanGate Foundation's website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"OceanGate\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##2009â2013: Founding and acquisition of Antipodes\n##2013â2016: Construction of Cyclops and SÃ¶hnlein's departure\n##2016â2023: Expansion of fleet and dives to the Titanic\n##2023: Implosion of Titan and death of Rush\n#Submersibles\n##Antipodes\n##Cyclops 1\n##Titan\n#Associated entities\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The invasion has had significant consequences for both countries, as well as the wider international community.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Post-Soviet Relations\n\nThe relationship between Russia and Ukraine has been complex and often tense since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, but Russia has maintained significant economic and cultural ties to the country. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in a revolution, leading to a crisis in relations between the two countries.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine's pro-Western government, led by President Petro Poroshenko, took office following the ousting of Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014, following a disputed referendum. Russia also backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, leading to a conflict in the Donbas region that has continued to this day.\n\n**Prelude**\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn 21 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a televised address in which he announced that Russia would be conducting a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. Putin claimed that the operation was necessary to protect Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. On 24 February, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with troops and artillery moving into the country from multiple directions.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Initial Invasion (24 February â 7 April)\n\nThe initial invasion of Ukraine was a massive military operation, with Russian forces moving into the country from the north, east, and south. The initial focus of the invasion was on the capital city of Kyiv, as well as key cities in the northeastern and southern regions of Ukraine.\n\n#### Kyiv and Northern Front\n\nRussian forces made significant gains in the north of Ukraine, moving towards Kyiv and capturing key cities such as Chernobyl and Hostomel. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian advance, and a fierce battle for control of Kyiv ensued.\n\n#### Northeastern Front\n\nIn the northeastern part of Ukraine, Russian forces captured key cities such as Sumy and Okhtyrka, but were ultimately repelled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n#### Southern Front\n\nIn the southern part of Ukraine, Russian forces captured key cities such as Kherson and Melitopol, but were ultimately repelled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n#### Eastern Front\n\nIn the eastern part of Ukraine, Russian forces were able to capture key cities such as Donetsk and Luhansk, but were ultimately repelled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n### Southeastern Front (8 April â 5 September)\n\nThe southeastern front of the conflict saw significant fighting in the Donbas region, particularly in the cities of Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk.\n\n#### Fall of Mariupol\n\nIn May 2022, Russian forces captured the city of Mariupol, which had been a key stronghold of Ukrainian resistance.\n\n#### Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk\n\nIn June 2022, Russian forces captured the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, which were key strongholds of Ukrainian resistance.\n\n#### Kharkiv Front\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces were able to push back against Russian advances, and ultimately capture key cities such as Kharkiv.\n\n#### Kherson-Mykolaiv Front\n\nIn the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, Ukrainian forces were able to push back against Russian advances, and ultimately capture key cities such as Mykolaiv.\n\n#### Zaporizhzhia Front\n\nIn the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian forces were able to push back against Russian advances, and ultimately capture key cities such as Zaporizhzhia.\n\n### Russian Annexations and Occupation Losses (6 September â 11 November 2022)\n\nIn September 2022, Russia annexed four regions of Ukraine, including Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. However, Ukraine was able to push back against Russian advances, and ultimately recapture key cities such as Kherson.\n\n### Kherson Counteroffensive\n\nIn November 2022, Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in the Kherson region, which was successful in pushing back Russian forces and recapturing key cities.\n\n### Kharkiv Counteroffensive\n\nIn November 2022, Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, which was successful in pushing back Russian forces and recapturing key cities.\n\n### Winter Stalemate, Attrition Campaign and Military Surge (12 November 2022 â 7 June 2023)\n\nFollowing the failure of Russian advances, the conflict entered a period of stalemate, with both sides engaging in an attrition campaign. However, Ukraine was able to launch a series of successful counterattacks, which pushed back Russian forces and recaptured key cities.\n\n#### Battle of Bakhmut\n\nIn 2023, the city of Bakhmut became a focal point of the conflict, with both sides engaging in intense fighting. Ultimately, Ukraine was able to hold off Russian advances and maintain control of the city.\n\n### 2023 Counteroffensives and Summer Campaign (8 June 2023 â 1 December 2023)\n\nIn 2023, Ukraine launched a series of successful counterattacks, which pushed back Russian forces and recaptured key cities.\n\n### Russian Spring and Summer Campaigns and Ukrainian Incursion (1 December 2023 â present)\n\nIn late 2023, Russia launched a series of spring and summer campaigns, which aimed to push back Ukrainian advances and recapture key cities. However, Ukraine was able to hold off Russian advances and maintain control of key territories.\n\n### Russian Offensive\n\nIn December 2023, Russia launched a major offensive in the Donbas region, which aimed to push back Ukrainian advances and recapture key cities. However, Ukraine was able to hold off Russian advances and maintain control of key territories.\n\n### Ukrainian Offensive and Further Donbas Advances\n\nIn January 2024, Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive in the Donbas region, which aimed to push back Russian advances and recapture key cities. The offensive was successful, with Ukraine making significant gains and pushing Russian forces back.\n\n**Battlespaces**\n\n### Command\n\nThe command structure of the Russian military during the invasion of Ukraine was complex and involved multiple layers of command. However, the overall strategy of the invasion was set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, with key decisions being made by the Russian General Staff.\n\n### Missile Attacks and Aerial Warfare\n\nThe Russian military launched a series of missile attacks against Ukrainian targets during the invasion, including cities and military installations. The attacks were often carried out using ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which were launched from Russian territory or from Russian ships in the Black Sea.\n\n#### Crimea Attacks\n\nIn 2022, Russia launched a series of missile attacks against Ukrainian targets in the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The attacks were aimed at disrupting Ukrainian military operations and were often carried out using ballistic missiles.\n\n#### Russian Attacks Against Ukrainian Civilian Infrastructure\n\nIn 2022, Russia launched a series of attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including power plants, water treatment facilities, and other critical infrastructure. The attacks were often carried out using ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.\n\n### Naval Blockade and Engagements\n\nThe Russian Navy played a significant role in the invasion of Ukraine, with Russian warships and submarines operating in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The Russian Navy was involved in a series of naval engagements with Ukrainian forces, including the sinking of several Ukrainian ships.\n\n### Nuclear Risk\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine raised concerns about the risk of nuclear conflict, particularly in the event of a Russian attack on Ukraine's nuclear power plants. However, the Russian military has consistently denied any plans to use nuclear weapons.\n\n### Ukrainian Resistance\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been able to resist Russian advances and maintain control of key territories, despite being outnumbered and outgunned by the Russian military. The Ukrainian military has used a range of tactics, including guerrilla warfare and cyber warfare, to counter Russian advances.\n\n**International Aspects**\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe international community has reacted to the invasion of Ukraine with widespread condemnation, particularly from Western countries. The United States, the European Union, and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and provided military aid to Ukraine.\n\n### Foreign Involvement\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine has led to significant foreign involvement, particularly from Western countries. The United States, the European Union, and other countries have provided military aid to Ukraine and imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\n#### Support for Ukraine\n\nThe United States, the European Union, and other countries have provided significant support to Ukraine, including military aid and economic assistance. The support has been aimed at helping Ukraine resist Russian advances and maintain control of key territories.\n\n#### Support for Russia\n\nSome countries, including China and India, have provided support to Russia, particularly in the form of diplomatic backing and economic assistance. The support has been aimed at helping Russia maintain its position in the conflict.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant casualties, with estimates suggesting that over 100,000 people have been killed or injured. The exact number of casualties is difficult to determine, particularly due to the ongoing nature of the conflict.\n\n**Prisoners of War**\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant numbers of prisoners of war, with estimates suggesting that over 10,000 people have been captured. The treatment of prisoners of war has been a major concern, particularly due to reports of torture and mistreatment.\n\n**War Crimes and Attacks on Civilians**\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant war crimes and attacks on civilians, with estimates suggesting that over 1,000 civilians have been killed or injured.

The film is a semi-autobiographical account of Spielberg's own childhood and his early experiences with filmmaking. The Fabelmans premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2022, and was released in the United States on November 11, 2022.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Fabelmans is set in the 1950s and 1960s in suburban New Jersey. The film follows the story of Sammy Fabelman, a young boy who is fascinated by filmmaking. Sammy's parents, Burt and Mitzi Fabelman, are a Jewish family who are struggling to make ends meet. Sammy's father, Burt, is a successful businessman who is also a bit of a dreamer, while his mother, Mitzi, is a kind and supportive wife and mother.\n\nAs Sammy grows older, he becomes increasingly interested in filmmaking and begins to make his own short films using a camera he receives as a gift. However, his father is skeptical of his interest in filmmaking, fearing that it will distract him from his studies and lead to a life of poverty.\n\nDespite his father's reservations, Sammy continues to pursue his passion for filmmaking, and eventually, he makes a short film that gains some attention in the community. This leads to a series of events that changes Sammy's life forever.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe Fabelmans features a talented cast of actors, including:\n\n* Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman\n* Paul Dano as Burt Fabelman\n* Michelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman\n* Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy\n* Judd Hirsch as Boris Posen\n* Julia Butters as Natalie Savage\n* Robin Bartlett as Rita\n* Oakes Fegley as John\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for The Fabelmans was first conceived by Spielberg in the 1990s.

The set design for the Fabelman's home was a key part of the production design, with Stockhausen creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that reflects the family's warm and loving relationship.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for The Fabelmans were created by Industrial Light & Magic, with Spielberg working closely with the visual effects team to achieve a seamless blend of live-action and visual effects. The visual effects were used to enhance the film's nostalgic look and to create a sense of wonder and magic.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe score for The Fabelmans was composed by John Williams, who has collaborated with Spielberg on numerous films.

The monastery complex, which includes a cathedral, a refectory, and a bell tower, has been rebuilt and restored several times throughout its history. Today, it is one of the most significant and iconic landmarks in Kiev, and a major cultural and spiritual center in Ukraine.\n\n# History\n\n## Early years\n\nThe monastery was founded in the 11th century, during the reign of Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev, with a church dedicated to the Archangel Michael. The exact date of its foundation is not known, but it is believed to have been built around 1108. The church was constructed on the site of a pagan temple, and its location was chosen for its proximity to the Dnieper River and its strategic importance in the city's defenses.\n\n## 16thâ17th centuries\n\nIn the 16th century, the monastery underwent significant changes. The church was renovated and expanded, and a new refectory was built. The monastery also became a center of learning and culture, with a scriptorium and a library. During this period, the monastery was also involved in the ecclesiastical politics of the time, with its monks playing a key role in the theological debates of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\n\n## 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery underwent significant damage during the Great Northern War. The church was destroyed, and the refectory and other buildings were severely damaged. However, the monastery was rebuilt in the late 18th century, with a new church and a new refectory constructed.\n\n## 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the monastery underwent significant changes under the leadership of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The church was renovated and expanded, and a new bell tower was built. The monastery also became a center of Ukrainian nationalism, with its monks playing a key role in the cultural and spiritual revival of Ukraine.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the monastery underwent significant changes under the Soviet regime. The church was closed, and the monastery was used as a warehouse and a storage facility. However, in the 1990s, the monastery was reopened, and it was restored to its former glory.\n\n## Demolition and aftermath\n\nIn 1935, the monastery was demolished by the Soviet authorities, as part of a wider campaign to suppress Ukrainian culture and nationalism. The church and the refectory were destroyed, and the bell tower was severely damaged. The demolition of the monastery was a devastating blow to the Ukrainian people, and it marked the beginning of a period of cultural and spiritual suppression.\n\n## Restoration\n\n### Plans and preparatory work\n\nIn the 1990s, the Ukrainian government began to plan for the restoration of the monastery. The project was led by a team of architects and historians, who worked to design a plan for the restoration of the monastery. The plan included the reconstruction of the church, the refectory, and the bell tower, as well as the creation of a new museum and a new library.\n\n### Rebuilding the monastery\n\nThe restoration of the monastery began in the early 2000s, with the reconstruction of the church and the refectory. The church was rebuilt using traditional Ukrainian techniques and materials, and it was designed to be a faithful reproduction of the original building. The refectory was also rebuilt, and it was designed to be a modern interpretation of the traditional Ukrainian architecture.\n\n### Metropolitan see\n\nIn 2006, the monastery was elevated to the status of a metropolitan see, with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate appointing a metropolitan to oversee the monastery. The appointment of the metropolitan marked a significant change in the status of the monastery, and it marked a new era in the spiritual and cultural life of Ukraine.\n\n# Architecture\n\n## Dates, styles and architects\n\nThe monastery complex has undergone significant changes throughout its history, with different architects and styles being employed at different times.

This phenomenon has occurred in various historical contexts, often as a result of regime change, conflict, or collapse of the central authority.\n\n#History\n\n##Russia (1917â1925)\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian Empire ceased to exist, and the new Bolshevik government began to establish embassies in foreign capitals. However, the Bolsheviks faced significant challenges in setting up and maintaining diplomatic relations with other countries. Many countries, including the United States, refused to recognize the new Soviet government, and diplomatic relations were cut off.\n\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, the Soviet government continued to establish diplomatic missions abroad, but these were often met with skepticism and hostility by the host countries. The Soviet Union's first diplomatic mission was established in 1918 in Berlin, but it was not recognized by the German government. Instead, it was seen as a propaganda outpost and was eventually expelled.\n\nIn 1920, the Soviet government established a diplomatic mission in London, but it was refused recognition by the British government. Instead, the British government recognized the Russian People's Republic, which had been established in 1918 as a precursor to the Soviet Union. This led to a series of diplomatic rows between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom.\n\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and the Russian government was established as the successor state. In the aftermath of the collapse, many Soviet embassies were closed, and new diplomatic missions were established in their place. The Russian government inherited the Soviet Union's diplomatic missions and continued to represent Russia abroad.\n\n##Spain (1939â1977)\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the Republican government in Spain was overthrown, and General Francisco Franco established a dictatorship. The Spanish monarchy was abolished, and a new constitution was adopted. However, the new government was not recognized by many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nIn 1939, the Spanish government established diplomatic missions in foreign capitals, but these were often met with skepticism and hostility by the host countries. The Franco regime was seen as an authoritarian and repressive regime, and many countries refused to recognize it.\n\nThe Spanish government established diplomatic missions in Germany, Italy, and other Axis powers, but these were often seen as propaganda outposts rather than genuine diplomatic missions. In the aftermath of World War II, the Spanish government's diplomatic missions were often seen as having been complicit in the Axis war effort.\n\n##Poland (1939â1990)\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish government was overthrown, and a new government was established under German and Soviet occupation. The Polish government-in-exile continued to represent Poland abroad, but it was not recognized by many countries.\n\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nIn the aftermath of the invasion, the Polish government established diplomatic missions in foreign capitals, but these were often met with skepticism and hostility by the host countries. The Polish government-in-exile was seen as a legitimate representative of Poland, but its diplomatic missions were often seen as being in competition with the new Polish government established under German and Soviet occupation.\n\nIn 1945, the Polish government established diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union, but these were often seen as being under Soviet influence. In the aftermath of World War II, the Polish government's diplomatic missions were often seen as having been complicit in the Soviet occupation of Poland.\n\n##Afghanistan (2021âpresent)\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan in 2021, the Afghan government was overthrown, and the Taliban established a new government. The Afghan government's diplomatic missions were often seen as having been complicit in the US and NATO war effort, and many countries refused to recognize the new Taliban government.\n\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nIn the aftermath of the Taliban takeover, the Afghan government established diplomatic missions in foreign capitals, but these were often met with skepticism and hostility by the host countries. The Taliban government was seen as an authoritarian and repressive regime, and many countries refused to recognize it.\n\nThe Afghan government established diplomatic missions in countries such as Pakistan, China, and Iran, but these were often seen as being under the influence of these countries. In the aftermath of the Taliban takeover, the Afghan government's diplomatic missions were often seen as being in competition with the new Taliban government established in Kabul.\n\n#See also\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* Regime change\n* Conflict\n* Collapse of the central authority\n* Embassies and diplomatic missions\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Embassy_without_a_government\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Russia (1917â1925)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n##Spain (1939â1977)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Poland (1939â1990)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Afghanistan (2021âpresent)\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges in the world, with a significant presence in the global cryptocurrency market. However, in November 2022, FTX faced a severe crisis that led to its bankruptcy and had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market.\n\n**History**\n\nFTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. The company was initially based in the Bahamas and was one of the first cryptocurrency exchanges to offer a range of derivatives products, including futures, options, and perpetual swaps. FTX quickly gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders and investors, thanks to its innovative products, low fees, and user-friendly interface.\n\nIn 2020, FTX raised $900 million in funding from various investors, including venture capital firms and hedge funds. The funding round valued the company at $18 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.\n\n**November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy**\n\n### Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, FTX's sister company, Alameda Research, was facing significant financial difficulties. Alameda was a quantitative trading firm that was known for its aggressive trading strategies and was heavily involved in the cryptocurrency markets. However, in October 2022, reports began to emerge that Alameda was facing liquidity issues and was struggling to meet its financial obligations.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reported that Alameda's balance sheet was heavily concentrated in FTX's native token, FTT. The report suggested that Alameda's liabilities exceeded its assets by a significant margin, and that the company was at risk of insolvency.\n\n### Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, announced that it would sell its entire holdings of FTT. The sale was reportedly worth $500 million and was seen as a significant blow to FTX's liquidity.\n\nIn the days that followed, FTX's native token, FTT, plummeted in value, falling by over 90%. The sell-off was exacerbated by the withdrawal of a rescue bid from Binance, which had initially expressed interest in acquiring FTX.\n\n### Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States and the Bahamas. The company's assets were frozen, and a court-appointed receiver was appointed to manage its affairs.\n\nIn the following weeks, it was revealed that FTX had engaged in a number of unauthorized transactions, including the transfer of customer funds to Alameda Research. The transactions were seen as a breach of trust and further eroded confidence in the company.\n\n### Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency markets, causing a significant sell-off in cryptocurrency prices. The market capitalization of Bitcoin fell by over 20%, and the price of Ethereum fell by over 30%.\n\nThe collapse of FTX also raised concerns about contagion, with many investors fearing that other cryptocurrency companies and exchanges could be at risk of insolvency. The incident highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n### Responses and effects\n\n#### Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on investors, many of whom had lost millions of dollars in the company's cryptocurrency trading products. The incident raised concerns about the safety and security of customer funds and highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n#### Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and exchanges, many of which were forced to freeze withdrawals and suspend trading in order to maintain liquidity. The incident highlighted the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency industry and the need for greater cooperation and coordination among participants.\n\n#### Responses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX was widely condemned by industry leaders and regulators, who called for greater regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency industry. The incident was seen as a wake-up call for the industry, highlighting the need for greater transparency, accountability, and investor protection.\n\n**Legal process**\n\nThe collapse of FTX led to a number of legal proceedings, including bankruptcy proceedings in the United States and the Bahamas. The company's assets were frozen, and a court-appointed receiver was appointed to manage its affairs.\n\nIn the following weeks, it was revealed that FTX had engaged in a number of unauthorized transactions, including the transfer of customer funds to Alameda Research. The transactions were seen as a breach of trust and further eroded confidence in the company.\n\nThe legal process surrounding FTX's collapse is ongoing, with many investors and creditors seeking to recover their losses. The incident has raised concerns about the need for greater regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n**Sponsorships**\n\nFTX was a sponsor of a number of high-profile events, including the Miami Open tennis tournament and the Formula 1 racing circuit. The company's collapse led to the termination of these sponsorships, with many partners expressing concern about the company's financial stability.\n\nThe collapse of FTX also raised concerns about the company's relationships with other partners and sponsors. The incident highlighted the need for greater due diligence and risk management in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n**References**\n\n**External links**\n\n* FTX official website\n* Alameda Research official website\n* Binance official website\n* CoinDesk official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The system is managed by the European windstorm naming committee, which is responsible for assigning names to windstorms that meet certain criteria.

The incident was a major embarrassment for the Reagan administration, and it led to a number of changes in the administration's policies.\n\n**Soviet decline and thaw in relations**\n\nReagan's administration was involved in a number of initiatives to improve relations with the Soviet Union. The administration implemented a number of policies to reduce tensions, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The treaty was signed in 1987, and it was a major breakthrough in the Cold War.\n\n**Post-presidency (1989â2004)**\n\nReagan's post-presidency was marked by a number of significant events, including his support for the Brady Bill and his diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Support for Brady Bill**\n\nReagan supported the Brady Bill, which was a bill that was designed to reduce gun violence. The bill was signed into law in 1993, and it was a major accomplishment for the gun control movement.\n\n**Alzheimer's disease**\n\nIn 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. The diagnosis was a major blow to Reagan, and it marked the beginning of a long and difficult period for him.\n\n**Death and funeral**\n\nReagan died on June 5, 2004, at the age of 93. His funeral was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and it was attended by thousands of people, including former presidents and world leaders.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nReagan's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who was committed to conservative principles, but he is also criticized for his handling of the economy and his response to the AIDS epidemic.\n\n**Historical reputation**\n\nReagan's historical reputation is still a matter of debate. Some historians view him as a great leader who was instrumental in ending the Cold War, while others view him as a divisive figure who was responsible for a number of policy failures.\n\n**Political influence**\n\nReagan's influence on American politics is still felt today. He helped to shape the Republican Party's platform and he was a major figure in the conservative movement. His legacy continues to inspire politicians and activists on the right.\n\n**References**\n\n* **Books**\n\t+ Reagan, R. (1964). _Where's the Rest of Me?_. New York: Dell.\n\t+ Reagan, R.

The siege was a key part of the larger Russian effort to capture the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and secure a land bridge to Crimea.\n\n**Background**\n\nMariupol, located in the Donetsk Oblast, had a pre-war population of around 450,000. The city had significant economic and strategic importance due to its industrial infrastructure, including the Azovstal steel plant, which was one of the largest in Europe. Mariupol was also a key transportation hub, with a major seaport and a strategic location on the Azov coast.\n\nPrior to the Russian invasion, Mariupol was a major stronghold of the Ukrainian military in the Donbas region. The city had been a key location for Ukrainian forces, who had established a significant presence there to counter the Russian-backed separatist forces in the area.\n\n**Advances to Mariupol**\n\n### Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n\nIn early February 2022, Russian forces began a series of intense artillery bombardments on Mariupol, targeting key infrastructure, including the city's airport, seaport, and industrial facilities. The shelling marked the beginning of the siege, which would last for several weeks.\n\nAs the Russian military advanced on Mariupol, Ukrainian forces attempted to hold their ground, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The city's defenses were breached, and Russian troops poured into the city, taking control of key infrastructure and strategic locations.\n\n### Mariupol surrounded\n\nBy mid-February, Mariupol was surrounded by Russian forces, with the city's residents facing severe shortages of food, water, and medical supplies. The Ukrainian military was forced to withdraw from the city, and the Russian military took control of key infrastructure, including the Azovstal steel plant.\n\n**Urban advances**\n\n### Russian push into the city\n\nAs the Russian military consolidated its control over Mariupol, it launched a series of urban advances, pushing into the city's residential areas and taking control of key buildings and infrastructure. The Ukrainian military was forced to retreat to the outskirts of the city, where they continued to resist the Russian advance.\n\nThe Russian push into the city was marked by widespread destruction and human rights abuses, including the use of siege warfare tactics, which resulted in significant civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### Final pockets of resistance\n\nBy late March, the Ukrainian military had been largely pushed out of Mariupol, and the city was under the control of Russian forces. However, small pockets of Ukrainian resistance remained, including a group of soldiers who had taken refuge in the Azovstal steel plant.\n\nThe Azovstal plant, also known as the \"Azovstal Bastion,\" became a key location for Ukrainian forces, who used it as a stronghold to resist the Russian advance. The plant's industrial facilities and underground tunnels provided a secure location for Ukrainian soldiers to launch counterattacks and coordinate their resistance efforts.\n\n**Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant**\n\n### Withdrawal to Azovstal\n\nIn late March, Ukrainian forces withdrew from the city, retreating to the Azovstal steel plant, where they established a final stronghold. The plant's industrial facilities and underground tunnels became a secure location for Ukrainian soldiers, who continued to resist the Russian advance.\n\n### Siege of Azovstal\n\nThe Azovstal plant was surrounded by Russian forces, who launched a series of intense artillery bombardments and ground assaults to try to capture the facility. The Ukrainian military, however, held out, using the plant's industrial facilities and underground tunnels to launch counterattacks and coordinate their resistance efforts.\n\nThe siege of Azovstal lasted for several weeks, with the Russian military suffering significant casualties and the Ukrainian military continuing to resist. The plant's defenders, who were largely made up of members of the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian nationalist militia, became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion.\n\n### Evacuation of civilians\n\nIn late March, the Russian military announced that it would allow the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal plant, which had been surrounded by Russian forces for several weeks. The evacuation was carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which helped to facilitate the safe passage of civilians out of the plant.\n\nHowever, the evacuation was not without controversy, with some reports suggesting that the Russian military had forced civilians to remain in the plant, using them as human shields to try to protect themselves from Ukrainian counterattacks.\n\n### Ukrainian surrender\n\nOn May 16, 2022, the Ukrainian military announced that it had surrendered at the Azovstal plant, marking the end of the siege and the fall of Mariupol. The surrender was a devastating blow to the Ukrainian military, which had held out for several weeks against the Russian advance.\n\nThe surrender was also met with widespread criticism, with many accusing the Ukrainian military of abandoning its soldiers and allowing them to be taken prisoner by the Russian military. The capture of the Azovstal plant's defenders marked a significant victory for the Russian military, which had been struggling to capture the facility for several weeks.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n\nFollowing the fall of Mariupol, the Russian military began a process of demolishing buildings and infrastructure in the city, which were deemed to be of strategic importance to the Ukrainian military. The destruction of buildings was carried out as part of a broader effort to Russify the city, which had been a key stronghold of Ukrainian nationalism.\n\nThe destruction of buildings and infrastructure was carried out in a way that was designed to humiliate and subjugate the city's residents, who were forced to live in squalid conditions and without access to basic services such as electricity and water.\n\n### Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n\nDespite the fall of Mariupol, there were still last holdouts of Ukrainian resistance in the city, who continued to fight against the Russian military. However, these holdouts were largely isolated and were eventually forced to surrender.\n\nThe capture of Ukrainian prisoners of war was a significant victory for the Russian military, which had been struggling to capture the city for several weeks. However, the treatment of prisoners of war was met with widespread criticism, with many accusing the Russian military of torture and mistreatment.\n\n### City government's role\n\nThe city government of Mariupol was severely criticized for its role in the siege, with many accusing it of abandoning its citizens and allowing them to be trapped in the city. The city government's failure to provide adequate support and services to its citizens was a major factor in the city's suffering during the siege.\n\n### Claimed cholera outbreak\n\nIn the aftermath of the siege, there were reports of a cholera outbreak in Mariupol, which was attributed to the city's lack of access to clean water and sanitation. However, the outbreak was not confirmed, and it was unclear whether it was actually a result of the siege or a separate issue.\n\n### Ukrainian missile strikes\n\nIn the aftermath of the siege, there were reports of Ukrainian missile strikes on Russian positions in Mariupol, which were designed to disrupt Russian operations and inflict casualties on Russian forces. However, the effectiveness of these strikes was unclear, and they did not appear to have a significant impact on the outcome of the siege.\n\n**Casualties**\n\n### Military casualties\n\nThe military casualties suffered during the siege of Mariupol were significant, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces suffering heavy losses. The exact number of casualties is unclear, but it is estimated that hundreds of soldiers were killed or wounded on both sides.\n\n### Civilian casualties\n\nThe civilian casualties suffered during the siege of Mariupol were also significant, with many residents of the city killed or wounded. The exact number of civilian casualties is unclear, but it is estimated that thousands of civilians were killed or wounded during the siege.\n\n**Humanitarian situation**\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Mariupol", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Siege_of_Mariupol\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Advances to Mariupol\n##Preliminary shelling and advance on the city\n##Mariupol surrounded\n#Urban advances\n##Russian push into the city\n##Final pockets of resistance\n#Resistance in the Azovstal steel plant\n##Withdrawal to Azovstal\n##Siege of Azovstal\n##Evacuation of civilians\n##Ukrainian surrender\n#Aftermath\n##Demolition of buildings and Russification of the city\n##Last Ukrainian holdouts and prisoners of war\n##City government's role\n##Claimed cholera outbreak\n##Ukrainian missile strikes\n#Casualties\n##Military casualties\n##Civilian casualties\n#Humanitarian situation\n#War crimes committed by Russian forces\n##Shooting of evacuation checkpoints\n##Maternity and children's hospital bombing\n##Regional theatre bombing\n##Mass shelling of residential areas\n##Alleged use of chemical weapons\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was called by Premier Doug Ford on May 4, 2022, after seeking a dissolution of the 42nd Parliament of Ontario.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was a significant event in the province's history, marking a return to a first-past-the-post electoral system after a brief experiment with mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in the 2018 election. The 2022 election also saw the return of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC) to power, with Doug Ford winning a second consecutive term as Premier.\n\nThe election was also notable for being the first in Canadian history in which the leader of the opposition party did not lead their party's campaign. Interim Liberal leader John Fraser led the party's campaign, while NDP leader Andrea Horwath did not run for re-election.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### 2018\n\nThe 2018 Ontario general election was held on June 7, 2018, and saw the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, win a majority government. The election was marked by controversy surrounding the party's platform and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario's (PC) decision to scrap the previous Liberal government's cap-and-trade program.\n\n### 2020\n\nThe 2020 Ontario general election was held on October 24, 2020, and saw the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, win a second consecutive majority government. The election was marked by controversy surrounding the party's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's decision to impose a state of emergency in the province.\n\n### 2021\n\nThe 2021 Ontario general election was not held, as the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, won a second consecutive majority government in 2020. However, the government did face opposition from the Liberal Party of Ontario and the New Democratic Party of Ontario, which resulted in the government passing several key pieces of legislation, including the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Act.\n\n### 2022\n\nThe 2022 Ontario general election was held on June 2, 2022, and saw the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, win a second consecutive term as the governing party. The election was marked by controversy surrounding the party's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's decision to impose a state of emergency in the province.\n\n**Campaign period**\n\n### Candidates not standing for reelection\n\nSeveral incumbent members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario announced that they would not be seeking re-election in the 2022 election. This included former Liberal cabinet ministers Ted McMeekin and Dipika Damerla, as well as several NDP and PC members.\n\n### Party slogans\n\nThe main parties in the election used the following slogans:\n\n* Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario: \"Stronger Ontario, Stronger You\"\n* Liberal Party of Ontario: \"A Better Future for Ontario\"\n* New Democratic Party of Ontario: \"People Over Profit\"\n\n### Debates\n\nThe main leaders of the parties participated in several debates throughout the election campaign, including a televised debate on June 1, 2022, hosted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).\n\n### Issues\n\nThe main issues of the election included the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare, education, and the economy. The parties also campaigned on several other issues, including climate change, housing affordability, and Indigenous reconciliation.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe 2022 Ontario general election was a significant event in the province's history, marking a return to a first-past-the-post electoral system after a brief experiment with mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in the 2018 election. The election saw the return of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC) to power, with Doug Ford winning a second consecutive term as Premier.\n\n### Endorsements\n\nThe main parties in the election received endorsements from several notable individuals and organizations, including:\n\n* Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario: Endorsed by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) and the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA)\n* Liberal Party of Ontario: Endorsed by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP)\n* New Democratic Party of Ontario: Endorsed by the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) and the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\n### Campaign polls\n\nSeveral campaign polls were conducted throughout the election period, including polls by the Angus Reid Institute, the Environics Institute, and the Forum Research poll. These polls showed the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leading the Liberal Party of Ontario and the New Democratic Party of Ontario in the polls.\n\n### Pre-campaign polls\n\nSeveral pre-campaign polls were conducted in the weeks leading up to the election, including polls by the Angus Reid Institute, the Environics Institute, and the Forum Research poll. These polls showed the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leading the Liberal Party of Ontario and the New Democratic Party of Ontario in the polls.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Synopsis of results\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario won a second consecutive majority government in the 2022 Ontario general election, winning 83 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The Liberal Party of Ontario won 24 seats, while the New Democratic Party of Ontario won 3 seats.\n\n### Post-election pendulum\n\nThe post-election pendulum is a graph showing the change in seats won by each party from one election to the next. The pendulum is used to predict the outcome of future elections.\n\n### Results summary by region\n\nThe results of the election were as follows:\n\n| Region | PC | Liberal | NDP | Other |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Toronto | 17 | 14 | 1 | 0 |\n| Peel | 9 | 6 | 1 | 0 |\n| York | 7 | 4 | 0 | 0 |\n| Durham | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 |\n| Halton | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n| Hamilton | 1 | 4 | 2 | 0 |\n| Niagara | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n| Ottawa | 10 | 6 | 0 | 0 |\n| Eastern Ontario | 11 | 5 | 0 | 0 |\n\n### Detailed results\n\nThe detailed results of the election are as follows:\n\n| Riding | Winner | Party | Votes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ajax--Pickering | Dave Leone | PC | 20,345 |\n| Ajax--Pickering--Uxbridge | Chris Ballard | Liberal | 16,513 |\n| Burlington | Jane McKenna | PC | 23,584 |\n| Cambridge | Belinda Karahalios | PC | 22,914 |\n| Carleton--Mississippi Mills | Goldie Ghez | PC | 25,196 |\n| Chatham-Kent--Leamington | Rick Nicholls | PC | 17,493 |\n| Dufferin--Caledon | Sylvia Jones | PC | 22,513 |\n| Durham | Lindsey Park | PC | 24,141 |\n| Eglinton--Lawrence | Robin Martin | PC | 17,213 |\n| Elgin--Middlesex--London | Jeff Yurek | PC | 20,441 |\n| Essex | Anthony Leard | PC | 19,163 |\n| Glengarry--Prescott--Russell | Stephane Sarrazin | PC | 20,111 |\n| Guelph | Mike Schreiner | Green | 20,351 |\n| Haldimand--Norfolk | Toby Barrett | PC | 18,341 |\n| Halton | Indira Naidoo-Harris | PC | 24,241 |\n| Halton Hills | Indira Naidoo-Harris | PC | 25,191 |\n| Hamilton Centre | Andrea Horwath | NDP | 19,815 |\n| Hamilton East--Stoney Creek | Paul Miller | NDP | 20,221 |\n| Hamilton Mountain | Monique Taylor | NDP | 19,831 |\n| Hamilton West--Ancaster--Dundas | Donna Skelly | PC | 23,531 |\n| Hastings--Lennox and Addington | Daryl Kramp | PC | 20,441 |\n| Huron--Bruce | Lisa Thompson | PC | 23,141 |\n| Kenora--Rainy River | Greg Rickford | PC | 15,531 |\n| Kingston and the Islands | Ted Hsu | Liberal | 19,421 |\n| Kitchener Centre | Laura Mae Lindo | NDP | 19,311 |\n| Kitchener-Conestoga | Mike Harris | PC | 23,141 |\n| Kitchener--Waterloo | Catherine Fife | NDP | 20,361 |\n| Lambton--Kent--Middlesex | Rick Nicholls | PC | 20,891 |\n| Lanark--Frontenac--Lennox and Addington | Steve Clark | PC | 23,591 |\n| Leeds--Grenville--Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes | Steve Clark | PC | 25,191 |\n| Leeds--Grenville--Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes | Steve Clark | PC | 25,191 |\n| London North Centre | Deborah Matthews | Liberal | 19,531 |\n| London--Fanshawe | Teresa Armstrong | NDP | 20,361 |\n| London West | Peggy Sattler | NDP | 19,531 |\n| Markham--Stouffville | Paul Calandra | PC | 23,861 |\n| Markham--Unionville | Billy Pang | PC | 24,221 |\n| Marmora and Lake | Todd Smith | PC | 21,441 |\n| Milton | Parm Gill | PC | 25,391 |\n| Mississauga Centre | Rudy Cuzzetto | PC | 21,141 |\n| Mississauga East--Cooksville | Kaleen Pataki | PC | 20,511 |\n| Mississauga--Erin Mills | Sheref Sabawy | PC | 20,891 |\n| Mississauga--Lakeshore | Sinead Morrison | PC | 21,441 |\n| Mississauga--Malton | Kaleen Pataki | PC | 23,891 |\n| Mississauga--Streetsville | Bob Delaney | Liberal | 20,231 |\n| Mississauga West--Cooksville | Rudy Cuzzetto | PC | 24,141 |\n| Nepean | Lisa MacLeod | PC | 24,861 |\n| Newmarket--Aurora | Chris Ballard | Liberal | 24,261 |\n| Niagara Falls | Wayne Gates | NDP | 20,231 |\n| Niagara West | Sam Oosterhoff | PC | 22,511 |\n| Nickel Belt | France GÃ©linas | NDP | 19,281 |\n| Nipissing | Vic Fedeli | PC | 22,141 |\n| North Bay--Parry Sound--Bruce Peninsula | Vic Fedeli | PC | 24,511 |\n| Northumberland--Peterborough--West | David Piccini | PC | 21,411 |\n| Oakville | Stephen Crawford | PC | 24,531 |\n| Oakville North--Burlington | Effie Triantafilopoulos | PC | 24,341 |\n| Oakville South--Milton | Effie Triantafilopoulos | PC | 25,591 |\n| Ottawa Centre | Yasir Naqvi | Liberal | 22,141 |\n| Ottawa East | Lucas Cuppens | Liberal | 25,011 |\n| Ottawa--Vanier | Luc ThÃ©riault | Liberal | 20,891 |\n| Ottawa West--Nepean | John Fraser | Liberal | 24,461 |\n| Oxford | Ernie Hardeman | PC | 22,611 |\n| Parkdale--High Park | Bhutila Karpoche | NDP | 20,511 |\n| Parry Sound--Muskoka | Norm Miller | PC | 24,891 |\n| Perth--Wellington | Mathew Rae | PC | 23,161 |\n| Peterborough--Kawartha | Dave Epp | PC | 24,511 |\n| Pickering--Uxbridge | Lindsey Park | PC | 21,341 |\n| Prince Edward--Hastings | Todd Smith | PC | 22,211 |\n| Queen's Park | Mike Schreiner | Green | 20,931 |\n| Rainy River--Kenora | Greg Rickford | PC | 15,831 |\n| Renfrew--Nipissing--Pembroke | John Yakabuski | PC | 24,491 |\n| Richmond Hill | Reza Moridi | Liberal | 24,241 |\n| Sarnia--Lambton | Laurie Scott | PC | 20,761 |\n| Sault Ste.

The incident has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the handling of sensitive information by the President and his staff.\n\n# Background\n\nThe discovery of classified documents began in November 2022, when Biden's personal lawyers were packing up files from his office in the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington, D.C. in preparation for the transition to a new administration. Among the files were a small number of classified documents, which were immediately turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for review and storage.\n\nThe incident has been compared to a similar situation involving former President Donald Trump, who was under investigation for his handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Both incidents have raised questions about the security and handling of sensitive information by the President and their staff.\n\n# Discoveries and other developments\n\n## First batch of documents\n\nOn November 2, 2022, Biden's personal lawyers discovered a small number of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center, which is a think tank located at the University of Pennsylvania. The documents included materials related to Ukraine, Iran, and the United Kingdom, and were marked as classified at the \"Secret\" level. The documents were immediately turned over to NARA, which launched an investigation into the matter.\n\n## DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 4, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, the White House counsel, informing him that the classified documents had been discovered and requesting that Biden's lawyers provide additional information about the documents and how they were handled. The letter also requested that Biden's lawyers provide any additional documents that may have been classified in error.\n\n## Second batch of documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, it was reported that a second batch of classified documents had been discovered at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents included materials related to Ukraine and were marked as classified at the \"Top Secret\" level. The discovery of the second batch of documents raised questions about the security and handling of sensitive information by the President and his staff.\n\n## FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 2, 2023, the FBI searched Biden's home in Wilmington as part of the investigation into the classified documents. The search was conducted with the consent of Biden and his lawyers, and was described as a \"routine\" search.\n\n## Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's home, the FBI has also searched his office at the Penn Biden Center and the offices of other members of his staff. The searches have been conducted as part of the investigation into the handling of classified information by the President and his staff.\n\n# Initial responses\n\n## Biden and his legal team\n\nPresident Biden has publicly stated that he was unaware of the classified documents and that they were stored in a safe at his home. His lawyers have also stated that the documents were handled in accordance with the law and that they were turned over to NARA as soon as they were discovered.\n\n## Elected officials\n\n### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have criticized Biden for his handling of the classified documents, with some calling for him to resign. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, has stated that the situation is \"very serious\" and that Biden's actions are \"very disturbing\".\n\n### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have defended Biden and his handling of the classified documents. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, has stated that the situation is \"not a scandal\" and that Biden's actions are \"consistent with the law\".\n\n## Media analysis\n\nThe media has widely covered the incident, with many outlets analyzing the implications of the discovery of classified documents. Some have compared the situation to the Trump incident, while others have noted that the situation is unique and requires a careful examination of the facts.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been some misinformation and speculation surrounding the incident, including claims that Biden intentionally stored the classified documents at his home. However, there is no evidence to support these claims, and the investigation has been ongoing for several months.\n\n## Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that a small number of classified documents had been discovered at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence in Indiana. The documents included materials related to national security and were marked as classified at the \"Top Secret\" level. The discovery of the classified documents at Pence's residence has raised questions about the handling of sensitive information by former government officials.\n\n# Investigations\n\n## Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the handling of classified information by the President and his staff. The special counsel is tasked with reviewing the facts and determining whether any laws were broken.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn March 2023, the special counsel announced that he had found that there was no basis for charging Biden with any crimes related to the handling of classified information.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also commented on Biden's memory, stating that he had a \"good memory\" and that he had \"relied on his staff\" to handle the classified documents.\n\n## Congressional\n\nThe incident has also been the subject of congressional hearings, with members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees questioning Biden's staff and other officials about the handling of classified information.\n\n# See also\n\n* Donald Trump classified documents incident\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The UNC's 1st Commonwealth Division, consisting of Australian, British, and New Zealand troops, was tasked with securing the Kapyong Valley and preventing a PVA advance on the city of Seoul.\n\nChinese Spring Offensive\nPreparations\n\nIn early April 1951, the PVA launched a massive spring offensive, known as the Chinese Spring Offensive, with the aim of pushing the UNC back to the 38th parallel. The PVA had been preparing for this offensive for months, gathering troops and supplies in the Kapyong Valley. On April 22, 1951, the PVA began its attack, with over 15,000 troops and 30 tanks advancing on the 1st Commonwealth Division's positions.\n\nLaunch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nThe PVA attack began at dawn on April 22, with the 117th and 118th Divisions advancing on the Australian 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) positions on Hill 504. The 3 RAR was part of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which was tasked with defending the Kapyong Valley. The PVA attack caught the 3 RAR by surprise, and the Australians were initially forced to retreat to the hill's center.\n\nSouth Korean withdrawal, 22â23 April 1951\n\nAs the PVA continued its attack, the South Korean 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, which was stationed to the south of the 3 RAR, was forced to withdraw from the battlefield. The South Koreans retreated without firing a shot, leaving the 3 RAR to face the PVA alone. The Australian battalion was now in a precarious position, with its flanks exposed and the PVA closing in on all sides.\n\nAustralian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23â24 April 1951\nNight battle\n\nOn the night of April 23, the 3 RAR launched a counterattack against the PVA, which had established a strong presence on the hill. The Australians used mortars and artillery to soften up the PVA positions, before advancing under cover of darkness. The night battle was intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nDay battle\n\nThe next day, April 24, the PVA launched a fierce attack on the 3 RAR positions on Hill 504. The Australians held their ground, using their machine guns and artillery to repel the PVA advances. However, the PVA continued to press the attack, and the Australians were eventually forced to retreat from the hill.\n\n3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the 3 RAR withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) arrived on the scene, taking up positions on Hill 677. The Canadians were tasked with holding the hill and preventing a PVA advance on the Kapyong Valley.\n\nCanadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24â25 April 1951\nPreparations\n\nThe 2 PPCLI prepared for a final stand on Hill 677, knowing that the PVA would launch a massive attack on the hill. The Canadians dug in, using their trenches and fortifications to prepare for the coming battle.\n\nNight battle\n\nOn the night of April 24, the PVA launched a fierce attack on the 2 PPCLI positions on Hill 677. The Canadians held their ground, using their machine guns and artillery to repel the PVA advances. However, the PVA continued to press the attack, and the Canadians were eventually forced to retreat from the hill.\n\nFinal 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nAs the 2 PPCLI retreated from Hill 677, they launched a series of attacks against the PVA, attempting to disrupt their advance. The Canadians fought bravely, but were ultimately forced to abandon the hill.\n\nAftermath\nSummary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a brutal and intense engagement, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Canadians lost over 400 men, while the Australians lost over 200. The PVA also suffered significant casualties, with estimates suggesting that over 1,000 troops were killed or wounded.\n\nAwards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was one of the most significant engagements of the Korean War, and it was recognized as a heroic effort by the United Nations Command. The 2 PPCLI was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for their bravery and sacrifice during the battle.\n\nSubsequent operations\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong marked a turning point in the Korean War, with the UNC launching a series of counterattacks against the PVA. The UNC's 1st Commonwealth Division continued to fight bravely, but the PVA remained a significant threat throughout the war.\n\nSee also\n\n* Battle of the Imjin River\n* Battle of Maryang San\n* Korean War\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\nCitations\nReferences\nFurther reading", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22â23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23â24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24â25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are the largest ethnic group in the province, making up around 35% of the population. The Bugis have a rich and complex history, with a unique culture that has been shaped by their geographical location, interactions with other ethnic groups, and their own distinct identity.\n\n**Origins and antecedents**\n\n### **Toalean â Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi**\n\nThe origins of the Bugis people date back to the pre-Austronesian era in South Sulawesi. The Toalean culture, which flourished in the region from around 1000 BCE to 1500 CE, is believed to be one of the precursors to the modern Bugis people. The Toalean culture was known for its sophisticated tools, agriculture, and trade networks. Although there is limited archaeological evidence, it is thought that the Toalean people may have been influenced by the Austronesian migrations that took place in the region.\n\n### **The arrival of Austronesians**\n\nBetween 500 BCE and 500 CE, Austronesian-speaking peoples arrived in South Sulawesi, replacing or displacing the pre-Austronesian populations. These new arrivals brought with them new technologies, languages, and cultural practices that would eventually shape the modern Bugis identity. The Austronesians settled in the region, developing complex societies and establishing trade networks with other ethnic groups.\n\n### **Tana Ogi â Land of the Bugis**\n\nThe name \"Bugis\" is derived from the term \"Tana Ogi,\" which means \"Land of the Bugis\" in the Bugis language. This name reflects the Bugis people's connection to their ancestral homeland in South Sulawesi. According to legend, the Bugis people were created by the god of the sea, who brought them to the island of Sulawesi to establish a new society.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Early society**\n\nThe early Bugis society was characterized by a complex system of kinship and social hierarchy. The people lived in small villages, with each village having its own leader and social structure. The Bugis people were skilled farmers, growing crops such as rice, maize, and sugarcane. They were also skilled artisans, producing textiles, jewelry, and other crafts.\n\n### **The growth of Bugis kingdoms**\n\nAs the Bugis people developed, they established a series of kingdoms that would eventually become the dominant powers in the region. The most notable of these kingdoms was the Bugis kingdom of Gowa, which was founded in the 13th century. The kingdom of Gowa was a major trading center, controlling the flow of goods and people between the island of Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia.\n\n### **Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula**\n\nIn the 15th century, a new power emerged in the region: the kingdom of Tallo. The kingdom of Tallo was a powerful and influential state that would eventually challenge the dominance of the kingdom of Gowa. The kingdom of Tallo was known for its sophisticated military and administrative systems, which allowed it to expand its territories and establish a strong economy.\n\n### **Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century**\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis-Makassar society was characterized by a complex system of social hierarchy and kinship. The people lived in large cities, with each city having its own leader and social structure. The Bugis-Makassar people were skilled traders, merchants, and artisans. They were also skilled warriors, with a strong military tradition.\n\n### **Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states**\n\nIn the 16th century, the Portuguese established a presence in the region, attempting to Christianize the Bugis states. However, the Bugis people resisted the attempts to convert them to Christianity, maintaining their traditional animist and Islamic faiths.\n\n### **Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis people began to expand their territories, seeking to establish themselves as the dominant power in the region. They established a series of alliances with other ethnic groups, expanding their influence and power over the peninsula.\n\n### **The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar**\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar people began to convert to Islam, which would eventually become the dominant faith in the region. The conversion to Islam was a gradual process, with many Bugis people retaining their traditional animist and indigenous faiths.\n\n### **The twilight of dominance**\n\nIn the 18th century, the Bugis people's dominance over the peninsula began to decline. The kingdom of Gowa was weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures, leading to its eventual collapse. The kingdom of Tallo also declined, as the Bugis people's power and influence began to wane.\n\n### **A new golden age**\n\nIn the 19th century, the Bugis people experienced a new golden age, as they established a series of new states and kingdoms. The kingdom of Bone, which was founded in the 19th century, became a major power in the region, controlling the flow of goods and people between the island of Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### **Language and dialects**\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family, which is spoken by around 8 million people in Indonesia. The Bugis language has a complex grammar and syntax, with a rich vocabulary that reflects the people's history and culture.\n\n### **Philosophy**\n\nBugis philosophy is characterized by a complex system of cosmology and spirituality. The people believe in a complex pantheon of gods and goddesses, each with its own powers and attributes. The Bugis people also believe in the concept of \"adat,\" which refers to their traditional customs and social norms.\n\n### **Traditional script**\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique traditional script, which is used to write their language. The script is a combination of logograms and phonetic symbols, which reflect the people's history and cultural traditions.\n\n### **Folklore and literary traditions**\n\nBugis folklore is characterized by a rich tradition of stories and legends, which reflect the people's history and cultural traditions.

The song was written and produced by Lady Gaga and RedOne, who is also credited as an executive producer on the album. The song was released as the fifth single from the album on November 20, 2011, by Interscope Records.\n\n**Influences and Lyrical Content**\n\nThe song's lyrics are inspired by a combination of Catholic guilt and the idea of a vengeful spirit. Lady Gaga has stated that the song's title character is a metaphor for the repressed emotions and desires that people hide behind their public personas.\n\n### Thematic Analysis\n\nThe song's themes are centered around the idea of confronting one's inner demons and embracing the truth about oneself. The lyrics describe a person who is haunted by their own guilt and shame, and is unable to shake off the feeling of being watched and judged by others. The song's title character, Bloody Mary, is a symbol of the repressed emotions and desires that people hide behind their public personas.\n\nThe song's lyrics also touch on the idea of the Catholic Church's influence on people's lives, particularly in regards to guilt and shame. Lady Gaga has stated that she was influenced by the Catholic Church's teachings on sin and redemption, and wanted to explore the idea of how these teachings can be used to control people's behavior.\n\nThe song's themes are also reflective of Lady Gaga's own experiences with the Catholic Church, having attended a Catholic school as a child. Lady Gaga has stated that she was bullied and ostracized by her classmates for being different, and that the Church's teachings on sin and redemption only added to her feelings of guilt and shame.\n\n**Recording and Composition**\n\nThe song was recorded at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California, and was produced by RedOne. The song's composition is a dark, atmospheric sound that features a combination of electronic and organic elements. The song's tempo is moderate, with a steady beat that builds up to a frenetic pace towards the end.\n\nThe song's instrumentation features a combination of synthesized leads, distorted guitars, and driving drums. The song's chorus is marked by a catchy, sing-along melody that features a repetitive hook. The song's bridge features a haunting vocal performance by Lady Gaga, who delivers a emotive and intense performance that showcases her vocal range and control.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the song's dark and atmospheric sound, as well as Lady Gaga's vocal performance. Rolling Stone praised the song's \"sinister, synth-heavy beat\" and Lady Gaga's \"haunting\" vocals. The New York Times praised the song's \"electronic dance floor rhythms\" and Lady Gaga's \"athletic\" vocals.\n\nHowever, not all reviews were positive, with some critics finding the song's themes and lyrics to be too dark and morbid. The Los Angeles Times criticized the song's \"clunky\" production and Lady Gaga's \"over-the-top\" vocals. The Chicago Tribune praised the song's \"frenetic energy\" but found Lady Gaga's vocals to be \"shrill\" and \"grating\".\n\n**Single Release and Media Appearances**\n\nThe song was released as a single on November 20, 2011, by Interscope Records. The song's music video, directed by Nick Knight, premiered on Vevo on November 21, 2011. The video features Lady Gaga as the title character, a vengeful spirit who seeks revenge on her tormentors.\n\nThe song has been featured on several media outlets, including the TV shows Glee and American Horror Story: Asylum. The song's remix, featuring hip-hop artist 2 Chainz, was released on January 8, 2013.\n\n**Commercial Performance**\n\nThe song was a commercial success, debuting at number 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and reaching number 1 on the US Dance Club Songs chart.

The song's music video has been viewed over 100 million times on Vevo.\n\n**Remix Versions**\n\nSeveral remix versions of the song have been released, featuring artists such as 2 Chainz, DJ White Shadow, and Nick Monson. The remixes feature a darker and more experimental sound than the original, with added elements of electronic dance music and hip-hop.\n\n**Live Performances**\n\nLady Gaga has performed the song live on several occasions, including during her Born This Way Ball tour in 2012-2013. The song's live performance features a high-energy stage show, with Lady Gaga performing the song while surrounded by a dark and moody lighting rig.\n\n**Credits and Personnel**\n\n* Lady Gaga - vocals, songwriting\n* RedOne - production, songwriting, executive production\n* Nick Monson - production, keyboards\n* Fernando Garibay - guitar, keyboards\n* DJ White Shadow - drums, percussion\n* 2 Chainz - vocals (remix version)\n* Nick Knight - music video direction\n* Terry Richardson - photography\n\n**Charts**\n\n* US Billboard Hot 100: 3\n* US Dance Club Songs: 1\n* US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay: 1\n* US Billboard Mainstream Top 40: 1\n* US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs: 2\n* US Billboard Hot Rap Songs: 2\n* Canadian Hot 100: 1\n* UK Singles Chart: 5\n* Australian Singles Chart: 2\n* Irish Singles Chart: 2\n* Dutch Singles Chart: 6\n* Swedish Singles Chart: 3\n* Swiss Singles Chart: 4\n\n**Certifications and Sales**\n\n* RIAA: Platinum (2,000,000 copies sold)\n* BPI: Gold (400,000 copies sold)\n* MC: Gold (40,000 copies sold)\n* ARIA: Platinum (70,000 copies sold)\n* IFPI: Platinum (30,000 copies sold)\n* SNEP: Gold (50,000 copies sold)\n\n**Release History**\n\n* November 20, 2011: Released as a single by Interscope Records\n* November 21, 2011: Music video premiered on Vevo\n* January 8, 2013: Remix featuring 2 Chainz released\n* 2012-2013: Featured on Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball tour", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bloody_Mary_(song)\" following this outline:\n\n#Influences and lyrical content\n##Thematic analysis\n#Recording and composition\n#Critical reception\n#Single release and media appearances\n#Commercial performance\n#Remix versions\n#Live performances\n#Credits and personnel\n#Charts\n#Certifications and sales\n#Release history\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are predominantly Shia Twelvers, with smaller communities of Alawites and Isma'ilis. This article provides an overview of the history, sub-groups, geographic distribution, demographics, genetics, and notable individuals of Lebanese Shia Muslims.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\nThe origins of Shia Islam in Lebanon date back to the early Islamic period. Shia Muslims were a minority in the region during the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, but they maintained a strong presence in the country.\n\nEarly Islamic period\n-------------------\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, the Shia community in Lebanon was largely made up of converts from the indigenous population. Shia Muslims played a significant role in the region's politics and trade, and their culture and traditions developed distinct differences from those of their Sunni counterparts.\n\nMamluk period\n--------------\n\nThe Mamluk period saw the rise of Shia Islam as a dominant force in Lebanon. The Mamluks, a Turkish slave-soldier caste, ruled Egypt and Syria from the 13th to the 16th century. Shia Muslims played a key role in the Mamluk administration, with many Shia clerics serving as advisors to the Mamluk sultans.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule\n----------------\n\nThe Ottoman Empire conquered Lebanon in the 16th century, bringing Shia Islam under its control. During this period, Shia Muslims faced significant repression, including the forced conversion of many Shia to Sunni Islam. Despite these challenges, the Shia community continued to maintain its distinct identity and traditions.\n\nRelations with Safavid Iran\n-------------------------\n\nThe Safavid dynasty, which ruled Iran from the 16th to the 18th century, played a significant role in the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon. The Safavids were Shia Muslims who sought to promote Shia Islam throughout their empire, including in Lebanon. Shia Muslims in Lebanon were influenced by Safavid teachings and traditions, and many Lebanese Shia Muslims maintained close ties with their Shia counterparts in Iran.\n\nFrench mandate period\n--------------------\n\nThe French mandate period (1920-1946) saw significant changes in the lives of Lebanese Shia Muslims. The French colonial authorities introduced a new education system, which emphasized Western-style education and secularism. Shia Muslims in Lebanon were encouraged to adopt Western values and customs, leading to significant changes in their cultural identity.\n\nEducation\n---------\n\nThe French introduced a modern education system in Lebanon, which emphasized the study of European languages, history, and culture. Many Shia Muslims took advantage of this new system, leading to a significant increase in literacy rates and educational attainment among the Shia population.\n\nJa'fari shar'ia courts\n--------------------\n\nThe French also introduced a system of Ja'fari shar'ia courts, which were designed to provide Shia Muslims with a separate legal system. These courts were based on Shia Islamic law and provided Shia Muslims with a sense of justice and equality under the law.\n\nSub-groups\n\nShia Twelvers (Metouali)\n----------------------\n\nShia Twelvers are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon, making up approximately 90% of the Shia population. They follow the teachings of the 12th Shia Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed to be in occultation and will return as the Mahdi. Shia Twelvers believe in the importance of following the imams and the hadiths, or sayings, of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nAlawites\n---------\n\nAlawites are a Shia sub-group in Lebanon who follow a distinct set of beliefs and traditions. They are estimated to make up approximately 2% of the Shia population in Lebanon. Alawites believe in the importance of rituals and ceremonies, and they have a distinct system of initiation and hierarchical structure.\n\nIsma'ilis\n---------\n\nIsma'ilis are a Shia sub-group in Lebanon who follow the teachings of the Isma'ili imams. They are estimated to make up approximately 1% of the Shia population in Lebanon. Isma'ilis believe in the importance of the imams and the hadiths, and they have a distinct system of spiritual guidance and authority.\n\nGeographic distribution within Lebanon\n\nShia Muslims are concentrated in certain regions of Lebanon, including the cities of Beirut, Sidon, and Tyre. They are also found in the Beqaa Valley, which is a fertile region in eastern Lebanon. Shia Muslims make up approximately 25% of the population in the Beqaa Valley, which is one of the most densely populated regions in Lebanon.\n\nDemographics\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, the Shia Muslim population in Lebanon is estimated to be approximately 1.6 million people, which is approximately 27% of the country's population. Shia Muslims are the second-largest religious group in Lebanon, after the Sunni Muslim population.\n\nGenetics\n\nStudies have shown that Shia Muslims in Lebanon have a distinct genetic profile compared to other Lebanese populations. Shia Muslims have a higher frequency of certain genetic markers, such as the M2 marker, which is associated with Middle Eastern ancestry.\n\nNotable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n\nReligious figures\n----------------\n\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah: A prominent Shia cleric who served as the spiritual leader of the Lebanese Shia community.\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Mahdi Shamsuddin: A prominent Shia cleric who served as the mufti of the Lebanese Shia community.\n* Sayyed Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah: A prominent Shia cleric who served as the spiritual leader of the Lebanese Shia community.\n\nPolitical figures\n----------------\n\n* Nabih Berri: The Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament and a prominent Shia politician.\n* Ammar Houri: A prominent Shia politician and former minister.\n* Ali Al-Amin: A prominent Shia politician and former minister.\n\nAcademics\n----------\n\n* Sayyed Mohammad Ali Hajj: A prominent Shia scholar and historian who has written extensively on Shia history and culture.\n* Sayyed Ali Al-Amin: A prominent Shia scholar and historian who has written extensively on Shia history and culture.\n\nArtists, singers and journalists\n-------------------------------\n\n* Wadih Saab: A prominent Shia singer and composer who has written and performed numerous songs on Shia themes.\n* Saad Lamjarred: A prominent Shia singer and composer who has written and performed numerous songs on Shia themes.\n* Ali Khaled: A prominent Shia journalist and writer who has written extensively on Shia history and culture.\n\nSee also\n\n* Shia Islam\n* Lebanese people\n* Lebanese Muslims\n* Shia Muslims in the Middle East\n\nExternal links\n\n* \"Shia Muslims in Lebanon\" by the Pew Research Center\n* \"Lebanese Shia Muslims\" by the World Factbook\n* \"Shia Islam in Lebanon\" by the Encyclopedia Britannica", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
