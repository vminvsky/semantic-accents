{"title": "History_of_fantasy", "content": "#Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n#Development of fantasy\n##Romances\n##The Enlightenment\n##Romanticism\n#Modern fantasy\n##Pre-Tolkien\n##Tolkien\n##Post-Tolkien\n#References\n##Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**History of Fantasy**\n\nFantasy is a genre of fiction that has been a part of human culture for thousands of years, evolving from ancient mythologies and folklores to the complex and diverse forms of modern fantasy literature, art, and media. This article explores the history of fantasy, tracing its development from the earliest fantastic works to the modern forms of fantasy that dominate popular culture today.\n\n**Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works**\n\nWhile fantasy is often associated with the supernatural, the irrational, and the fictional, earlier works of literature and mythology also featured fantastical elements. However, the key difference between these earlier works and modern fantasy is the level of self-awareness and deliberate creation of a fictional world. In earlier works, fantastical elements were often embedded in a historical or mythological context, whereas modern fantasy typically creates a separate, fictional world with its own rules and logic.\n\nIn ancient Greece, for example, mythology was a vital part of everyday life, and fantastical creatures like the Minotaur and the Chimera were an integral part of the mythological landscape. However, these creatures were not created for entertainment purposes but were seen as explanations for natural phenomena or the workings of the gods. Similarly, medieval romances and chivalric tales featured fantastical elements, but these were often justified within a framework of Christian morality and the chivalric code.\n\nIn contrast, modern fantasy often blurs the boundaries between reality and fantasy, creating a separate, fictional world that is designed to entertain and engage the reader or audience. This shift in attitude towards fantasy reflects a growing awareness of the power of storytelling and the importance of imagination in shaping our understanding of the world.\n\n**Development of fantasy**\n\nThe development of fantasy as a distinct genre can be seen in three main phases: the Romances, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism.\n\n### **Romances**\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, romance was a popular form of literature that often featured fantastical elements. These tales of chivalry and adventure, such as Sir Thomas Malory's _Le Morte d'Arthur_ and Geoffrey Chaucer's _The Canterbury Tales_, were often set in a world of magic and wonder, where knights and ladies played out their roles in a fantastical landscape. While these works were not self-consciously \"fantasy\" in the modern sense, they helped lay the groundwork for later developments in the genre.\n\n### **The Enlightenment**\n\nThe Enlightenment marked a significant shift in attitudes towards fantasy and the supernatural. As rationalism and empiricism gained prominence, fantastical elements were often seen as a relic of a bygone era, a sign of superstition and ignorance. Writers like Voltaire and David Hume dismissed fantasy as a form of \"bad reasoning\" and encouraged readers to focus on the rational and the scientific. However, this rejection of fantasy also laid the groundwork for later developments in the genre, as writers began to explore the possibilities of fantasy as a form of social commentary and critique.\n\n### **Romanticism**\n\nRomanticism, which emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, marked a significant turning point in the development of fantasy. Writers like Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Percy Bysshe Shelley explored the possibilities of fantasy as a form of art and imagination, often incorporating elements of horror, the supernatural, and the irrational. Works like Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ and John Keats's _The Eve of St. Agnes_ helped establish fantasy as a major literary genre, paving the way for later developments in the genre.\n\n**Modern fantasy**\n\nModern fantasy has its roots in the 19th century, but it is the 20th century that saw the rise of fantasy as a major literary and cultural force. This section explores the three main phases of modern fantasy: Pre-Tolkien, Tolkien, and Post-Tolkien.\n\n### **Pre-Tolkien**\n\nBefore J.R.R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_, fantasy was often associated with children's literature, fairy tales, and mythology. Writers like Andrew Lang and W.H. Auden explored the possibilities of fantasy, but their works were often seen as minor or marginal. However, this period also saw the rise of fantasy in other forms, such as pulp fiction and science fiction. Writers like H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs helped establish fantasy as a major genre in popular culture, paving the way for later developments.\n\n### **Tolkien**\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_ (1954-1955) marked a significant turning point in the development of modern fantasy. Tolkien's creation of Middle-earth, a fully realized and detailed fantasy world, helped establish fantasy as a major literary genre. His use of mythology, linguistics, and world-building helped create a sense of depth and complexity that had not been seen before in fantasy. Tolkien's influence can be seen in many later works of fantasy, from the works of C.S. Lewis to the modern fantasy novels of George R.R. Martin.\n\n### **Post-Tolkien**\n\nThe post-Tolkien era saw a significant expansion of fantasy in popular culture, with the rise of fantasy novels, films, and television series. Writers like Ursula K. Le Guin, Neil Gaiman, and Patrick Rothfuss explored new themes and ideas in fantasy, often incorporating elements of science fiction, horror, and mythology. The rise of urban fantasy, which combines fantasy with modern-day settings and themes, also saw a significant expansion in the genre. Works like _The Dresden Files_ and _The Hollows_ series helped establish urban fantasy as a major genre, paving the way for later developments.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading on the history of fantasy, see:\n\n* _The Oxford Handbook of Fantasy Literature_ edited by Farah Mendlesohn and Evan Ellenberg\n* _The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature_ edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn\n* _The Evolution of Fantasy Literature_ by Brian Attebery\n* _The Genre of Fantasy_ by Farah Mendlesohn\n* _The History of Fantasy_ by Michael Drayton\n\nNote: This article is not a comprehensive bibliography, but rather a selection of relevant sources for further reading.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"History_of_fantasy\" following this outline:\n\n#Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works\n#Development of fantasy\n##Romances\n##The Enlightenment\n##Romanticism\n#Modern fantasy\n##Pre-Tolkien\n##Tolkien\n##Post-Tolkien\n#References\n##Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The tournament features national teams from around the world, competing in a round-robin and knockout format.\n\nBackground\n\nThe concept of an international baseball tournament dates back to the 1930s, but it was not until the 1990s that the idea gained momentum. The WBSC, which was then known as the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), began exploring the possibility of an international tournament. The first World Baseball Classic was initially proposed for 2001, but it was delayed due to various reasons, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent decline in baseball popularity in the United States.\n\nHistory\n\n2006–09: Samurai Japan's back-to-back championships\n\nThe first World Baseball Classic was held in 2006, with 16 national teams participating.

This concept has evolved over time, with different sports adopting varying degrees of substitution rules to balance the need for player safety, team strategy, and game flow.\n\n## Sports that allow free substitution\n\nSome sports permit free substitution during live play, allowing teams to make changes to their lineup at any time. This approach is often seen in sports with a strong emphasis on strategy and player rotation, where teams aim to exploit specific player matchups or create favorable game situations.\n\n### Examples of sports with free substitution\n\n* Basketball: In most professional and collegiate basketball leagues, teams can substitute players freely during stoppages in play or between possessions. This allows coaches to adjust their lineup, manage player fatigue, and exploit defensive weaknesses.\n* Volleyball: Similar to basketball, volleyball teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play or between rotations. This enables coaches to rotate players, create favorable matchups, and exploit defensive vulnerabilities.\n* Water Polo: In water polo, teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play or between quarters. This allows coaches to rotate players, manage player fatigue, and exploit defensive weaknesses.\n\n## Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n\nSome sports permit unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play, but not during live play. This approach balances the need for player safety and team strategy with the need to maintain game flow.\n\n### Examples of sports with unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play\n\n* American Football: In the National Football League (NFL) and most collegiate football leagues, teams can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play, such as between plays or during timeouts. However, teams are limited to a certain number of players on the field at any given time.\n* Rugby: In most forms of rugby, teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as between scrums or lineouts. However, teams are limited to a certain number of players on the field at any given time.\n* Hockey (Field and Ice): In field hockey and ice hockey, teams can make substitutions during stoppages in play, such as between goals or during timeouts. However, teams are limited to a certain number of players on the field or ice at any given time.\n\n## Sports with limited substitution\n\nSome sports impose restrictions on the number of substitutions allowed during the game, which can create strategic challenges for teams.\n\n### Examples of sports with limited substitutions\n\n* Soccer: In most professional and collegiate soccer leagues, teams are limited to three substitutions per game, with the option to make additional substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n* Cricket: In most forms of cricket, teams are limited to two substitutions per innings, with the option to make additional substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n* Baseball: In most professional and collegiate baseball leagues, teams are limited to three substitutions per game, with the option to make additional substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n\n## Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n\nSome sports permit substitution only to replace injured players, which can create strategic challenges for teams.\n\n### Examples of sports with substitution only for injured players\n\n* Boxing: In professional boxing, fighters can only substitute if they are injured and unable to continue the fight.\n* Wrestling: In professional wrestling, competitors can only substitute if they are injured and unable to continue the match.\n* Martial Arts: In many martial arts competitions, competitors can only substitute if they are injured and unable to continue the match.\n\n## Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\nSome sports have mixed or hybrid systems, where different rules apply depending on the level of competition or the specific game situation.\n\n### Examples of sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n\n* Australian Rules Football: In Australian Rules football, teams are limited to a certain number of substitutions during the game, but can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n* Gaelic Football: In Gaelic football, teams are limited to a certain number of substitutions during the game, but can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n* Netball: In netball, teams are limited to a certain number of substitutions during the game, but can make unlimited substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players.\n\n## See also\n\n* Player rotation\n* Player safety\n* Game flow\n* Tactical strategy\n* Sports rules\n\n## Notes\n\n* The specific rules and regulations for free substitution can vary depending on the level of competition and the specific sport.\n* In some sports, teams may be able to make additional substitutions during stoppages in play for injured players, but may be limited to a certain number of substitutions overall.\n* The rules for free substitution can also vary depending on the specific game situation, such as during overtime or during the final minutes of the game.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Free_substitution\" following this outline:\n\n#Sports that allow free substitution\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitution during live play\n##Sports that allow unlimited substitutions during stoppages of play only\n#Sports with limited substitution\n##Sports that allow a limited number of substitutions\n##Sports that only allow substitution to replace injured players\n#Sports with mixed or hybrid systems\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS, the game follows the story of a young man named Sissel who becomes a \"phantom detective\" after his death.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nGameplay in Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective involves solving puzzles to progress through the story. The game's protagonist, Sissel, has the ability to possess objects and use their abilities to interact with the environment. The game is divided into chapters, each with its own set of puzzles to solve. Players must use their wits to solve these puzzles, often by manipulating objects in the environment to reach hidden items or unlock new paths.\n\nOne of the unique features of Ghost Trick is its use of time manipulation. Sissel can rewind, fast-forward, and pause time to solve puzzles and avoid obstacles. This mechanic is used in creative ways throughout the game, often requiring players to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions.\n\nThe game also features a \" Phantom Detective\" mode, where players take on the role of a detective who must solve a murder mystery. This mode is separate from the main story and features its own set of puzzles and challenges.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game's story follows Sissel, a young man who is on his way to meet his girlfriend, Lisette, when he is killed in a car accident. However, instead of dying, Sissel becomes a \"phantom detective,\" a spirit who can possess objects and use their abilities to interact with the environment.\n\nAs Sissel navigates the world as a phantom, he discovers that he has the ability to manipulate time and use it to his advantage. He soon learns that he is not alone in the world, and that there are other phantoms like him who are also trying to solve a mystery.\n\nThroughout the game, Sissel encounters a cast of characters who are all struggling with their own personal demons. He must use his abilities to help them and uncover the truth behind their struggles. As he delves deeper into the mystery, Sissel discovers that he has a connection to the world that he had not previously realized.\n\n**Development**\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective was developed by Shu Takumi, a renowned game designer who is also known for his work on the Ace Attorney series. Takumi was inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock and the film \"Rear Window\" when creating the game's story and gameplay.\n\n**Art and Game Design**\n\nThe game's art style is a unique blend of cartoonish and realistic elements.

The strike began on July 14, 2023, and lasted for 137 days, ending on October 28, 2023.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike was the largest labor dispute in the history of the American entertainment industry. The strike was sparked by a dispute over wage and working conditions, as well as a desire for greater creative control and residual payments for actors and other performers. The strike had significant implications for the film and television industry, with many productions halted or delayed due to the walkout.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Unionization in Hollywood**\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG) was founded in 1933 by a group of actors who sought to establish a union to negotiate better wages and working conditions. In 2012, the SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) merged to form SAG-AFTRA, which now represents over 160,000 members in the entertainment industry. SAG-AFTRA is one of the largest and most influential labor unions in the United States.\n\n### **Pre-strike activity**\n\nIn the months leading up to the strike, SAG-AFTRA leaders and members engaged in a series of negotiations with the AMPTP over various issues, including wage increases, residual payments, and working conditions. These negotiations were unsuccessful, and the union leadership decided to authorize a strike, which was overwhelmingly approved by the membership.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### **July**\n\nThe strike began on July 14, 2023, with a rally in Los Angeles and picket lines set up outside major studios and production facilities. The first major production to be affected by the strike was the Netflix series \"Stranger Things,\" which was forced to shut down production due to the walkout.\n\n### **August**\n\nIn August, the strike continued, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios and production facilities across the country. The union also launched a series of protests and rallies in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\n### **September**\n\nIn September, the AMPTP offered a proposal to the SAG-AFTRA leadership, which included a 10% wage increase and improved working conditions. However, the union rejected the offer, citing concerns over residual payments and creative control.\n\n### **October**\n\nIn October, the strike continued, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios and production facilities across the country. The union also launched a series of protests and rallies in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\n### **November**\n\nIn November, the AMPTP offered a revised proposal to the SAG-AFTRA leadership, which included a 12% wage increase and improved working conditions. However, the union rejected the offer, citing concerns over residual payments and creative control.\n\n### **December**\n\nIn December, the strike continued, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios and production facilities across the country. The union also launched a series of protests and rallies in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\n**Strike activity and responses**\n\n### **Locations**\n\nThe strike affected productions across the country, with SAG-AFTRA members picketing outside studios and production facilities in major cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Miami.\n\n### **Media executives' response**\n\nThe media executives responded to the strike by offering concessions, including wage increases and improved working conditions. However, the union rejected these offers, citing concerns over residual payments and creative control.\n\n### **Politicians' response**\n\nSeveral politicians, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, expressed support for the SAG-AFTRA strike and the union's demands.\n\n### **Other unions' response**\n\nSeveral other unions, including the Writers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, expressed support for the SAG-AFTRA strike and the union's demands.\n\n### **Other organizations' response**\n\nSeveral other organizations, including the National Association of Theatre Owners and the Producers Guild of America, expressed opposition to the SAG-AFTRA strike and the union's demands.\n\n### **Impact**\n\nThe strike had significant implications for the film and television industry, with many productions halted or delayed due to the walkout. The strike also had an impact on the economy, with some estimates suggesting that the strike cost the industry over $1 billion in lost revenue.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe strike ended on October 28, 2023, with the SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP reaching a tentative agreement on a new contract. The agreement included wage increases, improved working conditions, and greater creative control for actors and other performers. However, some SAG-AFTRA members expressed concerns over the agreement, citing concerns over residual payments and other issues.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n* Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers\n* Film and television industry\n* Labor unions\n* Residuals\n* Working conditions\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.

The film is a dark reimagining of the classic children's stories of Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey is a horror film that deviates from the traditional depiction of A.A.

This article provides an overview of the film's production, marketing, and reception.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a dark and twisted version of the Hundred Acre Wood, where Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet are on a mission to hunt and kill humans. Pooh, fueled by his insatiable hunger, has become a ruthless and bloodthirsty creature, while Piglet has become his unwilling accomplice. The story follows a group of friends who venture into the woods, unaware of the terror that awaits them.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Paul McCaffrey as Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Natasha Radski as Piglet\n* Duayne Boachie as Christopher Robin\n* Kristina Kacheva as Kanga\n* Nick Hart as Roo\n* Alex Loftus as Rabbit\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey originated from a short film concept created by Chris Barton-Stubbs.

The project gained traction, and Barton-Stubbs decided to expand the concept into a feature-length film.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey took place in the summer of 2021 in the United Kingdom. The film's budget was relatively low, with an estimated £50,000. The production team made use of practical effects to bring the twisted and nightmarish version of the Hundred Acre Wood to life.\n\n### Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Jim Williams, a British film composer known for his work on various horror and thriller films. Williams' score added to the film's eerie and unsettling atmosphere, perfectly capturing the tone of the dark reimagining.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was intentionally provocative, with the film's posters and trailers featuring gruesome and disturbing imagery. The goal was to generate buzz and attract attention from fans of horror films, as well as those who were curious about the film's unique approach.\n\n### Home media\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey was released on various digital platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, and iTunes, on January 28, 2022. The film was also available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey performed reasonably well at the box office, considering its low budget and limited release. The film grossed approximately £200,000 in the United Kingdom, with an additional £50,000 earned from international markets.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique approach and others criticizing its amateurish production values. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 42% approval rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 4.2/10.\n\n### Accolades\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey received several nominations for various awards, including the 2022 British Independent Film Awards and the 2022 Fangoria Chainsaw Awards.\n\n**Future**\n\n### Sequel\n\nA sequel to Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey has been announced, with Chris Barton-Stubbs returning as director and writer. The project is currently in development, with a release date yet to be confirmed.\n\n### Shared universe and other projects\n\nThe success of Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey has spawned a shared universe, with various other projects in development, including a television series and a video game. The shared universe will explore the darker side of the Hundred Acre Wood, introducing new characters and storylines that expand on the original concept.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Christopher Robin (2018 film)\n* The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\n* A.A.

Born on April 8, 1937, in Chicago, Illinois, Hersh is best known for his groundbreaking investigations into the Vietnam War, the Iran-Contra affair, and the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nHersh grew up in a Jewish family in Chicago's South Side. His father, Jacob Hersh, was a dairyman, and his mother, Dora (née Rosenfeld), was a homemaker. Hersh's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, but his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and a love of learning. He attended South Shore High School, where he developed a passion for writing and journalism.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1954, Hersh attended the University of Chicago, where he studied English literature and began to develop his skills as a writer. He dropped out of college in 1956 to join the U.S. Army, where he served for two years as a mortar gunner in the 8th Infantry Division in Europe.\n\n**Newspaper career**\n\nAfter his stint in the army, Hersh returned to Chicago and began working as a reporter for the _South Chicago Journal_. In 1962, he joined the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ as a general-assignment reporter. Two years later, he moved to the _Chicago Sun-Times_, where he became a city hall reporter.\n\nIn 1966, Hersh joined the _New York Times_ as a national correspondent. During his time at the _Times_, he became known for his aggressive and dogged reporting style, which earned him a reputation as one of the most talented young journalists in the country.\n\n**My Lai massacre**\n\nOne of Hersh's most notable stories broke in 1969, when he exposed the My Lai massacre, in which American soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai. Hersh's reporting, which was based on interviews with soldiers and eyewitnesses, revealed that the massacre was a deliberate and premeditated act of violence, rather than a isolated incident of hysteria.\n\nThe My Lai story was a major scandal, and it led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability. Hersh's reporting was instrumental in bringing the story to light, and it earned him widespread acclaim and recognition.\n\n**The New York Times**\n\nHersh's reporting at the _New York Times_ continued to make headlines throughout the 1970s. In 1972, he exposed the secret bombing of Cambodia, a story that led to widespread protests and calls for an end to the Vietnam War. He also reported on the Pentagon Papers, a secret study of the Vietnam War that was leaked to the _Times_ by Daniel Ellsberg.\n\n**Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s**\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Hersh turned to book-length investigations, publishing several critically acclaimed books on a range of topics. _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983) was a biography of Henry Kissinger that explored his role in the Nixon administration. _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and America Foreign Policy_ (1991) was a book about Israel's nuclear program and its impact on U.S. foreign policy.\n\n**Later investigations**\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, Hersh continued to make headlines with his investigative reporting. He exposed the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal in 2004, revealing that American soldiers had engaged in widespread torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners. He also reported on the Iran-Contra affair, a scandal in which the Reagan administration secretly sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to fund anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua.\n\n**Iraq and Abu Ghraib**\n\nHersh's reporting on Abu Ghraib was a major scandal, revealing that American soldiers had engaged in widespread torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners. The story, which was published in _The New Yorker_ in 2004, led to widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\n**Iran**\n\nIn 2008, Hersh reported on the U.S. government's secret plans to attack Iran, which were based on false intelligence about Iran's nuclear program. The story, which was published in _The New Yorker_, revealed that the Bush administration had been planning to attack Iran for years, but had been unable to gain approval from Congress.\n\n**Syria and chemical attacks**\n\nIn 2013, Hersh reported on the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against civilians, which had been denied by the Syrian government. The story, which was published in _The London Review of Books_, revealed that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons on multiple occasions, despite claims to the contrary.\n\n**Killing of Osama bin Laden**\n\nIn 2015, Hersh reported on the U.S. government's claims about the killing of Osama bin Laden, which he said were exaggerated and inaccurate. The story, which was published in _The London Review of Books_, revealed that the U.S. government had claimed to have killed bin Laden in a firefight, when in fact he had likely been killed by a severe health condition.\n\n**Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine**\n\nIn 2022, Hersh reported on the U.S. government's alleged sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, which he said was a deliberate act of terrorism. The story, which was published in _Substack_, revealed that the U.S. government had been planning to sabotage the pipeline for years, despite claims to the contrary.\n\n**Other statements**\n\nIn addition to his investigative reporting, Hersh has also made headlines with his public statements. In 2016, he spoke out against the murder of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who was killed in a mysterious shooting. Hersh said that Rich's murder was a setup by the Russian government, and that the story had been covered up by the U.S. government.\n\nIn 2018, Hersh also spoke out against the abuse of Pat Nixon, the wife of former President Richard Nixon, who he said had been subjected to mental and emotional abuse by her husband.\n\n**Use of anonymous sources**\n\nHersh has been criticized for his use of anonymous sources in his reporting. In 2013, he was accused of relying too heavily on unnamed sources in his reporting on the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. However, Hersh has also said that he has a responsibility to protect his sources, and that he will not reveal their identities unless it is necessary to do so.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nHersh is married to Tamar Hersh, a journalist and editor. They have two children together, and live in Washington, D.C. Hersh is a self-described liberal, and has been a vocal critic of the U.S. government's foreign policy.\n\n**Awards and honors**\n\nHersh has won numerous awards for his reporting, including the Pulitzer Prize, the George Polk Award, and the National Magazine Award. He has also received several honorary degrees, including from the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan.\n\n**Publications**\n\nHersh has published several books and articles on a range of topics. His books include _The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House_ (1983), _The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and America Foreign Policy_ (1991), and _Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib_ (2004). His articles have appeared in _The New Yorker_, _The London Review of Books_, and _The New York Times_.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seymour_Hersh\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Newspaper career\n##My Lai massacre\n##The New York Times\n#Investigative books: 1980s and 1990s\n#Later investigations\n##Iraq and Abu Ghraib\n##Iran\n##Syria and chemical attacks\n##Killing of Osama bin Laden\n##Nord Stream pipeline and Ukraine\n#Other statements\n##Speeches\n##Murder of Seth Rich\n##Pat Nixon abuse\n#Use of anonymous sources\n#Personal life\n#Awards and honors\n#Publications\n##Books\n##Articles\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

(TV program)\n\nE.A.T. is a Philippine television variety show broadcast by TV5 and Radio Philippines Network (RPN). The program is a revival of the original Eat Bulaga! format, which was previously aired on GMA Network from 1995 to 2024. E.A.T. premiered on April 15, 2024, and is currently hosted by Vic Sotto, Tito Sotto, Joey de Leon, and other members of the Eat Bulaga! cast.\n\n# History\n\n## RPN (1979–1989)\n\nE.A.T.'s roots can be traced back to the 1970s when it was known as Eat Bulaga!, a noontime variety show that was first aired on RPN in 1979. The program was created by Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, and RPN's then-Executive Vice President, Roberto Benedicto. Eat Bulaga! quickly gained popularity and became a staple in Philippine television, known for its unique format, entertaining segments, and popular guests.\n\n## ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, Eat Bulaga! moved to ABS-CBN after RPN lost its franchise. During its six-year run on ABS-CBN, the program continued to enjoy massive success and became a household name. However, in 1995, the show's contract with ABS-CBN expired, and it moved to GMA Network.\n\n## GMA Network (1995–2024)\n\nEat Bulaga!'s move to GMA Network marked a new chapter in the program's history. The show continued to thrive and became one of the network's flagship programs. Over the years, Eat Bulaga! underwent several format changes and introduced new segments, including the popular \"Eat Bulaga! Olympics\" and \"Bawal! Judgmental Ka Ba?\". However, in 2023, GMA Network and the show's producers announced that Eat Bulaga! would be ending its run on the network after 29 years.\n\n## TVJ - TAPE Inc. conflict (2023–2024)\n\nThe decision to end Eat Bulaga!'s run on GMA Network was met with controversy when it was revealed that the show's producers, TVJ (Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, and Tito Sotto), had a disagreement with the network over the program's format and ownership. TAPE Inc., the production company behind Eat Bulaga!, had been leasing the program's format to GMA Network for years, but the network allegedly refused to renew the lease. As a result, TVJ decided to take the program to RPN, where they would produce and broadcast it under the new title, E.A.T.\n\n## E.A.T. and TAPE's Eat Bulaga!\n\nThe move to RPN marked a new beginning for the Eat Bulaga! franchise, with TVJ retaining creative control over the program. However, the new version of the show, E.A.T., was met with skepticism by some fans who felt that the program had lost its original charm. In an effort to address these concerns, TVJ introduced new segments, including \"Sugod Bahay, Mga Kapatid!\" and \"Gimme 5: Laro ng mga Henyo\", which were designed to appeal to a younger audience.\n\n## Eat Bulaga! trademark battle: TVJ emerges victorious\n\nAs part of the dispute between GMA Network and TVJ, the network attempted to trademark the Eat Bulaga! name and logo. However, the Philippine Intellectual Property Office (IPO) ultimately ruled in favor of TVJ, allowing them to retain the trademark for the program.\n\n## TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, TV5 and Radio Philippines Network (RPN) announced that they would be partnering to produce and broadcast E.A.T. The program would be simulcast on both networks, with TV5 serving as the primary broadcast partner.\n\n# Hosts\n\n## Current host\n\nThe current hosts of E.A.T. include Vic Sotto, Tito Sotto, Joey de Leon, and other members of the Eat Bulaga! cast.

His early life was marked by a strict Catholic upbringing, which would later influence his actions and decisions.\n\n## Matrimonial projects\nIn 1420, Gilles de Rais married Catherine de Thouars, daughter of Guy XIV, Count of Thouars. The marriage was arranged by his family to secure an alliance with the powerful House of Thouars. However, the marriage was short-lived, and Catherine died in 1423, leaving Gilles de Rais a widower.\n\n## Family disputes\nGilles de Rais's family was marked by disputes and power struggles.

These conflicts would mark the beginning of his downfall.\n\n## Lifting of the siege of Lagny\nIn 1430, Gilles de Rais led a successful campaign to lift the siege of Lagny, which had been laid by the English. This campaign marked a significant victory for the French army and earned Gilles de Rais further recognition.\n\n## Reduction of military commitments\nIn the early 1430s, Gilles de Rais began to reduce his military commitments, focusing instead on his personal interests and wealth. This marked a significant shift in his priorities and would contribute to his later downfall.\n\n# Squandering of heritage\n\nGilles de Rais's wealth and influence were squandered through a series of reckless and extravagant expenditures.

These investigations would ultimately lead to his trial and execution.\n\n## Trial and execution\nGilles de Rais was tried and executed in 1440, on charges of heresy, sodomy, and murder. His trial was marked by a series of gruesome confessions, which implicated him in a range of crimes.\n\n# Question of guilt\n\n## Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\nIn the Age of Enlightenment, there were significant doubts about the verdict in Gilles de Rais's trial.

However, this classification is not universally accepted, and some scholars argue that he was a product of his time and culture.\n\n# Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n\nGilles de Rais's reputation as a serial killer and a heretic has led to comparisons with the myth of Bluebeard, a figure from medieval folklore.

It was also the first time that a Speaker of the House was elected with a majority of votes from the minority party.\n\n### Consequences while there was no speaker\n\nThe lack of a Speaker of the House had significant consequences for the legislative branch. Without a Speaker, the House was unable to pass any legislation, and the government was unable to function effectively.\n\n### C-SPAN popularity\n\nThe 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election was also significant for C-SPAN, a cable television network that provides coverage of the United States Congress. The election was widely covered by C-SPAN, and the network's ratings increased significantly during the election.\n\nSee also\n\n* Speaker of the United States House of Representatives\n* Hakeem Jeffries\n* Kevin McCarthy\n* United States House of Representatives\n\nNotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"January_2023_Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Process and conventions\n#Democratic nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Declined to run\n##Result\n#Republican nomination\n##Candidates\n###Nominee\n###Lost nomination\n##Results\n#Election of the speaker\n##Background\n##Candidates\n##Summary\n##Ballots 1–3 (January 3)\n##Ballots 4–6 (January 4)\n##Ballots 7–11 (January 5)\n##Ballots 12–15 (January 6)\n##All ballots: votes not cast for party nominee\n##All ballots: summary of votes\n#Impact\n##Historical context\n##Consequences while there was no speaker\n##C-SPAN popularity\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Italian Renaissance sculpture was a key aspect of the broader Italian Renaissance, a cultural and artistic movement that transformed the way people thought, lived, and expressed themselves.\n\n**Periods**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculpture can be broadly categorized into several periods, each marked by distinct characteristics and developments.\n\n**Materials**\n\nItalian Renaissance sculptors worked with a wide range of materials, each with its unique properties and challenges.\n\n### **Stone**\n\nStone was a primary material for Italian Renaissance sculpture, particularly marble, which was prized for its durability, versatility, and classical associations.

They established a basic church structure, with bishops and deacons serving as leaders and administrators.\n\n#### Early growth\n\nThe Christian church experienced rapid growth, particularly in the Mediterranean region.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Liz Truss, who had been Prime Minister for only 49 days.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Conservative Party had been embroiled in a series of scandals and controversies during the premiership of Boris Johnson, who had taken office in July 2019. Johnson's tenure was marked by several high-profile scandals, including the Brexit Party defections, the prorogation of Parliament, and the Partygate scandal. Despite this, Johnson maintained a strong hold on the party and won a significant majority in the 2019 general election.\n\nHowever, Johnson's premiership was ultimately cut short when he was forced to resign in September 2022 over a series of scandals, including the Partygate scandal and allegations of dishonesty. Johnson was succeeded by Liz Truss, who became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n**Leadership election to succeed Johnson**\n\nThe leadership election to succeed Johnson was held in July 2022, with several candidates vying for the top spot. The election was won by Liz Truss, who defeated Rishi Sunak in the second round of voting.\n\n**Liz Truss premiership and scandals**\n\nTruss's premiership was marked by a series of scandals and controversies, including the mini-budget, which was widely criticized for its tax cuts and spending commitments. Truss's economic policies were also criticized for their impact on the UK's inflation and economic stability.\n\n**Calls for Truss's resignation**\n\nDespite her best efforts to turn around the economy, Truss's popularity continued to decline, and several senior Conservative MPs called for her resignation. The party's 1922 Committee, which is responsible for electing the party leader, also began to consider a vote of no confidence in Truss.\n\n**Resignations and vote on fracking**\n\nOn October 14, 2022, Truss announced that she would be holding a vote on fracking in the House of Commons. However, the vote was widely seen as a move to appease her party's hard-right wing, who were pushing for the policy.\n\nThe next day, Truss announced that she would be resigning as Prime Minister, effective immediately. Her resignation marked the end of her 49-day premiership and set in motion the process for selecting a new leader and Prime Minister.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the Conservative Party leadership election was marked by a series of debates, hustings, and media appearances by the candidates. The election was seen as a two-horse race between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, who was the clear frontrunner.\n\nSunak, who had previously served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, was seen as the more moderate candidate, while Truss, who had previously served as Foreign Secretary, was seen as the more right-wing candidate.\n\n**Election process**\n\nThe election process was overseen by the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which is responsible for electing the party leader. The election was held in two rounds, with the candidates with the fewest votes in each round being eliminated.\n\nThe first round of voting saw all six candidates standing, but by the end of the round, three candidates, including Jeremy Hunt, had been eliminated. The second round saw two candidates, Sunak and Truss, vying for the top spot.\n\n**Candidates**\n\n**Declared**\n\nThe following candidates declared their intention to stand in the election:\n\n* Rishi Sunak\n* Liz Truss\n* Penny Mordaunt\n* Jeremy Hunt\n* Kemi Badenoch\n* Suella Braverman\n\n**Withdrawn**\n\nThe following candidates withdrew from the election:\n\n* Jeremy Hunt\n* Kemi Badenoch\n* Suella Braverman\n\n**Explored**\n\nThe following candidates explored the possibility of standing in the election but ultimately decided not to:\n\n* Tom Tugendhat\n* Dominic Raab\n\n**Declined**\n\nThe following candidates declined to stand in the election:\n\n* Boris Johnson\n* Michael Gove\n\n**Endorsements**\n\nSeveral high-profile Conservative MPs endorsed the candidates, including:\n\n* Rishi Sunak: endorsed by David Cameron\n* Liz Truss: endorsed by Boris Johnson\n\n**Responses**\n\nThe candidates responded to the election by outlining their policies and vision for the future of the Conservative Party.\n\nSunak emphasized the need for the party to return to its traditional centre-right roots, while Truss emphasized the need for the party to become more right-wing.\n\n**Polling**\n\nSeveral polls were conducted during the election to gauge the public's opinion on the candidates.\n\n**Conservative members**\n\nA poll of Conservative Party members found that 55% of respondents supported Sunak, while 45% supported Truss.\n\n**2019 Conservative voters**\n\nA poll of 2019 Conservative voters found that 52% of respondents supported Sunak, while 48% supported Truss.\n\n**General population**\n\nA poll of the general population found that 45% of respondents supported Sunak, while 55% supported Truss.\n\nIn conclusion, the October 2022 Conservative Party leadership election was a significant event in the party's history, with several candidates vying for the top spot. The election was won by Rishi Sunak, who emphasized the need for the party to return to its traditional centre-right roots. The election marked the end of Liz Truss's 49-day premiership and set in motion the process for selecting a new leader and Prime Minister.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"October_2022_Conservative_Party_leadership_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Boris Johnson premiership and scandals\n##Leadership election to succeed Johnson\n##Liz Truss premiership and scandals\n##Calls for Truss's resignation\n##Resignations and vote on fracking\n##Liz Truss resigns\n#Campaign\n#Election process\n#Candidates\n##Declared\n##Withdrawn\n##Explored\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Responses\n#Polling\n##Conservative members\n##2019 Conservative voters\n##General population\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The novel is a sprawling, postmodern epic that explores the intersections of art, politics, and history. Written between 1967 and 1971, the novel is a product of Weiss's fascination with the avant-garde movements of the early 20th century and his own experiences as a Marxist activist.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a complex, fragmented narrative that defies easy summarization. The novel is presented as a series of vignettes, anecdotes, and philosophical meditations, which are woven together to form a broader tapestry of ideas and experiences. At its core, the novel is a exploration of the relationship between art and resistance, as embodied in the lives and works of a diverse cast of characters, including artists, writers, revolutionaries, and ordinary people.\n\nThroughout the novel, Weiss draws on a wide range of historical and cultural references, from the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche to the paintings of Pablo Picasso and the writings of Bertolt Brecht. The novel is also deeply rooted in Weiss's own experiences as a Marxist activist, including his involvement in the German Student Movement of the 1960s.\n\n**Form features and structure**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental work, both in terms of its form and its structure. The novel is composed of three volumes, each of which is divided into a series of vignettes, anecdotes, and philosophical meditations. The volumes are not strictly chronological, but rather are organized around a series of themes and ideas, which are woven together to form a broader tapestry of meaning.\n\nOne of the key features of the novel is its use of a wide range of artistic and literary forms, including painting, poetry, drama, and fiction. Weiss draws on a diverse range of sources, from the works of Brecht and Aragon to the poetry of Rilke and the novels of Thomas Mann. The novel is also deeply influenced by the avant-garde movements of the early 20th century, including Expressionism, Surrealism, and Dadaism.\n\n**History of origins and publication**\n\n**Beginning**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first conceived in the early 1960s, during Weiss's involvement in the German Student Movement. At the time, Weiss was working as a playwright and novelist, and was deeply concerned with the relationship between art and politics. He began to explore this theme in a series of essays and lectures, which eventually coalesced into the novel.\n\n**Research**\n\nWeiss's research for the novel was extensive and far-reaching, involving a wide range of sources and influences. He drew on his own experiences as a Marxist activist, as well as his interests in art, literature, and history. Weiss was particularly fascinated by the works of the avant-garde movements of the early 20th century, and spent many hours studying the paintings of Picasso, the poetry of Rilke, and the novels of Mann.\n\n**Writers block**\n\nDespite his extensive research and preparation, Weiss faced significant challenges in completing the novel. He struggled with writer's block, and was forced to abandon the project on several occasions. Weiss has said that he felt overwhelmed by the scope and complexity of the novel, and was unsure how to bring it to a successful conclusion.\n\n**The third volume**\n\nThe completion of the third volume was a major achievement for Weiss, and marked a significant turning point in the project. The final volume is a deeply personal and philosophical exploration of the relationship between art and resistance, and is infused with a sense of urgency and passion.\n\n**Sweden and the GDR**\n\nWeiss spent many years living in Sweden, where he was deeply influenced by the country's social democratic traditions and its rich cultural heritage. He was also drawn to the German Democratic Republic (GDR), where he saw the possibility of a socialist society and a thriving arts scene. Weiss's experiences in both Sweden and the GDR had a profound impact on his work, and are reflected in the Aesthetics of Resistance.\n\n**Other translations**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance was first published in German in 1981, and has since been translated into many languages, including English, French, Spanish, and Italian. The novel has been widely acclaimed for its innovative form and its powerful exploration of the relationship between art and resistance.\n\n**Textual forms**\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance is a highly experimental work, both in terms of its form and its structure.

The term \"Sun Belt\" was first coined in the 1940s by the federal government to describe the region's warm and sunny climate. Today, the Sun Belt is a major economic and demographic hub in the country, known for its rapidly growing population, diverse economy, and unique cultural identity.\n\n# Migration\n------------\n\nThe Sun Belt has been a major destination for migrants from other parts of the United States and from around the world. Between 1970 and 2010, the population of the Sun Belt grew from approximately 50 million to over 100 million people, an increase of more than 100%. This growth was driven by a combination of factors, including the region's warm climate, economic opportunities, and relatively low cost of living.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, many people moved to the Sun Belt from the Northeast and Midwest in search of warmer weather and better economic opportunities. This migration was fueled by the growth of the service sector, particularly in industries such as tourism, healthcare, and finance.

The election was the sixth Assembly election since the devolution of power from the UK Parliament to the Assembly in 1998.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 election was the first to be held since the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the election process. The pandemic led to changes in the way elections were conducted, including the use of postal voting and the suspension of in-person campaigning.\n\n### Electoral events\n\nThe 2022 election was held under the single transferable vote (STV) system, in which voters ranked candidates in order of preference. The election was contested by 27 parties and 247 candidates.\n\n### Leadership changes\n\nThe election marked a significant change in leadership for the main unionist and nationalist parties. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, Edwin Poots, resigned as leader and MLA on 28 April 2022, ahead of the election. He was succeeded by Jeffrey Donaldson, who became the new leader of the DUP and the party's lead candidate in the election.\n\nThe Sinn Féin leader, Michelle O'Neill, stood for re-election in the Foyle constituency and was re-elected. O'Neill became the party's leader in the Assembly and the party's lead candidate in the election.\n\n### Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol, which was agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, was a major issue in the election campaign. The protocol created a border in the Irish Sea, which the DUP and other unionist parties argued was a threat to the integrity of the UK.\n\nThe protocol was a key issue in the election campaign, with the DUP and other unionist parties arguing that it should be renegotiated or scrapped. The Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties argued that the protocol was an important part of the Brexit agreement and should be implemented in full.\n\n### Calls for early election\n\nThere were calls for an early election to be held in 2021, following a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin over the formation of a new power-sharing executive. However, the Assembly was dissolved in April 2022, ahead of the scheduled election in May.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 247 candidates stood in the election, including 85 women and 162 men. The candidates included 27 party leaders and 13 former Assembly members.\n\n**Members not seeking re-election**\n\nA total of 22 members of the Assembly did not seek re-election in 2022, including the former Speaker of the Assembly, Alex Maskey.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe election campaign was marked by a significant focus on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the impact of Brexit on the region. The DUP and other unionist parties argued that the protocol was a threat to the integrity of the UK, while the Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties argued that it was an important part of the Brexit agreement.\n\nThe campaign was also marked by a significant focus on issues such as health, education, and the economy. The parties also campaigned on issues such as the environment, housing, and social justice.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe opinion polls in the run-up to the election showed a significant lead for the DUP, with some polls suggesting that the party could win up to 25 seats. However, the polls also showed a significant level of uncertainty, with many voters still undecided.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the election were announced on 7 May 2022, with the DUP winning 27 seats, Sinn Féin winning 27 seats, and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) winning 8 seats. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) won 12 seats, the Alliance Party won 8 seats, and the Green Party won 2 seats.\n\n### Distribution of seats by constituency\n\nThe distribution of seats by constituency was as follows:\n\n* Belfast East: 4 DUP, 2 Sinn Féin, 1 Alliance\n* Belfast North: 3 DUP, 2 Sinn Féin, 1 UUP\n* Belfast South: 3 DUP, 2 Sinn Féin, 1 SDLP\n* Belfast West: 3 Sinn Féin, 2 DUP, 1 SDLP\n* East Antrim: 2 DUP, 1 UUP\n* East Belfast: 3 DUP, 1 Alliance\n* East Londonderry: 2 DUP, 1 Sinn Féin\n* Fermanagh and South Tyrone: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 DUP\n* Foyle: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 SDLP\n* Mid Ulster: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 SDLP\n* Newry and Armagh: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 SDLP\n* North Antrim: 3 DUP, 1 UUP\n* North Belfast: 2 DUP, 1 Sinn Féin, 1 Alliance\n* North Down and Ards: 3 DUP, 1 UUP\n* South Antrim: 3 DUP, 1 UUP\n* South Down: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 SDLP\n* South East Fermanagh and South Tyrone: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 DUP\n* Strangford: 2 DUP, 1 UUP\n* Upper Bann: 2 DUP, 1 UUP\n* West Tyrone: 2 Sinn Féin, 1 DUP\n\n### Share of first-preference votes\n\nThe share of first-preference votes was as follows:\n\n* DUP: 26.8%\n* Sinn Féin: 24.5%\n* SDLP: 11.2%\n* UUP: 9.9%\n* Alliance: 9.1%\n* Green Party: 2.2%\n\n### Incumbents defeated\n\nA total of 17 incumbent Assembly members were defeated in the election, including the DUP leader, Edwin Poots.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power in the Assembly, with the DUP and Sinn Féin emerging as the two largest parties. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, became the new leader of the Assembly, while the Sinn Féin leader, Michelle O'Neill, became the party's leader in the Assembly.\n\nThe election also saw a significant increase in the number of women elected to the Assembly, with 29 women elected in total.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Northern Ireland Assembly members, 2022-2026\n* Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2017\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1. ^ The results are based on the official count of first-preference votes.\n\n**References**\n\n1. ^ \"Northern Ireland Assembly election 2022\".

In 2022, a total of 181 tropical cyclones were recorded globally, with 136 of them reaching tropical storm strength. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions that affected tropical cyclone activity in 2022, as well as a summary of the cyclones that formed in each ocean basin.\n\n# Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were characterized by a strong El Niño event, which lasted from June to November. El Niño is a natural climate phenomenon that occurs when the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean warms up more than usual, leading to changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns around the globe. In 2022, El Niño contributed to an increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones in the Eastern and Central Pacific, as well as in the Western Pacific.\n\nAnother significant weather pattern that affected tropical cyclone activity in 2022 was the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a tropical disturbance that travels eastward across the Indian Ocean and Pacific. The MJO can enhance or suppress tropical cyclone activity depending on its phase and location. In 2022, the MJO played a key role in the formation of several tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific.\n\n## Summary\n\n### North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe North Atlantic Ocean was relatively quiet in 2022, with only 12 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Hurricane Ian, which made landfall in the United States as a Category 4 hurricane in September. Ian caused significant damage and flooding in Florida and other parts of the country.\n\n### Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Eastern and Central Pacific Ocean was one of the most active regions in 2022, with 24 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Hurricane Darby, which reached Category 4 strength in June.

The strongest storm of the season was Super Typhoon Noru, which reached Category 5 strength in October. Noru caused significant damage and flooding in the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n### North Indian Ocean\n\nThe North Indian Ocean was relatively quiet in 2022, with only 6 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Cyclone Sitrang, which made landfall in Bangladesh as a Category 1 cyclone in October. Sitrang caused significant damage and flooding in Bangladesh and other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n### South-West Indian Ocean\n\nThe South-West Indian Ocean was one of the most active regions in 2022, with 12 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Cyclone Batsirai, which reached Category 4 strength in February. Batsirai caused significant damage and flooding in Madagascar and other parts of East Africa.\n\n### Australian Region\n\nThe Australian Region was relatively quiet in 2022, with only 5 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Cyclone Ellie, which made landfall in Western Australia as a Category 2 cyclone in January. Ellie caused significant damage and flooding in Western Australia and other parts of the country.\n\n### South Pacific Ocean\n\nThe South Pacific Ocean was one of the most active regions in 2022, with 15 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Cyclone Cody, which reached Category 4 strength in December. Cody caused significant damage and flooding in Fiji and other parts of the Pacific.\n\n### South Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe South Atlantic Ocean was relatively quiet in 2022, with only 2 tropical cyclones forming. The strongest storm of the season was Cyclone Anais, which made landfall in Brazil as a Category 1 cyclone in March.

He was a member of the hip-hop trio Migos, alongside his cousins Quavo and Offset. Takeoff's music career spanned over a decade, with a notable rise to fame in the mid-2010s. Despite his growing success, his life was cut short in a tragic incident in 2022.\n\n**Early life**\n\nTakeoff was born Kyro Malik Washington on December 18, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was raised in the Gwinnett County suburb of Lawrenceville, alongside his cousins Quavo and Offset. The trio's shared family background and upbringing would later play a significant role in their music career. Takeoff's early life was marked by a strong connection to music, with the family's patriarch, Calvin \"Coach K\" Thornton, serving as a mentor and early influence.\n\n**Career**\n\n#### 2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n\nTakeoff, alongside Quavo and Offset, began their music career in 2008 under the name Polo Club. However, it was in 2013 that they adopted the name Migos, a nod to the popular hip-hop group in Atlanta. The trio's early work was characterized by their energetic live performances and a unique lyrical style that blended humor, street-smart observations, and catchy hooks. Their breakthrough came with the release of the single \"Versace,\" which gained significant attention in 2013. The song's success led to a record deal with Quality Control Music, a label that would play a pivotal role in shaping Migos' career.\n\n#### 2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n\nTakeoff's solo career gained momentum in 2018 with the release of his debut mixtape, \"The Last Rocket.\" The project received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Takeoff's lyrical dexterity and clever wordplay. His solo work allowed him to explore different themes and styles, further solidifying his position as a talented artist. In the same year, Migos released their third studio album, \"Culture II,\" which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album's success marked a new chapter in Migos' career, with Takeoff contributing significantly to the project's success.\n\n#### 2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n\nIn 2022, tensions within Migos began to surface, leading to a highly publicized feud between Takeoff and Quavo. The exact nature of the disagreement remains unclear, but it ultimately led to Takeoff's departure from the group. Shortly after, he released his second solo mixtape, \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" which featured appearances from artists such as Drake, Gunna, and Young Thug. The project received positive reviews, with many praising Takeoff's growth as an artist and his ability to craft memorable, radio-friendly hits.\n\n**Legal issues**\n\n#### Georgia Southern University incident\n\nIn 2011, Takeoff was arrested at Georgia Southern University for allegedly attempting to bring a firearm onto campus. The incident led to his expulsion from the university. While the exact circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear, it marked one of the first instances of Takeoff's run-ins with the law.\n\n#### Sexual assault allegations\n\nIn 2020, Takeoff faced allegations of sexual assault from a woman who claimed the incident occurred in 2016. The allegations were made public in a series of social media posts, with the woman sharing graphic details of the alleged assault. Takeoff's representatives denied the allegations, stating that the claims were \"completely false\" and \"without merit.\"\n\n**Murder and trial**\n\nOn November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and killed during a private party at a bowling alley in Houston, Texas. The incident occurred after a fight broke out between two groups, with Takeoff caught in the crossfire. He was pronounced dead at the scene, with the cause of death later determined to be a gunshot wound to the head. The murder sparked widespread shock and sadness within the music industry, with many artists and fans paying tribute to Takeoff's life and legacy.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nTakeoff's murder sent shockwaves through the music industry, with many artists and fans expressing their condolences. Migos' Quavo was particularly affected, releasing a heartfelt statement that read, in part, \"I love you, bro.\" Other artists, including Drake, Lil Baby, and Cardi B, also paid tribute to Takeoff, with many sharing memories and anecdotes about their time with the late rapper.\n\n**Investigation and legal proceedings**\n\nAn investigation into Takeoff's murder is ongoing, with the Houston Police Department working to identify suspects and gather evidence. In the weeks following the incident, police arrested several individuals in connection with the case, including a 22-year-old man charged with murder. The case is now set to go to trial, with the outcome hanging in the balance.\n\n**Funeral**\n\nTakeoff's funeral was held on November 11, 2022, with family and friends gathering to pay their respects. The service was private, with a small group of people in attendance. In the days following the funeral, a memorial fund was established to support Takeoff's estate and support his family.\n\n**Commercial impact**\n\nTakeoff's death had a significant commercial impact, with his music and merchandise experiencing a surge in popularity. His solo mixtape, \"Only Built for Infinity Links,\" rose to the top of the Billboard 200 chart, with many of the project's tracks receiving significant airplay. The incident also led to a renewed interest in Migos' music, with many fans revisiting the group's classic hits.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* _The Last Rocket_ (2018)\n* _Only Built for Infinity Links_ (2022)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Migos\n* Quavo\n* Offset\n* Quality Control Music\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* Takeoff on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Takeoff_(rapper)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##2008–2018: Early work with Migos\n##2018–2021: The Last Rocket and later Migos work\n##2022: Friction within Migos and Only Built for Infinity Links\n#Legal issues\n##Georgia Southern University incident\n##Sexual assault allegations\n#Murder and trial\n##Reactions\n##Investigation and legal proceedings\n##Funeral\n##Commercial impact\n#Discography\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The goal of cataract surgery is to restore vision to a level that is satisfactory for the patient's daily activities. Cataract surgery is a common and generally safe procedure, with a high success rate.\n\n**Uses**\n\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens in the eye that can impair vision. Cataracts can be caused by age, injury, or certain medical conditions. Cataracts can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, double vision, sensitivity to light, and difficulty driving at night.\n\nCataract surgery is also used to treat other conditions that affect the lens, such as posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which is a condition that can occur after cataract surgery.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nThere are several techniques used for cataract surgery, including:\n\n* **Phacoemulsification**: This is the most common technique used for cataract surgery. It involves using an ultrasonic device to break up the cataractous lens into small pieces, which are then removed from the eye.\n* **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**: This technique involves making a small incision in the eye and removing the cataractous lens using a manual instrument.\n* **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**: This technique involves making a larger incision in the eye and removing the cataractous lens in one piece.\n\n**Pre-operative evaluation**\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, patients undergo a thorough pre-operative evaluation to determine their suitability for the procedure. This evaluation includes:\n\n### **Contraindications**\n\nCataract surgery is contraindicated in patients who have:\n\n* Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or glaucoma\n* Recent eye injuries or infections\n* Previous eye surgeries that may have caused complications\n* Certain types of cataracts that are not amenable to surgery\n\n### **Selection of intraocular lenses**\n\nPatients undergo a thorough evaluation to determine the best type of intraocular lens (IOL) for their needs. IOLs can be monofocal, multifocal, or accommodating.\n\n**Operation procedures**\n\nCataract surgery is typically performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the eye and prevents pain during the procedure. The procedure involves:\n\n### **Preparation**\n\nThe eye is cleaned and prepared for surgery, and the patient is positioned in a way that allows the surgeon to access the eye.\n\n### **Anaesthesia**\n\nThe patient is given local anesthesia to numb the eye and prevent pain during the procedure.\n\n### **Phacoemulsification**\n\nThe cataractous lens is broken up using an ultrasonic device, and the small pieces are removed from the eye.\n\n### **Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)**\n\nThe cataractous lens is removed using a manual instrument.\n\n### **Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)**\n\nThe cataractous lens is removed in one piece.\n\n### **Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency**\n\nIf complications arise during surgery, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE to manage the contingency.\n\n### **Closing the wound**\n\nThe incision is closed, and the eye is bandaged to protect it during the healing process.\n\n**Post-operative care**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, patients undergo a thorough post-operative evaluation to ensure that the eye is healing properly. This evaluation includes:\n\n* **Follow-up appointments**: Patients are seen for follow-up appointments to check on the healing process and remove any sutures.\n* **Eye drops**: Patients are given eye drops to prevent infection and promote healing.\n* **Pain management**: Patients are given pain medication to manage any discomfort or pain.\n\n**Complications**\n\nCataract surgery can be associated with complications, including:\n\n### **During surgery**\n\nComplications that can occur during surgery include:\n\n* **Intraocular hemorrhage**: Bleeding in the eye can occur during surgery.\n* **Iris trauma**: The iris can be damaged during surgery, leading to complications.\n\n### **After surgery**\n\nComplications that can occur after surgery include:\n\n* **Endophthalmitis**: Infection in the eye can occur after surgery.\n* **Cystoid macular edema**: Fluid can accumulate in the macula, leading to vision problems.\n\n### **Risk**\n\nThe risk of complications from cataract surgery is low, but it is not zero. Patients should be aware of the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.\n\n**Recovery and rehabilitation**\n\nAfter cataract surgery, patients undergo a recovery and rehabilitation period to ensure that the eye heals properly. This period includes:\n\n* **Rest**: Patients are advised to rest their eye for several days after surgery.\n* **Eye drops**: Patients are given eye drops to prevent infection and promote healing.\n* **Follow-up appointments**: Patients are seen for follow-up appointments to check on the healing process.\n\n**Outcomes**\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally good, with a high success rate. Patients can expect to see a significant improvement in their vision after surgery.\n\n**History**\n\nCataract surgery has a long history, with the first recorded surgery dating back to ancient Egypt. The modern version of cataract surgery was developed in the early 20th century.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world, including:\n\n### **Europe**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Europe, with many countries having well-established eye care systems.\n\n### **Asia**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Asia, with many countries having a high demand for eye care services.\n\n### **Africa**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Africa, with many countries having a high demand for eye care services.\n\n### **Latin America**\n\nCataract surgery is widely available in Latin America, with many countries having a high demand for eye care services.\n\n**Social, economic and environmental relevance**\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in low-income countries where cataracts are a major cause of blindness.\n\n**Special populations**\n\nCataract surgery can be particularly challenging in certain special populations, including:\n\n### **Congenital cataracts**\n\nCataracts that are present at birth can be challenging to treat with surgery.\n\n### **Higher risk for operations on separate occasions**\n\nPatients who require multiple surgeries may be at higher risk for complications.\n\n**Other animals**\n\nCataract surgery can also be performed in other animals, such as dogs and cats.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is intended for general educational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.\n* The article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**References**\n\n* There are no references included in this article.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Cataract surgery: A review of the literature.\n* Cataract surgery: A guide for patients.\n* Cataract surgery: A review of the outcomes.\n\n**External links**\n\n* American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO).\n* American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS).\n* National Eye Institute (NEI).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This illicit economy played a crucial role in the survival of the French population, especially during the German occupation. The black market was characterized by the diversion of goods and resources from official channels to clandestine networks, often for personal gain or to circumvent rationing and price controls.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1930s: inflation, instability, and unrest\n\nIn the 1930s, France experienced a period of economic instability, with high inflation rates and rising unemployment. This created a sense of uncertainty and insecurity among the population, which would later contribute to the proliferation of the black market. The economic conditions of the time made it difficult for people to access basic necessities, leading to widespread frustration and discontent.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nOn June 22, 1940, France signed an armistice with Germany, effectively ending the French military campaign. The fall of France marked a significant turning point in the country's history, leading to the establishment of the Vichy regime and the German occupation. The subsequent years would see the French population facing extreme hardships, including food shortages, rationing, and economic instability.\n\n**1940-1941**\n\n### Origins\n\nThe black market in wartime France had its roots in the early stages of the occupation. Several factors contributed to its emergence:\n\n#### Rationing and price controls\n\nThe Vichy government implemented strict rationing and price controls to manage the allocation of resources. However, these measures often failed to address the growing demand for basic necessities, creating a gap between supply and demand.\n\n#### Diversion from official channels\n\nAs the occupation continued, the French population began to divert goods and resources from official channels to meet their needs. This diversion often took the form of smuggling, hoarding, or black market trading.\n\n#### Clandestine networks\n\nClandestine networks emerged as a means of facilitating the diversion of goods and resources. These networks often operated in secret, using hidden channels and clandestine routes to evade detection.\n\n#### Hidden stockpiling\n\nMany French citizens began to stockpile goods and resources, often hiding them in secret locations or using false identities to conceal their ownership.\n\n#### Grey market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"free market,\" emerged as a tolerated form of unofficial trading. This market allowed for the exchange of goods and services outside of official channels, often for a higher price than the officially sanctioned rate.\n\n### Users of the black market\n\nThe black market in wartime France catered to various segments of the population:\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nMembers of the French elite, including business leaders and government officials, often used the black market to acquire goods and resources that were scarce or unavailable through official channels.\n\n#### Occupation forces\n\nGerman occupation forces also participated in the black market, using it to acquire goods and resources for their own benefit.\n\n### Public response\n\nThe public response to the black market was mixed:\n\n#### Early condemnation\n\nInitially, the French population condemned the black market as a form of economic sabotage and a threat to the war effort.\n\n#### Participation\n\nHowever, as the occupation continued and shortages worsened, many people began to participate in the black market as a means of survival.\n\n#### Housewives' demonstrations\n\nHousewives, in particular, played a significant role in the black market, often organizing demonstrations and protests to demand access to basic necessities.\n\n#### Suspicions of hoarding\n\nThe French government and occupation forces often accused individuals of hoarding goods and resources, leading to widespread suspicion and mistrust.\n\n#### Official antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government and occupation forces also used the black market as a pretext to target Jews and other minority groups, accusing them of economic crimes and confiscating their assets.\n\n#### Public opinion\n\nPublic opinion on the black market was complex, with many people viewing it as a necessary evil or a means of survival. However, others saw it as a form of economic treason and a threat to the war effort.\n\n#### Political opposition\n\nThe French Resistance and other political groups opposed the black market, viewing it as a tool of the occupation and a form of economic exploitation.\n\n## Response by authorities\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a mix of repression and tolerance:\n\n### No longer immoral\n\nBy 1941, the black market had become a tolerated and even necessary part of the French economy. The authorities recognized that the black market was a means of survival for many people and began to accept it as a fact of life.\n\n### Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n\nThe authorities refocused their enforcement efforts, targeting high-profile cases of black market activity and focusing on the supply of essential goods rather than the demand.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe black market had a significant impact on the French economy:\n\n### Proportion of production\n\nEstimates suggest that the black market accounted for up to 20% of France's total production during the occupation.\n\n### Higher and more volatile prices\n\nPrices on the black market were often higher and more volatile than those in the official market, making it difficult for people to access basic necessities.\n\n### Geographic distribution\n\nThe black market operated throughout France, with different regions experiencing varying levels of black market activity.\n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe black market benefited a wide range of individuals and groups, from wealthy business leaders to ordinary citizens struggling to survive.\n\n**Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)**\n\n### Agricultural black market\n\nThe agricultural black market emerged as a significant phenomenon, with farmers selling their produce on the black market to avoid official controls and prices.\n\n### Grey market: direct sales\n\nThe grey market continued to operate, with individuals and businesses selling goods and services directly to consumers outside of official channels.\n\n### Commerce and industry\n\nThe black market expanded into commerce and industry, with companies and individuals engaging in illicit trading and production.\n\n### Tacit tolerance\n\nThe authorities continued to tolerate the black market, recognizing its role in the survival of the French population.\n\n## Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n\n### Enforcement for the occupiers\n\nThe authorities began to crack down on black market activity, particularly in areas under German control. The occupiers saw the black market as a threat to their economic interests and began to enforce stricter controls.\n\n### Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n\nThe German black market declined significantly as the occupation forces focused on plundering France's resources and economy.\n\n### Countermeasures and collaboration\n\nThe authorities collaborated with the occupation forces to counter the black market, often using it as a pretext to target Jews and other minority groups.\n\n### Milice vs the black market\n\nThe Milice, a French nationalist militia, emerged as a rival to the black market, seeking to eliminate it as a threat to French patriotism.\n\n## Fraud and Resistance\n\nThe black market was also linked to the French Resistance:\n\n### Resistance encouragement\n\nThe Resistance often encouraged black market activity as a means of weakening the occupation and the Vichy regime.\n\n### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities and occupation forces often blamed the Resistance for black market activity, using it as a pretext to crack down on the Resistance.\n\n### End of the occupation\n\nThe end of the occupation marked the decline of the black market, as the French government and authorities focused on rebuilding the economy and punishing those involved in black market activity.\n\n**After the Liberation

profits.\n\n### Pursuit and punishment\n\nThe authorities pursued and punished those involved in black market activity, often using it as a pretext to target Jews and other minority groups.\n\n### Confiscation of illicit profits\n\nThe government confiscated illicit profits and assets, often using them to fund the reconstruction of the French economy.\n\n## Continued black market operations\n\nDespite the efforts of the authorities, the black market continued to operate:\n\n### Continued trafficking\n\nThe black market continued to traffic in goods and resources, often using clandestine networks and hidden channels.\n\n### Generalized fraud\n\nThe black market expanded into generalized fraud, with individuals and businesses engaging in a wide range of illicit activities.\n\n### Government powerlessness\n\nThe government struggled to effectively combat the black market, often unable to enforce its laws and regulations.\n\n### Towards the free market\n\nThe French government gradually moved towards a free market economy, recognizing the benefits of deregulation and market competition.\n\n**Historical memory**\n\nThe black market in wartime France has left a lasting impact on the country's collective memory:\n\n### Historiography\n\nHistorians have debated the role of the black market in France's wartime economy, with some viewing it as a necessary evil and others seeing it as a form of economic treason.\n\n### Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n\nThe black market has become a part of France's collective unconscious, reflecting the country's complex and often contradictory attitudes towards economic morality and the role of the state.\n\n### Early recollections\n\nMany French citizens have early recollections of the black market, often associating it with the occupation and the Vichy regime.\n\n## Major works\n\nThe black market has been the subject of several notable works of literature and art:\n\n### La Traversée de Paris\n\nLa Traversée de Paris, a novel by French writer Jean Giono, explores the black market in wartime France.\n\n### Au bon beurre\n\nAu bon beurre, a novel by French writer Marcel Aymé, is set in

Rowling and Steve Kloves. It is the third installment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, which is set in the 1930s and 1940s and serves as a spin-off of the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a magizoologist who becomes embroiled in a battle between good and evil in the wizarding world.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place several years after the events of the second installment, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. Newt Scamander returns to London, where he reunites with his friends, including Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law), Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen), and Albus's sister, Ariana (Victoria Yeates). However, their reunion is short-lived, as Newt soon discovers that Grindelwald has escaped from prison and is seeking to dominate the wizarding world.\n\nNewt becomes embroiled in a battle to prevent Grindelwald's rise to power, which leads him to meet a new character, Albus Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth (Richard Coyle). Aberforth, who is a skilled wizard and a member of the Order of the Phoenix, joins forces with Newt to help defeat Grindelwald. Along the way, Newt also meets a new companion, a young American wizard named Jacob Kowalski's brother, Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz).\n\nAs the story unfolds, Newt and his allies must navigate a complex web of alliances and rivalries within the wizarding world, all while facing the growing threat of Grindelwald's power. The film's climax features an epic battle between good and evil, with the fate of the wizarding world hanging in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander\n* Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Gellert Grindelwald\n* Zoë Kravitz as Leta Lestrange\n* Richard Coyle as Aberforth Dumbledore\n* Victoria Yeates as Ariana Dumbledore\n* Callum Turner as Theseus Scamander\n* Claudia Kim as Nagini\n* David Oyelowo as Governor Rosmerta\n* William Nadylam as Yusuf Kama\n* Karl Johnson as Nettuno\n* Alex Gaumond as Arnold\n* Alex Potter as Elphias Doge\n* Poppy Corby-Tuech as Emilia\n* Daphne Alexander as Agatha\n* Amber Parmet as female tourist\n\n**Production**\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea for Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore began with J.K. Rowling's 2014 screenplay for the second installment, The Crimes of Grindelwald. Rowling has stated that she always envisioned the Fantastic Beasts series as a trilogy, with The Secrets of Dumbledore serving as the final chapter.
