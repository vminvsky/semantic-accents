{"title": "Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters", "content": "#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Lists of feature films with LGBT characters\n\nFeature films that include LGBT characters have been produced since the early days of cinema. These films often provide a platform for representation, exploration, and discussion of LGBT issues and themes. Over the years, a significant number of feature films featuring LGBT characters have been released, catering to diverse audiences and contributing to the evolution of cinema.\n\n**Early representations**\n\nFeature films with LGBT characters have been present in various forms since the early 20th century. In the early days of cinema, LGBT characters often appeared in the form of stereotypes or caricatures, reflecting the societal attitudes of the time. However, as the years progressed, films began to showcase more nuanced and complex portrayals of LGBT individuals.\n\n## Silent era\n\nDuring the silent era, films featuring LGBT characters were often subtle and open to interpretation. The 1920s saw the release of films such as \"Pandora's Box\" (1929) and \"The Passionate Friends\" (1922), which explored themes of same-sex desire and relationships. These films, although not explicitly LGBT, provided a platform for the discussion of taboo subjects.\n\n## Classical Hollywood era\n\nIn the 1930s to 1960s, the classical Hollywood era witnessed a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters on screen. Films such as \"Rebecca\" (1940) and \"The Women\" (1939) featured LGBT characters, although often in the form of stereotypes. The 1950s saw the release of films like \"Bus Stop\" (1956) and \"The Caine Mutiny\" (1954), which explored themes of same-sex desire and relationships.\n\n**Modern representations**\n\nSince the 1970s, feature films featuring LGBT characters have become increasingly prominent. The establishment of the LGBT rights movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to a surge in films that explored LGBT themes and issues. The 1970s saw the release of films like \"Scarecrow\" (1973) and \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), which featured LGBT characters and explored themes of same-sex desire.\n\n## 1980s to 1990s\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s witnessed a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters on screen. Films like \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" (1985) and \"Maurice\" (1987) explored themes of same-sex desire and relationships, while films like \"Philadelphia\" (1993) and \"The Birdcage\" (1996) featured LGBT characters in leading roles.\n\n## 2000s to 2010s\n\nThe 2000s and 2010s saw a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters in mainstream cinema. Films like \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005) and \"Milk\" (2008) explored themes of same-sex desire and relationships, while films like \"Moonlight\" (2016) and \"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017) featured LGBT characters in leading roles.\n\n**Modern trends and developments**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters in mainstream cinema. This trend can be attributed to the growing visibility and acceptance of LGBT individuals in society, as well as the increasing demand for diverse and inclusive storytelling. The use of LGBT characters in films has also become more nuanced and complex, reflecting the diversity of the LGBT community and exploring a range of themes and issues.\n\n## Increased representation in mainstream cinema\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of mainstream films featuring LGBT characters.

The film serves as the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and the sequel to the 2008 film Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The story follows Indiana Jones, a renowned archaeologist, as he navigates a complex web of ancient artifacts, Nazi conspiracies, and personal demons.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1969, on the eve of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Indiana Jones, now in his 70s, has retired from his archaeological pursuits and is struggling to come to terms with his own mortality. However, his peaceful life is disrupted when he receives a cryptic message from his former flame, Helena Shaw, who has been missing for over 20 years.\n\nHelena reveals that she has been working on a top-secret project, codenamed \"Dial of Destiny,\" which has the potential to change the course of human history. The Dial, an ancient device created by a mystical cult, has the power to manipulate time itself. As Indiana delves deeper into the mystery, he discovers that a group of Nazis, led by a former acquaintance, J√ºrgen Voller, are also seeking to claim the Dial for their own nefarious purposes.\n\nIndiana's journey takes him from the streets of Paris to the deserts of Egypt, as he navigates treacherous landscapes, ancient ruins, and rival treasure hunters. Along the way, he must confront his own past and the consequences of his actions, all while racing against time to prevent the Dial of Destiny from falling into the wrong hands.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Mads Mikkelsen as J√ºrgen Voller\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Wilhelm Strudel\n* Boyd Holbrook as Klaber\n* Shaunette Ren√©e Wilson as May Day\n* Toby Jones as Basil Shaw\n* Antonio Banderas as Juanito\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began to take shape in the early 2000s, shortly after the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Frank Marshall, the long-time producer of the franchise, began exploring new storylines and characters, while Harrison Ford expressed interest in reprising his role as Indiana Jones.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2018, with James Mangold hired to direct and write the screenplay. Mangold brought a new perspective to the franchise, incorporating elements of sci-fi and mythology into the story. The production team spent several months researching and developing the script, working closely with Ford and the other cast members to ensure that the film stayed true to the spirit of the original trilogy.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was extensive, with many actors auditioning for key roles. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, a rising star in Hollywood, was cast as Helena Shaw, while Mads Mikkelsen brought his signature intensity to the role of J√ºrgen Voller.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in 2021, with a significant portion of the shoot occurring on location in the United Kingdom. The production team worked tirelessly to recreate the iconic landscapes and sets of the original trilogy, while also incorporating new technologies and special effects to bring the story to life.\n\n### Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for the film were a major undertaking, with a team of over 100 artists and technicians working on the project. The production used a combination of practical and CGI effects to create the film's stunning action sequences, ancient ruins, and futuristic technologies.\n\n### De-aging\n\nThe film's most notable visual effect was the de-aging of Harrison Ford, which allowed him to appear as Indiana Jones in his 70s, while still maintaining the character's youthful energy and vitality. The de-aging process involved a combination of makeup, prosthetics, and CGI, which were carefully integrated to create a seamless and convincing effect.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for the film was composed by John Williams, who returned to the franchise after a 15-year absence. Williams' iconic theme, \"Raiders March,\" was reworked to incorporate new elements and motifs, while also paying homage to the original trilogy.\n\n**Themes and influences**\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny explores several themes, including the consequences of playing with time, the power of ancient artifacts, and the importance of legacy and personal responsibility. The film also draws inspiration from various cultural and mythological sources, including ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology, as well as the works of H.G. Wells and J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for the film was extensive, with a mix of traditional and social media promotions. The first trailer was released in 2022, showcasing the film's stunning action sequences and ancient artifacts. The marketing team also created a series of interactive experiences and events, which allowed fans to explore the world of Indiana Jones and engage with the story.\n\n### Theatrical\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2023, before opening in theaters worldwide in June 2023. The film received a wide release, with over 4,000 screens in the United States and a significant number of IMAX and 3D showings.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media in August 2023, with a Blu-ray and digital download release. The home media package includes a range of special features, including behind-the-scenes footage, cast and crew interviews, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny grossed over $700 million at the global box office, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2023. The film performed well in most markets, with a strong opening weekend in the United States and a prolonged run in China.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to the film was mixed, with some reviewers praising the film's action sequences, visual effects, and Harrison Ford's performance, while others criticized the story, characters, and pacing. The film holds a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews.\n\n### Accolades\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny received several awards and nominations, including three Academy Award nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Sound.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe future of the Indiana Jones franchise is uncertain, with no official announcements or confirmations regarding a sixth installment or spin-off. However, the success of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny suggests that the franchise remains viable and popular, and it is likely that we will see more of Indiana Jones in the future.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of Indiana Jones films\n* List of Indiana Jones characters\n* List of Indiana Jones adventures\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's script was written in collaboration with Harrison Ford, who provided input and feedback throughout the process.\n* The film's production team spent several months researching and developing the script, working closely with Ford and the other cast members to ensure that the film stayed true to the spirit of the original trilogy.\n* The film's visual effects were a major undertaking, with a team of over 100 artists and technicians working on the project.\n* The film's de-aging effects were achieved through a combination of makeup, prosthetics, and CGI.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at IMDb\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n###De-aging\n##Music\n#Themes and influences\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the key aspects of testate succession in South Africa, including freedom of testation, testamentary capacity, formalities for execution of a will, and the effect of wills on the rights of heirs, legatees, and fiduciaries.\n\n**Freedom of Testation**\n\nFreedom of testation is the ability of a testator to dispose of their property as they see fit in their will. However, there are certain limitations to this freedom.\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator cannot make dispositions in their will that are illegal or contrary to public policy. For example, a testator cannot leave their property to a person who is under a disability, such as a minor or a person with a mental illness.\n\n#### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act 70 of 1970 regulates the subdivision of agricultural land in South Africa. A testator cannot make a disposition of agricultural land in their will that would result in the subdivision of the land in contravention of this Act.\n\n#### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 regulates the subdivision of mineral rights in South Africa. A testator cannot make a disposition of mineral rights in their will that would result in the subdivision of the rights in contravention of this Act.\n\n#### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a type of trust that can be created in a will. However, a testator cannot create a fideicommissum multiplex in their will that would result in the creation of a trust that is not valid under the Trust Property Control Act 57 of 1988.\n\n#### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nA testator cannot make a disposition of their property in their will that would result in the surviving spouse being left without adequate maintenance.\n\n#### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nA testator cannot make a disposition of their property in their will that would result in the minor children being left without adequate maintenance and education.\n\n#### Pension Funds\n\nA testator cannot make a disposition of their pension funds in their will that would result in the pension funds being left to a person who is not a dependant of the testator.\n\n### Delegation\n\nA testator can delegate the administration of their estate to a person of their choice in their will. However, the delegate must be a competent person and must be willing to act as the administrator of the estate.\n\n### Customary Law\n\nCustomary law can play a role in testate succession in South Africa, particularly in the case of traditional communities. However, customary law must be consistent with the principles of the Constitution and must not be inconsistent with the law of succession.\n\n**Testamentary Capacity**\n\nTestamentary capacity refers to the ability of a testator to make a valid will. A testator must have mental ability and must not be subject to undue influence in order to make a valid will.\n\n### Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nA testator must have mental ability in order to make a valid will. This means that the testator must be able to understand the nature and extent of their property, the people who would benefit from their estate, and the consequences of their dispositions.\n\n### Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nA testator must not be subject to undue influence in order to make a valid will. Undue influence can take many forms, including coercion, manipulation, and exploitation.\n\n**Capacity to Witness a Will**\n\nA person must have the capacity to witness a will in order to sign as a witness. A person who is under a disability, such as a minor or a person with a mental illness, cannot sign as a witness to a will.\n\n**Formalities for Execution of a Will**\n\nA will must be executed in a particular way in order to be valid. The formalities for execution of a will in South Africa are as follows:\n\n### Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be in writing and must be signed by the testator. The testator must also sign the will in the presence of two witnesses, who must also sign the will.\n\n### Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA will can be executed in a number of different ways, including:\n\n* By signing the will in the presence of two witnesses;\n* By signing the will in the presence of a notary public;\n* By signing the will in the presence of a commissioner of oaths.\n\n### Signing and Signature\n\nThe testator must sign the will in a legible hand and must indicate their intention to sign the will. The witnesses must also sign the will and must indicate their intention to sign the will.\n\n### Certificate\n\nA certificate must be obtained from a notary public or a commissioner of oaths in order to prove that the will was executed in accordance with the formalities.\n\n### Witnesses\n\nThe witnesses to a will must be competent persons and must be willing to act as witnesses. The witnesses must also sign the will in the presence of the testator.\n\n**Condonation**\n\nCondonation is the act of forgiving a disposition in a will that would otherwise be void. A condonation can be made by the person who would have been the beneficiary of the disposition, or by the person who made the disposition.\n\n**Invalid Wills**\n\nA will can be invalid for a number of reasons, including:\n\n* Lack of testamentary capacity;\n* Lack of formalities for execution;\n* Undue influence;\n* Illegal dispositions.\n\n### Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by the testator in a number of different ways, including:\n\n* By making a later will or codicil;\n* By physically or symbolically destroying the will;\n* By ademption;\n* By other means of revocation.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nThe testator has the right to revoke their will at any time before their death. The testator can also revoke their will after their death, but only if the revocation is made before the will is probated.\n\n### Manner\n\nThe revocation of a will can be made in a number of different ways, including:\n\n* By making a later will or codicil;\n* By physically or symbolically destroying the will;\n* By ademption;\n* By other means of revocation.\n\n### Later Will or Codicil\n\nA later will or codicil can be used to revoke a previous will. The later will or codicil must be executed in accordance with the formalities for execution of a will.\n\n### Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nThe physical or symbolic destruction of a will can be used to revoke the will. The destruction must be intentional and must be done with the intention of revoking the will.\n\n### Ademption\n\nAdemption is the act of revoking a disposition in a will by substituting a newer disposition. Ademption can be used to revoke a disposition in a will that is no longer valid.\n\n### Other Means of Revocation\n\nOther means of revocation can include:\n\n* The destruction of the will;\n* The loss or spoliation of the will;\n* The making of a later will or codicil.\n\n### Divorce or Annulment of Marriage\n\nThe divorce or annulment of a marriage can be used to revoke a disposition in a will that was made in favor of the former spouse.\n\n### Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can Be Revoked\n\nThere are a number of exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked. These include:\n\n* A will that is made by a person who is under a disability;\n* A will that is made by a person who is subject to undue influence;\n* A will that is made by a person who is not competent to make a will.\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived in a number of different ways, including:\n\n* By the testator making a later will or codicil that revives the revoked will;\n* By the testator physically or symbolically restoring the revoked will;\n* By the court reviving the revoked will.\n\n**Alteration or Variation**\n\nA will can be altered or varied in a number of different ways, including:\n\n* By amendment by the testator;\n* By rectification by the court;\n* By alteration or variation by the court.\n\n### Amendment by Testator\n\nA testator can amend their will by making a codicil. The codicil must be executed in accordance with the formalities for execution of a will.\n\n### Rectification by Court\n\nThe court can rectify a will by altering or varying the will to reflect the testator's true intentions. The court can only rectify a will if the testator's true intentions are clear and if the rectification is necessary to carry out the testator's wishes.\n\n### Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nThe court can alter or vary a will if the testator's true intentions are clear and if the alteration or variation is necessary to carry out the testator's wishes.\n\n**Incorporation by Reference**\n\nA will can incorporate a document or other instrument by reference. The document or instrument must be identified and must be incorporated into the will.\n\n**Obsolete and Provincial Wills**\n\nObsolete and provincial wills are wills that were made under laws that have since been repealed or changed. Obsolete and provincial wills can still be valid, but they must be interpreted in light of the current laws.\n\n**Joint or Mutual Wills**\n\nJoint or mutual wills are wills that are made by two or more people who are married or in a domestic partnership. Joint or mutual wills can be used to distribute property jointly or to make reciprocal bequests.\n\n**Probate of Wills**\n\nProbate is the process of proving the validity of a will in a court of law.

The franchise has undergone significant development and expansion since its inception, with a focus on creating a cohesive and interconnected narrative universe.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **DC Extended Universe**\n\nThe DC Extended Universe (DCEU) was the first attempt by Warner Bros. to create a shared universe for its DC Comics properties. The DCEU began with the release of **Man of Steel** in 2013, a reboot of the Superman film franchise. The DCEU aimed to create a cohesive and interconnected universe, with each film building upon the events of the previous one. However, the DCEU ultimately failed to achieve its goal, with a mixed critical and commercial response to its films.\n\n### **Warner Bros. Discovery**\n\nIn 2021, WarnerMedia merged with Discovery, Inc. to form Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). As a result, the DC Universe has undergone significant changes, with a new focus on creating a more cohesive and streamlined universe. WBD has emphasized the importance of a shared universe, with a focus on creating a more immersive and engaging experience for fans.\n\n**Development**\n\n### **DC Studios and initial developments**\n\nIn 2022, WBD announced the creation of DC Studios, a new division dedicated to developing and producing DC Comics properties. DC Studios is led by James Gunn and Peter Safran, who will oversee the development of all DC Comics-related projects. The duo has stated that their goal is to create a more cohesive and interconnected universe, with a focus on telling more complex and mature stories.\n\n### **Chapter One: Gods and Monsters**\n\nIn an effort to reboot the DCEU, DC Studios has announced a new initiative called Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. This initiative will see the release of several new films and television series, all of which will be interconnected and part of the larger DC Universe. The goal of Chapter One is to create a fresh and exciting take on the DC Comics characters, while also laying the groundwork for a more cohesive and expansive universe.\n\n**Films**\n\n### **Superman (2025)**\n\nThe first film in the Chapter One initiative is **Superman**, which is set to be released in 2025.

The platform was developed by Meta Platforms, Inc., the same company behind Facebook and Instagram. Threads was launched on July 5, 2023, as a separate app from Instagram, with the goal of providing a more intimate and conversational space for users to share their thoughts and ideas.\n\n**History**\n\n### **Predecessor**\n\nThe idea of creating a separate app for sharing short text posts was first conceived by Instagram, which had been experimenting with a similar feature called \"Notes\" since 2022. However, the feature was met with mixed reviews, and the company ultimately decided to create a standalone app, which became Threads.\n\n### **Development and announcement**\n\nDevelopment on Threads began in earnest in 2022, with a team of engineers and designers working on the project. The app was designed to be a more intimate and conversational space, with a focus on sharing short text posts rather than photos and videos. In May 2023, Meta announced that it was working on a new app called Threads, which would allow users to share short text posts with their followers.\n\n### **Launch**\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, with a global rollout on the App Store and Google Play Store. The app was initially available in over 100 countries, with support for multiple languages. To promote the launch, Meta ran a series of ads and social media campaigns, highlighting the app's features and benefits.\n\n**Appearance and features**\n\n### **Possibility of open interoperability**\n\nOne of the key features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability, which would allow users to share their posts and engage with other platforms, such as Twitter and Mastodon. This feature is still in development, but Meta has stated that it is committed to making Threads a more open and decentralized platform.\n\n### **Account integration with Instagram**\n\nThreads is closely integrated with Instagram, allowing users to share their posts and engage with their followers on both platforms. Users can also share their Instagram posts on Threads, and vice versa. This integration has been well-received by users, who appreciate the ability to share their content across multiple platforms.\n\n### **Device compatibility**\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, as well as on the web. The app is designed to be highly responsive and user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface.\n\n### **Censorship attempts**\n\nIn the days following the launch of Threads, the company faced criticism and censorship attempts from several governments and organizations. In China, for example, the government banned the app, citing concerns over \"cybersecurity and national security.\" Meta responded by saying that it would not comply with the ban and would continue to operate in the country.\n\n### **Advertising**\n\nThreads is free from advertising, a departure from most social media platforms. Instead, the app relies on a subscription-based model, with users able to upgrade to a premium version for additional features and perks.\n\n**Userbase**\n\n### **Decline in the months after launch**\n\nIn the months following the launch of Threads, the app's userbase began to decline, with many users citing frustration with the app's performance and lack of features. Meta responded by saying that it was working on addressing the issues and would continue to update and improve the app.\n\n### **Popularity in Taiwan**\n\nDespite the decline in the months following the launch, Threads remains popular in Taiwan, where it has become a go-to platform for sharing news and information. The app's popularity in the country has been driven in part by its close ties to Instagram, which is extremely popular in Taiwan.\n\n**Responses**\n\n### **Intellectual property dispute**\n\nIn August 2023, Meta faced an intellectual property dispute with a rival social media company, which claimed that Threads infringed on its trademark. Meta responded by saying that it would defend its rights and would continue to operate the app.\n\n### **Data privacy**\n\nIn response to concerns over data privacy, Meta has said that it will take steps to protect users' data and keep their information private. The company has also said that it will comply with all relevant data protection regulations and will be transparent about its data collection and usage practices.\n\n### **State media**\n\nIn September 2023, the Chinese government launched a state-run media campaign against Threads, accusing the app of spreading \"anti-China\" content. Meta responded by saying that it would continue to operate in China and would not be intimidated by the government's actions.\n\n### **Imitating other platforms**\n\nIn an effort to compete with other social media platforms, Threads has introduced several features that are similar to those found on other apps. For example, the app now allows users to share short videos, a feature that is similar to that found on TikTok.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Instagram\n* Meta Platforms, Inc.\n* Social media\n* Communication\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references as per your requirements.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Meta's official blog on Threads\n* Threads' official website\n* Meta's official social media channels", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The tournament was the 15th edition of the Candidates Tournament and was organized by the World Chess Council (WCC).\n\n**#Participants**\n\nThe tournament featured eight participants, who qualified through various routes:\n\n##**Qualification of Radjabov**\n\nTeimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan qualified for the Candidates Tournament by finishing second in the 2021 FIDE Grand Prix Series. Radjabov had a strong performance in the series, winning one event and finishing runner-up in another. His qualification marked a return to the top level of international chess for the Azerbaijani grandmaster.\n\n##**Disqualification of Karjakin**\n\nSergey Karjakin of Russia was initially qualified for the tournament but was subsequently disqualified due to a doping ban. Karjakin had tested positive for a prohibited substance in 2020, and his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was rejected. As a result, he was stripped of his qualification and replaced by another player.\n\n##**Qualification of Ding Liren**\n\nDing Liren of China qualified for the tournament by winning the 2021 FIDE World Cup. Ding had a dominant performance in the tournament, defeating several top-ranked players en route to the final. His qualification marked a significant achievement for Chinese chess, as he became the first Chinese player to qualify for the Candidates Tournament since Hou Yifan in 2013.\n\n**#Organization**\n\nThe Candidates Tournament was organized by the World Chess Council (WCC) in collaboration with the FIDE. The tournament was held at the Hotel Meli√° Madrid Princesa in Madrid, Spain, and took place from June 16 to June 30, 2022. The tournament was played over 14 rounds, with each player competing against each other player once.\n\n##**Regulations**\n\nThe tournament was played under FIDE rules, with the following regulations:\n\n* The tournament was played with the classical time control of 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 60 minutes for the next 20 moves, and then 15 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 30-second increment from move 41.\n* The tiebreak system used was the aggregate score of the players' scores in the classical games, with the player having the higher aggregate score considered the winner.\n* In the event of a tie in the aggregate score, the winner was determined by a tiebreak game, played under the same time control as the classical games.\n\n**#Results**\n\nThe tournament was highly competitive, with several players vying for the top spot. The final standings were as follows:\n\n##**Standings**\n\n| Rank | Player | Country | Score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ian Nepomniachtchi | Russia | 8.5/14 |\n| 2 | Ding Liren | China | 8.5/14 |\n| 3 | Alireza Firouzja | France | 8/14 |\n| 4 | Teimour Radjabov | Azerbaijan | 7.5/14 |\n| 5 | Alexander Grischuk | Russia | 7/14 |\n| 6 | Richard Rapport | Hungary | 6.5/14 |\n| 7 | Veselin Topalov | Bulgaria | 6.5/14 |\n| 8 | Wang Hao | China | 6/14 |\n\n##**Points by round**\n\nThe points accumulated by each player throughout the tournament were as follows:\n\n| Round | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ian Nepomniachtchi | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 |\n| Ding Liren | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5 | 6 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8 | 8 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 |\n| Alireza Firouzja | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |\n| Teimour Radjabov | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8 | 8 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 7.5 |\n| Alexander Grischuk | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5 | 6 | 6.5 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 7 |\n| Richard Rapport | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6 | 6 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 |\n| Veselin Topalov | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 | 5.5 | 6 | 6 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 | 6.5 |\n| Wang Hao | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 |\n\n##**Results by round**\n\nThe results of each round were as follows:\n\n| Round | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ian Nepomniachtchi | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 |\n| Ding Liren | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 |\n| Alireza Firouzja | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1-0 |\n| Teimour Radjabov | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 0-1 | 1/2-1/2 | 0-1 |\n| Alexander Grischuk | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 |\n| Richard Rapport | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 |\n| Veselin Topalov | 0-1 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 | 1/2-1/2 |\n| Wang Hao | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 1/2-1/2 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 1-0 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 | 0-1 |\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of chess tournaments\n* World Chess Championship\n\n**#Notes**\n\n* The tournament was held under the auspices of the World Chess Council (WCC).\n* The tournament was played with the classical time control of 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 60 minutes for the next 20 moves, and then 15 minutes for the remainder of the game, with a 30-second increment from move 41.\n* The tiebreak system used was the aggregate score of the players' scores in the classical games, with the player having the higher aggregate score considered the winner.\n* In the event of a tie in the aggregate score, the winner was determined by a tiebreak game, played under the same time control as the classical games.\n\n**#References**\n\nThere are no references provided for this article.\n\n**#External links**\n\n* Official website of the Candidates Tournament 2022", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Candidates_Tournament_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Participants\n##Qualification of Radjabov\n##Disqualification of Karjakin\n##Qualification of Ding Liren\n#Organization\n##Regulations\n#Results\n##Standings\n##Points by round\n##Results by round\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The effects of climate change are far-reaching and multifaceted, impacting various aspects of the environment, human societies, and economies. This article provides an overview of the effects of climate change, covering changes in temperature, weather, land, oceans, ice and snow, wildlife and nature, tipping points, health, food security, water security, human settlements, and economic impacts.\n\n**Changes in Temperature**\n\nOne of the most significant effects of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1¬∞C since the late 19th century, and is projected to continue to rise by 2-5¬∞C by the end of this century. This increase in temperature is causing a range of effects, including:\n\n* **Heat waves and temperature extremes**: As the planet warms, heat waves are becoming more frequent and severe, leading to increased mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children.\n* **Rain**: Changes in precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and intense rainfall events, causing flooding and landslides.\n* **Extreme storms**: Climate change is also increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons, and droughts.\n\n**Land**\n\nClimate change is affecting the Earth's land surface in various ways, including:\n\n* **Floods**: Changes in precipitation patterns and sea level rise are leading to more frequent and severe flooding, especially in coastal areas and low-lying regions.\n* **Droughts**: Climate change is also increasing the frequency and severity of droughts, affecting agriculture and water resources.\n* **Wildfires**: Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are creating conditions that are more conducive to wildfires, which are threatening forests and communities.\n\n**Oceans**\n\nThe oceans are also being affected by climate change, including:\n\n* **Sea level rise**: Melting of glaciers and ice sheets is causing sea levels to rise, leading to coastal erosion and flooding.\n* **Ocean acidification**: The absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans is causing a decrease in pH levels, affecting marine ecosystems and the global carbon cycle.\n\n**Ice and Snow**\n\nThe Earth's ice and snow cover is also being affected by climate change, including:\n\n* **Glaciers decline**: Glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate, leading to sea level rise and changes in global water cycles.\n* **Ice sheets decline**: The ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are also declining, contributing to sea level rise.\n* **Sea ice decline**: The extent and thickness of sea ice are declining, affecting marine ecosystems and global weather patterns.\n* **Permafrost thawing**: The permafrost is thawing, releasing methane and carbon dioxide, which are potent greenhouse gases.\n\n**Wildlife and Nature**\n\nClimate change is affecting the Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity, including:\n\n* **Ecosystems on land**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting the distribution and abundance of plants and animals.\n* **Marine ecosystems**: Climate change is affecting the health and productivity of marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and ocean fisheries.\n\n**Tipping points and irreversible impacts**\n\nClimate change is also causing tipping points and irreversible impacts, including:\n\n* **Ice sheet collapse**: The collapse of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would lead to rapid sea level rise.\n* **Coral bleaching**: Mass coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent, leading to the loss of coral reefs and marine biodiversity.\n\n**Health, food security, and water security**\n\nClimate change is also affecting human health, food security, and water security, including:\n\n* **Health**: Climate change is increasing the spread of diseases and heat-related illnesses.\n* **Food security**: Climate change is affecting agriculture and food production, leading to food insecurity and malnutrition.\n* **Water security**: Climate change is affecting water availability and quality, leading to water scarcity and conflicts.\n\n**Human settlements**\n\nClimate change is also affecting human settlements, including:\n\n* **Impacts from heat**: Rising temperatures are affecting human health and well-being, especially in urban areas.\n* **Low-lying coastal regions**: Sea level rise is threatening coastal communities and infrastructure.\n\n**Impacts on societies**\n\nClimate change is also affecting societies and communities, including:\n\n* **Displacement and migration**: Climate change is leading to displacement and migration of people, especially in vulnerable communities.\n* **Conflict**: Climate change is increasing the risk of conflict over resources and territory.\n* **Social impacts on vulnerable groups**: Climate change is disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups, including women, children, and indigenous peoples.\n\n**Economic impacts**\n\nClimate change is also affecting the economy, including:\n\n* **Economic inequality**: Climate change is exacerbating economic inequality, as those who are most vulnerable to climate

The film stars Kenneth Branagh as Agatha Christie, alongside Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver, and Emma Thompson as Lady Tressingham.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 1952, and follows Agatha Christie, a world-renowned mystery writer, as she travels to Venice to attend a literary festival. Christie is accompanied by her friend, Ariadne Oliver, a fellow writer and amateur sleuth. Upon arrival, they are met with a sense of unease and foreboding, as several writers and intellectuals have gone missing in the city.\n\nAs the festival progresses, Christie becomes increasingly entangled in a web of mystery and deceit. She discovers that each of the missing individuals was connected to a mysterious figure, known only as \"The Golem,\" who seems to be manipulating events from behind the scenes. Christie's own past is also slowly revealed, including a traumatic event that has left her with a deep-seated fear of the city.\n\nAs the bodies begin to pile up, Christie must use her exceptional detective skills to unravel the mystery and uncover the truth behind the disappearances. Along the way, she must confront her own demons and face the darkness that lies at the heart of Venice.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Kenneth Branagh as Agatha Christie\n* Tina Fey as Ariadne Oliver\n* Emma Thompson as Lady Tressingham\n* Matthew Macfadyen as Detective Spencer\n* Tom Hiddleston as Julian\n* Rebecca Hall as Sophie\n* Maxine Peake as Lucy\n* Rupert Graves as Detective Ricks\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nA Haunting in Venice was first announced in 2020, with Kenneth Branagh set to direct and star in the film.

The production team also built several sets to recreate specific locations, including the interior of the Hotel Danieli and the exterior of the famous Venice Carnival.\n\nOne of the most striking sets in the film is the interior of the Hotel Danieli, which serves as a kind of \"safe house\" for Agatha Christie. The set was built in a studio, and features a elaborate and ornate design that reflects the hotel's opulent style.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for A Haunting in Venice was composed by Alexandre Desplat, who is known for his work on a number of high-profile films. The score is a mix of traditional and modern elements, and features a number of themes that are designed to evoke the sense of mystery and unease that pervades the film.\n\nIn an interview, Alexandre Desplat stated that he was drawn to the project because of the opportunity to work with Kenneth Branagh and Christopher Hampton. \"I've always been a great admirer of Agatha Christie's work, and I saw this as a chance to bring her stories to life in a new and exciting way,\" he said. \"I wanted to create a score that would be both haunting and beautiful, and that would capture the sense of atmosphere and foreboding that pervades the film.\"\n\n**Release**\n\nA Haunting in Venice was released in theaters on September 22, 2023, and was distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was released in a number of formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\nThe film was well-received by critics, with many praising the performances of the cast and the direction of the film.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch in history, serving for over 70 years.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926 at 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair, London, to Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, Duchess of York. She was the first child of the couple and their eldest daughter, Princess Elizabeth, was born on 21 April 1926. Elizabeth's early life was marked by a traditional upbringing, with her education taking place at home and at the private school, Goring Hall.\n\nAs a young girl, Elizabeth was fascinated by her father's military service and often accompanied him on visits to various army bases. She also showed a keen interest in horses and was an accomplished rider. Elizabeth's parents were devoted to their children and provided a loving and supportive environment. However, the family's life was also marked by the absence of her father, who was often away at sea or on official duties.\n\n**Heir Presumptive**\n\nElizabeth's early life as a potential monarch was marked by her father's health struggles. King George VI suffered from a chronic lung condition and was not expected to live long. As a result, Elizabeth's uncle, Edward, Duke of Windsor, was next in line to the throne. However, Edward's abdication in 1936 due to his marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee, made Elizabeth the heir presumptive.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nAs the Second World War broke out in 1939, Elizabeth's father, now King George VI, took on a more prominent role as the monarch. Elizabeth, then just 13 years old, began to take on more responsibilities, including supporting her father and her people during the war. She also began to receive military training, learning about the workings of the military and its various branches.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a naval officer of Greek and Danish descent. The marriage took place on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony watched by millions of people around the world. Elizabeth and Philip had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales (born 1948); Anne, Princess Royal (born 1950); Prince Andrew, Duke of York (born 1960); and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (born 1964).\n\n**Reign**\n\n**Accession and Coronation**\n\nOn 6 February 1952, King George VI died, and Elizabeth became the monarch at the age of just 25. Her accession was met with widespread celebration across the Commonwealth. Elizabeth's coronation took place on 2 June 1953 at Westminster Abbey, in a ceremony watched by millions of people around the world. The coronation marked the beginning of Elizabeth's reign, which would last for over 70 years.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nElizabeth's early reign was marked by a period of significant change and modernization. She played a key role in promoting the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of states formerly part of the British Empire. Elizabeth also played a significant role in promoting British culture and identity. She was also a strong supporter of the British monarchy's role in supporting British industries, including the arts and manufacturing.\n\n**Political Reforms and Crises**\n\nElizabeth's reign was also marked by significant political reforms and crises. One of the most notable was the Suez Crisis in 1956, in which the British government's attempt to regain control of the Suez Canal from Egypt led to a major international incident. Elizabeth's government was forced to withdraw from the canal, and the crisis marked a significant shift in British foreign policy.\n\n**Perils and Dissent**\n\nElizabeth's reign was also marked by periods of dissent and controversy. One of the most notable was the decolonization of Africa, in which many African countries gained independence from Britain. Elizabeth's government was criticized for its handling of the process, with many accusing it of being too slow and too reluctant to grant independence.\n\n**Turbulent Years**\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s were marked by significant turmoil and controversy. Elizabeth's government faced significant opposition from the Labour Party and other left-wing groups, who accused it of being out of touch with the needs of the working class. The monarchy also faced criticism for its handling of the Falklands War, in which British forces invaded the Falkland Islands, a British territory in the South Atlantic, in order to retake them from Argentine forces.\n\n**Dawn of the New Millennium**\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw a significant shift in Elizabeth's reign, as she began to take on a more symbolic role. She played a key role in promoting British culture and identity, and was a strong supporter of the arts. Elizabeth also played a significant role in promoting British industry, including the financial sector.\n\n**Diamond Jubilee and Milestones**\n\nIn 2012, Elizabeth celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. The anniversary was marked by widespread celebrations across the Commonwealth, including a pageant on the River Thames and a concert at Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth also celebrated other significant milestones, including the 50th anniversary of her accession and the 60th anniversary of her marriage.\n\n**Pandemic and Widowhood**\n\nIn 2020, Elizabeth's reign was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the British economy and society. Elizabeth's government was forced to impose significant restrictions on public life, including lockdowns and mask mandates. Elizabeth also played a key role in promoting British industry and culture during the pandemic.\n\nElizabeth's husband, Prince Philip, passed away on 9 April 2021, at the age of 99. Elizabeth was deeply affected by his death, and paid tribute to him in a public statement.\n\n**Platinum Jubilee and Beyond**\n\nIn 2022, Elizabeth celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne. The anniversary was marked by widespread celebrations across the Commonwealth, including a pageant on the River Thames and a concert at Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth's reign marked a significant shift in British history, as the monarchy evolved to meet the changing needs of the nation.\n\n**Death**\n\nElizabeth II passed away on 8 September 2022, at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Her death was met with widespread mourning across the Commonwealth, and she was succeeded by her son, Charles, Prince of Wales.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nElizabeth II's legacy is complex and multifaceted. She played a significant role in promoting British culture and identity, and was a strong supporter of the arts. Elizabeth also played a significant role in promoting British industry, including the financial sector. However, her reign was also marked by significant controversy and criticism, including her handling of the decolonization of Africa and the Falklands War.\n\n**Beliefs, Activities, and Interests**\n\nElizabeth II was a devout Christian and a strong supporter of the Church of England.

The scheme aims to provide a career path for young Indians in the armed forces, with a focus on youth development and skill enhancement.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in recruiting and retaining personnel due to various factors, including demographic changes, urbanization, and the availability of alternative job opportunities. The traditional model of recruitment, which relied on a long-term commitment from soldiers, has not been effective in attracting and retaining talented youth. The Ministry of Defence, in collaboration with the three services, has been working to revamp the recruitment process and provide a more attractive and flexible career path for young Indians.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is a four-year training program for young Indians, with a focus on skill development and youth empowerment. The scheme aims to provide a platform for young individuals to acquire skills, knowledge, and experience in a structured environment, with the option to join the armed forces or pursue other career opportunities after completing their training. The scheme is designed to cater to the needs of the armed forces, while also providing a career path for young Indians.\n\n**Reservation and Welfare Benefits**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides various benefits to its recruits, including:\n\n* **Reservation**: The scheme provides 10% reservation for Agniveers from the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category.\n* **Welfare benefits**: Agniveers are entitled to various welfare benefits, including a monthly stipend, food and accommodation, medical facilities, and insurance coverage.\n* **Education and skill development**: Agniveers will receive training in various skills, including technical, vocational, and soft skills, to enhance their employability and career prospects.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by various stakeholders, including:\n\n**By political parties and activists**\n\n* The scheme has been criticized for being anti-youth and anti-poor, as it does not provide a secure career path for young Indians.\n* The scheme has been accused of being a \"sacrificial lamb\" for the armed forces, as it allows the government to save on pension and other benefits.\n\n**By retired defence personnel**\n\n* The scheme has been criticized for being a \"short-term fix\" and not addressing the long-term needs of the armed forces.\n* The scheme has been accused of undermining the morale of serving personnel, who are concerned about the future of their careers.\n\n**By state governments**\n\n* The scheme has been criticized for not providing adequate compensation to the families of Agniveers who may be martyred or injured during service.\n* The scheme has been accused of being a \"centralized\" scheme, which may not take into account the specific needs and requirements of different states.\n\n**Data on employment of veterans**\n\n* The scheme has been criticized for not providing adequate data on the employment of veterans, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the scheme.\n* The scheme has been accused of not providing a clear roadmap for the career development of Agniveers, making it difficult for them to plan their future.\n\n**Protests**\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been met with widespread protests from various stakeholders, including:\n\n**Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)**\n\n* The scheme was met with a Bharat Bandh on June 17, 2022, which saw widespread protests and demonstrations across the country.\n* The strike was called by various trade unions and opposition parties, who accused the government of being anti-youth and anti-poor.\n\n**21 June onwards**\n\n* The protests continued on June 21, 2022, with demonstrations and rallies being held across the country.\n* The protests were marked by violence and vandalism, with reports of police firing and arrests being reported from various parts of the country.\n\n**Response by the Government**\n\n* The government has defended the scheme, stating that it is a necessary step to modernize the armed forces and provide a career path for young Indians.\n* The government has also accused opposition parties and trade unions of being \"obstructionist\" and \"anti-national\".\n\n**Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme**\n\n* A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the scheme, alleging that it is unconstitutional and violates the rights of young Indians.\n* The plea has been made by various stakeholders, including opposition parties and trade unions.\n\n**First Agniveer batch (2023)**\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers has been recruited from various locations across the country, including:\n\n**Hyderabad**\n\n* The first batch of Agniveers was recruited from Hyderabad, with 150 young men being selected for the program.\n* The recruits were trained at the Recruitment Training Centre in Secunderabad.\n\n**Nashik**\n\n* The second batch of Agniveers was recruited from Nashik, with 150 young men being selected for the program.\n* The recruits were trained at the Recruitment Training Centre in Nashik.\n\n**Ranikhet**\n\n* The third batch of Agniveers was recruited from Ranikhet, with 150 young men being selected for the program.\n* The recruits were trained at the Recruitment Training Centre in Ranikhet.\n\n**Amendment in recruitment procedure**\n\n* The recruitment procedure has been amended to include a written examination and physical fitness test, in addition to the existing medical examination.\n* The amendment aims to ensure that only the most talented and fit individuals are

It is a tree-like data structure that is used to store the cumulative sums of elements in an array, making it useful for a wide range of applications in computer science and mathematics.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in the 1990s as a way to efficiently calculate prefix sums and range sums in an array. The motivation behind the development of the Fenwick tree was to provide a data structure that could efficiently store and update the cumulative sums of elements in an array, making it useful for applications such as database query optimization and computational geometry.\n\n**Description**\n\nA Fenwick tree is a binary indexed tree, which means that it is a tree-like data structure that is used to store the cumulative sums of elements in an array. The tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and storing the cumulative sum of each subarray at a node in the tree.\n\n### The Interrogation Tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to calculate prefix sums and range sums. It is a binary tree where each node represents a subarray of the original array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subarray that is one element smaller than the parent node.\n\nThe interrogation tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and storing the cumulative sum of each subarray at a node in the tree. The cumulative sum of each subarray is calculated by adding the cumulative sum of the parent node to the sum of the elements in the subarray.\n\n### The Update Tree\n\nThe update tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to update the cumulative sums of elements in the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a subarray of the original array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subarray that is one element smaller than the parent node.\n\nThe update tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and storing the cumulative sum of each subarray at a node in the tree. The cumulative sum of each subarray is updated by adding the value of the element at the current index to the cumulative sum of the parent node.\n\n### The Search Tree\n\nThe search tree is the part of the Fenwick tree that is used to search for the index of a given value in the array. It is a binary tree where each node represents a subarray of the original array. The root node represents the entire array, and each child node represents a subarray that is one element smaller than the parent node.\n\nThe search tree is constructed by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and storing the cumulative sum of each subarray at a node in the tree. The cumulative sum of each subarray is used to search for the index of a given value in the array.\n\n**Pseudocode**\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of a Fenwick tree can be performed using the following pseudocode:\n\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(array):\n  n = length of array\n  tree = new array of size n+1\n  for i from 1 to n:\n    tree[i] = array[i-1]\n    if i is a power of 2:\n      tree[i] += tree[i/2]\n    else:\n      tree[i] += tree[i/2] + tree[i/2-1]\n  return tree\n```\n\nThis pseudocode constructs a Fenwick tree by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays and storing the cumulative sum of each subarray at a node in the tree.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Range sum query\n* Prefix sum query\n* Computational geometry\n* Database query optimization\n\n**References**\n\nNone\n\n**External links**\n\n* [Fenwick Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree)\n* [Binary Indexed Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_indexed_tree)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fenwick_tree\" following this outline:\n\n#Motivation\n#Description\n##The interrogation tree\n##The update tree\n##The search tree\n#Pseudocode\n##Construction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Robert Oppenheimer**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a prominent American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, a research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, and his work had a profound impact on the development of nuclear physics and the world at large.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### Childhood and Education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer, a textile importer. The Oppenheimers were a middle-class Jewish family, and Robert was the oldest of three children. He grew up in a comfortable household, with a love of reading and learning encouraged from an early age. Oppenheimer's father was a liberal Democrat, and the family was involved in various philanthropic and cultural activities.\n\nOppenheimer attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City, a progressive school that emphasized the importance of social responsibility and intellectual curiosity. He was an excellent student, particularly in mathematics and science, and was accepted into Harvard University at the age of 17. At Harvard, Oppenheimer studied chemistry and physics, and was heavily influenced by the work of Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.\n\n### Studies in Europe\n\nIn 1925, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to study under some of the leading physicists of the time. He spent two years in Cambridge, England, where he worked with J.J. Thomson and was exposed to the work of Ernest Rutherford. He then moved to G√∂ttingen, Germany, where he studied under Max Born and was introduced to the work of Werner Heisenberg. Oppenheimer's time in Europe was formative, and he was heavily influenced by the intellectual and cultural ferment of the time.\n\n**Early Career**\n\n### Teaching\n\nIn 1929, Oppenheimer returned to the United States and accepted a position as a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He quickly established himself as a leading researcher in the field of quantum mechanics, and his work on the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules was highly influential. Oppenheimer was a demanding teacher, but his students loved him for his enthusiasm and intellectual rigor.\n\n### Scientific Work\n\nOppenheimer's scientific work was extensive and diverse, and he made important contributions to many areas of physics. He was a pioneer in the development of quantum field theory, and his work on the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules was highly influential. He was also a leading figure in the development of relativistic quantum mechanics, and his work on the behavior of particles in high-energy collisions was highly regarded.\n\n**Private and Political Life**\n\n### Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a strong supporter of liberal and left-wing causes, and he was involved in various political activities throughout his life. He was a vocal critic of fascism and militarism, and he was deeply concerned about the rise of Nazism in Germany. Oppenheimer was also a strong supporter of the New Deal, and he was involved in various efforts to promote social justice and equality.\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening in 1940, and they had two children, Toni and Peter. Oppenheimer was a devoted father and husband, and his family was very important to him. He was known for his wit and humor, and his family loved him for his kindness and generosity.\n\n### Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was deeply interested in mysticism and spirituality, and he was heavily influenced by the work of various mystics and philosophers. He was particularly interested in the concept of the \"mystical experience,\" and he believed that it was possible to experience a profound sense of unity and interconnectedness with the universe. Oppenheimer's interest in mysticism was a lifelong one, and he saw it as a way of deepening his understanding of the world and his place in it.\n\n**Manhattan Project**\n\n### Los Alamos\n\nIn 1943, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project, a research and development project that aimed to produce an atomic bomb. The project was headquartered at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oppenheimer played a key role in the development of the bomb. He was a brilliant leader and administrator, and he was able to bring together a diverse group of scientists and engineers to work on the project.\n\n### Bomb Design\n\nOppenheimer was heavily involved in the design of the bomb, and he worked closely with a team of scientists and engineers to develop the project's key technologies. He was a strong supporter of the use of the bomb in war, and he believed that it was a powerful tool for ending the conflict quickly.\n\n### Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the first successful test of the atomic bomb, codenamed \"Trinity,\" was conducted at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Oppenheimer was present at the test, and he was deeply moved by the experience. He famously quoted from the Bhagavad Gita, saying \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.\"\n\n**Postwar Activities**\n\n### Institute for Advanced Study\n\nIn 1947, Oppenheimer was appointed as the director of the Institute for Advanced Study, a prestigious research center in Princeton, New Jersey. He played a key role in shaping the institute's research agenda, and he was a strong supporter of the development of new ideas and approaches in physics.\n\n### Atomic Energy Commission\n\nIn 1949, Oppenheimer was appointed as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, a federal agency responsible for regulating the development and use of nuclear energy. He was a strong critic of the commission's policies, and he advocated for greater transparency and accountability in its decision-making processes.\n\n### Panels and Study Groups\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific participant in various panels and study groups, and he played a key role in shaping policy and research agendas in a variety of areas. He was a strong advocate for the development of new technologies and approaches, and he was deeply concerned about the social and environmental implications of scientific progress.\n\n### Security Hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security hearing, in which he was accused of being a security risk due to his alleged ties to communism. The hearing was highly contentious, and Oppenheimer was ultimately cleared of the charges. The hearing was a major blow to Oppenheimer's reputation, and it marked a turning point in his career.\n\n**Final Years**\n\n### Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, a prestigious honor for his contributions to physics. He was a strong supporter of the award, and he saw it as a way of recognizing the importance of scientific research and innovation.\n\n**Death**\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer. He was a deeply respected and influential figure in the scientific community, and his legacy continues to be felt today.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted, and he is remembered for his many contributions to physics, politics, and society.

The country's geographical location, bordering the Soviet Union and later Russia, has made it a significant player in European security politics. The following article provides an overview of Finland's relations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), from its early neutrality to its recent accession as a member state.\n\n## History\n\n### Background: Finnish Neutrality at the End of World War II\n\nFinland declared its independence from Russia in 1917, but the country's geographic location made it vulnerable to Soviet influence. After World War II, Finland maintained a policy of neutrality, which was formalized in the 1947 Treaty of Paris. This treaty established Finland's borders and recognized its sovereignty, but also imposed significant limitations on its military capabilities and foreign policy.\n\n### 1949‚Äì1991: Finnish Neutrality During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's neutrality was a key aspect of its foreign policy. The country maintained good relations with both the Soviet Union and the Western bloc, but avoided taking a clear stance on the conflict. Finland's military was also limited, with a focus on defensive capabilities rather than offensive operations. This policy allowed Finland to maintain its independence while avoiding conflict with its powerful neighbor.\n\n### 1991‚Äì1995: Immediate Aftermath of the Cold War\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country began to reassess its relationships with its neighbors and the wider international community. Finland applied for membership in the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1992, which it joined in 1995. This marked a significant shift towards integration with Western Europe and away from its earlier neutrality.\n\n### 1995‚Äì2022: Shift from Non-Alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's membership in the European Union (EU) marked a significant shift in its foreign policy. The country became an active participant in EU decision-making and began to engage more closely with its Western partners. Finland's military also began to modernize and expand, with a focus on interoperability with other NATO member states. However, Finland's commitment to military defense remained limited, with a strong emphasis on civil-military cooperation and crisis management.\n\n### 2022‚Äì2023: Accession Process Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 marked a significant turning point in Finland's foreign policy. The country's parliament voted to declare its intention to join NATO in May 2022, and an application was submitted to the alliance in the same month. Finland's accession process was accelerated by the rapid expansion of NATO following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#### February ‚Äì May 2022: Initial Response to the Invasion\n\nFinland's initial response to the invasion of Ukraine was cautious, with a focus on condemning the aggression and providing humanitarian aid. However, as the conflict escalated, Finland began to reassess its relationships with its neighbors and the wider international community. The country's parliament held a series of debates on NATO membership, with a strong majority in favor of joining the alliance.\n\n#### May ‚Äì June 2022: Declaration of Intent, Application\n\nIn May 2022, Finland's parliament voted to declare its intention to join NATO. The country's application was submitted to the alliance in the same month, marking a significant step towards membership. Finland's accession process was accelerated by the rapid expansion of NATO following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#### June 2022 ‚Äì April 2023: Ratification\n\nFinland's accession process was completed in April 2023, when the country's parliament ratified the NATO membership agreement. The ratification process was marked by a series of debates and votes, with a strong majority in favor of joining the alliance. Finland's accession to NATO marked a significant shift in its foreign policy, with a strong emphasis on collective defense and cooperation with its Western partners.\n\n## Finland's Foreign Relations with Other NATO Member States\n\nAs a new member of NATO, Finland's foreign relations with other member states will be shaped by its commitment to collective defense and cooperation. Finland will maintain close relationships with its Nordic neighbors, including Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. The country will also engage closely with its Baltic neighbors, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Finland's accession to NATO marks a significant shift in its relationships with its neighbors and the wider international community, with a strong emphasis on cooperation and collective defense.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Finland's foreign policy\n* NATO membership expansion\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* European Union foreign policy\n* Nordic foreign policy\n\n## References\n\nThere are no references in this article.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Finland's foreign policy, Ministry for Foreign Affairs\n* NATO membership expansion, NATO website\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine, Wikipedia article\n* European Union foreign policy, European Union website\n* Nordic foreign policy, Nordic Council website\n\n## External Links\n\n* Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland\n* NATO website\n* European Union website\n* Nordic Council website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland‚ÄìNATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949‚Äì2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949‚Äì1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991‚Äì1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995‚Äì2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022‚Äì2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February ‚Äì May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May ‚Äì June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 ‚Äì April 2023: Ratification\n##2023‚Äìpresent: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She began working on the album in 2020, initially aiming to create a limited-edition EP to share with her fans. However, as the project progressed, Beyonc√©'s creative vision expanded, and she decided to develop it into a full-length album. Throughout the production process, she drew inspiration from various sources, including her own personal experiences, as well as the works of icons such as Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, and Sylvester.\n\nCover artwork\n-------------\n\nThe cover artwork for Renaissance features a painting of Beyonc√© by artist and director, Kwame Brathwaite. The image depicts the singer in a red swimsuit, surrounded by lush greenery, and exudes a sense of freedom and joy. Brathwaite's artwork was chosen by Beyonc√© for its vibrant colors and energetic vibe, which perfectly encapsulates the essence of the album.\n\nComposition\n-----------\n\nRenaissance is a 16-track album, with a diverse range of styles and influences. The album's opening track, \"I'm That Girl,\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, showcasing Beyonc√©'s impressive vocal range and her ability to blend different genres seamlessly. The album's second track, \"Cozy,\" is a laid-back, atmospheric song that features a haunting vocal performance from Beyonc√©, accompanied by a minimalist instrumental arrangement. Other standout tracks include \"Alien Superstar,\" a high-energy dance track that showcases Beyonc√©'s impressive vocal acrobatics, and \"Plastic Off the Sofa,\" a sultry, 1970s-inspired funk song that showcases the singer's vocal range and control.\n\nPromotion and release\n-------------------\n\n### Singles\n\nThe lead single from Renaissance, \"Break My Soul,\" was released on May 13, 2022.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, features Beyonc√© dancing in a colorful, vibrant setting, surrounded by a troupe of dancers.\n\n### Tour\n\nIn support of the album, Beyonc√© embarked on a world tour, which kicked off in May 2023. The tour, which was her first solo tour in over five years, saw the singer perform in over 40 cities worldwide, including major stops in the US, Europe, and Australia. The tour was highly successful, with many shows selling out in minutes.\n\n### Visuals\n\nThe album's visuals, which were directed by various artists, including Jake Nava, Melina Matsoukas, and Ladiran, feature a diverse range of styles and influences. The music videos, which accompany each track, showcase Beyonc√©'s impressive dance skills and her ability to blend different styles and genres.

The line, which features a range of statement pieces, including dresses, tops, and accessories, was designed by the singer in collaboration with her long-time collaborator, Ivy Park. The line was a commercial success, with many pieces selling out in minutes.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Critical response\n\nRenaissance received widespread critical acclaim from music critics, with many praising the album's innovative production, Beyonc√©'s impressive vocal performances, and the album's thematic coherence. In a review for Rolling Stone, critic Tom Breihan praised the album's \"unapologetic, genre-bending sound,\" stating that it was \"one of the most exciting and innovative albums of the year.\" In a review for The New York Times, critic Jon Caramanica praised the album's \"vibrant, dancefloor-friendly sound,\" stating that it was \"a testament to Beyonc√©'s enduring creativity and musicality.\"\n\n### Featured, sampled and interpolated artists\n\nRenaissance features a range of featured, sampled, and interpolated artists, including Rich the Kid, Tems, and Megan Thee Stallion.
