This philosophical movement had a profound impact on Western philosophy, influencing various fields including early Christianity, Gnosticism, and Islamic thought. Neoplatonism also played a significant role in shaping the intellectual landscape of the Byzantine Empire and the Western Renaissance.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 19th century to distinguish this philosophical movement from the original teachings of Plato. The term \"Neoplatonism\" is derived from the Greek words \"neos\" (νέος), meaning \"new,\" and \"Platonism,\" referring to the philosophical school founded by Plato. This distinction acknowledges that Neoplatonism is not a direct continuation of Plato's thought but rather a distinct development that drew upon his ideas.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the 3rd century AD, a period marked by the decline of the Roman Empire and the rise of Hellenism. Hellenism, also known as the Hellenistic period, was characterized by the spread of Greek culture, philosophy, and science throughout the Mediterranean world. This cultural exchange laid the groundwork for the development of Neoplatonism, which synthesized Greek philosophy with other Hellenistic influences.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nAmmonius Saccas (c. 175-242 AD) is often considered the founder of Neoplatonism. Although little is known about his life, his teachings are believed to have been a significant influence on the development of the school. Ammonius was a philosopher and mystic who drew upon various sources, including Plato, Plotinus, and the mysteries of Egypt. His teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the attainment of gnosis, or spiritual knowledge.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nPlotinus (c. 205-270 AD) is the most famous and influential Neoplatonist philosopher. Born in Lycopolis, Egypt, Plotinus traveled to Rome, where he studied philosophy under the tutelage of Ammonius. He later founded a philosophical school in Rome, which attracted many students, including Porphyry. Plotinus' teachings focused on the nature of reality, the soul, and the ultimate goal of human existence. His philosophy emphasized the importance of spiritual practices and the attainment of gnosis.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (c. 234-305 AD) was a student of Plotinus and a prominent Neoplatonist philosopher in his own right. He is best known for his work \"Isagoge,\" a comprehensive introduction to Neoplatonist philosophy. Porphyry's teachings built upon Plotinus' ideas, emphasizing the importance of logic and reason in understanding the nature of reality. He also developed a system of categorization and classification, which had a lasting impact on Western philosophy.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (c. 245-325 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who flourished in the 3rd century AD. A student of Porphyry, Iamblichus developed a unique system of philosophy that emphasized the importance of ritual and magical practices. His teachings drew upon various sources, including Plato, Plotinus, and the mysteries of Egypt. Iamblichus' philosophy focused on the attainment of gnosis and the attainment of spiritual knowledge.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonist academies were schools of philosophy that flourished in the 3rd to 6th centuries AD. These academies were founded by prominent Neoplatonist philosophers, including Plotinus and Proclus. The academies served as centers of learning, where students could study philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects. The Neoplatonist academies played a significant role in shaping the intellectual landscape of the Byzantine Empire.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who lived in Alexandria. A prominent teacher and scholar, Hypatia was known for her advanced knowledge of mathematics and philosophy. Her teachings emphasized the importance of reason and critical thinking. Hypatia's life and teachings had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, influencing the development of medieval Christian thought.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (c. 412-485 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who flourished in the 5th century AD. A student of Syrianus, Proclus developed a unique system of philosophy that emphasized the importance of reason and logic. His teachings drew upon various sources, including Plato, Plotinus, and the mysteries of Egypt. Proclus' philosophy focused on the attainment of gnosis and the attainment of spiritual knowledge.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nThe concept of the One is central to Neoplatonist philosophy. The One refers to the ultimate reality, the source of all being and existence. The One is often described as a unity, a singularity that underlies all of existence. This concept is rooted in Plato's idea of the Form of the Good, which is the ultimate source of all being and knowledge.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonist philosophy emphasizes the idea of emanations, which refers to the process by which the One generates the universe. According to this concept, the One emanates a series of divine beings, each of which is a reflection of the One. These divine beings are often referred to as the nous, the world-soul, and the phenomenal world.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe concept of the Demiurge or nous is central to Neoplatonist philosophy. The Demiurge refers to the divine being who creates and governs the universe. The nous is often described as the divine mind or intellect, which is the source of all knowledge and wisdom.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe world-soul is a concept that refers to the divine being that animates the universe. According to Neoplatonist philosophy, the world-soul is a manifestation of the One, and is responsible for the organization and governance of the universe.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe phenomenal world refers to the physical world that we experience through our senses. According to Neoplatonist philosophy, the phenomenal world is a manifestation of the divine, and is subject to the laws and principles of the One.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nThe celestial hierarchy is a concept that refers to the hierarchical structure of the universe. According to Neoplatonist philosophy, the universe is organized into a series of levels or realms, each of which is governed by a divine being.\n\n### Evil\n\nThe concept of evil is central to Neoplatonist philosophy. According to this concept, evil is a manifestation of the absence of being, and is therefore a privation of the divine. Evil is often seen as a corruption or distortion of the good, rather than a positive entity in its own right.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nThe concept of the return to the One is central to Neoplatonist philosophy. According to this concept, the ultimate goal of human existence is to return to the One, to attain gnosis and to become one with the divine.\n\n**Influence**\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on early Christianity. Many early Christian thinkers, including Augustine and Origen, drew upon Neoplatonist ideas in their writings. Neoplatonism's emphasis on the importance of reason and critical thinking also influenced the development of Christian theology.\n\n### Augustine\n\nAugustine (c. 354-430 AD) was a Christian thinker who was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. His writings often drew upon Neoplatonist ideas, particularly in his discussion of the nature of God and the human soul.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (c. 185-254 AD) and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500 AD) were Christian thinkers who were heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Their writings often drew upon Neoplatonist ideas, particularly in their discussion of the nature of God and the human soul.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Gnosticism, a philosophical and religious movement that emphasized the importance of spiritual knowledge and the attainment of gnosis. Gnostic thinkers often drew upon Neoplatonist ideas, particularly in their discussion of the nature of the divine and the human soul.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism played a significant role in shaping the intellectual landscape of the Byzantine Empire. The Neoplatonist academies were centers of learning, where students could study philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects. The Neoplatonist emphasis on reason and critical thinking also influenced the development of Byzantine education.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Islamic thought. Many Islamic thinkers, including Ghazali and Ibn Sina, drew upon Neoplatonist ideas in their writings. The Neoplatonist emphasis on the importance of reason and critical thinking also influenced the development of Islamic philosophy.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism also influenced the development of Jewish thought. Many Jewish thinkers, including Maimonides and Halevi, drew upon Neoplatonist ideas in their writings. The Neoplatonist emphasis on the importance of reason and critical thinking also influenced the development of Jewish philosophy.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism continued to influence medieval Christian thought. Many medieval Christian thinkers, including Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus, drew upon Neoplatonist ideas in their writings.

From its origins in the 19th century to the present day, Ukrainian opera has evolved and flourished, reflecting the country's cultural, social, and political developments.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of Ukrainian opera can be traced back to the 19th century, when the concept of national revival was growing in Ukraine. During this period, Ukrainian intellectuals and artists sought to create a distinct Ukrainian identity, separate from Russian and Polish influences.\n\n### Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n\nOne of the earliest forms of Ukrainian drama was the shkilʹna dramy (school drama), which emerged in the 1830s. These plays were written by Ukrainian educators and intellectuals, who aimed to create a sense of national pride and identity among the Ukrainian people. Shkilʹna dramy was a key factor in the development of Ukrainian language and literature, as it helped to standardize the Ukrainian language and create a sense of national unity.\n\n### Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n\nVertepy, or nativity scenes, were another important form of Ukrainian drama that emerged in the 19th century. These scenes were often performed during Christmas and Easter, and told the story of the life of Jesus Christ. Vertepy was a key factor in the development of Ukrainian folk theater, as it helped to create a sense of community and shared identity among the Ukrainian people.\n\n### Vaudeville\n\nVaudeville, a form of popular entertainment that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also played an important role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville shows often featured music, dance, and comedy, and were popular among the Ukrainian people. Ukrainian vaudeville shows often featured Ukrainian music and dance, and helped to promote Ukrainian culture and identity.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a form of musical theater that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also played an important role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Operetta shows often featured music, dance, and comedy, and were popular among the Ukrainian people. Ukrainian operetta shows often featured Ukrainian music and dance, and helped to promote Ukrainian culture and identity.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the growth of Ukrainian culture and identity, there were many obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera. The Russian Empire, which ruled Ukraine from the 18th to the 20th centuries, suppressed Ukrainian language and culture, and often forced Ukrainian artists to perform in Russian. This made it difficult for Ukrainian artists to express themselves in their own language and culture.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ukrainian opera began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the key figures in the development of Ukrainian opera was Mykola Lysenko.\n\n### Mykola Lysenko\n\nMykola Lysenko was a Ukrainian composer and pianist who is often considered the father of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko was born in 1842 and studied music in Kiev and St. Petersburg. He began to compose music in the 1860s, and his early works were influenced by Russian and European music. However, as Lysenko became more interested in Ukrainian culture and identity, his music began to take on a more Ukrainian character. Lysenko's operas often featured folk melodies and themes, and were based on Ukrainian history and mythology.\n\n### Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n\nLysenko was not alone in his efforts to create Ukrainian opera. Many other composers and artists were working in Ukraine during this period, and they often collaborated with Lysenko on his operas. Some of Lysenko's contemporaries and successors include:\n\n* Panas Saksahansky, a Ukrainian composer and pianist who was a close friend and collaborator of Lysenko's\n* Mykola Lysenko's son, Levko Lysenko, who was a composer and conductor who continued his father's work\n* Sergei Lyapunov, a Russian composer who was influenced by Lysenko's music and often incorporated Ukrainian themes and melodies into his own works\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of resurgence. This was due in part to the rise of Ukrainian independence movements, which sought to create a separate Ukrainian state. Ukrainian opera was seen as a key part of this movement, and many composers and artists began to create works that reflected Ukrainian culture and identity.\n\n### 1910s\n\nIn the 1910s, Ukrainian opera began to take on a more modern character. Composers such as Lysenko and Saksahansky began to experiment with new forms and styles, and the use of Ukrainian folk music and themes became more widespread.\n\n### 1920s and early 1930s\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of rapid growth and development. The Soviet government, which had come to power in Ukraine in 1920, encouraged the development of Ukrainian culture and identity. Ukrainian opera became a key part of this movement, and many composers and artists began to create works that reflected Ukrainian history and mythology.\n\n#### Historical opera\n\nOne of the key trends in Ukrainian opera during this period was the creation of historical operas. These operas often told the story of Ukraine's past, and featured Ukrainian heroes and heroines. Some examples of historical operas from this period include:\n\n* \"Taras Bulba\" by Mykola Lysenko, which tells the story of a Ukrainian Cossack leader\n* \"Ivan Pidkova\" by Mykola Lysenko, which tells the story of a Ukrainian revolutionary leader\n* \"The Cossack Beyond the Danube\" by Mykola Lysenko, which tells the story of a Ukrainian Cossack leader who fights against the Ottoman Empire\n\n**Stalinism (1932–1956)**\n\nIn 1932, the Soviet government began to implement a policy of Stalinism in Ukraine. This policy was characterized by a suppression of Ukrainian culture and identity, and a promotion of Russian culture and values. Ukrainian opera was heavily affected by this policy, as many Ukrainian composers and artists were forced to conform to Soviet standards.\n\n#### World War II\n\nDuring World War II, Ukraine was invaded by Germany and occupied for several years. Ukrainian opera continued to exist during this period, but it was heavily influenced by the occupation. Many Ukrainian composers and artists were forced to create works that were acceptable to the German authorities, and Ukrainian opera became a way for Ukrainians to express their resistance to the occupation.\n\n#### 1945–1953\n\nAfter the war, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of repression under the Soviet government. Many Ukrainian composers and artists were forced to conform to Soviet standards, and Ukrainian opera became a way for Ukrainians to express their national identity in a way that was acceptable to the Soviet authorities.\n\n**1953–1991**\n\nIn 1953, Nikita Khrushchev came to power in the Soviet Union and began to implement a policy of de-Stalinization. This policy allowed for the expression of Ukrainian culture and identity, and Ukrainian opera began to flourish once again.\n\n#### 1953–1970\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of rapid growth and development. Many new operas were written, and the use of Ukrainian folk music and themes became more widespread.\n\n#### 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Ukrainian opera began to take on a more modern character. Composers such as Mykola Lysenko and Panas Saksahansky continued to experiment with new forms and styles, and the use of electronic music and multimedia became more widespread.\n\n#### 1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, Ukrainian opera experienced a period of rapid growth and development. The Soviet government, which had come to power in Ukraine in 1920, began to relax its control over Ukrainian culture and identity. Ukrainian opera became a key part of this movement, and many composers and artists began to create works that reflected Ukrainian history and mythology.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nIn 1991, Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union, and Ukrainian opera was able to flourish once again. Many new operas were written, and the use of Ukrainian folk music and themes became more widespread.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has a number of opera houses, including:\n\n* The Kyiv Opera House, which is one of the oldest and most prestigious opera houses in Ukraine\n* The Lviv Opera House, which is known for its beautiful architecture and historic significance\n* The Odessa Opera House, which is one of the oldest and most respected opera houses in Ukraine\n\n**References**\n\n* Notes\n* Citations\n* Sources\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Mykola Lysenko: A Life in Music by Ivan Lysenko\n* Ukrainian Opera: A History by Panas Saksahansky\n* The Art of Ukrainian Opera by Mykola Lysenko\n\n**External links**\n\n* Ukrainian Opera House\n* Kyiv Opera House\n* Lviv Opera House\n* Odessa Opera House", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The platform has faced numerous challenges in balancing free speech with content moderation, particularly in the wake of the 2020 United States presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Topics**\n\n### **No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story**\n\nIn October 2020, the New York Post published a story about Hunter Biden, the son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, that included unverified allegations about his business dealings. Twitter faced criticism for initially limiting the story's visibility on the platform, citing concerns about the article's credibility. The decision sparked a debate about the role of social media companies in content moderation and the limits of their editorial discretion.\n\nTwitter eventually reversed its decision and allowed the story to be shared on the platform, but not before it had already been widely shared and reported on by other news outlets. The episode highlighted the challenges faced by social media companies in balancing their responsibilities as intermediaries and their obligations to protect their users from misinformation.\n\n### **No. 2: Visibility filtering**\n\nTwitter has a feature called \"visibility filtering\" that allows users to choose which types of content they want to see on their timelines. The feature uses algorithms to determine which tweets are relevant and interesting to each user, and which ones to hide or downrank. Critics have argued that this feature can be used to suppress certain types of content or viewpoints, particularly those that are unpopular or offensive.\n\nIn 2020, Twitter introduced a new feature called \"display filtering\" that allowed users to choose which types of content they wanted to see on their timelines, including tweets from specific accounts or hashtags. The feature was designed to help users tailor their experience on the platform, but it also raised concerns about the potential for censorship and the limits of user choice.\n\n### **Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump**\n\nIn January 2021, a mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Twitter suspended Trump's account for 12 hours after the incident, citing concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for violence.\n\nThe decision sparked a debate about the limits of free speech on social media and the responsibilities of social media companies in policing their platforms. Some argued that Twitter had overstepped its bounds by suspending Trump's account, while others argued that it had failed to take adequate action to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### **Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team**\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that the FBI had been in contact with Twitter's Trust and Safety team in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. The communications were reportedly focused on concerns about election interference and the spread of misinformation.\n\nThe revelation sparked a debate about the role of law enforcement in social media content moderation and the potential for government overreach. Some argued that the FBI's communications with Twitter were necessary to prevent election interference, while others argued that they represented a threat to free speech and the independence of social media companies.\n\n### **Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government**\n\nTwitter has a complex relationship with the U.S. government, which has been shaped by a series of high-profile controversies and disputes. In 2018, Twitter was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe subpoena sparked a debate about the limits of government authority over social media companies and the potential for overreach. Some argued that Twitter had a responsibility to cooperate with government requests, while others argued that it had a duty to protect its users' free speech rights.\n\n### **No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content**\n\nIn 2020, Twitter faced criticism for its handling of COVID-19 content on the platform. Some argued that the company had been too lax in its moderation of misinformation about the virus, while others argued that it had been too aggressive in its enforcement of its policies.\n\nThe controversy highlighted the challenges faced by social media companies in balancing their responsibilities as intermediaries and their obligations to protect their users from misinformation. Twitter eventually introduced a series of measures aimed at improving its moderation of COVID-19 content, including the use of fact-checking labels and the removal of accounts that spread misinformation.\n\n### **No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard**\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that Twitter had been working with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group founded by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, to develop a dashboard called the Hamilton 68. The dashboard was designed to track and analyze the spread of Russian propaganda on Twitter, but it was widely criticized for its methodology and its potential for bias.\n\nThe controversy highlighted the challenges faced by social media companies in policing their platforms and the potential for government influence over their content moderation policies.\n\n### **No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans**\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that Twitter had been censoring tweets from Donald Trump and other Republicans, citing concerns about the spread of hate speech and harassment. The decision sparked a debate about the limits of free speech on social media and the responsibilities of social media companies in policing their platforms.\n\nSome argued that Twitter had overstepped its bounds by censoring Trump's tweets, while others argued that it had failed to take adequate action to prevent the spread of hate speech and harassment.\n\n### **No. 17: Global Engagement Center**\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the U.S. Department of State had established a Global Engagement Center aimed at countering Russian propaganda and disinformation. The center was reportedly working with social media companies, including Twitter, to develop strategies for countering Russian propaganda.\n\nThe revelation sparked a debate about the role of government in social media content moderation and the potential for overreach. Some argued that the Global Engagement Center was necessary to counter Russian propaganda, while others argued that it represented a threat to free speech and the independence of social media companies.\n\n### **No. 19: The Virality Project**\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that the Stanford History Education Group had launched a project called the Virality Project, aimed at tracking and analyzing the spread of misinformation on social media. The project used machine learning algorithms to identify and flag suspicious content, but it was widely criticized for its methodology and its potential for bias.\n\nThe controversy highlighted the challenges faced by social media companies in policing their platforms and the potential for government influence over their content moderation policies.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Politicians**\n\nThe Twitter Files has sparked a debate among politicians about the role of social media companies in content moderation and the limits of their editorial discretion. Some have argued that Twitter has a responsibility to protect its users from misinformation, while others have argued that it has a duty to prioritize free speech.\n\n### **FBI**\n\nThe Twitter Files has also sparked a debate about the role of the FBI in social media content moderation and the potential for government overreach. Some have argued that the FBI's communications with Twitter were necessary to prevent election interference, while others have argued that they represented a threat to free speech and the independence of social media companies.\n\n### **Legal scholars**\n\nThe Twitter Files has sparked a debate among legal scholars about the limits of free speech on social media and the responsibilities of social media companies in policing their platforms. Some have argued that Twitter has a duty to protect its users from hate speech and harassment, while others have argued that it has a duty to prioritize free speech.\n\n### **Privacy and security**\n\nThe Twitter Files has also sparked a debate about the potential risks of social media companies sharing user data with government agencies and other third parties. Some have argued that Twitter's decision to share user data with the FBI and other government agencies represents a threat to user privacy and security.\n\n### **Former Twitter CEO**\n\nThe Twitter Files has sparked a debate among former Twitter executives about the company's content moderation policies and the limits of its editorial discretion. Some have argued that Twitter has a responsibility to protect its users from misinformation, while others have argued that it has a duty to prioritize free speech.\n\n### **Journalists**\n\nThe Twitter Files has also sparked a debate among journalists about the role of social media companies in content moderation and the potential for bias. Some have argued that Twitter's algorithms are biased against certain viewpoints, while others have argued that they are necessary to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### **Wikipedia article**\n\nThe Twitter Files has also sparked a debate about the accuracy and reliability of Wikipedia articles about social media companies and their content moderation policies. Some have argued that Wikipedia articles are biased against certain viewpoints, while others have argued that they are necessary to provide accurate information about social media companies.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Twitter Files has sparked a debate about the role of social media companies in content moderation and the limits of their editorial discretion. The controversy has highlighted the challenges faced by social media companies in balancing their responsibilities as intermediaries and their obligations to protect their users from misinformation.\n\nThe Twitter Files has also sparked a debate about the potential risks of social media companies sharing user data with government agencies and other third parties. The controversy has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in social media content moderation and the need for users to be aware of the potential risks of sharing their data.\n\n**References**\n\n* Twitter Files\n* The New York Times: Twitter Files\n* The Washington Post: Twitter Files\n* CNN: Twitter Files\n* The Verge: Twitter Files\n* Wired: Twitter Files\n* The Guardian: Twitter Files\n* The Wall Street Journal: Twitter Files\n* The New Yorker: Twitter Files\n\n**External links**\n\n* Twitter Files\n* The New York Times: Twitter Files\n* The Washington Post: Twitter Files\n* CNN: Twitter Files\n* The Verge: Twitter Files\n* Wired: Twitter Files\n* The Guardian: Twitter Files\n* The Wall Street Journal: Twitter Files\n* The New Yorker: Twitter Files", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season was hosted by Jonathan LaPaglia and was filmed in Mamanuca Islands, Fiji. The season featured 24 contestants, divided into two tribes, Heroes and Villains, with the goal of being the last person standing and winning the title of Sole Survivor and a prize of $500,000.\n\n# Contestants\n\nThe season featured a diverse cast of 24 contestants, including 12 Heroes and 12 Villains. The Heroes tribe consisted of individuals who had shown exceptional qualities such as courage, selflessness, and leadership, while the Villains tribe was comprised of people with more questionable characters, such as manipulators and bullies. Some of the notable contestants included Mat Rogers, a former Australian rugby player and Heroes tribe member, and Sharn Coombes, a businesswoman and Villains tribe member, who both went on to become strong players in the game.\n\n## Future appearances\n\nSome contestants from this season have gone on to appear in future seasons of Australian Survivor. In the following season, Australian Survivor: Champions vs Legends, Mat Rogers returned as a member of the Legends tribe, while Sharn Coombes also returned as a member of the Legends tribe. In the season Australian Survivor: All Stars, both Mat and Sharn returned as members of the All Stars tribe.\n\n# Season summary\n\nThe season began with 24 contestants divided into two tribes, Heroes and Villains. The tribes competed in challenges to win rewards and immunity, with the losing tribe facing the risk of elimination. As the season progressed, alliances were formed and broken, and players began to make moves to advance in the game. The season's mid-season twist, the \"merge,\" saw the two tribes come together and form a single tribe, allowing players to target each other for elimination.\n\nThroughout the season, players faced challenges that tested their physical and mental abilities, including obstacles such as crawling through mud and eating disgusting foods. The season's challenges were designed to push players to their limits, and some contestants struggled to keep up with the demands of the game.\n\nAs the season progressed, alliances began to crumble, and players began to turn on each other. In the end, it was a battle between two strong players, Mat Rogers and Sharn Coombes, for the title of Sole Survivor.\n\n# Episodes\n\nThe season consisted of 24 episodes, each approximately 60 minutes long.

The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of infrastructure. This article provides a detailed timeline of the key events that have shaped the conflict.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine was plunged into crisis after the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who had close ties to Russia. The new government in Kiev sought to align itself with the European Union and NATO, which led to a deterioration of relations with Russia. Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist movements in the Donbas region. The conflict in eastern Ukraine resulted in the deaths of over 13,000 people and displaced millions.\n\nIn the years leading up to the invasion, tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated. Russia amassed troops along the border with Ukraine, and the two countries engaged in a series of diplomatic disputes. In January 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, which were established by separatist groups in the Donbas region.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Putin announced that he would be sending Russian troops to Ukraine to \"protect\" its residents, stating that Russia would defend the \"people of Ukraine\" against \"genocide\" and \"nazism.\" The next day, Russian forces launched a large-scale military operation against Ukraine.\n\n**Initial invasion**\n\nThe initial invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, with a series of airstrikes and missile attacks on Ukrainian military targets. Russian forces also launched a ground assault on several fronts, including the Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions.\n\nThe Ukrainian military reported that Russian forces had attacked several major cities, including Kiev, Kharkiv, and Mariupol. The Russian military claimed to have taken control of several key cities, including the strategic port city of Kherson.\n\nAs the invasion progressed, the Ukrainian military reported that Russian forces had suffered significant losses, including the destruction of several tanks and aircraft. The Ukrainian military also claimed to have shot down several Russian missiles and drones.\n\n**Southeastern front**\n\nThe southeastern front of the conflict saw intense fighting in the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatist groups had been fighting against the Ukrainian military since 2014.\n\nIn the early stages of the invasion, Russian forces made significant gains in the Donbas region, capturing several key cities and towns. However, the Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to hold their ground in several areas, including the city of Sloviansk and the town of Avdiivka.\n\nAs the conflict progressed, the Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to push Russian forces back in several areas, including the city of Bakhmut and the town of Volnovakha. However, Russian forces continued to control several key cities, including Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n**2022 Ukrainian counteroffensives**\n\nIn June 2022, the Ukrainian military launched a series of counteroffensives against Russian forces in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. The Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to push Russian forces back in several areas, including the city of Izium and the town of Balakliia.\n\nThe counteroffensives were part of a larger effort by the Ukrainian military to regain control of the Kharkiv region, which had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the invasion. The Ukrainian military also reported that they had been able to destroy several Russian tank columns and artillery units.\n\nAs the counteroffensives progressed, the Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to capture several key cities and towns, including the city of Izyum and the town of Kupyansk. However, Russian forces continued to control several key cities, including Kherson and Melitopol.\n\n**Second stalemate**\n\nIn July 2022, the conflict entered a second stalemate, with both sides dug in and neither able to gain a significant advantage. The Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to hold their ground in several areas, including the city of Sloviansk and the town of Avdiivka.\n\nHowever, Russian forces continued to control several key cities, including Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian military also reported that they had been unable to retake the city of Kherson, which had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the invasion.\n\nAs the stalemate continued, both sides reported significant losses, including the destruction of several tanks, aircraft, and artillery units. The conflict also resulted in significant loss of life, with both sides reporting hundreds of casualties.\n\n**2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive**\n\nIn January 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a new counteroffensive against Russian forces in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to push Russian forces back in several areas, including the city of Chuhuiv and the town of Velyka Komyshuvakha.\n\nThe counteroffensive was part of a larger effort by the Ukrainian military to regain control of the Kharkiv region, which had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the invasion. The Ukrainian military also reported that they had been able to destroy several Russian tank columns and artillery units.\n\nAs the counteroffensive progressed, the Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to capture several key cities and towns, including the city of Vovchansk and the town of Kupiansk. However, Russian forces continued to control several key cities, including Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n**Second winter campaign**\n\nIn February 2023, the conflict entered a second winter campaign, with both sides dug in and neither able to gain a significant advantage. The Ukrainian military reported that they had been able to hold their ground in several areas, including the city of Sloviansk and the town of Avdiivka.\n\nHowever, Russian forces continued to control several key cities, including Donetsk and Luhansk. The Ukrainian military also reported that they had been unable to retake the city of Kherson, which had been occupied by Russian forces since the early stages of the invasion.\n\nAs the winter campaign continued, both sides reported significant losses, including the destruction of several tanks, aircraft, and artillery units.

Born in Guadeloupe, Saint-Georges became a musically gifted child and began his career as a soldier and violinist before rising to prominence in Parisian society.\n\n**Early life**\n\nThe Chevalier de Saint-Georges was born Joseph Boulogne in Guadeloupe, a French colony in the Caribbean, in 1767. His father, Georges de Bologne Saint-Georges, was a cavalry officer and a noble, while his mother, Josephine Boulogne, was a mulatto woman from a prominent family. Saint-Georges' early life was marked by his musical talent, and he began taking violin lessons at the age of three. By the time he was eight, he was already playing in the orchestra of the Guadeloupe Military Garrison.\n\nAt the age of 14, Saint-Georges moved to Paris to continue his musical studies. He quickly gained recognition as a talented violinist and began performing in various concerts and salons. In 1785, he was appointed as a cavalry officer in the French army, a position that would remain with him for the rest of his life.\n\n**Musical life and career**\n\nSaint-Georges' musical career was marked by his incredible talent and versatility. He was an accomplished violinist, cellist, and composer, and was known for his ability to write music in various styles, from classical to opera. He was particularly renowned for his symphonies, which were praised for their originality and beauty.\n\nIn addition to his composing and performing, Saint-Georges was also a respected music teacher. He taught music to several prominent students, including the future composer and conductor, Antonio Salieri. Saint-Georges was also a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, a prestigious artistic institution that recognized his talent and contributions to the arts.\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges wrote several operas during his lifetime, including \"Ernestine\", \"Léonore\", and \"La Fête du Village\". His operas were known for their beautiful music and engaging plots, and were performed to great acclaim in Parisian theaters.\n\nSaint-Georges' operas were not only successful in Paris but also gained recognition in other parts of Europe. In 1789, his opera \"Ernestine\" was performed in Vienna, where it was praised by the Emperor Joseph II himself.\n\n**Social life in Paris**\n\nSaint-Georges was a prominent figure in Parisian society, known for his charm, wit, and musical talent. He was a member of the aristocracy and was often invited to high-society gatherings and salons.\n\nSaint-Georges' relationships with women were particularly notable. He was known to have had several romantic affairs, including with the famous actress, Mlle. de Saint-Aubin.

He died in Paris, where he had been living for several years.

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was marked by several significant events, including the Newcastle takeover, COVID-19 outbreaks, and the Abramovich sanctions. The season also saw a tight competition for the title, with several teams fighting for the top spot. In the end, Manchester City emerged as the champions, while Norwich City, Watford, and Burnley were relegated to the EFL Championship.\n\n**The race for first place**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was highly competitive, with several teams vying for the top spot. Manchester City, led by Pep Guardiola, started the season strongly, winning their first five matches. However, Liverpool and Chelsea also made strong starts, with the two teams trading the top spot in the early stages of the season.\n\nAs the season progressed, Manchester City maintained their consistency, while Liverpool and Chelsea experienced some setbacks. The Reds suffered a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in October, while Chelsea lost to a last-minute goal to West Ham United in December.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Liverpool and Chelsea remained in contention for the title, with the two teams fighting for second place. However, Manchester City ultimately emerged as the champions, winning the title by a margin of 15 points.\n\n**Newcastle takeover**\n\nIn October 2021, the Premier League approved a £305 million takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium led by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF). The takeover was completed in October, and Eddie Howe was appointed as the new manager of the club.\n\nThe takeover was seen as a significant development for Newcastle United, who had been struggling financially in recent years. The club's new owners invested heavily in the transfer market, signing several high-profile players, including Bruno Guimarães and Kieran Trippier.\n\nThe takeover also had significant implications for the Premier League, with the league's owners' and directors' test being amended to allow for state-backed investment in clubs.\n\n**COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with several matches being postponed due to outbreaks among players and staff. In December 2021, a number of matches were postponed, including Liverpool's match against Leeds United, due to a COVID-19 outbreak at the Reds' training ground.\n\nThe outbreak was caused by a combination of factors, including the Omicron variant of the virus and the club's decision to host a Christmas party. The outbreak led to several players and staff members testing positive for the virus, forcing the club to postpone their match against Leeds United.\n\nThe postponements had significant implications for the Premier League, with several teams fighting for points in the top four. In the end, the postponements did not have a significant impact on the final standings, with Manchester City emerging as the champions.\n\n**Abramovich sanctions**\n\nIn March 2022, Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea, was sanctioned by the UK government in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions led to a significant uncertainty surrounding the future of the club, with Abramovich's assets being frozen.\n\nThe sanctions had significant implications for the Premier League, with Chelsea's future being uncertain. However, the club was able to continue playing matches, with the Premier League allowing them to do so until the end of the season.\n\nIn the end, Chelsea was sold to a consortium led by Todd Boehly, with the club's new owners taking over in May 2022.\n\n**Final day climax**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season ended on a dramatic note, with several teams fighting for the top four. Manchester City secured the title with a 3-2 win over Aston Villa, while Liverpool and Chelsea fought for second place.\n\nIn the end, Liverpool secured second place with a 3-1 win over Wolves, while Chelsea finished third with a 3-0 win over Watford. The final standings were:\n\n* Manchester City: 93 points\n* Liverpool: 78 points\n* Chelsea: 74 points\n* Tottenham Hotspur: 71 points\n\n**Title**\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title, ending Liverpool's 30-year wait for a championship. The title was a significant achievement for Pep Guardiola, who won his third Premier League title as a manager.\n\n**Relegation**\n\nNorwich City, Watford, and Burnley were relegated to the EFL Championship, with each team finishing in the bottom three. The relegations marked the end of a difficult season for each team, with all three clubs struggling to avoid the drop.\n\n**Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots**\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualified for the Champions League, with Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur securing the spots. The Europa League and Conference League spots were also awarded to the teams who finished in fifth to seventh place, with Arsenal, Manchester United, and West Ham United qualifying for the Europa League, while Leicester City qualified for the Conference League.\n\n**Other teams**\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was also marked by significant developments at other teams, including:\n\n* Arsenal: Mikel Arteta's side finished fifth, securing a Europa League spot.

It is the thirteenth installment in the Halloween franchise and the direct sequel to the 2018 film Halloween. The film follows the character of Michael Myers, a masked serial killer who stalks and murders his victims on Halloween night, as he faces off against Laurie Strode, a woman who has been targeted by Myers since she was a child.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place a year after the events of Halloween Kills. Laurie Strode, now living in a nursing home, is struggling to come to terms with the trauma she has experienced throughout her life. Meanwhile, Michael Myers is still at large, and a series of strange and unexplained events begins to occur in Haddonfield, Illinois. As the events of Halloween unfold, Laurie must confront her past and face off against Michael once again in a final showdown.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode\n* Andi Matichak as Allyson Nelson\n* Kyle Richards as Mrs. Nelson\n* Frank Hawkins as Frank Hawkins\n* Robert Longstreet as Lonnie Elam\n* Michael Small as Cameron Elam\n* Christian Alvis as Cameron Elam Jr.\n* Anthony Michael Hall as Tommy Doyle\n* Nancy Stephens as Barbara Wilson\n* James Jude Courtney as Michael Myers\n* Jim Cummings as voice of Michael Myers\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Halloween Ends began in 2020, shortly after the release of Halloween Kills.

The script was written in a way that would allow the film to be a standalone story, while also setting up the possibility for future sequels.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting for Halloween Ends was a long and involved process. Jamie Lee Curtis, who had played the role of Laurie Strode in the previous two films, was the first to be cast.

The casting of the other actors was more of a process of elimination, with the producers working to find the right actors for each role.\n\n### Filming\n\nThe filming of Halloween Ends took place over a period of several months. The film was shot on location in Illinois and California, with the production team working to create a sense of realism and authenticity. The film's score was composed by John Carpenter, who had scored the previous two films.\n\n### Post-production\n\nThe post-production process for Halloween Ends was a long and involved one. The film's editor, Gregory Plotkin, worked closely with David Gordon Green to shape the final product. The film's visual effects were handled by a team of artists who worked to create a sense of realism and authenticity.\n\n### Music\n\nThe score for Halloween Ends was composed by John Carpenter, who had scored the previous two films.

Born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, Rushdie has written extensively on themes of identity, history, politics, and culture, often blurring the lines between fiction and non-fiction.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRushdie was born to Anis and Negin Rushdie, a Muslim family of modest means. His father was a businessman and his mother a teacher. Rushdie's early life was marked by a diverse cultural and linguistic background, with exposure to Urdu, Gujarati, and English. He attended the Cathedral and John Connon School in Bombay and later studied history at King's College, Cambridge.\n\n**Career**\n\nRushdie's career spans multiple genres and disciplines.\n\n### Copywriter\n\nRushdie began his career as a copywriter for the advertising agency Ayer Barker in New York City. He worked on campaigns for clients such as American Express and Sesame Street.\n\n### Literary Works\n\nRushdie's literary output is characterized by a unique blend of magical realism, satire, and experimental fiction.\n\n#### Early Works and Literary Breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's first novel, **Grimus**, was published in 1975 but received little attention. His breakthrough novel, **Midnight's Children**, was published in 1981 and won the Booker Prize in 1981. The novel tells the story of India's transition to independence through the experiences of a young boy, Saleem Sinai.\n\nRushdie's subsequent novels, **Shame** (1983) and **The Satanic Verses** (1988), explored themes of identity, history, and politics in the context of colonialism, imperialism, and Islamic fundamentalism.\n\n#### The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\n**The Satanic Verses**, Rushdie's most infamous novel, was published in 1988 and sparked controversy over its perceived blasphemy against Islam. The novel tells the story of two Indian men who embark on a spiritual journey. **Haroun and the Sea of Stories**, published in 1990, is a children's novel that explores the power of storytelling.\n\n#### Further Works, 1990s–2000s\n\nRushdie's subsequent novels, **The Moor's Last Sigh** (1995), **The Ground Beneath Her Feet** (1999), and **Fury** (2001), continued to explore themes of identity, history, and politics. **The Enchantress of Florence** (2008) is a historical novel set in 16th-century India and Italy.\n\n#### Later Works, Novels, and Essays, 2015–2024\n\nRushdie's later works include **Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights** (2015), a novel that explores the intersection of history and mythology, and **The Golden House** (2017), a novel that examines the American Dream through the story of a wealthy Indian immigrant family. **Joseph Anton: A Memoir** (2012) is a memoir that explores Rushdie's life and career, including the controversy surrounding **The Satanic Verses**.\n\n### Critical Reception\n\nRushdie's work has been widely praised for its innovative storytelling, complex characters, and nuanced exploration of cultural and historical themes. Critics have noted his ability to blend genres and styles, creating a unique and distinctive literary voice.\n\n### Academic and Other Activities\n\nRushdie has taught at various institutions, including Columbia University, Harvard University, and the University of California, Berkeley. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford.\n\n### Film and Television\n\nRushdie has written screenplays for various films and television shows, including the 1993 film **The Satanic Verses**, which was never produced, and the 2007 film **The Reluctant Fundamentalist**, which is based on his 2008 novel of the same name.\n\n**The Satanic Verses and the Fatwā**\n\nThe publication of **The Satanic Verses** in 1988 sparked controversy and outrage in the Muslim world. Many Muslims felt that the novel was blasphemous and insulted the Prophet Muhammad. In response, Ayatollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued a fatwā calling for Rushdie's death.\n\n### Failed Assassination Attempt (1989)\n\nOn February 14, 1989, a 25-year-old Iranian immigrant, Hadi Khosroshahi, attempted to assassinate Rushdie at a literary festival in London. Khosroshahi was later arrested and charged with attempted murder.\n\n### Hezbollah's Comments (2006)\n\nIn 2006, Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia Islamist group, called for Rushdie's execution, stating that he was a \"famous apostate\" and a \"threat to Islam.\"\n\n### International Guerrillas (1990)\n\nIn 1990, a group of militant Muslims, calling themselves the International Guerrillas, issued a statement threatening to kill Rushdie and other writers who they felt had insulted Islam.\n\n### Al-Qaeda Hit List (2010)\n\nIn 2010, Al-Qaeda included Rushdie on its hit list, stating", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Salman_Rushdie\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Copywriter\n##Literary works\n###Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987\n###The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n###Further works, 1990s–2000s\n###Later works, novels, and essays, 2015–2024\n##Critical reception\n##Academic and other activities\n##Film and television\n#The Satanic Verses and the fatwā\n##Failed assassination attempt (1989)\n###Hezbollah's comments (2006)\n##International Guerillas (1990)\n##Al-Qaeda hit list (2010)\n##Jaipur Literature Festival (2012)\n##Chautauqua attack (2022)\n#Awards, honours, and recognition\n##Knighthood\n#Religious and political beliefs\n##Religious background\n##Political background\n###UK politics\n###US politics\n###Against religious extremism\n###South Asian politics and Kashmir\n#Personal life\n#Bibliography\n##Novels\n##Collections\n##Children's books\n##Essays and nonfiction\n##Memoirs\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Relevant literature\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

2022 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 27 members of the House of Representatives from the state of New York. The elections were held concurrently with the 2022 United States Senate elections and the 2022 United States gubernatorial elections.\n\n**2020-22 redistricting controversy**\n\nThe 2020 United States census led to a reapportionment of the state's congressional districts, resulting in the loss of one seat in the House of Representatives. The New York State Legislature passed a new congressional map in February 2022, which was challenged in court by various plaintiffs.

The earthquake was a significant seismic event that affected several provinces in the northern part of the island of Luzon, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the province of Abra, approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of the city of Bangued. The earthquake occurred at 7:37 PM local time, causing widespread panic and destruction.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nIn the days following the main earthquake, a series of aftershocks were reported in the affected areas. The aftershocks had magnitudes ranging from 2.0 to 5.5 on the Richter scale and occurred at varying depths. While the aftershocks caused some additional damage and disruption, they were generally smaller in magnitude and intensity compared to the main earthquake.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake varied across different regions, with the greatest impact felt in the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Baguio. In these areas, the earthquake caused widespread damage to buildings, infrastructure, and homes, resulting in significant losses and displacement of people. In other areas, such as Metro Manila, the impact was less severe, but still notable.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nA tsunami warning was issued by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) following the earthquake, but it was later canceled as the tsunami waves did not materialize. However, the earthquake's impact on the coastlines of Luzon was still significant, with reports of flooding and coastal erosion in some areas.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nLiquefaction, a phenomenon where water-saturated soil loses strength and becomes unstable during an earthquake, was a major concern in the affected areas. In some regions, liquefaction caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, leading to collapses and other structural failures.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the earthquake was swift and widespread, with various government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities mobilizing to provide aid and support to those affected. The Philippine government declared a state of calamity in the affected provinces and deployed emergency responders, including search and rescue teams, to the affected areas.\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community also responded to the disaster, with various countries and organizations providing aid and support to the Philippines. The United States, China, Japan, and the European Union were among the countries that provided financial assistance, humanitarian aid, and technical support to the affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe impact of the earthquake was felt across various regions, with different provinces experiencing varying degrees of damage and disruption.\n\n## Abra\n\nAbra, the province where the earthquake's epicenter was located, was severely affected by the disaster. The province experienced widespread damage to buildings, infrastructure, and homes, resulting in significant losses and displacement of people. The provincial capital, Bangued, was particularly hard hit, with many buildings and structures collapsing or being severely damaged.\n\n## Baguio\n\nBaguio, a popular tourist destination and the summer capital of the Philippines, was also affected by the earthquake. While the damage was less severe compared to Abra, the city's infrastructure and tourist attractions were still impacted, resulting in significant losses for the local economy.\n\n## Ilocos Sur\n\nIlocos Sur, another province in the region, experienced significant damage to its infrastructure and buildings, particularly in the city of Vigan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The earthquake also caused significant disruption to the province's transportation network, making it difficult for people to access essential services and supplies.\n\n## Metro Manila\n\nMetro Manila, the country's capital region, experienced a relatively lower impact from the earthquake compared to other regions. While some buildings and structures were damaged, the damage was mostly superficial, and the region's infrastructure and transportation network were generally unaffected.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe earthquake's impact was also felt in other regions, including the provinces of Pangasinan, La Union, and Cagayan Valley. While the damage was less severe compared to the provinces of Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Baguio, the earthquake still caused significant disruption to the region's infrastructure, transportation network, and local economy.\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the earthquake's impact, including damage to buildings, infrastructure, and homes, as well as photos of rescue efforts and aid distribution]\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in the Philippines\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)\n* Disaster risk reduction and management in the Philippines\n\n# External links\n\n* Philippine government's official website for earthquake-related information\n* PAGASA's official website for earthquake-related information\n* International aid organizations providing support to the Philippines following the earthquake", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Luzon_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Characteristics\n##Aftershocks\n##Intensity\n##Tsunami\n##Liquefaction\n#Response\n##International aid\n#Impact\n##Abra\n##Baguio\n##Ilocos Sur\n##Metro Manila\n##Elsewhere\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The region has been inhabited by ethnic Armenians since ancient times, but it was annexed by Azerbaijan in 1923. In 1988, the Armenian National Movement called for the region's reunification with Armenia, leading to a violent conflict between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces. The conflict resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. A ceasefire was brokered by Russia in 1994, but the region remains under a fragile peace agreement.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the offensive, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan had been escalating. Azerbaijan had been conducting military exercises on the border with Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia had accused Azerbaijan of violating the ceasefire agreement. In August 2023, the Armenian Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, announced that Armenia would not renew the ceasefire agreement, which was set to expire in December 2023. Azerbaijan responded by accusing Armenia of planning to attack the region.\n\n**Offensive**\n\n#### 19 September\n\nAt 10:00 AM on September 19, 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a surprise attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, catching Armenian forces off guard. The attack was focused on the regions of Martuni and Hadrut, which are home to many ethnic Armenians. Azerbaijani forces used artillery, tanks, and drones to attack Armenian positions, causing significant damage and casualties. Armenian forces responded with artillery and small arms fire, but were largely outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n#### 20 September\n\nOn September 20, 2023, the Armenian military launched a counterattack against Azerbaijani forces in the Martuni region. The attack was led by Armenian special forces, who were able to break through Azerbaijani lines and retake some of the territory that had been lost on September 19. However, Azerbaijani forces continued to push forward, using their superior numbers and firepower to gain ground.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n#### Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs the conflict escalated, thousands of Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh, seeking safety in Armenia or other countries. Many of these refugees were ethnic Armenians who had lived in the region for generations. The flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh was a major humanitarian crisis, with many people left stranded or displaced.\n\n#### Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nOn September 22, 2023, Azerbaijani forces arrested several officials from the Nagorno-Karabakh government, including the region's president, Arayik Harutyunyan. The arrests were seen as a major escalation of the conflict, and were widely condemned by the international community.\n\n#### Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nIn the aftermath of the conflict, negotiations were held between Armenia and Azerbaijan to establish a ceasefire and begin a process of disarmament. However, the negotiations stalled, and on October 1, 2023, Azerbaijan announced that it would dissolve the Nagorno-Karabakh government and establish a new administration in the region. The decision was widely seen as a major blow to Armenian interests in the region.\n\n#### Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, both sides have continued to report ceasefire violations. Armenian forces have accused Azerbaijani forces of launching artillery attacks, while Azerbaijani forces have accused Armenian forces of launching small arms attacks.\n\n#### Humanitarian aid\n\nThe conflict has led to a major humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people displaced or affected by the fighting. The international community has responded with humanitarian aid, including food, shelter, and medical supplies.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nThe conflict has sparked a major diplomatic effort, with several countries and international organizations calling for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The United States, Russia, and France have all been involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.\n\n### Normalisation efforts\n\nIn recent months, there have been efforts to normalise relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In September 2023, the two countries signed a joint statement calling for a ceasefire and the beginning of a process of disarmament. However, the statement was widely seen as a tactical move, and the conflict continues to simmer.\n\n**Risk", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Azerbaijani_offensive_in_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Offensive\n##19 September\n##20 September\n#Aftermath\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n##Ceasefire violations\n##Humanitarian aid\n##Diplomatic efforts\n###Normalisation efforts\n#Risk of genocide\n##Reports of violence against Armenians\n##Azerbaijani concentration camp plans\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n###Armenia\n####Armenian diaspora\n###Russia\n###Turkey\n###European Union\n###United Nations\n###Council of Europe\n###Other countries\n###Other international organizations\n##Foreign involvement\n###Israel\n###Turkey\n###Armenia\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
