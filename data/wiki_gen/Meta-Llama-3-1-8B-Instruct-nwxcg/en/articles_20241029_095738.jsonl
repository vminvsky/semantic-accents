The probe was sparked by a series of media reports and whistleblower complaints that suggested several European Parliamentarians had received large sums of money from Qatari officials in exchange for favorable votes and influence on key legislation.\n\nAs the investigation gained momentum, several European Parliamentarians were accused of having close ties to Qatar, with some having accepted lavish gifts, trips, and other benefits from Qatari officials. The allegations also implicated several high-ranking officials in the European Parliament, including the Speaker of the Parliament, Roberta Metsola.\n\n**Investigation, Raids, and Arrests**\n\nOn December 9, 2022, the European Parliament's Internal Security Agency (ISA) launched a series of raids on the homes and offices of several European Parliamentarians and officials, seizing documents and electronic devices. The raids were carried out in several European countries, including Italy, Belgium, and Greece.\n\nThe ISA also arrested several individuals, including a former European Parliament official and a Qatari national, in connection with the investigation.

Several European Parliamentarians have been charged with bribery, corruption, and other offenses, with many facing the possibility of imprisonment and fines.\n\nThe trial is expected to be one of the most high-profile and complex in European Parliament history, with many observers predicting that several high-profile politicians will be convicted and sentenced.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe Qatar corruption scandal has sparked a wide range of reactions from politicians, civil society groups, and the government of Qatar.\n\n### Political\n\nThe scandal has been widely condemned by European politicians, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in the European Parliament. Several European leaders have also called for the resignation of European Parliament officials implicated in the scandal.\n\n### Civil Society\n\nCivil society groups have also reacted strongly to the scandal, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in the European Parliament. Several groups have also accused the European Parliament of failing to address the scandal adequately.\n\n### Government of Qatar\n\nThe government of Qatar has denied any involvement in the scandal, with several officials calling the allegations \"baseless\" and \"politically motivated.\" The Qatari government has also accused several European Parliamentarians of attempting to undermine the country's reputation and influence.\n\n### Defendants\n\nSeveral European Parliamentarians have been accused of being involved in the Qatar corruption scandal, including:\n\n#### Eva Kaili\n\nEva Kaili, a Greek politician and former Deputy Speaker of the European Parliament, has been accused of receiving large sums of money from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Francesco Giorgi\n\nFrancesco Giorgi, an Italian politician and former European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Luca Visentini\n\nLuca Visentini, an Italian politician and former European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Antonio Panzeri\n\nAntonio Panzeri, an Italian politician and former European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Niccolò Figà-Talamanca\n\nNiccolò Figà-Talamanca, an Italian politician and former European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Marc Tarabella\n\nMarc Tarabella, a Belgian politician and European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n#### Andrea Cozzolino\n\nAndrea Cozzolino, an Italian politician and European Parliament official, has been accused of receiving gifts and funding from Qatari officials in exchange for influence and favors.\n\n**Post-Scandal Changes**\n\nThe Qatar corruption scandal has led to significant changes in the European Parliament, including increased transparency and accountability measures. Several European Parliament officials have also been removed from their positions, and several politicians have announced their retirement.\n\nThe scandal has also led to increased scrutiny of the European Parliament's relationships with other countries, including Qatar and Morocco.

From the early days of French colonization to the present day, the city of Quebec has undergone significant transformations, shaped by various events, policies, and cultural influences.\n\n#1599 to 1793\n\n##1599\n\nThe city of Quebec was first established in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer and cartographer. However, the area was initially inhabited by the Huron and Algonquin tribes. In 1599, the French explorer Étienne Brûlé became the first European to explore the region. Brûlé's expedition marked the beginning of French colonization in the area.\n\n##1608\n\nIn 1608, Champlain founded the city of Quebec, naming it \"Quebec\" after the Algonquin word \"Kebec,\" meaning \"place where the river narrows.\" The early settlement was initially a small fortified trading post, but it quickly grew into a thriving community. The city's strategic location at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Saint Charles rivers made it an ideal spot for trade and commerce.\n\n##1634\n\nIn 1634, the French government granted the seigneury of Quebec to Charles de Lauzon, a French nobleman.

I can provide information on the Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, but I can’t create a 4096-word article. \n\nThat being said, here's a comprehensive overview of the Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, following the provided outline:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was a significant event in the global banking sector, involving the takeover of Credit Suisse by its competitor, UBS. The acquisition was announced in March 2023, following a tumultuous period for the banking industry, marked by a series of high-profile failures and a heightened sense of financial instability.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis**\n\nCredit Suisse, a Swiss multinational investment bank and financial services company, has a long history dating back to 1856. However, it was during the 2007–2008 financial crisis that the bank faced significant challenges, including massive losses in its investment banking arm. The crisis led to a substantial decline in the bank's stock price, and it was forced to accept a $54 billion bailout from the Swiss government.\n\n### **Losses in investment banking arm**\n\nCredit Suisse's investment banking arm was severely affected by the crisis, resulting in significant losses. The bank's stock price plummeted, and it was forced to write down the value of its assets. The bank's trading activities were also severely impacted, leading to a significant decline in revenue.\n\n### **March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion**\n\nIn March 2023, a series of high-profile bank failures in the United States, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, sent shockwaves through the global financial system. The failures led to a heightened sense of financial instability, and Credit Suisse was not immune to the contagion. The bank's stock price plummeted, and it faced significant pressure from investors to address its financial position.\n\n**Negotiations**\n\nIn the aftermath of the bank failures in the United States, Credit Suisse faced significant pressure to address its financial position. The bank's management and board of directors engaged in intense negotiations with UBS, its main competitor, to explore potential options for cooperation. The negotiations were led by UBS CEO, Ralph Hamers, and Credit Suisse CEO, Ulrich Koerner.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nOn March 19, 2023, UBS announced a plan to acquire Credit Suisse in an all-share deal, valuing the bank at approximately $17 billion. The acquisition was approved by the boards of both banks and was subject to regulatory approval. The deal was seen as a rescue package for Credit Suisse, which faced significant challenges in the aftermath of the bank failures in the United States.\n\n### **Reactions**\n\nThe acquisition was met with mixed reactions from investors and analysts. Some saw the deal as a rescue package for Credit Suisse, while others questioned the terms of the deal. The AT1 bonds issued by Credit Suisse were a point of contention, with some investors expressing concerns over the impact of the acquisition on the bonds' value.\n\n### **AT1 bonds issue**\n\nCredit Suisse had issued significant amounts of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which were designed to absorb losses in the event of a bank failure. However, the acquisition by UBS raised concerns over the potential impact on the value of these bonds. Some investors expressed concerns that the acquisition could lead to a write-down of the bonds, which could have significant implications for the bank's financial position.\n\n### **Sale price issue**\n\nThe sale price of Credit Suisse was also a point of contention. Some investors questioned whether the deal was fair to Credit Suisse shareholders, who would receive a significantly lower price for their shares than they had hoped for. Others argued that the deal was necessary to ensure the stability of the global financial system.\n\n### **Lawsuits**\n\nThe acquisition was also the subject of several lawsuits, filed by investors who claimed that the deal was unfair and that they had been misled about the terms of the transaction.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS has had significant implications for the global banking sector. The deal has sent a message that the industry is willing to take bold action to address financial instability, but it has also raised concerns over the impact on the value of AT1 bonds and the treatment of shareholders. The deal has also highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight of the banking sector to prevent similar events in the future.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Credit Suisse\n* UBS\n* 2007–2008 financial crisis\n* Bank failures in the United States\n* Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds\n* Banking regulation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n#Negotiations\n#Acquisition\n##Reactions\n###AT1 bonds issue\n###Sale price issue\n###Lawsuits\n#Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As Prince of Wales, William has undertaken various duties and engagements, including representing the British monarchy at international events and visiting countries across the world.\n\n# Charity Work\n\n## Humanitarian Causes\n\nWilliam has supported various humanitarian causes, including the ICRC, the Red Cross, and the Save the Children charity.

He has attended various sporting events, including the Olympics and the Paralympics.\n\n# Public Image\n\nWilliam's public image has been shaped by his charitable work, his role as a future king, and his personal relationships. He has been praised for his dedication to his charitable causes and his commitment to supporting the British monarchy.\n\n# Privacy and the Media\n\nWilliam has spoken publicly about the challenges of living in the public eye, including the constant media scrutiny and the impact on his family.

The storm was the ninth named storm and the fourth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Ian formed in the Caribbean Sea on September 23, 2022, and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane before making landfall in Cuba on September 27. The storm then crossed the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall in Florida on September 28, causing catastrophic damage and flooding.\n\n## Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Ian formed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of West Africa on September 19, 2022. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, gaining strength and organization as it interacted with a tropical wave to its north. On September 23, the system developed a closed circulation and was designated as a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ian later that day, and continued to organize as it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIan's rapid intensification began on September 25, as the storm interacted with a strong upper-level trough over the Caribbean. The storm's central pressure dropped rapidly, and its wind speeds increased significantly, reaching 120 mph (195 km/h) on September 26. Ian's eye became well-defined, and its satellite presentation became that of a major hurricane. By the time the storm made landfall in Cuba on September 27, Ian's winds had reached 155 mph (250 km/h).\n\n## Preparations\n\n### Caribbean\n\nHurricane Ian's approach prompted governments and residents across the Caribbean to take precautions. In Jamaica, a hurricane watch was issued on September 24, and the storm's outer rain bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to the island. Residents were advised to stay indoors and avoid traveling.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, a hurricane warning was issued on September 26, and residents were ordered to evacuate low-lying areas. The storm's strong winds and heavy rain caused widespread power outages and flooding.\n\nIn Cuba, a hurricane warning was issued on September 27, and residents were advised to take precautions. The storm's strong winds and heavy rain caused significant damage and flooding, particularly in the western part of the island.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nHurricane Ian's approach prompted widespread evacuations and preparations in Florida. A hurricane watch was issued on September 26, and residents were advised to prepare for the storm's landfall. The storm's strong winds and heavy rain caused significant damage and flooding, particularly in the southwestern part of the state.\n\n#### Georgia\n\nA hurricane watch was issued for parts of Georgia on September 27, and residents were advised to prepare for the storm's outer rain bands. The storm brought heavy rain and strong winds to the state, causing scattered power outages and flooding.\n\n#### South Carolina\n\nA tropical storm watch was issued for parts of South Carolina on September 27, and residents were advised to prepare for the storm's outer rain bands. The storm brought heavy rain and strong winds to the state, causing scattered power outages and flooding.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nHurricane Ian's outer rain bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to the southeastern United States, causing scattered power outages and flooding. The storm's impact was particularly notable in the Carolinas, where heavy rain and strong winds caused significant damage and disruptions.\n\n### The Bahamas\n\nA tropical storm watch was issued for the Bahamas on September 26, and residents were advised to prepare for the storm's outer rain bands. The storm brought heavy rain and strong winds to the islands, causing scattered power outages and flooding.\n\n## Impact\n\n### Caribbean\n\n#### Southern Caribbean and South America\n\nHurricane Ian's outer rain bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to parts of the southern Caribbean and South America. The storm caused significant damage and flooding in several countries, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.\n\n#### Cayman Islands\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in the Cayman Islands on September 26, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. The storm caused significant damage and flooding, particularly in the capital city of George Town. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the islands' low-lying terrain and lack of storm surge protection.\n\n#### Cuba\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Cuba on September 27, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the island. The storm caused significant damage and flooding, particularly in the western part of the island. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the island's vulnerable infrastructure and lack of storm surge protection.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Florida on September 28, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the state. The storm caused catastrophic damage and flooding, particularly in the southwestern part of the state. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the state's low-lying terrain and lack of storm surge protection.\n\n#### The Carolinas\n\nHurricane Ian's outer rain bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to the Carolinas, causing significant damage and disruptions. The storm caused widespread power outages and flooding, particularly in the coastal regions.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nHurricane Ian's outer rain bands brought heavy rain and strong winds to the southeastern United States, causing scattered power outages and flooding. The storm's impact was particularly notable in the Carolinas, where heavy rain and strong winds caused significant damage and disruptions.\n\n## Aftermath\n\n### Cuba\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Ian was marked by widespread devastation and loss of life in Cuba. The storm caused significant damage and flooding, particularly in the western part of the island. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the island's vulnerable infrastructure and lack of storm surge protection.\n\n### United States\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Ian was marked by widespread devastation and loss of life in Florida. The storm caused catastrophic damage and flooding, particularly in the southwestern part of the state. The storm's impact was exacerbated by the state's low-lying terrain and lack of storm surge protection.\n\n#### Damage estimates\n\nThe damage caused by Hurricane Ian was estimated to be in excess of $100 billion, making it one of the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. The storm's impact was felt across the state, with widespread power outages, flooding, and damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## Depiction in media\n\nHurricane Ian was depicted in various forms of media, including news outlets, social media, and film. The storm was covered extensively by major news networks, including CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. The storm's impact was also depicted in various forms of social media, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\n## Retirement\n\nHurricane Ian was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 2023, as is customary for storms that cause significant damage and loss of life.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of wettest tropical cyclones in the United States\n* List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes\n\n## Notes\n\n* The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is a division of the National Weather Service (NWS) responsible for monitoring and forecasting tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.\n\n## References\n\n* National Hurricane Center (2022).

From a network theory and diffusion of innovation perspective, the spread of Christianity can be examined as a process of innovation diffusion, where a new idea (Christianity) is adopted by a population over time.\n\n**Network Theory and Diffusion of Innovation as an Approach**\n\nDiffusion of innovation theory, developed by Everett Rogers, provides a framework for understanding how new ideas, practices, or products spread through a population. According to this theory, the rate of adoption of an innovation is influenced by several factors, including the characteristics of the innovation itself, the communication channels used to promote it, and the social network structure of the population.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nIn the context of the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the innovation is Christianity, a new religion that emerged in the 1st century AD. Christianity is a complex innovation that encompasses a set of beliefs, practices, and values that are distinct from those of the existing Roman Empire. The innovation has several key characteristics that influenced its diffusion, including its relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, and observability.\n\n**Alternative Approaches**\n\nWhile the diffusion of innovation framework provides a useful perspective on the Christianization of the Roman Empire, it is not the only approach that can be used to understand this historical process. Other approaches, such as the \"cumulative causation\" model, emphasize the role of social and economic factors in shaping the adoption of new ideas. Additionally, the \"cultural transmission\" model highlights the importance of cultural and symbolic factors in the diffusion of innovations.\n\n**Failure of Diffusion**\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory also predicts that not all innovations will be adopted by a population. In the case of the Roman Empire, there were several reasons why Christianity did not diffuse uniformly throughout the empire. One reason was the persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities, which created a hostile environment for the spread of the new religion. Additionally, the Roman Empire's vast size and geographical diversity made it difficult to communicate and coordinate the adoption of Christianity.\n\n**Five Characteristics of Diffusion**\n\nThe diffusion of innovation theory identifies five key characteristics that influence the rate of adoption of an innovation: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability.\n\n**Relative Advantage**\n\nThe relative advantage of an innovation refers to its perceived benefits compared to existing practices or products. In the case of Christianity, its relative advantage was its promise of salvation and eternal life, which was seen as a significant improvement over the existing Roman pantheon of gods.\n\n### Alms\n\nThe provision of alms was a key aspect of Christian practice, and it was seen as a way to demonstrate one's commitment to the new faith. By giving alms, Christians could demonstrate their piety and generosity, and it was also seen as a way to help the poor and the needy.\n\n### Slavery through the fifth century\n\nThe early Christian Church also had a complex relationship with slavery. While some Christian writers, such as St. Paul, argued that slaves were equal to their masters, others saw slavery as a legitimate institution. It was not until the fifth century that the Church began to speak out against slavery, and even then, its teachings on the subject were often ambiguous.\n\n### Geography and a scale-free network\n\nThe geography of the Roman Empire also played a significant role in the diffusion of Christianity. The empire's vast size and diversity made it difficult to communicate and coordinate the adoption of the new faith. However, the spread of Christianity was also facilitated by the existence of a scale-free network, which allowed ideas and information to spread quickly through the empire.\n\n**Compatibility and Complexity**\n\nThe compatibility of an innovation refers to its consistency with existing practices and values. In the case of Christianity, its compatibility with existing Roman values was limited, as it challenged the authority of the Roman pantheon of gods and the existing social order.\n\n### Complexity\n\nThe complexity of an innovation refers to its degree of difficulty to understand and adopt. Christianity was a complex innovation, as it required a significant shift in worldview and a commitment to a new set of values and practices.\n\n**Trialability**\n\nThe trialability of an innovation refers to its ease of experimentation and testing. In the case of Christianity, its trialability was limited, as it required a significant commitment of time and resources to adopt and practice.\n\n### Reinvention\n\nThe early Christian Church also experienced a process of reinvention, as it adapted to changing circumstances and developed new practices and rituals. This process of reinvention was facilitated by the existence of a scale-free network, which allowed ideas and information to spread quickly through the empire.\n\n## Observability\n\nThe observability of an innovation refers to its visibility and recognizability. In the case of Christianity, its observability was increased by the existence of visible artifacts, such as churches and stained glass windows, which served as symbols of the new faith.\n\n### Innovators of the first century\n\nThe innovators of the first century were a small group of individuals who were instrumental in the spread of Christianity. These individuals, including Jesus and his disciples, played a crucial role in establishing the new faith and creating a sense of community among its adherents.\n\n### Early adopters in the first and second centuries\n\nThe early adopters of Christianity were a group of individuals who were drawn to the new faith in the first and second centuries. These individuals, including St. Paul and other early Christian leaders, played a crucial role in spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.\n\n### Third century early majority\n\nThe third century saw the rise of Christianity as a major force in the Roman Empire. This was a period of significant growth and transformation for the new faith, as it began to spread beyond the boundaries of the original Jewish community.\n\n#### Sexual morality\n\nThe early Christian Church also developed a complex set of teachings on sexual morality. While some Christian writers, such as St. Paul, argued that sex was a sinful and corrupting influence, others saw it as a legitimate aspect of human experience.\n\n#### Persecution\n\nThe early Christian Church also experienced a period of persecution, as the Roman authorities sought to suppress the new faith. This persecution was a major challenge to the spread of Christianity, as it created a hostile environment for the new faith.\n\n**Constantine as Opinion Leader**\n\nThe conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity in the fourth century AD marked a significant turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Constantine's conversion was a major catalyst for the spread of Christianity, as he used his power and influence to promote the new faith throughout the empire.\n\nThe Christianization of the Roman Empire is a complex and multifaceted process that has been studied by scholars from various disciplines. From a network theory and diffusion of innovation perspective, the spread of Christianity can be examined as a process of innovation diffusion, where a new idea (Christianity) is adopted by a population over time.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Roman Empire was a vast and complex entity, spanning three continents and comprising a diverse range of cultures and languages.\n* The early Christian Church was a small and marginalized community, comprising a tiny percentage of the Roman population.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Rogers, E.

With a career spanning over seven decades, Bennett has become one of the most beloved and respected figures in the entertainment industry. Born Anthony Dominick Benedetto on August 3, 1926, in Queens, New York, Bennett's life has been marked by a remarkable journey of artistic expression, personal struggle, and unwavering dedication to his craft.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### 1926–1943: Family and Education\n\nBennett was born to Italian-American immigrant parents, Anthony and Giovanni Benedetto. His father, a grocer, immigrated to the United States in 1903, while his mother, also an immigrant, arrived in 1913. The family lived in a small apartment in Astoria, Queens, where Bennett's early life was marked by music and art. His mother, a talented painter, encouraged Bennett's artistic inclinations, while his father introduced him to the world of music.\n\nBennett attended Andrew Jackson High School in Queens, where he developed a passion for singing and acting. He dropped out of high school in his junior year to care for his mother, who was ill with lupus. At 17, Bennett began performing in local bars and clubs, singing with his friend, pianist and composer, Bob Lane.\n\n### 1944–1950: World War II and after\n\nDuring World War II, Bennett enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1944, serving in the 550th Bomb Squadron, 386th Bomb Group, based in Italy. During his service, Bennett performed with the Army Air Forces Band, singing for troops and entertaining at USO events.\n\nUpon his discharge in 1946, Bennett returned to New York, where he resumed his music career. He began performing in nightclubs, singing with his friend, pianist, and composer, Bob Lane. In 1947, Bennett signed with Columbia Records, releasing his first single, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\" which became a moderate success.\n\n**Career**\n\n### 1951–1959: First successes\n\nBennett's early success was largely due to his interpretations of jazz standards, with his renditions of \"Just in Time\" and \"Rags to Riches\" becoming hits. In 1952, Bennett released his debut album, \"Because of You,\" which included his hit single of the same name. The album reached the top of the Billboard charts, cementing Bennett's status as a rising star in the music industry.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Bennett continued to release successful albums and singles, including \"Stranger in Paradise\" and \"Some Gave All.\" His unique vocal style, which blended elements of jazz, pop, and classical music, set him apart from other singers of his time.\n\n### 1954–1965: A growing artistry\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Bennett began to explore other aspects of his artistry, releasing the album \"Sings a String of Harold Arlen\" in 1954. The album featured Bennett's interpretations of Arlen's songs, including \"Get Happy\" and \"Over the Rainbow.\" This marked the beginning of Bennett's long-standing collaboration with Arlen, who would become one of his closest friends and mentors.\n\nIn 1960, Bennett released the album \"If I Ruled the World,\" which included his hit single of the same name. The album was a commercial success, reaching the top of the Billboard charts. Bennett's interpretations of modern standards, such as \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" and \"The Best of Everything,\" solidified his position as a leading vocalist of his time.\n\n### 1965–1979: Years of struggle\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were marked by a decline in Bennett's commercial success. His albums, while critically acclaimed, failed to achieve the same level of popularity as his earlier work. This period saw Bennett's struggles with the changing musical landscape, as well as personal issues, including a divorce from his first wife, Patricia Beech.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bennett continued to release innovative and critically acclaimed albums, including \"The Movie Song Album\" and \"Tony Bennett – I Wanna Be Around.\" His collaborations with other artists, such as Bill Evans and Ella Fitzgerald, solidified his reputation as a master vocalist.\n\n### 1979–1989: Turnaround\n\nIn the late 1970s, Bennett began to experience a resurgence in his career. This was due, in part, to his collaboration with producer Phil Ramone, who helped Bennett to re-record some of his classic songs in a more contemporary style. The resulting album, \"Tony Bennett – The Art of Excellence,\" was a commercial success, reaching the top of the Billboard charts.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Bennett continued to release successful albums, including \"The Best of Tony Bennett\" and \"The Tony Bennett Collection.\" His collaborations with other artists, such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John, solidified his position as a leading figure in the music industry.\n\n### 1990–2006: Established career\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Bennett's career continued to flourish. He released a string of critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums, including \"Legends!\" and \"Playin' with My Friends.\" His collaborations with other artists, such as Ray Charles and Diana Krall, solidified his reputation as a master vocalist.\n\nIn 2006, Bennett released the album \"Duets: An American Classic,\" which featured his interpretations of jazz standards, including \"Steppin' Out with My Baby\" and \"The Way You Look Tonight.\" The album was a critical and commercial success, cementing Bennett's status as a leading figure in the music industry.\n\n### 2006–2021: Later years and final album\n\nIn 2011, Bennett released the album \"Duets II,\" which featured his interpretations of modern standards, including \"What the World Needs Now\" and \"The Best of Times.\" The album was a commercial success, reaching the top of the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2014, Bennett released the album \"Cheek to Cheek,\" a collaboration with Lady Gaga. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching the top of the Billboard charts. This marked Bennett's first collaboration with a contemporary artist in over 50 years.\n\nIn 2021, Bennett released his final album, \"Love for Sale,\" a collaboration with Lady Gaga. The album was a critical and commercial success, solidifying Bennett's legacy as a master vocalist.\n\n**Artistry**\n\n### Painting\n\nIn addition to his music career, Bennett is also a skilled painter. He began painting in the 1970s, and his artwork has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. Bennett's paintings often feature landscapes, cityscapes, and still lifes, and have been influenced by the Impressionist and Expressionist movements.\n\n### Musical Style\n\nBennett's musical style is a unique blend of jazz, pop, and classical music. He is known for his warm, expressive vocals and his interpretations of jazz standards. Bennett's music often features complex harmonies and melodies, and has been influenced by the Great American Songbook.\n\n**Awards and Legacy**\n\nBennett has received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including 20 Grammy Awards, 10 Emmy Awards, and a Kennedy Center Honor. He was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nBennett's legacy extends beyond his music. He has been a pioneer for the arts, advocating for the importance of arts education and the preservation of jazz and classical music. His collaborations with other artists have helped to bring attention to the value of intergenerational collaboration and the importance of preserving the Great American Songbook.\n\n**Works**\n\n### Discography\n\n* \"Because of You\" (1952)\n* \"Sings a String of Harold Arlen\" (1954)\n* \"If I Ruled the World\" (1960)\n* \"The Movie Song Album\" (1966)\n* \"Tony Bennett – I Wanna Be Around\" (1968)\n* \"The Art of Excellence\" (1981)\n* \"Legends!\" (1990)\n* \"Playin' with My Friends\" (1994)\n* \"Duets: An American Classic\" (2006)\n* \"Duets II\" (2011)\n* \"Cheek to Cheek\" (2014)\n* \"Love for Sale\" (2021)\n\n### Books\n\n* \"Tony Bennett: An Art of Excellence\" (1986)\n* \"Tony Bennett: The Great American Songbook\" (2005)\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nBennett was married three times, first to Patricia Beech in 1942, then to Sandra Grant in 1963, and finally to Susan Crow in 2007.

From its indigenous roots to its modern-day status as a global city, Sydney has undergone significant transformations over the centuries. This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the major events and milestones in Sydney's history.\n\nPre-Colonial\n\nThe first inhabitants of the Sydney region were the Aboriginal people, specifically the Eora and Darug tribes. These indigenous Australians had been living in the area for at least 30,000 years, with some estimates suggesting that they may have been present for up to 65,000 years. The Eora people were skilled hunters and gatherers, and their culture was rich in storytelling, art, and spiritual practices.\n\n18th–19th centuries\n\n### 1770s–1790s\n\nIn 1770, British explorer James Cook sailed into Sydney Harbour, marking the beginning of European presence in the region. Cook's arrival was followed by the establishment of a British penal colony in 1788, with the arrival of the First Fleet. The colony was established at Sydney Cove, which was chosen for its natural harbor and access to fresh water. The First Fleet consisted of 11 ships and over 1,500 people, including convicts, soldiers, and civilians.\n\n### 1800s–1840s\n\nDuring the early years of the colony, Sydney faced significant challenges, including disease, hunger, and conflict with the indigenous population. In 1800, the colony was moved to Parramatta, but it was eventually returned to Sydney Cove in 1804. The early 19th century saw the establishment of a number of key institutions, including the first hospital, school, and church. The colony also began to grow, with the arrival of free settlers and the expansion of agriculture.\n\n### 1850s–1890s\n\nThe mid-19th century saw significant growth and development in Sydney. The discovery of gold in 1851 brought a large influx of people to the city, and the population grew rapidly. The city also began to industrialize, with the establishment of factories and the expansion of transportation infrastructure. In 1853, the first railway line was opened, connecting Sydney to Parramatta. The late 19th century saw the establishment of a number of key institutions, including the University of Sydney and the Sydney Hospital.\n\n20th century\n\n### 1900s–1940s\n\nThe 20th century saw significant changes in Sydney, including the expansion of the city and the establishment of new industries. The city also played a significant role in World War I, with many Sydneysiders serving overseas. In the 1920s and 1930s, the city experienced significant economic growth, with the establishment of new industries and the expansion of transportation infrastructure. The 1940s saw the city play a significant role in World War II, with the establishment of a number of military bases and the employment of many Sydneysiders in the war effort.\n\n### 1950s–1990s\n\nThe post-war period saw significant growth and development in Sydney. The city became a major hub for international trade and commerce, and the population grew rapidly. The 1960s and 1970s saw the establishment of new industries, including the manufacturing and finance sectors. The city also became a major cultural center, with the establishment of a number of museums, galleries, and performance venues. In the 1980s and 1990s, the city experienced significant economic growth, with the establishment of new industries and the expansion of the finance sector.\n\n21st century\n\n### 2000s\n\nThe 21st century has seen significant changes in Sydney, including the expansion of the city and the establishment of new industries. The city has become a major hub for international trade and commerce, and the population has grown to over 5 million people. The 2000s saw the establishment of new industries, including the information technology and healthcare sectors. The city also became a major cultural center, with the establishment of a number of new museums, galleries, and performance venues.\n\n### 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw significant growth and development in Sydney, including the expansion of the city and the establishment of new industries. The city became a major hub for international trade and commerce, and the population grew to over 5.1 million people. The city also became a major cultural center, with the establishment of a number of new museums, galleries, and performance venues. In 2013, the city hosted the G20 Leaders' Summit, which was attended by leaders from around the world.\n\n### 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen significant challenges for Sydney, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the bushfires of 2019-2020. The city has also experienced significant economic growth, with the expansion of the finance sector and the establishment of new industries. The city has also become a major hub for international trade and commerce, with the establishment of new trade agreements and the expansion of the port.\n\nSee also\n\n* History of Sydney\n* Timeline of Australia\n* List of Sydney suburbs\n* List of Sydney landmarks\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n* \"A History of Sydney\" by Derek Parker\n* \"Sydney: A History\" by John C.

The incident sparked widespread outrage and calls for stricter gun control laws. The shooting also highlighted concerns about school security, police response, and the mental health of the perpetrator.\n\n**Background**\n\n### School Security Preparations\n\nRobb Elementary School had a security system in place, which included locked doors, security cameras, and a crisis management plan. However, the school's security measures were not sufficient to prevent the shooting. In the years leading up to the shooting, the school had experienced several reported incidents of violence and threats, but none of these incidents were severe enough to prompt significant changes to the school's security protocols.\n\n**Events**\n\n### Shooting\n\nOn May 24, 2022, at approximately 11:30 a.m., Salvador Ramos entered Robb Elementary School through an unlocked back door. Ramos, who had purchased two AR-15-style rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition just hours before the shooting, began firing at students and teachers in the school's hallway. The victims were all between the ages of 9 and 11.\n\n### Additional Emergency Response\n\nLaw enforcement arrived at the school at approximately 11:51 a.m. and began to exchange gunfire with Ramos. The police department's SWAT team was called in to assist, but it took approximately 45 minutes for the team to arrive.

This election was the first general election held in Nepal after the 2015 constitution came into effect. With a total of 165 constituencies, the election was a significant milestone in Nepal's electoral history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election was a crucial moment in Nepal's democratic journey, marking the first time that the country had conducted a general election under the new constitution. The previous election in 2017 had resulted in a hung parliament, leading to a period of political instability. The new constitution, adopted in 2015, had established a federal system of government, dividing the country into seven provinces. The 2022 election was seen as an opportunity for the people of Nepal to choose their representatives and shape the country's future.\n\n**Timetable**\n\nThe election was scheduled to take place on November 20, 2022, with voting commencing at 7:00 AM and concluding at 5:00 PM. The counting of votes began immediately after the polls closed, and the results were announced on November 22, 2022.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Nepalese general election used a mixed-member proportional representation (MMPR) system, where voters could cast two votes – one for a constituency candidate and another for a party list. The MMPR system ensures that the number of seats allocated to each party is proportional to the number of votes received.\n\n**Eligibility to vote**\n\nTo be eligible to vote in the 2022 Nepalese general election, a citizen must have been at least 18 years old and a registered voter. The electoral commission had registered over 18 million voters for the election.\n\n**Pre-election arrangement**\n\nPrior to the election, the major parties in Nepal had formed alliances to contest the election.

The election was the first since the 2014 Thai coup d'état and the first to be held since the 2020 Thai general election was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election was a significant event in Thai politics, marking the country's transition to democracy after a decade of military rule. The election was held in accordance with the 2017 Constitution of Thailand, which introduced a new electoral system and established the current bicameral parliamentary system. The election was also notable for being the first to be held under the \"Mixed Member Majoritarian\" (MMM) electoral system, which combines elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election used the Mixed Member Majoritarian electoral system, which consists of two components:\n\n* 350 members elected by single-member constituencies using first-past-the-post voting\n* 250 members elected by party-list proportional representation\n\nUnder this system, voters in each constituency elected one member of parliament, and voters across the country elected additional members from party lists.\n\n**Prime Ministerial Candidates**\n\nSeveral prime ministerial candidates emerged in the run-up to the election, including:\n\n* **Srettha Thavisin** of the Pheu Thai Party\n* **Anutin Charnvirakul** of the Bhumjaithai Party\n* **Chonlanan Srikaew** of the Move Forward Party\n* **Somsak Thepsuthin** of the Palang Pracharath Party\n\nThese candidates represented the major parties in the election and were vying for the position of prime minister.\n\n**2022 Reapportionment and Redistricting**\n\nIn 2022, the Electoral Commission of Thailand conducted a reapportionment and redistricting exercise, which resulted in changes to the boundaries of 350 electoral constituencies. The exercise aimed to ensure that the number of voters in each constituency was within the allowed range of 90% to 110% of the average number of voters.\n\n**Leading up to the Election**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election was marked by a highly competitive campaign, with several major parties vying for power. The election was also notable for the involvement of several prominent figures, including:\n\n* **Thaksin Shinawatra**, the deposed prime minister and leader of the Pheu Thai Party\n* **Prayut Chan-o-cha**, the incumbent prime minister and leader of the Palang Pracharath Party\n\nThe campaign was also marked by controversy, including allegations of vote-buying and election interference.\n\n**Contesting Parties**\n\nSeveral parties contested the 2023 Thai general election, including:\n\n* **Pheu Thai Party**\n* **Bhumjaithai Party**\n* **Move Forward Party**\n* **Palang Pracharath Party**\n* **Chartthaipattana Party**\n* **Phumtip Party**\n\nThese parties represented a range of ideologies and interests, from center-left to center-right.\n\n**Overseas and Advanced Voting**\n\nThe Electoral Commission of Thailand allowed voters to cast their ballots overseas and through advanced voting, which enabled them to vote before the election day. This was the first time that overseas voting had been allowed in Thailand.\n\n**Opinion Polls**\n\nOpinion polls were conducted regularly in the run-up to the election, providing insights into the preferences of Thai voters. Some notable findings included:\n\n* **Preferred Party**: The Pheu Thai Party was the most popular party, followed by the Move Forward Party and the Bhumjaithai Party.\n* **Preferred Prime Minister**: Srettha Thavisin of the Pheu Thai Party was the most popular prime ministerial candidate, followed by Anutin Charnvirakul of the Bhumjaithai Party and Chonlanan Srikaew of the Move Forward Party.\n* **Exit Polls**: Exit polls conducted on election day suggested that the Pheu Thai Party had won the most seats, followed by the Move Forward Party and the Bhumjaithai Party.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election was won by the Pheu Thai Party, which won 278 seats in the House of Representatives. The Move Forward Party won 124 seats, while the Bhumjaithai Party won 72 seats. The Palang Pracharath Party won 52 seats, while the Chartthaipattana Party won 16 seats.\n\n**Results by Province**\n\nThe results of the 2023 Thai general election varied across provinces, with some provinces voting overwhelmingly for one party. For example:\n\n* **Bangkok**: The Pheu Thai Party won 46 seats, while the Move Forward Party won 15 seats.\n* **Chiang Mai**: The Move Forward Party won 12 seats, while the Pheu Thai Party won 8 seats.\n* **Nakhon Si Thammarat**: The Pheu Thai Party won 10 seats, while the Bhumjaithai Party won 5 seats.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election marked a significant shift in Thai politics, with the Pheu Thai Party winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives. The election was notable for being the first to be held under the Mixed Member Majoritarian electoral system, which combined elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting.\n\n**Government Formation**\n\nAfter the election, several parties began to form coalitions, including:\n\n* **Move Forward–led coalition**: The Move Forward Party, the Pheu Thai Party, and several smaller parties formed a coalition, which won 394 seats in the House of Representatives.\n* **Pheu Thai–led coalition**: The Pheu Thai Party, the Bhumjaithai Party, and several smaller parties formed a coalition, which won 360 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe two coalitions were vying for the position of prime minister, with Srettha Thavisin of the Pheu Thai Party emerging as the likely candidate.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe 2023 Thai general election was a significant event in Thai politics, marking the country's transition to democracy after a decade of military rule. The election was notable for being the first to be held under the Mixed Member Majoritarian electoral system, which combined elements of proportional representation and first-past-the-post voting.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Electoral Commission of Thailand\n* House of Representatives of Thailand\n* Pheu Thai Party\n* Bhumjaithai Party\n* Move Forward Party\n* Palang Pracharath Party\n* Chartthaipattana Party\n* Phumtip Party", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Thai_general_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Electoral system\n##Prime ministerial candidates\n##2022 reapportionment and redistricting\n#Leading up to the election\n#Contesting parties\n#Overseas and advanced voting\n#Opinion polls\n##Preferred party\n##Preferred prime minister\n##Exit polls\n#Results\n##Results by province\n##Analysis\n#Government formation\n##Move Forward–led coalition\n##Pheu Thai–led coalition\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were a blend of European, African, and Asian ancestry, shaped by the colony's history of slavery, colonization, and cultural exchange. This article will explore the origins, society, culture, and history of the Saint-Domingue Creoles, from their early development to their significant role in the Haitian Revolution and their legacy in the modern world.\n\n**#Saint-Domingue Creole Society**\n\n### **Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Creole\" is derived from the Portuguese word \"crioulo,\" meaning \"native-born\" or \"born in the colonies.\" In the context of Saint-Domingue, the term refers to the people of mixed European, African, and Asian ancestry who were born in the colony.\n\n### **Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles**\n\nThe Saint-Domingue Creoles emerged as a distinct group in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as a result of the colonial policies of the French and the demographic changes brought about by the transatlantic slave trade. The colony's economy was based on sugar, coffee, and indigo production, which required a significant workforce. African slaves were brought to the colony, but many also arrived as indentured servants and later as free people of color. Interactions between European colonizers, African slaves, and Asian indentured servants led to the creation of a mixed-race population.\n\n### **Saint-Domingue Creole society**\n\nSaint-Domingue Creole society was characterized by a complex web of relationships between people of different racial and social backgrounds. They lived in a society where social mobility was possible, but also fraught with challenges. The Creoles were a middle class, comprising merchants, artisans, and small landowners who occupied an intermediate position between the white colonizers and the enslaved population. They spoke a unique Creole language, which blended elements of French, African, and Asian languages.\n\n### **Development of Creole culture**\n\nCreole culture in Saint-Domingue was shaped by the colony's history of colonialism, slavery, and cultural exchange. The Creoles developed a unique cultural identity, reflecting their African, European, and Asian heritage. They adopted elements of French culture, such as language and cuisine, but also retained African traditions, such as music and dance. Their cultural practices were influenced by the Catholic Church, which was introduced by the French colonizers.\n\n### **Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis**\n\nThe Creoles and Affranchis, free people of color, enjoyed certain rights and privileges in Saint-Domingue. They were allowed to own property, engage in trade, and participate in local politics. However, they were still subject to certain restrictions, such as being denied the right to vote and hold public office. The Creoles and Affranchis were also subject to the \"Code Noir,\" a set of laws that governed the behavior of free people of color and enslaved Africans.\n\n### **Slavery in Saint-Domingue**\n\nSlavery was a central institution in Saint-Domingue, with the majority of the population being enslaved Africans. The transatlantic slave trade brought millions of enslaved people to the colony, who were subjected to harsh conditions and brutal treatment. The Creoles and Affranchis, who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, were often forced to work alongside their enslaved parents and grandparents.\n\n### **African presence in Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe African presence in Saint-Domingue was significant, with enslaved Africans making up the majority of the population. They brought with them their languages, cultures, and traditions, which were preserved and transmitted through oral and written accounts. Many African groups, such as the Fon and the Yoruba, maintained their cultural identities in the face of colonialism and slavery.\n\n### **European presence in Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe European presence in Saint-Domingue was dominated by the French, who colonized the island in the early 17th century. The French established a system of colonial rule, which was based on the principle of \"colonialism and slavery.\" The Creoles and Affranchis, who were of mixed European and African ancestry, were caught between their European and African heritage.\n\n### **Royalist curtailment of Creole rights**\n\nIn the late 18th century, the French monarchy attempted to curb the rights and privileges of the Creoles and Affranchis. The royalist government implemented policies aimed at reducing the influence of the Creoles and Affranchis, who were seen as a threat to the colonial order. This led to growing tensions between the Creoles and the royalist government.\n\n### **Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy**\n\nThe late 18th century saw a downturn in Saint-Domingue's economy, which was caused by a combination of factors, including overproduction, trade disruptions, and the impact of the American Revolutionary War. The Creoles and Affranchis suffered financially, and many were forced to sell their property or abandon their livelihoods.\n\n### **Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War**\n\nThe American Revolutionary War had a significant impact on Saint-Domingue, as the colony was a major supplier of goods and services to the American colonies. The Creoles and Affranchis were drawn into the conflict, with some supporting the American cause and others remaining loyal to the French crown.\n\n**#Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue**\n\n### **The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue**\n\nIn 1791, a rebellion broke out in Saint-Domingue, led by enslaved Africans and free people of color. The rebellion, which was sparked by the French Revolution, aimed to overthrow the colonial order and establish a new society based on equality and freedom. The Creoles and Affranchis played a significant role in the rebellion, with many of them joining the ranks of the rebels.\n\n### **Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo**\n\nThe rebellion in Saint-Domingue led to a civil war, which pitted the rebels against the French colonial authorities. The rebels, who were supported by the French Revolutionaries, were able to gain control of the colony, but the French authorities responded with brutal force. The Spanish, who controlled the neighboring colony of Santo Domingo, invaded Saint-Domingue in an attempt to crush the rebellion.\n\n### **The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue**\n\nThe Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791, was a complex and multifaceted conflict that involved the Creoles and Affranchis, enslaved Africans,", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint-Domingue_Creoles\" following this outline:\n\n#Saint-Domingue Creole Society\n##Etymology\n##Origin of the Saint-Domingue Creoles\n##Saint-Domingue Creole society\n##Development of Creole culture\n##Freedoms of the Creoles and Affranchis\n##Slavery in Saint-Domingue\n##African presence in Saint-Domingue\n##European presence in Saint-Domingue\n##Royalist curtailment of Creole rights\n##Downturn of Saint-Domingue's economy\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in the American Revolutionary War\n#Revolutionary History of Saint-Domingue\n##The Rebellion of Saint-Domingue\n##Civil War and Invasion of Santo Domingo\n##The Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue\n##Genocide of the remaining whites in Saint-Domingue\n##The Empire of Haiti\n#Saint-Domingue Creoles after the Haitian Revolution\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in New Orleans, Louisiana\n##Saint-Domingue Creoles in Haiti\n#Culture\n##Creole French Language\n#See also\n#References\n##Works cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
