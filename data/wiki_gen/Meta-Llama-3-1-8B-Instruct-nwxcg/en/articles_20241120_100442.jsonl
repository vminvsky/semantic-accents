{"title": "Jimmy_Carter", "content": "\nEarly life\nJames Earl Carter Jr was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse [1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital [2] He is the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635 [3] [4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers [5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland [6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I [6]\n\n\nEducation\nEarly into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\" [209] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June [210] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law, [211] establishing the United States Department of Education [212]\n\n\nNaval career\nFrom 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets [26] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret [27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year [28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer [29]\n\n\nFarming\nAfter debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little [48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains [b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business [50] Transitioning from the Navy to an agribusinessman was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat [51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books [52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful [49] [52]\n\n\nEarly political career (1963–1971)\nAs racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v Board of Education, [53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board [54] [55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election [56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County [56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182 [57]\n\n\nGeorgia state senator (1963–1967)\nAs racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v Board of Education, [53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board [54] [55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election [56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County [56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182 [57]\n\n\n1966 and 1970 gubernatorial campaigns\nIn the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road .. I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\" [65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who narrowly defeated Arnall [66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor [66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter [66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time [67] [68]\n\n\nGeorgia governorship (1971–1975)\nCarter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971 In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\", [71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature [72] [73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972 Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session [74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money [75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence [76]\n\n\n1976 presidential campaign\nOn December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change [95] [96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace [97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\" [98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\" [99]\n\n\nElection\nCarter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points [120] [121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead [122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election [123] [124]\n\n\nTransition\nPreliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election [131] [132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice [133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were [133] [132]\n\n\nPresidency (1977–1981)\nCarter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977 [140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483 [141] [142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis Under Carter, the U.S experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission [143] In 1980, Carter signed Law H.R 5860 aka Public Law 96–185, known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail out the Chrysler Corporation with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $12.94 billion in 2023) in aid [144]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nMoralism typified much of Carter's action [148] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\" He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House [149] [150] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House [151] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years [152]\n\n\nU.S. energy crisis\nMoralism typified much of Carter's action [148] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of

1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years [152]\n\n\nEPA Love Canal Superfund\nIn 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill The Superfund law was created in response to the situation [166] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\" [167]\n\n\nPoor relations with Congress\nCarter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules [168] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them He was unwilling to return political favors His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation [169] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties [170] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects, [171] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party [172]\n\n\nEconomy\nCarter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession, which had left fixed investment at its lowest level since the 1970 recession and unemployment at 9% [183] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978, [184] [185] but the early 1980s recession caused it to return to its pre-1977 level [186] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration [187] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates, [188] oil shortages, and slow economic growth [189] Due to the $30 billion economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter [190]\n\n\nDeregulation\nIn 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978 [194]\n\n\nHealthcare\nDuring his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance [198] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal, [199] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage [200] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage President Harry S Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B Johnson [201] [202] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate, [203] but later defeated in the House [204] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful [205] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system [206]\n\n\nEducation\nEarly into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\" [209] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June [210] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law, [211] establishing the United States Department of Education [212]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFrom the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict [217] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference), [218] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt [219]\n\n\nIsrael and Egypt\nFrom the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict [217] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference), [218]

two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt [219]\n\n\nAfrica\nIn an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\" [221] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region [222]\n\n\nEast Asia\nCarter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter [231] [232] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping [233]\n\n\nIran\nOn November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\" [247] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to  [the Shah]\" [248] [249] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them [250] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979 [251]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nOn February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer [262] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week [263]\n\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan\nCommunists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978 [269] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year [269] [270] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September [269] [270] [271] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president [269] [270]\n\n\nInternational trips\nCarter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president [285] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978 [224] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi [286]\n\n\nAllegations and investigations\nThe September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter [287]\n\n\n1980 presidential campaign\nCarter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him [292] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal [293] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $108,718,255 in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission [294]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1981–present)\nShortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself [316]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nDiplomacy has been a large part of Carter's post-presidency These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin, [317] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization [318]\n\n\nViews on later presidents\nCarter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\" [341] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, [342] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East; [343] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East [344] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, [345] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984, [346] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985, [347] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism [348] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands, [349] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, [350] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis [351]\n\n\nPresidential politics\nCarter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election, [371] [372] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination [373] [374] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign, [375] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale [376] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes [377]\n\n\nHurricane relief\nCarter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina, [416] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy [417] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities, [418] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters [419]\n\n\nOther activities\nIn 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center, [420] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering, [421] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries [422] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016, [423] [424] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics [425]\n\n\nIsrael and Palestine\nCarter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid [442] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\" [443] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's: [444]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCarter's hobbies include painting, [446] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing [447] He also has an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas [448] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey; [449] this later came to fruition in 1982 [448] [450]\n\n\nBeliefs\nFrom a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity [460] [461] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia [462] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia [463] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign [461] [464] [465] [466] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\" [467] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\" [468] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship [460] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment [469] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics [470]\n\n\nFamily\nCarter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988) [471] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians [472] He is related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who had a relationship with a black female slave he owned [473]\n\n\nHealth\nOn August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated [485] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings [486] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer [487]\n\n\nLongevity\nAt 100 years old, Carter is the longest-lived former U.S president [503] He has been the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006 In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration [504] [505] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived US president, surpassing George H W Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days [506] He is also the oldest of the few U.S presidents to have been born in a hospital, all of whom are alive as of 2024 [507] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage [508] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home [509]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him [516] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner [517] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\" [518] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates [519] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid [520]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him [516] By comparison, Carter was

Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984 [145] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986 [542] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a  National Historic Site [543] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park [544] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University, [545] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society [546] In 1998, the U.S Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer [547]\n\n\nSee

"Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jimmy_Carter\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJames Earl Carter Jr was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse [1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital [2] He is the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635 [3] [4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers [5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland [6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I [6]\n\n\nEducation\nEarly into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\" [209] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June [210] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law, [211] establishing the United States Department of Education [212]\n\n\nNaval career\nFrom 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets [26] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret [27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year [28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer [29]\n\n\nFarming\nAfter debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little [48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains [b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business [50] Transitioning from the Navy to an agribusinessman was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat [51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books [52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful [49] [52]\n\n\nEarly political career (1963–1971)\nAs racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v Board of Education, [53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board [54] [55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election [56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County [56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182 [57]\n\n\nGeorgia state senator (1963–1967)\nAs racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v Board of Education, [53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the

fraudulent in an investigation Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182 [57]\n\n\n1966 and 1970 gubernatorial campaigns\nIn the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road .. I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\" [65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who narrowly defeated Arnall [66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor [66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter [66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time [67] [68]\n\n\nGeorgia governorship (1971–1975)\nCarter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971 In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\", [71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature [72] [73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972 Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session [74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money [75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence [76]\n\n\n1976 presidential campaign\nOn December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change [95] [96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace [97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\" [98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\" [99]\n\n\nElection\nCarter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points [120] [121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead [122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election [123] [124]\n\n\nTransition\nPreliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election [131] [132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice [133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were [133] [132]\n\n\nPresidency (1977–1981)\nCarter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977 [140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483 [141] [142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis Under Carter, the U.S experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission [143] In 1980, Carter signed Law H.R 5860 aka Public Law 96–185, known as The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail out the Chrysler Corporation with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $12.94 billion in 2023) in aid [144]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nMoralism typified much of Carter's action [148] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\" He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House [149] [150] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House [151] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years [152]\n\n\nU.S. energy crisis\nMoralism typified much of Carter's action [148] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of

1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years [152]\n\n\nEPA Love Canal Superfund\nIn 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill The Superfund law was created in response to the situation [166] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\" [167]\n\n\nPoor relations with Congress\nCarter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules [168] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them He was unwilling to return political favors His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation [169] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties [170] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects, [171] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party [172]\n\n\nEconomy\nCarter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession, which had left fixed investment at its lowest level since the 1970 recession and unemployment at 9% [183] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978, [184] [185] but the early 1980s recession caused it to return to its pre-1977 level [186] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration [187] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates, [188] oil shortages, and slow economic growth [189] Due to the $30 billion economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter [190]\n\n\nDeregulation\nIn 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978 [194]\n\n\nHealthcare\nDuring his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance [198] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal, [199] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage [200] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage President Harry S Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B Johnson [201] [202] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate, [203] but later defeated in the House [204] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful [205] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system [206]\n\n\nEducation\nEarly into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\" [209] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June [210] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law, [211] establishing the United States Department of Education [212]\n\n\nForeign policy\nFrom the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict [217] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference), [218] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt [219]\n\n\nIsrael and Egypt\nFrom the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict [217] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference), [218] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt [219]\n\n\nAfrica\nIn an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\" [221] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region [222]\n\n\nEast Asia\nCarter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter [231] [232] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping [233]\n\n\nIran\nOn November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\" [247] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to  [the Shah]\" [248] [249] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them [250] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979 [251]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nOn February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer [262] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week [263]\n\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan\nCommunists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978 [269] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year [269] [270] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September [269] [270] [271] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president [269] [270]\n\n\nInternational trips\nCarter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president [285] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978 [224] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi [286]\n\n\nAllegations and investigations\nThe September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter [287]\n\n\n1980 presidential campaign\nCarter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him [292] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal [293] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $108,718,255 in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission [294]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1981–present)\nShortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself [316]\n\n\nDiplomacy\nDiplomacy has been a large part of Carter's post-presidency These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin, [317] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization [318]\n\n\nViews on later presidents\nCarter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\" [341] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, [342] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East; [343] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East [344] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, [345] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984, [346] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985, [347] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism [348] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands, [349] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, [350] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis [351]\n\n\nPresidential politics\nCarter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election, [371] [372] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination [373] [374] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign, [375] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale [376] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes [377]\n\n\nHurricane relief\nCarter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina, [416] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy [417] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities, [418] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters [419]\n\n\nOther activities\nIn 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center, [420] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering, [421] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries [422] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016, [423] [424] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics [425]\n\n\nIsrael and Palestine\nCarter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid [442] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\" [443] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's: [444]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCarter's hobbies include painting, [446] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing [447] He also has an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas [448] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey; [449] this later came to fruition in 1982 [448] [450]\n\n\nBeliefs\nFrom a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity [460] [461] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia [462] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia [463] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign [461] [464] [465] [466] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\" [467] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\" [468] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship [460] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment [469] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics [470]\n\n\nFamily\nCarter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988) [471] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians [472] He is related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who had a relationship with a black female slave he owned [473]\n\n\nHealth\nOn August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated [485] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings [486] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer [487]\n\n\nLongevity\nAt 100 years old, Carter is the longest-lived former U.S president [503] He has been the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006 In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration [504] [505] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived US president, surpassing George H W Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days [506] He is also the oldest of the few U.S presidents to have been born in a hospital, all of whom are alive as of 2024 [507] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage [508] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home [509]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him [516] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner [517] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\" [518] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates [519] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid [520]\n\n\nPublic opinion\nIn exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him [516] By comparison, Carter was

Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984 [145] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986 [542] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a  National Historic Site [543] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park [544] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University, [545] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society [546] In 1998, the U.S Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer [547]\n\n\nSee

Do middle- and working-class African-Americans have different interests and needs? Do all oppressed peoples have something in common?\" This is a look at the ways that oppressed groups may share in their oppression but also have different needs and values that need to be analyzed differently It is a question of how groups can be essentialized or are unable to be essentialized [41] [81] [further explanation needed]\n\n\nStructural determinism, and race, sex, class, and their intersections\nThis refers to the exploration of how \"the structure of legal thought or culture influences its content\" in a way that determines social outcomes [41] [86] Delgado and Stefancic cited \"empathic fallacy\" as one example of structural determinism—the \"idea that our system, by reason of its structure and vocabulary, cannot redress certain types of wrong.\" [87] They interrogate the absence of terms such as intersectionality, anti-essentialism, and jury nullification in standard legal reference research tools in law libraries [88]\n\n\nCultural nationalism/separatism\nThis refers to the exploration of more radical views that argue for separation and reparations as a form of foreign aid (including black nationalism) [41] [example  needed]\n\n\nLegal institutions, critical pedagogy, and minorities in the bar\nCamara Phyllis Jones defines institutionalized racism as \"differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized and often manifests as inherited disadvantage It is structural, having been absorbed into our institutions of custom, practice, and law, so there need not be an identifiable offender Indeed, institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need, manifesting itself both in material conditions and in access to power With regard to the former, examples include differential access to quality education, sound housing, gainful employment, appropriate medical facilities, and a clean environment.\" [89]\n\n\nBlack–white binary\nThe black–white binary is a paradigm identified by legal scholars through which racial issues and histories are typically articulated within a racial binary between black and white Americans The binary largely governs how race has been portrayed and addressed throughout US history [90] Critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic argue that anti-discrimination law has blindspots for non-black minorities due to its language being confined within the black–white binary [91]\n\n\nApplications and adaptations\nScholars of critical race theory have focused, with some particularity, on the issues of hate crime and hate speech In response to the opinion of the US Supreme Court in the hate speech case of R.A.V v City of St Paul (1992), in which the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance as applied to a teenager who had burned a cross, Mari Matsuda and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had paid insufficient attention to the history of racist speech and the actual injury produced by such speech [92]\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough the terminology critical race theory began in its application to laws, the subject emerges from the broader frame of critical theory in how it analyzes power structures in society despite whatever laws may be in effect [29] In the 1998 article, \"Critical Race Theory: Past, Present, and Future\", Delgado and Stefancic trace the origins of CRT to the early writings of Derrick Albert Bell Jr including his 1976 Yale Law Journal article, \"Serving Two Masters\" [100] and his 1980 Harvard Law Review article entitled \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\" [101] [102]\n\n\nEarly years\nAlthough the terminology critical race theory began in its application to laws, the subject emerges from the broader

article entitled \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\" [101] [102]\n\n\nEmergence as a movement\nIn 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, and Stephanie Phillips organized a workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison entitled \"New Developments in Critical Race Theory\" The organizers coined the term \"Critical Race Theory\" to signify an \"intersection of critical theory and race, racism and the law.\" [21]\n\n\nPhilosophical foundations\nCRT scholars draw on the work of Antonio Gramsci, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and W E B DuBois Bell shared Paul Robeson's belief that \"Black self-reliance and African cultural continuity should form the epistemic basis of Blacks' worldview.\" [139]\nTheir writing is also informed by the 1960s and 1970s movements such as Black Power, Chicano, and radical feminism [22] Critical race theory shares many intellectual commitments with critical theory, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, and postcolonial theory University of Connecticut philosopher, Lewis Gordon, who has focused on postcolonial phenomenology, and race and racism, wrote that CRT is notable for its use of postmodern poststructural scholarship, including an emphasis on \"subaltern\" or \"marginalized\" communities and the \"use of alternative methodology in the expression of theoretical work, most notably their use of \"narratives\" and other literary techniques\" [140]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, aspects of CRT have been criticized by \"legal scholars and jurists from across the political spectrum.\" [17] Criticism of CRT has focused on its emphasis on storytelling, its critique of the merit principle and of objective truth, and its thesis of the voice of color [148] As reported by Britannica, critics say it contains a \"postmodernist-inspired skepticism of objectivity and truth\" and has a tendency to interpret \"any racial inequity or imbalance .. as proof of institutional racism and as grounds for directly imposing racially equitable outcomes in those realms\" Proponents of CRT have also been accused of treating even well-meaning criticism of CRT as evidence of latent racism [17]\n\n\nAcademic criticism\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, aspects of CRT have been criticized by \"legal scholars and jurists from across the political

racism and as grounds for directly imposing racially equitable outcomes in those realms\" Proponents of CRT have also been accused of treating even well-meaning criticism of CRT as evidence of latent racism [17]\n\n\nPublic controversies\nCritical race theory has stirred controversy in the United States for promoting the use of narrative in legal studies, advocating \"legal instrumentalism\" as opposed to ideal-driven uses of the law, and encouraging legal scholars to promote racial equity [155]\n\n\n2020s challenges\nSince 2020, efforts have been made by conservatives and others to challenge critical race theory (CRT) being taught in schools in the United States Following the 2020 protests of the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, as well as the killing of Breonna Taylor, school districts began to introduce additional curricula and create diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-positions to address \"disparities stemming from race, economics, disabilities and other factors\" [169] These measures were met with criticism from conservatives, particularly those in the Republican Party Critics have described these criticisms to be part of a cycle of backlash against what they view as progress toward racial equality and equity [170]\n\n\nSubfields\nWithin critical race theory, various sub-groupings focus on issues and nuances unique to particular ethno-racial and/or marginalized communities This includes the intersection of race with disability, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, or religion For example, disability critical race studies (DisCrit), critical race feminism (CRF), Jewish Critical Race Theory (HebCrit, [173] pronounced \"Heeb\"), Black Critical Race Theory (Black Crit), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit [174]), Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit [175]), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit [176]), Quantitative Critical Race Theory (QuantCrit [177]), Queer Critical Race Theory (QueerCrit [178]), and American Indian critical race studies or Tribal critical race theory (sometimes called TribalCrit [175]) CRT methodologies have also been applied to the study of white immigrant groups [179] CRT has spurred some scholars to call for a second wave of whiteness studies, which is now a small offshoot known as Second Wave Whiteness (SWW) [180] Critical race theory has also begun to spawn research that looks at understandings of race outside the United States [181] [182]\n\n\nDisability critical race theory\nAnother offshoot field is disability critical race studies (DisCrit), which combines disability studies and CRT to focus on the intersection of disability and race [183]\n\n\nLatino critical race theory\nLatino critical race theory (LatCRT or LatCrit) is a research framework that outlines the social construction of race as central to how people of color are constrained and oppressed in society Race scholars developed LatCRT as a critical response to the \"problem of the color line\" first explained by W E B Du Bois [184] While CRT focuses on the Black–White paradigm, LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos, as well as Latinos/as, Asians, Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.\n\n\nAsian critical race theory\nAsian critical race theory looks at the influence of race and racism on Asian Americans and their experiences in the US education system [189] Like Latino critical race theory, Asian critical race theory is distinct from the main body of CRT in its emphasis on immigration theory and policy [187]\n\n\nTribal critical race theory\nCritical Race Theory evolved in the 1970s in response to Critical Legal Studies [190] Tribal Critical Theory (TribalCrit) focuses on stories and values oral data as a primary source of information [190] TribalCrit builds on the idea that White supremacy and imperialism underpin US policies toward Indigenous peoples [190] In contrast with CRT, it argues that colonization rather than racism is endemic to society [190] A key tenet of TribalCrit is that Indigenous people exist within a US society that both politicizes and racializes them, placing them in a \"liminal space\" where Indigenous self-representation is at odds with how others perceive them [190] TribalCrit argues that ideas of culture, information, and power take on new importance when inspected through a Native lens [190] TribalCrit rejects goals of assimilation in US educational institutions, and argues that understanding the lived realities of Indigenous peoples is dependent on comprehending tribal philosophies, beliefs, traditions, and visions for the future [190]\n\n\nCritical philosophy of race\nThe Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) is inspired by both Critical Legal Studies and Critical Race Theory's use of interdisciplinary scholarship Both CLS and CRT explore the covert nature of mainstream use of \"apparently neutral concepts, such as merit or freedom.\"

1970s as a critique of the existing legal order from a race-based point of view. It is a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order that emphasizes the role of race in shaping the experiences of people of color. CRT is a response to the legacy of racism and the ongoing struggle for racial justice in the United States.\n\n## Definitions\n\nIn his introduction to the comprehensive 1995 publication of critical race theory's key writings, Cornel West described CRT as \"an intellectual movement that is both particular to our postmodern (and conservative) times and part of a long tradition of human resistance and liberation.\" Law professor Roy L Brooks defined critical race theory in 1994 as \"a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view.\"\n\n## Tenets\n\nScholars of CRT say that race is not \"biologically grounded and natural\"; rather, it is a socially constructed category used to oppress and exploit people of color. They argue that racism is not an aberration, but a normalized feature of American society. According to CRT, negative stereotypes assigned to members of minority groups benefit white people and increase racial oppression. Individuals can belong to a number of different identity groups, and the concept of intersectionality, one of CRT's main concepts, was introduced by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw.\n\n## Common themes\n\nRichard Delgado and Jean Stefancic published an annotated bibliography of CRT references in 1993, listing works of legal scholarship that addressed one or more of the following themes: critique of liberalism, storytelling/counterstorytelling and \"naming one's own reality\", revisionist interpretations of American civil rights law and progress, a greater understanding of the underpinnings of race and racism, structural determinism, race, sex, class, and their intersections, essentialism and anti-essentialism, cultural nationalism/separatism, legal institutions, critical pedagogy, and minorities in the bar.\n\n## Critique of liberalism\n\nThe first and foremost theme to CRT legal scholars in 1993 was their \"discontent\" with the way in which liberalism addressed race issues in the US. They critiqued \"liberal jurisprudence\", including affirmative action, color-blindness, role modeling, and the merit principle. Specifically, they claimed that the liberal concept of value-neutral law contributed to maintenance of the US's racially unjust social order.\n\n## Storytelling/counterstorytelling and \"naming one's own reality\"\n\nThis refers to the use of narrative (storytelling) to illuminate and explore lived experiences of racial oppression. Standpoint epistemology is the view that members of racial minority groups have a unique authority and ability to speak about racism. This is seen as undermining dominant narratives relating to racial inequality, such as legal neutrality and personal responsibility or bootstrapping, through valuable first-hand accounts of the experience of racism.\n\n## Revisionist interpretations of American civil rights law and progress\n\nInterest convergence is a concept introduced by Derrick Bell in his 1980 Harvard Law Review article, \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\". In this article, Bell described how he re-assessed the impact of the hundreds of NAACP LDF de-segregation cases he won from 1960 to 1966, and how he began to believe that in spite of his sincerity at the time, anti-discrimination law had not resulted in improving Black children's access to quality education.\n\n## Intersectional theory\n\nThis refers to the examination of race, sex, class, national origin, and sexual orientation, and how their intersections play out in various settings. These intersections provide a more holistic picture for evaluating different groups of people. Intersectionality is a response to identity politics insofar as identity politics does not take into account the different intersections of people's identities.\n\n## Essentialism vs. anti-essentialism\n\nDelgado and Stefancic write, \"Scholars who write about these issues are concerned with the appropriate unit for analysis: Is the black community one, or many, communities?

Race scholars developed LatCRT as a critical response to the \"problem of the color line\" first explained by W E B Du Bois.\n\n## Asian critical race theory\n\nAsian critical race theory looks at the influence of race and racism on Asian Americans and their experiences in the US education system. Like Latino critical race theory, Asian critical race theory is distinct from the main body of CRT in its emphasis on immigration theory and policy.\n\n## Tribal critical race theory\n\nCritical Race Theory evolved in the 1970s in response to Critical Legal Studies. Tribal Critical Theory (TribalCrit) focuses on stories and values oral data as a primary source of information. TribalCrit builds on the idea that White supremacy and imperialism underpin US policies toward Indigenous peoples. In contrast with CRT, it argues that colonization rather than racism is endemic to society.\n\n## Critical philosophy of race\n\nThe Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) is inspired by both Critical Legal Studies and Critical Race Theory's use of interdisciplinary scholarship. Both CLS and CRT explore the covert nature of mainstream use of \"apparently neutral concepts, such as merit or freedom\".", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Critical_race_theory\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinitions\nIn his introduction to the comprehensive 1995 publication of critical race theory's key writings, Cornel West described CRT as \"an intellectual movement that is both particular to our postmodern (and conservative) times and part of a long tradition of human resistance and liberation.\" [29] Law professor Roy L Brooks defined critical race theory in 1994 as \"a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view\" [30]\n\n\nTenets\nScholars of CRT say that race is not \"biologically grounded and natural\"; [9] [10] rather, it is a socially constructed category used to oppress and exploit people of color; [35] and that racism is not an aberration, [36] but a normalized feature of American society [35] \nAccording to CRT, negative stereotypes assigned to members of minority groups benefit white people [35] and increase racial oppression [37]\nIndividuals can belong to a number of different identity groups [35] The concept of intersectionality—one of CRT's main concepts—was introduced by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw [38]\n\n\nCommon themes\nRichard Delgado and Jean Stefancic published an annotated bibliography of CRT references in 1993, listing works of legal scholarship that addressed one or more of the following themes: \"critique of liberalism\"; \"storytelling/counterstorytelling and 'naming one's own reality'\"; \"revisionist interpretations of American civil rights law and progress\"; \"a greater understanding of the underpinnings of race and racism\"; \"structural determinism\"; \"race, sex, class, and their intersections\"; \"essentialism and anti-essentialism\"; \"cultural nationalism/separatism\"; \"legal institutions, critical pedagogy, and minorities in the bar\"; and \"criticism and self-criticism\" [41] When Gloria Ladson-Billings introduced CRT into education in 1995, she cautioned that its application required a \"thorough analysis of the legal literature upon which it is based\" [33]\n\n\nCritique of liberalism\n\nFirst and foremost to CRT legal scholars in 1993 was their \"discontent\" with the way in which liberalism addressed race issues in the US They critiqued \"liberal jurisprudence\", including affirmative action, [42] color-blindness, role modeling, and the merit principle [43] Specifically, they claimed that the liberal concept of value-neutral law contributed to maintenance of the US's racially unjust social order [15]\n\nStorytelling/counterstorytelling and \"naming one's own reality\"\n\nThis refers to the use of narrative (storytelling) to illuminate and explore lived experiences of racial oppression [41]\n\nStandpoint epistemology\nThis is the view that members of racial minority groups have a unique authority and ability to speak about racism This is seen as undermining dominant narratives relating to racial inequality, such as legal neutrality and personal responsibility or bootstrapping, through valuable first-hand accounts of the experience of racism [67]\n\n\nRevisionist interpretations of American civil rights law and progress\nInterest convergence is a concept introduced by Derrick Bell in his 1980 Harvard Law Review article, \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\" [68] In this article, Bell described how he re-assessed the impact of the hundreds of NAACP LDF de-segregation cases he won from 1960 to 1966, and how he began to believe that in spite of his sincerity at the time, anti-discrimination law had not resulted in improving Black children's access to quality education [69] He listed and described how Supreme Court cases had gutted civil rights legislation, which had resulted in African-American students continuing to attend all-black schools that lacked adequate funding and resources [68] In examining these Supreme Court cases, Bell concluded that the only civil-rights legislation that was passed coincided with the self-interest of white people, which Bell termed interest convergence [68] [70] [71]\n\n\nIntersectional theory\nThis refers to the examination of race, sex, class, national origin, and sexual orientation, and how their intersections play out in various settings, such as how the needs of a Latina are different from those of a Black male, and whose needs are promoted [41] [79] [further explanation needed] These intersections provide a more holistic picture for evaluating different groups of people Intersectionality is a response to identity politics insofar as identity politics does not take into account the different intersections of people's identities [80]\n\n\nEssentialism vs. anti-essentialism\nDelgado and Stefancic write, \"Scholars who write about these issues are concerned with the appropriate unit for analysis: Is the black community one, or many, communities? Do middle- and working-class African-Americans have different interests and needs? Do all oppressed peoples have something in common?\" This is a look at the ways that oppressed groups may share in their oppression but also have different needs and values that need to be analyzed differently It is a question of how groups can be essentialized or are unable to be essentialized [41] [81] [further explanation needed]\n\n\nStructural determinism, and race, sex, class, and their intersections\nThis refers to the exploration of how \"the structure of legal thought or culture influences its content\" in a way that determines social outcomes [41] [86] Delgado and Stefancic cited \"empathic fallacy\" as one example of structural determinism—the \"idea that our system, by reason of its structure and vocabulary, cannot redress certain types of wrong.\" [87] They interrogate the absence of terms such as intersectionality, anti-essentialism, and jury nullification in standard legal reference research tools in law libraries [88]\n\n\nCultural nationalism/separatism\nThis refers to the exploration of more radical views that argue for separation and reparations as a form of foreign aid (including black nationalism) [41] [example  needed]\n\n\nLegal institutions, critical pedagogy, and minorities in the bar\nCamara Phyllis Jones defines institutionalized racism as \"differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized and often manifests as inherited disadvantage It is structural, having been absorbed into our institutions of custom, practice, and law, so there need not be an identifiable offender Indeed, institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need, manifesting itself both in material conditions and in access to power With regard to the former, examples include differential access to quality education, sound housing, gainful employment, appropriate medical facilities, and a clean environment.\" [89]\n\n\nBlack–white binary\nThe black–white binary is a paradigm identified by legal scholars through which racial issues and histories are typically articulated within a racial binary between black and white Americans The binary largely governs how race has been portrayed and addressed throughout US history [90] Critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic argue that anti-discrimination law has blindspots for non-black minorities due to its language being confined within the black–white binary [91]\n\n\nApplications and adaptations\nScholars of critical race theory have focused, with some particularity, on the issues of hate crime and hate speech In response to the opinion of the US Supreme Court in the hate speech case of R.A.V v City of St Paul (1992), in which the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance as applied to a teenager who had burned a cross, Mari Matsuda and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had paid insufficient attention to the history of racist speech and the actual injury produced by such speech [92]\n\n\nHistory\nAlthough the terminology critical race theory began in its application to laws, the subject emerges from the broader frame of critical theory in how it analyzes power structures in society despite whatever laws may be in effect [29] In the 1998 article, \"Critical Race Theory: Past, Present, and Future\", Delgado and Stefancic trace the origins of CRT to the early writings of Derrick Albert Bell Jr including his 1976 Yale Law Journal article, \"Serving Two Masters\" [100] and his 1980 Harvard Law Review article entitled \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\" [101] [102]\n\n\nEarly years\nAlthough the terminology critical race theory began in its application to laws, the subject emerges from the broader frame of critical theory in how it analyzes power structures in society despite whatever laws may be in effect [29] In the 1998 article, \"Critical Race Theory: Past, Present, and Future\", Delgado and Stefancic trace the origins of CRT to the early writings of Derrick Albert Bell Jr including his 1976 Yale Law Journal article, \"Serving Two Masters\" [100] and his 1980 Harvard Law Review article entitled \"Brown v Board of Education and the Interest-Convergence Dilemma\" [101] [102]\n\n\nEmergence as a movement\nIn 1989, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, and Stephanie Phillips organized a workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison entitled \"New Developments in Critical Race Theory\" The organizers coined the term \"Critical Race Theory\" to signify an \"intersection of critical theory and race, racism and the law.\" [21]\n\n\nPhilosophical foundations\nCRT scholars draw on the work of Antonio Gramsci, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and W E B DuBois Bell shared Paul Robeson's belief that \"Black self-reliance and African cultural continuity should form the epistemic basis of Blacks' worldview.\" [139]\nTheir writing is also informed by the 1960s and 1970s movements such as Black Power, Chicano, and radical feminism [22] Critical race theory shares many intellectual commitments with critical theory, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, and postcolonial theory University of Connecticut philosopher, Lewis Gordon, who has focused on postcolonial phenomenology, and race and racism, wrote that CRT is notable for its use of postmodern poststructural scholarship, including an emphasis on \"subaltern\" or \"marginalized\" communities and the \"use of alternative methodology in the expression of theoretical work, most notably their use of \"narratives\" and other literary techniques\" [140]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, aspects of CRT have been criticized by \"legal scholars and jurists from across the political spectrum.\" [17] Criticism of CRT has focused on its emphasis on storytelling, its critique of the merit principle and of objective truth, and its thesis of the voice of color [148] As reported by Britannica, critics say it contains a \"postmodernist-inspired skepticism of objectivity and truth\" and has a tendency to interpret \"any racial inequity or imbalance .. as proof of institutional racism and as grounds for directly imposing racially equitable outcomes in those realms\" Proponents of CRT have also been accused of treating even well-meaning criticism of CRT as evidence of latent racism [17]\n\n\nAcademic criticism\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, aspects of CRT have been criticized by \"legal scholars and jurists from across the political spectrum.\" [17] Criticism of CRT has focused on its emphasis on storytelling, its critique of the merit principle and of objective truth, and its thesis of the voice of color [148] As reported by Britannica, critics say it contains a \"postmodernist-inspired skepticism of objectivity and truth\" and has a tendency to interpret \"any racial inequity or imbalance .. as proof of institutional racism and as grounds for directly imposing racially equitable outcomes in those realms\" Proponents of CRT have also been accused of treating even well-meaning criticism of CRT as evidence of latent racism [17]\n\n\nPublic controversies\nCritical race theory has stirred controversy in the United States for promoting the use of narrative in legal studies, advocating \"legal instrumentalism\" as opposed to ideal-driven uses of the law, and encouraging legal scholars to promote racial equity [155]\n\n\n2020s challenges\nSince 2020, efforts have been made by conservatives and others to challenge critical race theory (CRT) being taught in schools in the United States Following the 2020 protests of the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, as well as the killing of Breonna Taylor, school districts began to introduce additional curricula and create diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-positions to address \"disparities stemming from race, economics, disabilities and other factors\" [169] These measures were met with criticism from conservatives, particularly those in the Republican Party Critics have described these criticisms to be part of a cycle of backlash against what they view as progress toward racial equality and equity [170]\n\n\nSubfields\nWithin critical race theory, various sub-groupings focus on issues and nuances unique to particular ethno-racial and/or marginalized communities This includes the intersection of race with disability, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, or religion For example, disability critical race studies (DisCrit), critical race feminism (CRF), Jewish Critical Race Theory (HebCrit, [173] pronounced \"Heeb\"), Black Critical Race Theory (Black Crit), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit [174]), Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit [175]), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit [176]), Quantitative Critical Race Theory (QuantCrit [177]), Queer Critical Race Theory (QueerCrit [178]), and American Indian critical race studies or Tribal critical race theory (sometimes called TribalCrit [175]) CRT methodologies have also been applied to the study of white immigrant groups [179] CRT has spurred some scholars to call for a second wave of whiteness studies, which is now a small offshoot known as Second Wave Whiteness (SWW) [180] Critical race theory has also begun to spawn research that looks at understandings of race outside the United States [181] [182]\n\n\nDisability critical race theory\nAnother offshoot field is disability critical race studies (DisCrit), which combines disability studies and CRT to focus on the intersection of disability and race [183]\n\n\nLatino critical race theory\nLatino critical race theory (LatCRT or LatCrit) is a research framework that outlines the social construction of race as central to how people of color are constrained and oppressed in society Race scholars developed LatCRT as a critical response to the \"problem of the color line\" first explained by W E B Du Bois [184] While CRT focuses on the Black–White paradigm, LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos, as well as Latinos/as, Asians, Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.\n\n\nAsian critical race theory\nAsian critical race theory looks at the influence of race and racism on Asian Americans and their experiences in the US education system [189] Like Latino critical race theory, Asian critical race theory is distinct from the main body of CRT in its emphasis on immigration theory and policy [187]\n\n\nTribal critical race theory\nCritical Race Theory evolved in the 1970s in response to Critical Legal Studies [190] Tribal Critical Theory (TribalCrit) focuses on stories and values oral data as a primary source of information [190] TribalCrit builds on the idea that White supremacy and imperialism underpin US policies toward Indigenous peoples [190] In contrast with CRT, it argues that colonization rather than racism is endemic to society [190] A key tenet of TribalCrit is that Indigenous people exist within a US society that both politicizes and racializes them, placing them in a \"liminal space\" where Indigenous self-representation is at odds with how others perceive them [190] TribalCrit argues that ideas of culture, information, and power take on new importance when inspected through a Native lens [190] TribalCrit rejects goals of assimilation in US educational institutions, and argues that understanding the lived realities of Indigenous peoples is dependent on comprehending tribal philosophies, beliefs, traditions, and visions for the future [190]\n\n\nCritical philosophy of race\nThe Critical Philosophy of Race (CPR) is inspired by both Critical Legal Studies and Critical Race Theory's use of interdisciplinary scholarship Both CLS and CRT explore the covert nature of mainstream use of \"apparently neutral concepts, such as merit or freedom.\"

the unicameral legislature of West Bengal, not a permanent body, and subject to dissolution [6] The assembly term lasts for five years unless it is dissolved earlier Members of the Legislative Assembly are directly elected by the people, and the tenure of the Sixteenth West Bengal Legislative Assembly was scheduled to end on 30 May 2021 [7]\n\n\nElectoral system\nOutlined in Article 168 of the Constitution of India, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly is the only house of the unicameral legislature of West Bengal, not a permanent body, and subject to dissolution [6] The assembly term lasts for five years unless it is dissolved earlier Members of the Legislative Assembly are directly elected by the people, and the tenure of the Sixteenth West Bengal Legislative Assembly was scheduled to end on 30 May 2021 [7]\n\n\nPrevious general election\nIn the 2016 election, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC or TMC) retained its majority in the Legislative Assembly with 211 seats The Indian National Congress won 44 seats and the Left Front won 33 seats from their alliance, while the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha won 3 seats each out of the total 294 seats [8]\n\n\nPolitical developments\nSince the by-elections held for the Kanthi South seat in 2017, it became evident that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had overtaken the Left Front as the primary opposition party in the state [9] According to various political analysts, the shifting of the Left Front and other opposition voters towards the BJP caused the party's vote share to significantly increase [10] [11] In spite of widespread violence, the BJP emerged as the second largest party in the 2018 elections to the state panchayats mainly due to the shifting of the Left Front's voter base The long-held stereotype of Bengali Hindus being averse to right-wing politics was shattered when the BJP won the 2018 assembly elections in Tripura, another Indian state with a Bengali Hindu majority, ruled till then by CPI(M)-led alliance of Communist parties since 1993.\n\n\nPolitical issues\nThe pandemic became an election issue [29] [30] The government was accused of \"fudging\" the count of positive cases and deaths in the region, [31] and the AITC-led state government and BJP-led union government blamed each other for the surge in COVID-19 infections over the course of the campaign [32]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe pandemic became an election issue [29] [30] The government was accused of \"fudging\" the count of positive cases and deaths in the region, [31] and the AITC-led state government and BJP-led union government blamed each other for the surge in COVID-19 infections over the course of the campaign [32]\n\n\nCyclone Amphan\nIn May 2020, a year before the 2021 elections, Cyclone Amphan hit the state [37] [29] After it passed, widespread allegations of mismanagement [38] and relief scam were reported [39] [40] Protests broke out in some districts over the allegations, [41] [42] and the opposition made it an election issue ahead of the Assembly polls [43] [44]\n\n\nCitizenship, immigration and refugee issues\nIn 2019, the BJP-led Union Government passed the CAA in Parliament, promising citizenship to immigrants and refugees belonging to religious minorities in Bangladesh, and providing them with rehabilitation [9] [45] The BJP's Bengali booklet released in January 2020 claimed that the National Register of Citizens was implemented to identify allegedly undocumented illegal Muslim immigrants, but religiously persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains, Parsi, and other religious minorities would be \"shielded\" by the CAA [46] [47]\n\n\nOther issues\nPolarisation amongst various religious, linguistic, and caste communities were also likely to play a role in this election [48] Both TMC and BJP had promised schemes for various communities [49] [50] Although previously mobilized by Left governments against elites under the \"class\" narrative, the Dalits of West Bengal began to assert their identity politically [51] [52] [53] Religious polarization is particularly intense in districts bordering Bangladesh, such as North 24 Parganas Arguments regarding who are native to the state and constituencies were also likely to impact the elections [54] [55] [56] Dissatisfaction and defection of many TMC leaders to BJP, allegedly due to rising influence of Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor in party administration was also likely to impact the elections [57]\n\n\nSchedule\nThe election schedule was announced on 26 February 2021, and the election was held in eight phases from 27 March 2021 to 29 April 2021 Votes were counted on 2 May 2021 [70] [71] On the day of announcement, the ECI declared that physically disabled and elderly voters would get the benefit of postal voting and the time limit for voting was extended by one hour [72] [73] Due to polling abnormalities, re-polling for booth number 88 in Jangipara was held in the fourth phase [74] The elections in Jangipur and Samserganj were adjourned due to the death of the INC candidate in Samserganj and Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) candidate in Jangipur [75] Polling for these two seats was originally rescheduled to 13 May 2021, [76] but as that day was Eid, it was pushed back to 16 May [77] Later on ECI adjourned polling for both constituencies and it took place on 30 September [78] Repolling at the Amtali Madhyamik Siksha Kendra polling station in Sitalkuchi was conducted on 29 April, after CISF personnel were fired on 10 April [79]\n\n\nParties and alliances\nBoth factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) expressed support for TMC in the assembly election [82] TMC allotted three seats in the Darjeeling to GJM, but its two factions, namely Bimal and Binoy, declared fielding their candidates in each of the three seats [83] RJD, Shiv Sena, and JMM also endorsed Trinamool for the election [84] [85] [86] TMC supported Independent candidate in Joypur after their candidate's nomination was cancelled [87] [88]\n\n\nAll India Trinamool Congress +\nBoth factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) expressed support for TMC in the assembly election [82] TMC allotted three seats in the Darjeeling to GJM, but its two factions, namely Bimal and Binoy, declared fielding their candidates in each of the three seats [83] RJD, Shiv Sena, and JMM also endorsed Trinamool for the election [84] [85] [86] TMC supported Independent candidate in Joypur after their candidate's nomination was cancelled [87] [88]\n\n\nSanjukta Morcha\nOn 28 January 2021 Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury announced that seat-sharing talks between the Congress and Left Front had concluded for 193 seats and that the remaining 101 seats would be decided at a later point [89] [90] Out of the 193 seats agreed upon by 28 January 92 went to Congress and 101 to the Left Front [89] Left Front &  Congress announced from a rally at the Brigade Parade ground on 28 February 2021 that they would form an alliance called Sanyukta Morcha with a newly-formed outfit called ISF [91] ISF initially claimed that they secured 30 seats from the Left Front's quota [92] After the final seat sharing agreement was concluded, it was announced that the Left Front would contest 165 seats, Congress 92 seats, and ISF 37 seats [93] [94]\n\n\nNational Democratic Alliance\nFive hill-based parties pledged support to BJP ahead of the assembly election: Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), Gorkhaland Rajya Nirman Morcha, and SUMETI Mukti Morcha [82] Hindu Samhati, a right-wing organisation in West Bengal, had withdrawn their support from the BJP at first [106] to contest the elections on their own, [107] but eventually they supported the BJP [108] BJP allotted the Amta constituency seat to the president of Hindu Samhati to contest under the symbol of BJP [109]\n\n\nOthers\nShiv Sena initially said that they would contest in around 100 seats, [112] but later on 4 March 2021 announced that they would not contest and would support Mamata Banerjee and TMC [113]\n\n\nCandidates\nOn 27 March, the ECI banned the publication of surveys and exit polls until 7:30 pm on 29 April to prevent influencing voters, [126] [127] but the ban ended half an hour earlier [128]\n\n\nSurveys and polls\nOn 27 March, the ECI banned the publication of surveys and exit polls until 7:30 pm on 29 April to prevent influencing voters, [126] [127] but

polls contradicted each other regarding the possible outcome [162]\n\n\nElection\nThe ECI issued various health guidelines for conducting the elections, including the use of masks, sanitisation of the polling booths, use of thermal scanners before entering the polling booths, maintaining social distancing, and so forth [187] The maximum number of voters for each polling station was lowered to 1000 from 1500 [188]\n\n\nCOVID-19 guidelines\nThe ECI issued various health guidelines for conducting the elections, including the use of masks, sanitisation of the polling booths, use of thermal scanners before entering the polling booths, maintaining social distancing, and so forth [187] The maximum number of voters for each polling station was lowered to 1000 from 1500 [188]\n\n\nSecurity preparations\nAfter several instances of violence, threats, and murders before the polls were announced, the ECI and the Home Ministry ordered twelve companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to be deployed in West Bengal on 20 February At least 125 more CAPF troops were dispatched to reach West Bengal on 25 February to focus on sensitive zones [194] 60 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), 30 companies of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), 25 companies of the Border Security Force (BSF) and five companies each of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) [195] The total number of central forces rose to 725, [196] [197] before a final total of 1,000 companies after the third phase of polling [198]\n\n\nVoting\nThe

The election was the 15th general assembly election in the state since its formation in 1952.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe West Bengal Legislative Assembly is the unicameral legislature of West Bengal, not a permanent body, and subject to dissolution. The assembly term lasts for five years unless it is dissolved earlier. Members of the Legislative Assembly are directly elected by the people.\n\n**Electoral System**\n\nThe electoral system in West Bengal is based on the first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the seat. The state has a total of 294 constituencies, with the majority required to win 148 seats.\n\n**Previous General Election**\n\nIn the 2016 election, the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC or TMC) retained its majority in the Legislative Assembly with 211 seats. The Indian National Congress won 44 seats, and the Left Front won 33 seats from their alliance. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) won 3 seats each.\n\n**Political Developments**\n\nSince the by-elections held for the Kanthi South seat in 2017, the BJP had overtaken the Left Front as the primary opposition party in the state. The shifting of the Left Front and other opposition voters towards the BJP caused the party's vote share to significantly increase. In spite of widespread violence, the BJP emerged as the second-largest party in the 2018 elections to the state panchayats mainly due to the shifting of the Left Front's voter base.\n\n**Political Issues**\n\nThe pandemic became an election issue, with the government accused of \"fudging\" the count of positive cases and deaths in the region. The AITC-led state government and BJP-led union government blamed each other for the surge in COVID-19 infections over the course of the campaign.\n\n**COVID-19**\n\nThe pandemic became an election issue, with the government accused of \"fudging\" the count of positive cases and deaths in the region. The AITC-led state government and BJP-led union government blamed each other for the surge in COVID-19 infections over the course of the campaign.\n\n**Cyclone Amphan**\n\nIn May 2020, a year before the 2021 elections, Cyclone Amphan hit the state. After it passed, widespread allegations of mismanagement and relief scam were reported. Protests broke out in some districts over the allegations, and the opposition made it an election issue ahead of the Assembly polls.\n\n**Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Issues**\n\nIn 2019, the BJP-led Union Government passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Parliament, promising citizenship to immigrants and refugees belonging to religious minorities in Bangladesh and providing them with rehabilitation. The BJP's Bengali booklet released in January 2020 claimed that the National Register of Citizens was implemented to identify allegedly undocumented illegal Muslim immigrants, but religiously persecuted Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains, Parsis, and other religious minorities would be \"shielded\" by the CAA.\n\n**Other Issues**\n\nPolarization amongst various religious, linguistic, and caste communities were also likely to play a role in this election. Both the TMC and the BJP had promised schemes for various communities. Although previously mobilized by Left governments against elites under the \"class\" narrative, the Dalits of West Bengal began to assert their identity politically. Religious polarization is particularly intense in districts bordering Bangladesh, such as North 24 Parganas. Arguments regarding who are native to the state and constituencies were also likely to impact the elections.\n\n**Schedule**\n\nThe election schedule was announced on 26 February 2021, and the election was held in eight phases from 27 March 2021 to 29 April 2021. Votes were counted on 2 May 2021.\n\n**Parties and Alliances**\n\nBoth factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) expressed support for the TMC in the assembly election. The TMC allotted three seats in the Darjeeling to GJM, but its two factions, namely Bimal and Binoy, declared fielding their candidates in each of the three seats. The RJD, Shiv Sena, and JMM also endorsed the TMC for the election.\n\n**Sanjukta Morcha**\n\nOn 28 January 2021, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury announced that seat-sharing talks between the Congress and the Left Front had concluded for 193 seats, and that the remaining 101 seats would be decided at a later point. Out of the 193 seats agreed upon by 28 January, 92 went to the Congress, and 101 to the Left Front. The Left Front and the Congress announced from a rally at the Brigade Parade ground on 28 February 2021 that they would form an alliance called Sanyukta Morcha with a newly-formed outfit called ISF.\n\n**National Democratic Alliance**\n\nFive hill-based parties pledged support to the BJP ahead of the assembly election: the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists, the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), the Gorkhaland Rajya Nirman Morcha, and the SUMETI Mukti Morcha. The Hindu Samhati, a right-wing organization in West Bengal, had withdrawn their support from the BJP at first to contest the elections on their own but eventually supported the BJP.\n\n**Other Parties**\n\nThe Shiv Sena initially said that they would contest in around 100 seats but later announced that they would not contest and would support the TMC.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nOn 27 March, the Election Commission of India (ECI) banned the publication of surveys and exit polls until 7:30 pm on 29 April to prevent influencing voters.\n\n**Voting**\n\nVoting took place in eight phases from 27 March to 29 April 2021. The maximum number of voters for each polling station was lowered to 1000 from 1500. The ECI issued various health guidelines for conducting the elections, including the use of masks, sanitisation of the polling booths, use of thermal scanners before entering the polling booths, maintaining social distancing, and so forth.\n\n**Security Preparations**\n\nAfter several instances of violence, threats, and murders before the polls were announced, the ECI and the Home Ministry ordered twelve companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to be deployed in West Bengal on 20 February. At least 125 more CAPF troops were dispatched to reach West Bengal on 25 February to focus on sensitive zones.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe election results for 292 constituencies were announced on 2 May 2021 after counting of votes began at 8:00 am (UTC+5:30), while the results for 2 constituencies were delayed until 3 October.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nThe election results for 292 constituencies were announced on 2 May 2021 after counting of votes began at 8:00 am (UTC+5:30), while the results for 2 constituencies were delayed until 3 October.\n\n**Results by Party**\n\nThe TMC won 213 seats, while the BJP won 77 seats.

The BJP won in some regions, including the South 24 Parganas district and the North Dinajpur district.\n\n**Constituency-wise Results**\n\nThe TMC won in most constituencies of West Bengal, including the seats in the Kolkata metropolitan area, the North 24 Parganas district, and the Howrah district. The BJP won in some constituencies, including the seats in the South 24 Parganas district and the North Dinajpur district.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe election was marred by several controversies, including allegations of rigging, violence, and intimidation. The opposition parties accused the TMC of using money and muscle power to influence the voters.\n\n**No Vote To BJP Campaign**\n\nThe \"No Vote To BJP\" campaign was a non-partisan, anti-BJP campaign in West Bengal. The campaign motto was \"We requested to all peoples of the West Bengal, vote for anyone in the election, but not vote for the BJP on the 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.\"\n\n**Nandigram Controversy**\n\nThe Nandigram controversy involved a speech made by Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Nandigram, where she announced that she would contest the upcoming assembly elections from Nandigram. Suvendu Adhikari responded by saying that he would defeat the CM by a margin of at least 50,000 votes or quit politics.\n\n**Reactions and Analysis**\n\nThe election results were widely analyzed by the media and political observers. Many commentators noted that the TMC's victory was a significant blow to the BJP's efforts to expand its presence in West Bengal.\n\n**Allegations of Partial Election Commission**\n\nPrashant Kishor, a prominent election strategist, accused the Election Commission of being partial and helping the BJP. He claimed that the ECI did everything to help the BJP, from allowing the use of religion to scheduling the poll and bending the rules.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election was followed by a period of violence and unrest in West Bengal. The opposition parties accused the TMC of using violence to suppress their supporters.\n\n**Government Formation**\n\nMamata Banerjee took an oath as the Chief Minister of West Bengal for the third time on 5 May 2021 at the Raj Bhawan in Kolkata. She expanded the cabinet on 10 May 2021 when 43 TMC leaders were sworn in as ministers.\n\n**Vacant Seats**\n\nTwo seats in West Bengal remained vacant after the election, due to the death of two candidates. The ECI deferred the elections in these constituencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Appointments**\n\nSisir Adhikari and his son Dibyendu Adhikari were granted Y+ category security by the Union Home Ministry.\n\n**2021 By-Polls**\n\nThe ECI deferred the elections in Samserganj and Jangipur constituencies due to the death of two candidates.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

WWE history [20] [21] Writing for Sports Illustrated, Bryan Alvarez described the match as \"boring\", calling it a \"pretty by-the-numbers generic Rumble\" as \"the most notable thing about the match was how quickly they were rushing everything to get the show off the air by midnight ET even though the history of the Royal Rumble has shown that fudging the intervals is not something WWE has ever avoided, and doing it here would have left more time for the big moments at the end.\" [22]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn the following episode of Raw, Ronda Rousey pondered which title to challenge for as she had heated history with both reigning champions After Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch confronted Rousey and demanded she make her choice that night, Rousey responded that she would reveal her choice

Lesnar revealed that he would be challenging Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 38 However, he also challenged Bobby Lashley to a rematch for the WWE Championship that night due to the controversial finish of their Royal Rumble match Lashley declined, however, WWE official Adam Pearce added Lesnar to the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins was also added to the Chamber match due to technically defeating Reigns at the Royal Rumble [26] Lesnar won the Elimination Chamber match to regain the WWE Championship, thus converting his Universal Championship match against Reigns at WrestleMania into a Winner Takes All match, [31] which was later stipulated as a Championship Unification match [32]\n\n\nSmackDown\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Drew McIntyre stated he would continue to target Happy Corbin and Madcap Moss due to them almost ending his career at Day 1, and a match between Moss and McIntyre was scheduled for Elimination Chamber, [27] which was later changed to a Falls Count Anywhere match [33]\n\n\nResults\n\n\nWomen's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations\n\n\nMen's Royal Rumble

It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, originally dubbed the \"Big Four\", and as of August 2021, it is considered one of the \"Big Five\", along with Money in the Bank. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\n\n**Storylines**\n\nThe event included six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n**Event**\n\nThe pay-per-view opened with Roman Reigns defending the Universal Championship against Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins, with The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) barred from ringside. Reigns entered first, followed by Rollins, who came out to The Shield's former entrance theme and gear and walking in through the crowd to taunt Reigns. Rollins drove Reigns through the announce table with a Powerbomb, followed by a Frog Splash on Reigns for a nearfall. Rollins attempted a Phoenix Splash, but Reigns moved out of the way. Rollins intercepted a Spear attempt and followed up with a Buckle Bomb and The Stomp on Reigns for a nearfall. Rollins attempted a second Stomp, but Reigns turned him inside out with a clothesline. Reigns performed a Powerbomb on Rollins for a nearfall, followed by a triangle choke, only for Reigns to counter into another Powerbomb. Outside the ring, Reigns sent Rollins into the timekeeper's area and into the steel ring steps. Reigns followed up with a Superman Punch on Rollins for a nearfall, then performed a Spear on Rollins outside the ring and looked to do so again back inside, but Rollins countered the move into a Pedigree on Reigns for a nearfall. In the closing moments, Reigns performed a second Spear on Rollins, who offered a fist bump to Reigns. Reigns then applied the guillotine choke on Rollins, who grabbed the rope to void the submission, but Reigns refused to release Rollins and was disqualified. Rollins won the match but Reigns retained the title, as they do not change hands by disqualification unless stipulated. Following the match, Reigns viciously assaulted Rollins with a steel chair.\n\n**Preliminary matches**\n\nThe men's Royal Rumble match for a men's world championship match at WrestleMania 38 was the main event of the pay-per-view. AJ Styles and Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura started the match, with Austin Theory entering at #3, followed by Robert Roode, who was eliminated by Styles. Ridge Holland entered his first Royal Rumble match at #5, after which Styles eliminated Nakamura. Montez Ford (#6) attempted to eliminate Theory, but was prevented from doing so. United States Champion Damian Priest entered at #7, Johnny Knoxville entered at #9 and went after Sami Zayn (#8), and Angelo Dawkins entered at #10. Omos entered at #11 and eliminated The Street Profits (Dawkins and Ford) and Priest before being eliminated by Styles, Theory, Raw Tag Team Champion Chad Gable (#13), Dominik Mysterio (#14), Ricochet (#12), and Holland. Happy Corbin (#15) managed to eliminate Ricochet before Dolph Ziggler entered at #16. Styles then eliminated Theory, followed by Holland. Sheamus (#17) went right after Styles before Rick Boogs (#18) eliminated Gable. Corbin then teamed with Madcap Moss (#19) to eliminate Styles, followed by Riddle entering at #20. Corbin and Moss eliminated Boogs before Drew McIntyre made a surprise return from injury at #21 and eliminated Corbin and Moss as revenge for them injuring him a few weeks earlier. Kevin Owens (#22) had a showdown with McIntyre, with Owens getting the better of it before Rey Mysterio entered at #23. Rey almost eliminated Riddle, but was laid out with a Stunner by Owens. Kofi Kingston (#24) went for a springboard move, but was shoved off the top rope by Owens, resulting in his elimination. Otis (#25) dominated Ziggler, McIntyre, and Riddle before Big E entered at #26. In his first appearance since WrestleMania 37, reggaeton singer Bad Bunny entered at #27 as a surprise entrant, followed by Shane McMahon, who also entered at #28 as a surprise entrant. Brock Lesnar then entered as the surprise #30 entrant and dominated everyone before eliminating Orton, Lesnar then performed an F-5 on Bad Bunny before eliminating him, bringing the final four to Lesnar, McIntyre, McMahon, and Riddle. Lesnar eliminated Riddle and McMahon before having a staredown with McIntyre, the same man who eliminated Lesnar in and won the men's Royal Rumble match two years earlier. The two traded blows, with Lesnar driving McIntyre in the corner. Lesnar attempted an F-5, but McIntyre countered and performed a Glasgow Kiss. McIntyre attempted a Claymore Kick, but Lesnar blocked and followed up with an F-5 over the top rope on McIntyre to win the match and earn a world championship match at WrestleMania 38, becoming the fourth person to win from the No 30 spot (after The Undertaker in 2007, John Cena in 2008, and Triple H in 2016). This made Lesnar the ninth two-time Royal Rumble winner, his first win being in 2003. This also made him the first person to lose their world championship and then win the eponymous match in the same night. Among the other multi-time Royal Rumble winners, Lesnar also set a record for the longest time between Royal Rumble wins at 19 years. He also set the record for the least amount of time spent in the Royal Rumble before winning it, being in the match for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, beating Edge's 2010 record by 5 minutes and 7 seconds.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe men's Royal Rumble match was widely panned by fans due to what they felt was a lack of surprises and star-power, with some listing it among the worst Royal Rumble matches in WWE history.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Ronda Rousey pondered which title to challenge for as she had heated history with both reigning champions. After Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch confronted Rousey and demanded she make her choice that night, Rousey responded that she would reveal her choice on SmackDown. There, Rousey announced that she would challenge Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 38. Also on the following episode of Raw, Brock Lesnar revealed that he would be challenging Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 38. However, he also challenged Bobby Lashley to a rematch for the WWE Championship that night due to the controversial finish of their Royal Rumble match. Lashley declined, however, WWE official Adam Pearce added Lesnar to the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins was also added to the Chamber match due to technically defeating Reigns at the Royal Rumble. Lesnar won the Elimination Chamber match to regain the WWE Championship, thus converting his Universal Championship match against Reigns at WrestleMania into a Winner Takes All match, which was later stipulated as a Championship Unification match. On the following episode of SmackDown, Drew McIntyre stated he would continue to target Happy Corbin and Madcap Moss due to them almost ending his career at Day 1, and a match between Moss and McIntyre was scheduled for Elimination Chamber, which was later changed to a Falls Count Anywhere match.\n\n**Results**\n\n* Women's Royal Rumble match entrances and eliminations:\n\t+ 1.

The website was created by Alexandra Elbakyan, a Kazakhstani scientist, in 2011. Sci-Hub has become a popular platform for researchers, students, and scientists worldwide, despite facing numerous lawsuits and challenges from academic publishers.\n\n**History**\n\nAlexandra Elbakyan was born in Kazakhstan in 1988. She earned her undergraduate degree at Kazakh National Technical University, studying information technology. After working for a computer security firm in Moscow, Elbakyan joined a research team at the University of Freiburg in Germany in 2010, where she worked on a brain–computer interface project. During her time in the United States, Elbakyan attended a transhumanism conference and completed a research internship at the Georgia Institute of Technology. These experiences likely influenced her interest in creating a platform that would provide access to scientific knowledge.\n\n**Legal Status**\n\nSci-Hub has faced numerous lawsuits from academic publishers, including Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley. The largest copyright infringement case filed in the United States and the world was brought against Sci-Hub by Elsevier in 2015. The lawsuit alleged that Sci-Hub violated copyright law and induced others to do the same. In response, Elbakyan denied any wrongdoing and claimed that Sci-Hub was a necessary platform for researchers and scientists. The lawsuit was ongoing at the time of writing.\n\n**United States**\n\nIn 2015, Elsevier filed a lawsuit against Sci-Hub in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit claimed that Sci-Hub had violated copyright law and induced others to do the same. Elbakyan responded by stating that Sci-Hub was a necessary platform for researchers and scientists. The lawsuit was ongoing at the time of writing.\n\n**Sweden**\n\nIn October 2018, a Swedish court ordered ISPs to block access to Sci-Hub after a lawsuit brought by Elsevier. In response, Bahnhof, a large Swedish ISP, blocked access to the Elsevier website. However, the Sci-Hub .se domain name was reported to have been taken down, but it was reinstated after successful \"ownership verification.\"\n\n**Russia**\n\nIn November 2018, Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media blocked Sci-Hub and its mirror websites after a Moscow City Court ruling to comply with Elsevier's and Springer Nature's complaints regarding intellectual property infringement. However, the website continued to operate under a new domain.\n\n**France**\n\nIn March 2019, a French court ordered French ISPs to block access to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis following a complaint by Elsevier and Springer Nature. However, the court order did not affect the academic network Renater, which provides access to Sci-Hub for French researchers.\n\n**Belgium**\n\nIn March 2019, Elsevier, Springer, John Wiley, and Cambridge University Press filed a complaint against Proximus, VOO, Brutélé, and Telenet to block access to Sci-Hub and LibGen. The publishers claimed to represent more than half of the scientific publishing sector and indicated that over 90% of the contents on the sites infringed copyright laws. The lawsuit was successful, and the sites were blocked by the ISPs.\n\n**India**\n\nIn December 2020, Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Sci-Hub and Library Genesis in the Delhi High Court. The plaintiffs sought a dynamic injunction, which would prevent Sci-Hub from changing its domain name or IP address. The court restricted the sites from uploading, publishing, or making any article available until January 6, 2021.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nIn February 2021, Elsevier and Springer Nature obtained an injunction on TalkTalk to block the sci-hub.se domain. City of London police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit issued a warning to students and universities against accessing the website, alleging that it could steal credentials and download potentially dangerous content.\n\n**Website**\n\nSci-Hub's operation is financed by user donations. The website's PHP code, setup of the Linux web servers, and maintenance are all done by Alexandra Elbakyan herself. Over the years, various URL addresses and direct IP addresses have been used for Sci-Hub, as dozens of domain names have been confiscated by legal authorities.\n\n**Article Sourcing**\n\nSci-Hub obtains paywalled articles using leaked credentials. The source of the credentials used by Sci-Hub is unclear. Some appear to have been donated, while others were possibly sold before going to Sci-Hub or obtained via phishing.\n\n**Delivery to Users**\n\nThe Sci-Hub website provides access to articles from almost all academic publishers, including Elsevier, Springer, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, American Chemical Society, Wiley Blackwell, and the Royal Society of Chemistry, as well as open-access works.

{"title": "Sinn_Féin", "content": "\nName\nThe phrase \"Sinn Féin\" is Irish for \"Ourselves\" or \"We Ourselves\", [25] [26] although it is frequently mistranslated as \"ourselves alone\" (from \"Sinn Féin Amháin\", an early-20th-century slogan) [27] The name is an assertion of Irish national sovereignty and self-determination, i.e., the Irish people governing themselves, rather than being part of a political union with Great Britain under the Westminster Parliament.\n\n\nHistory\nSinn Féin was founded on 28 November 1905, when, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, Arthur Griffith outlined the Sinn Féin policy, \"to establish in Ireland's capital a national legislature endowed with the moral authority of the Irish nation\" [26] [30] Its initial political platform was both conservative and monarchist, advocating for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy unified with the British Crown (inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) [31] [32] The party contested the 1908 North Leitrim by-election, where it secured 27% of the vote [33] Thereafter, both support and membership fell At its 1910 ard fheis (party conference) attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive [34]\n\n\n1905–1922\nSinn Féin was founded on 28 November 1905, when, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, Arthur Griffith outlined the Sinn Féin policy, \"to establish in Ireland's capital a national legislature endowed with the moral authority of the Irish nation\" [26] [30] Its initial political platform was both conservative and monarchist, advocating for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy unified with the British Crown (inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) [31] [32] The party contested the 1908 North Leitrim by-election, where it secured 27% of the vote [33] Thereafter, both support and membership fell At its 1910 ard fheis (party conference) attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive [34]\n\n\n1923–1970\nPro-Treaty Dáil deputies and other Treaty supporters formed a new party, Cumann na nGaedheal, on 27 April 1923 at a meeting in Dublin, where delegates agreed on a constitution and political programme [39] Cumann na nGaedheal went on to govern the new Irish Free State for nine years (it merged with two other organisations to form Fine Gael in 1933) [40] Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin members continued to boycott the Dáil At a special Ard Fheis in March 1926, de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the Dáil if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin; on 16 May 1926, he founded his own party, Fianna Fáil, which was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within its political structures He took most Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála (TDs) with him [41] De Valera's resignation meant also the loss of financial support from America [42] The rump Sinn Féin party could field no more than fifteen candidates, [43] and won only five seats in the June 1927 general election, a decline in support not seen since before 1916 [44] [45] Vice-president and de facto leader Mary MacSwiney announced that the party simply did not have the funds to contest the second election called that year, declaring \"no true Irish citizen can vote for any of the other parties\" [45] Fianna Fáil came to power at the 1932 general election (to begin what would be an unbroken 16-year spell in government) and went on to long dominate politics in the independent Irish state.\n\n\n1970–1975\nSinn Féin split in two at the beginning of 1970 On 11 January, the proposal to end abstentionism and take seats, if elected, in the Dáil, the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom was put before the members at the party's Ard Fheis [55] A similar motion had been adopted at an IRA convention the previous month, leading to the formation of a Provisional Army Council by Mac Stíofáin and other members opposed to the leadership When the motion was put to the Ard Fheis, it failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority The Executive attempted to circumvent this by introducing a motion in support of IRA policy, at which point the dissenting delegates walked out of the meeting [56] These members reconvened at Kevin Barry Hall in Parnell Square, where they appointed a Caretaker Executive with Ruairí Ó Brádaigh as chairman [57] The Caretaker Executive's first act was to pass a resolution pledging allegiance to the 32-county Irish Republic and the Provisional Army Council [58] It also declared itself opposed to the ending of abstentionism, the drift towards \"extreme forms of socialism\", the failure of the leadership to defend the nationalist people of Belfast during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, and the expulsion of traditional republicans by the leadership during the 1960s [59]\n\n\n1976–1983\nPolitical status for prisoners became an issue after the ending of the truce Rees released the last of the internees, and ended 'Special Category Status' for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976 This led first to the blanket protest, and then to the dirty protest [71] Around the same time, Gerry Adams began writing for Republican News, calling for Sinn Féin to become more involved politically [72] Over the next few years, Adams and those aligned with him would extend their influence throughout the republican movement and slowly marginalise Ó Brádaigh, part of a general trend of power in both Sinn Féin and the IRA shifting north [73] In particular, Ó Brádaigh's part in the 1975 IRA ceasefire had damaged his reputation in the eyes of northern republicans [74]\n\n\n1983–1998\nUnder Adams' leadership electoral politics became increasingly important In 1983 Alex Maskey was elected to Belfast City Council, the first Sinn Féin member to sit on that body [78] Sinn Féin polled over 100,000 votes in the Westminster elections that year, and Adams won the West Belfast seat that had been held by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) [78] By 1985 it had 59 seats on seventeen of the 26 Northern Ireland councils, including seven on Belfast City Council [79]\n\n\n1998–2017\nAt the 1997 Irish general election, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was elected to the Dáil In doing so, he became the first person under the \"Sinn Féin\" banner to be elected to Leinster House since 1957, and the first since 1922 to take their seat [87] [88] [89] Ó Caoláin's entry to the Dáil marked the beginning of a continuous Sinn Féin presence in the Republic of Ireland's national political bodies.\n\n\n2018–present\nOn 10 February 2018, Mary Lou McDonald was announced as the new president of Sinn Féin at a special Ard Fheis in Dublin [103] [104] [105] Michelle O'Neill was also elected as vice president of the party [103]\n\n\nPast links with Republican paramilitaries\nSinn Féin is the largest Irish republican political party, and was historically associated with the Irish Republican Army, while also having been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the party's modern incarnation The Irish government alleged that senior members of Sinn Féin have held posts on the IRA Army Council [122] [123] However, the SF leadership has denied these claims [124]\n\n\nOrganisation and structure\nSinn Féin operates under the principle of democratic centralism; [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] the concept that policy should be debated internally within the party, and once a decision is made, all members must support the chosen policy publicly or be disciplined Once a decision has been made, it cannot be revisited or altered for a prolonged period of time.\n\n\nIdeology and policies\nSinn Féin is an Irish republican, democratic socialist and left-wing party [164] In the European Parliament, the party aligns itself with The Left in the European Parliament - GUE/NGL parliamentary group Categorised as \"populist socialist\" in literature, [165] [166] in 2014 leading party strategist and ideologue Eoin Ó Broin described Sinn Féin's entire political project as unashamedly populist [167] The party has been classed as left-wing nationalist and left-wing populist in academia, noting that while Sinn Féin engages in the \"us vs them\" dynamic of populism, it does so by engaging in the language of \"the people vs elites\" without resorting to using anti-immigrant rhetoric [166] [168] [169]\n\n\nSocial and cultural\nSinn Féin's main political goal is a united Ireland Other key policies from their most recent election manifesto are listed below:\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the most recent election in the Republic of Ireland, [178] Sinn Féin committed to:\n\n\nHealth\nAt the most recent election in the Republic of Ireland, [179] Sinn Féin committed to:\n\n\nAbortion\nUntil at least 2007, the party was not in favour of the extension of legalised abortion (British 1967 Act) to Northern Ireland; Assembly member John O'Dowd said that they were \"opposed to the attitudes and forces in society, which pressurise women to have abortions, and criminalise those who make this decision\", adding that \"in cases of rape, incest or sexual abuse, or where a woman's life and health is at risk or in grave danger, we accept that the final decision must rest with the woman.\" [181] It voted for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which allowed for termination in cases where a pregnancy endangered a woman's life [182] It voted to support termination, in those limited circumstances, at the 2015 Ard Fheis, but stopped short of supporting abortion on demand [183] In the 2018 Irish abortion referendum, the party campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote, while remaining opposed to abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks [184] At its Ard Fheis in June 2018, the month after the \"yes\" vote in the abortion referendum, the party committed itself to supporting abortion, including without restriction up to 12 weeks [185] This allowed it not only to support abortion legislation in the Republic, but also to campaign for provision of abortion in Northern Ireland [186] Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín, who was suspended from the party for voting against abortion legislation, left to form a new party: Aontú [187]\n\n\nTransgender health care\nHistorically the party has supported access to gender affirming healthcare for transgender individuals However in 2024 after the UK’s Conservative Party enacted a ban on puberty blockers following the Cass Review, Sinn Féin allowed the ban to be extended to Northern Ireland, closing what some considered a “loophole” regarding access to such treatments in the UK [192] [193]\n\n\nInternational relations\nSinn Féin has longstanding fraternal ties with the African National Congress [194] and was described by Nelson Mandela as an \"old friend and ally in the anti-apartheid struggle\" [195] Sinn Féin supports the independence of Catalonia from Spain, [196] Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, [197] and the right to self-determination regarding independence of the Basque Country from Spain and France [198] Sinn Féin opposes the United States embargo against Cuba and has called for a normalization of relations between the two countries [199] In 2016, the Sinn Féin party president, Gerry Adams was invited by the Cuban government to attend the state funeral of Fidel Castro whom Adams described as a \"freedom fighter\" and a \"friend of Ireland's struggle\" [200] Sinn Féin is opposed to NATO membership [201] [202] [203]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nHistorically, Sinn Féin has been considered to be Eurosceptic [204] [205] The party campaigned for a \"No\" vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972 [206] Sinn Féin was on the same side of the debate as the DUP and most of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975 [207] The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, [208] and urged a \"No\" vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there was \"no contradiction in being pro-Europe, but anti-treaty\" [209] In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), with Martin McGuinness saying that an exit \"would be absolutely economically disastrous\" Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, there ought to be a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland [210] Its policy of a \"Europe of Equals\", and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU The party expresses, on one hand, \"support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda\", and on the other a \"principled opposition\" to a European superstate [211] This has led political commentators to define the party as soft Eurosceptic since the 21st century [212]\n\n\nLeadership history\nSinn Féin returned to Northern Ireland elections at the 1982 Assembly elections, winning five seats with 64,191 votes (10.1%) The party narrowly missed winning additional seats in Belfast North and Fermanagh and South Tyrone In the 1983 UK general

republican, democratic socialist, and left-wing party that was founded in 1905. The name \"Sinn Féin\" is Irish for \"Ourselves\" or \"We Ourselves,\" although it is frequently mistranslated as \"ourselves alone\" from the early-20th-century slogan \"Sinn Féin Amháin.\" The name is an assertion of Irish national sovereignty and self-determination, advocating for the Irish people to govern themselves rather than being part of a political union with Great Britain under the Westminster Parliament.\n\n**History**\n\nSinn Féin was founded on November 28, 1905, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, where Arthur Griffith outlined the party's policy to establish a national legislature in Ireland's capital with the moral authority of the Irish nation. Initially, the party's platform was conservative and monarchist, advocating for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy unified with the British Crown, inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The party contested the 1908 North Leitrim by-election, securing 27% of the vote. However, both support and membership fell, and at its 1910 ard fheis (party conference), attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive.\n\n**1905–1922**\n\nSinn Féin was founded on November 28, 1905, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, where Arthur Griffith outlined the party's policy to establish a national legislature in Ireland's capital with the moral authority of the Irish nation.

However, both support and membership fell, and at its 1910 ard fheis (party conference), attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive. The party's early years were marked by internal divisions and a lack of clear direction.\n\n**1923–1970**\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, Sinn Féin split, with pro-Treaty Dáil deputies and other Treaty supporters forming a new party, Cumann na nGaedheal, in 1923. Cumann na nGaedheal went on to govern the new Irish Free State for nine years before merging with two other organizations to form Fine Gael in 1933. Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin members continued to boycott the Dáil. In 1926, Éamon de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the Dáil if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed. When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin and founded his own party, Fianna Fáil, which was dedicated to republicanizing the Free State from within its political structures.\n\n**1970–1975**\n\nIn 1970, Sinn Féin split in two, with a section led by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh opposing the leadership's decision to end abstentionism and take seats in the Dáil, the Parliament of Northern Ireland, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom. A similar motion had been adopted at an IRA convention the previous month, leading to the formation of a Provisional Army Council by Gerry Adams and other members opposed to the leadership. The dissenting delegates walked out of the meeting and reconvened at Kevin Barry Hall in Parnell Square, where they appointed a Caretaker Executive with Ruairí Ó Brádaigh as chairman.\n\n**1976–1983**\n\nPolitical status for prisoners became an issue after the ending of the truce, and Rees released the last of the internees, ending 'Special Category Status' for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976. This led first to the blanket protest and then to the dirty protest. Gerry Adams began writing for Republican News, calling for Sinn Féin to become more involved in politics. Over the next few years, Adams and those aligned with him would extend their influence throughout the republican movement and slowly marginalize Ó Brádaigh.\n\n**1983–1998**\n\nUnder Adams' leadership, electoral politics became increasingly important. In 1983, Alex Maskey was elected to Belfast City Council, the first Sinn Féin member to sit on that body. Sinn Féin polled over 100,000 votes in the Westminster elections that year, and Adams won the West Belfast seat that had been held by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). By 1985, it had 59 seats on 17 of the 26 Northern Ireland councils, including seven on Belfast City Council.\n\n**1998–2017**\n\nAt the 1997 Irish general election, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was elected to the Dáil, becoming the first person under the \"Sinn Féin\" banner to be elected to Leinster House since 1957, and the first since 1922 to take their seat. Ó Caoláin's entry to the Dáil marked the beginning of a continuous Sinn Féin presence in the Republic of Ireland's national political bodies.\n\n**2018–present**\n\nOn February 10, 2018, Mary Lou McDonald was announced as the new president of Sinn Féin at a special Ard Fheis in Dublin. Michelle O'Neill was also elected as vice president of the party.\n\n**Ideology and Policies**\n\nSinn Féin is an Irish republican, democratic socialist, and left-wing party. The party's main political goal is a united Ireland. Other key policies from their most recent election manifesto include:\n\n* A left-wing economic policy, including a 100% tax on wealth over €1 million, a wealth tax on corporations, and a 100% tax on profits made from the sale of assets.\n* A commitment to public ownership of key sectors, including healthcare, education, and energy.\n* A commitment to human rights, including the right to abortion, and the rights of marginalized communities.\n* A commitment to environmental protection, including a carbon tax and a commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\n**Social and Cultural**\n\nSinn Féin's main political goal is a united Ireland.

However, the party has also expressed support for the European Union's commitment to human rights and environmental protection.\n\n**International Relations**\n\nSinn Féin has longstanding fraternal ties with the African National Congress and was described by Nelson Mandela as an \"old friend and ally in the anti-apartheid struggle.\" The party also supports the independence of Catalonia from Spain, Palestine in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the right to self-determination regarding independence of the Basque Country from Spain and France.\n\n**Leadership History**\n\nSinn Féin has had several leaders throughout its history, including:\n\n* Arthur Griffith (1905-1922)\n* Éamon de Valera (1922-1926)\n* Ruairí Ó Brádaigh (1970-1975)\n* Gerry Adams (1978-2018)\n* Mary Lou McDonald (2018-present)\n\n**Presidential Elections**\n\nSinn Féin has participated in several presidential elections in Ireland, including:\n\n* 2011: Martin McGuinness was the party's candidate, but lost to Michael D. Higgins.\n* 2018: Gerry Adams was the party's candidate, but lost to Michael D.

phrase \"Sinn Féin\" is Irish for \"Ourselves\" or \"We Ourselves\", [25] [26] although it is frequently mistranslated as \"ourselves alone\" (from \"Sinn Féin Amháin\", an early-20th-century slogan) [27] The name is an assertion of Irish national sovereignty and self-determination, i.e., the Irish people governing themselves, rather than being part of a political union with Great Britain under the Westminster Parliament.\n\n\nHistory\nSinn Féin was founded on 28 November 1905, when, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, Arthur Griffith outlined the Sinn Féin policy, \"to establish in Ireland's capital a national legislature endowed with the moral authority of the Irish nation\" [26] [30] Its initial political platform was both conservative and monarchist, advocating for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy unified with the British Crown (inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) [31] [32] The party contested the 1908 North Leitrim by-election, where it secured 27% of the vote [33] Thereafter, both support and membership fell At its 1910 ard fheis (party conference) attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive [34]\n\n\n1905–1922\nSinn Féin was founded on 28 November 1905, when, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, Arthur Griffith outlined the Sinn Féin policy, \"to establish in Ireland's capital a national legislature endowed with the moral authority of the Irish nation\" [26] [30] Its initial political platform was both conservative and monarchist, advocating for an

the vote [33] Thereafter, both support and membership fell At its 1910 ard fheis (party conference) attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive [34]\n\n\n1923–1970\nPro-Treaty Dáil deputies and other Treaty supporters formed a new party, Cumann na nGaedheal, on 27 April 1923 at a meeting in Dublin, where delegates agreed on a constitution and political programme [39] Cumann na nGaedheal went on to govern the new Irish Free State for nine years (it merged with two other organisations to form Fine Gael in 1933) [40] Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin members continued to boycott the Dáil At a special Ard Fheis in March 1926, de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the Dáil if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin; on 16 May 1926, he founded his own party, Fianna Fáil, which was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within its political structures He took most Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála (TDs) with him [41] De Valera's resignation meant also the loss of financial support from America [42] The rump Sinn Féin party could field no more than fifteen candidates, [43] and won only five seats in the June 1927 general election, a decline in support not seen since before 1916 [44] [45] Vice-president and de facto leader Mary MacSwiney announced that the party simply did not have the funds to contest the second election called that year, declaring \"no true Irish citizen can vote for any of the other parties\" [45] Fianna Fáil came to power at the 1932 general election (to begin what would be an unbroken 16-year spell in government) and went on to long dominate politics in the independent Irish state.\n\n\n1970–1975\nSinn Féin split in two at the beginning of 1970 On 11 January, the proposal to end abstentionism and take seats, if elected, in the Dáil, the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom was put before the members at the party's Ard Fheis [55] A similar motion had been adopted at an IRA convention the previous month, leading to the formation of a Provisional Army Council by Mac Stíofáin and other members opposed to the leadership When the motion was put to the Ard Fheis, it failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority The Executive attempted to circumvent this by introducing a motion in support of IRA policy, at which point the dissenting delegates walked out of the meeting [56] These members reconvened at Kevin Barry Hall in Parnell Square, where they appointed a Caretaker Executive with Ruairí Ó Brádaigh as chairman [57] The Caretaker Executive's first act was to pass a resolution pledging allegiance to the 32-county Irish Republic and the Provisional Army Council [58] It also declared itself opposed to the ending of abstentionism, the drift towards \"extreme forms of socialism\", the failure of the leadership to defend the nationalist people of Belfast during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, and the expulsion of traditional republicans by the leadership during the 1960s [59]\n\n\n1976–1983\nPolitical status for prisoners became an issue after the ending of the truce Rees released the last of the internees, and ended 'Special Category Status' for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976 This led first to the blanket protest, and then to the dirty protest [71] Around the same time, Gerry Adams began writing for Republican News, calling for Sinn Féin to become more involved politically [72] Over the next few years, Adams and those aligned with him would extend their influence throughout the republican movement and slowly marginalise Ó Brádaigh, part of a general trend of power in both Sinn Féin and the IRA shifting north [73] In particular, Ó Brádaigh's part in the 1975 IRA ceasefire had damaged his reputation in the eyes of northern republicans [74]\n\n\n1983–1998\nUnder Adams' leadership electoral politics became increasingly important In 1983 Alex Maskey was elected to Belfast City Council, the first Sinn Féin member to sit on that body [78] Sinn Féin polled over 100,000 votes in the Westminster elections that year, and Adams won the West Belfast seat that had been held by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) [78] By 1985 it had 59 seats on seventeen of the 26 Northern Ireland councils, including seven on Belfast City Council [79]\n\n\n1998–2017\nAt the 1997 Irish general election, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was elected to the Dáil In doing so, he became the first person under the \"Sinn Féin\" banner to be elected to Leinster House since 1957, and the first since 1922 to take their seat [87] [88] [89] Ó Caoláin's entry to the Dáil marked the beginning of a continuous Sinn Féin presence in the Republic of Ireland's national political bodies.\n\n\n2018–present\nOn 10 February 2018, Mary Lou McDonald was announced as the new president of Sinn Féin at a special Ard Fheis in Dublin [103] [104] [105] Michelle O'Neill was also elected as vice president of the party [103]\n\n\nPast links with Republican paramilitaries\nSinn Féin is the largest Irish republican political party, and was historically associated with the Irish Republican Army, while also having been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the party's modern incarnation The Irish government alleged that senior members of Sinn Féin have held posts on the IRA Army Council [122] [123] However, the SF leadership has denied these claims [124]\n\n\nOrganisation and structure\nSinn Féin operates under the principle of democratic centralism; [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] the concept that policy should be debated internally within the party, and once a decision is made, all members must support the chosen policy publicly or be disciplined Once a decision has been made, it cannot be revisited or altered for a prolonged period of time.\n\n\nIdeology and policies\nSinn Féin is an Irish republican, democratic socialist and left-wing party [164] In the European Parliament, the party aligns itself with The Left in the European Parliament - GUE/NGL parliamentary group Categorised as \"populist socialist\" in literature, [165] [166] in 2014 leading party strategist and ideologue Eoin Ó Broin described Sinn Féin's entire political project as unashamedly populist [167] The party has been classed as left-wing nationalist and left-wing populist in academia, noting that while Sinn Féin engages in the \"us vs them\" dynamic of populism, it does so by engaging in the language of \"the people vs elites\" without resorting to using anti-immigrant rhetoric [166] [168] [169]\n\n\nSocial and cultural\nSinn Féin's main political goal is a united Ireland Other key policies from their most recent election manifesto are listed below:\n\n\nEconomy\nAt the most recent election in the Republic of Ireland, [178] Sinn Féin committed to:\n\n\nHealth\nAt the most recent election in the Republic of Ireland, [179] Sinn Féin committed to:\n\n\nAbortion\nUntil at least 2007, the party was not in favour of the extension of legalised abortion (British 1967 Act) to Northern Ireland; Assembly member John O'Dowd said that they were \"opposed to the attitudes and forces in society, which pressurise women to have abortions, and criminalise those who make this decision\", adding that \"in cases of rape, incest or sexual abuse, or where a woman's life and health is at risk or in grave danger, we accept that the final decision must rest with the woman.\" [181] It voted for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which allowed for termination in cases where a pregnancy endangered a woman's life [182] It voted to support termination, in those limited circumstances, at the 2015 Ard Fheis, but stopped short of supporting abortion on demand [183] In the 2018 Irish abortion referendum, the party campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote, while remaining opposed to abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks [184] At its Ard Fheis in June 2018, the month after the \"yes\" vote in the abortion referendum, the party committed itself to supporting abortion, including without restriction up to 12 weeks [185] This allowed it not only to support abortion legislation in the Republic, but also to campaign for provision of abortion in Northern Ireland [186] Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín, who was suspended from the party for voting against abortion legislation, left to form a new party: Aontú [187]\n\n\nTransgender health care\nHistorically the party has supported access to gender affirming healthcare for transgender individuals However in 2024 after the UK’s Conservative Party enacted a ban on puberty blockers following the Cass Review, Sinn Féin allowed the ban to be extended to Northern Ireland, closing what some considered a “loophole” regarding access to such treatments in the UK [192] [193]\n\n\nInternational relations\nSinn Féin has longstanding fraternal ties with the African National Congress [194] and was described by Nelson Mandela as an \"old friend and ally in the anti-apartheid struggle\" [195] Sinn Féin supports the independence of Catalonia from Spain, [196] Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, [197] and the right to self-determination regarding independence of the Basque Country from Spain and France [198] Sinn Féin opposes the United States embargo against Cuba and has called for a normalization of relations between the two countries [199] In 2016, the Sinn Féin party president, Gerry Adams was invited by the Cuban government to attend the state funeral of Fidel Castro whom Adams described as a \"freedom fighter\" and a \"friend of Ireland's struggle\" [200] Sinn Féin is opposed to NATO membership [201] [202] [203]\n\n\nEuropean Union\nHistorically, Sinn Féin has been considered to be Eurosceptic [204] [205] The party campaigned for a \"No\" vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972 [206] Sinn Féin was on the same side of the debate as the DUP and most of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975 [207] The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, [208] and urged a \"No\" vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there was \"no contradiction in being pro-Europe, but anti-treaty\" [209] In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), with Martin McGuinness saying that an exit \"would be absolutely economically disastrous\" Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, there ought to be a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland [210] Its policy of a \"Europe of Equals\", and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party's previous opposition to the EU The party expresses, on one hand, \"support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda\", and on the other a \"principled opposition\" to a European superstate [211] This has led political commentators to define the party as soft Eurosceptic since the 21st century [212]\n\n\nLeadership history\nSinn Féin returned to Northern Ireland elections at the 1982 Assembly elections, winning five seats with 64,191 votes (10.1%) The party narrowly missed winning additional seats in Belfast North and Fermanagh and South Tyrone In the 1983 UK general election eight months later, Sinn Féin

Howard Marshall II**\n\nJ. Howard Marshall II was an American lawyer, businessman, and philanthropist. He co-founded Koch Industries, one of the largest privately-held companies in the world, and was a prominent figure in the development of the oil and gas industry. Marshall was also a dedicated philanthropist, donating millions of dollars to various charitable causes throughout his life.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJ. Howard Marshall II was born on August 19, 1905, in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was raised a Quaker and attended George School, a private high school in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Marshall excelled academically and athletically at George School, captaining the debate team and playing soccer and tennis under the instruction of professional Bill Tilden. He graduated from George School in 1924 and then went on to study liberal arts at Haverford College, a Quaker institution, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1926.\n\nWhile at Haverford, Marshall was an active member of the school community, editing the school newspaper and captaining the debate team. He also studied with law and economics pioneer Walton Hale Hamilton, which would later influence his career in law and business. Marshall's education at Haverford College laid the foundation for his future success in law and business.\n\n**Careers**\n\nAfter graduating from Haverford College, Marshall went on to study law at Yale Law School, where he graduated in 1931. During his time at Yale, Marshall was a case editor of the Yale Law Journal and studied with notable law professors, including Walton Hale Hamilton. He was also a member of the influential legal realism school of thought, which emphasized the importance of empirical research and social science in the study of law.\n\nUpon graduating from Yale Law School, Marshall served as an Assistant Dean at Yale Law School from 1931 to 1933. During this time, he instructed courses in business, finance, and procedure, and published articles as a member of the legal realism school of thought. Marshall's work with future Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas on an article titled \"A Factual Study of Bankruptcy Administration and Some Suggestions\" was published in 1932, and his studies on the legal planning of petroleum production were published in 1931.\n\nMarshall's work in the oil and gas industry began in the 1950s, when he co-founded Great Northern Oil. In 1955, the company built an oil refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, that could refine heavy, sour Canadian crude oil. Marshall's expertise in the oil and gas industry, combined with his business acumen, helped Great Northern Oil become a successful and profitable company.\n\n**Koch Industries**\n\nIn 1969, Marshall's business partner, Fred Koch, acquired a majority interest in Great Northern Oil. However, Marshall and Koch wanted to keep their assets in private hands, and they blocked a takeover attempt by Union Oil. In 1969, Charles Koch, who shared a similar business philosophy with Marshall, swapped a stake in Koch Industries for the rest of Marshall's shares in Great Northern Oil.\n\nMarshall's partnership with Charles Koch marked the beginning of a new era in the oil and gas industry. Under their leadership, Koch Industries became one of the largest privately-held companies in the world, with a diverse range of businesses, including oil refining, chemicals, and textiles. Marshall's expertise in law and business, combined with his business acumen, helped Koch Industries become a successful and profitable company.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMarshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931, and they had two sons together, J. Howard Marshall III and E. Pierce Marshall. Marshall's marriage to Eleanor Pierce lasted until 1961, when they divorced. Marshall married Bettye Bohannon in 1961, and they remained married until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 1991.\n\nMarshall's eldest son, J. Howard Marshall III, was involved in a dispute with his father over the direction of Koch Industries. In 1980, Marshall purchased back company stock from his son, given previously as a gift, for $8 million, and removed the eldest son from his will and testament. Marshall's youngest son, E. Pierce Marshall, sided with his father, and he received substantially all of Marshall's estate, valued at $1.6 billion at the time of his death.\n\n**Death and Ensuing Lawsuits**\n\nJ. Howard Marshall II died on August 4, 1995, at the age of 90, in Houston, Texas, from pneumonia. After Marshall's death, his former daughter-in-law, Anna Nicole Smith, became involved in a court battle with his youngest son, E. Pierce Marshall, over his will and trust. Marshall's will and trust did not include Anna Nicole or his other son, J. Howard Marshall III. In 2001, Anna Nicole and J. Howard III both lost their cases during a six-month Texas state court jury trial.\n\n**Dispute over Pledge to Alma Mater**\n\nIn 1976, Marshall pledged $4 million to his alma mater, Haverford College. However, by the time of his death in 1995, Marshall had only contributed $2 million. Haverford sued Marshall's estate in a Houston probate court, claiming that Marshall had breached his pledge. In April 2003, a jury found that Haverford had not been injured because it had not relied on Marshall's pledges.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nJ. Howard Marshall II was a dedicated philanthropist, donating millions of dollars to various charitable causes throughout his life. He was also a prominent figure in the development of the oil and gas industry, and his partnership with Charles Koch helped Koch Industries become one of the largest privately-held companies in the world. Marshall's legacy continues to be felt today, and his contributions to the oil and gas industry, as well as his philanthropic efforts, will be remembered for generations to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"J._Howard_Marshall\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and raised a Quaker, [1] J Howard Marshall II attended George School, a private high school in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and then studied liberal arts at Haverford College, both Quaker institutions, graduating in 1926 While at George School and Haverford, he edited the school newspapers, captained the debate teams, was an All American soccer player, and played competitive tennis under the instruction of professional Bill Tilden He graduated magna cum laude from Yale Law School in 1931 At Yale, he was case editor of the Yale Law Journal and studied with law and economics pioneer Walton Hale Hamilton [1]\n\n\nCareers\nUpon graduation, from 1931 to 1933, he served as an Assistant Dean at Yale Law School and instructed courses in business, finance and procedure, [2] while also publishing articles as a member of the influential legal realism school of thought He worked with future Supreme Court Justice William O Douglas on an article titled A Factual Study of Bankruptcy Administration and Some Suggestions, published in 1932 [3] Along with Norman Meyers, he published two articles titled Legal Planning of Petroleum Production in 1931 [4] These studies offered an alternative to the then-prevailing practices of controlled production in the petroleum industry, which were leading to dramatic boom-bust cycles They gained the interest of the government, as many of the supporters of the New Deal were supporters of legal realism.\n\n\nKoch Industries\nIn 1952, Marshall co-founded Great Northern Oil, which, in 1955, built an oil refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota that could refine heavy, sour Canadian crude oil [8] In 1959, Fred Koch acquired a 35% interest in Great Northern Oil for $5 million Union Oil acquired a majority interest in Great Northern and attempted to take over the company, but Marshall and Koch, who wanted to keep their assets in private hands, blocked the takeover In 1969, after buying out Union Oil, Charles Koch, who shared a similar business philosophy with Marshall, swapped a stake in Koch Industries for the rest of Marshall's shares in Great Northern Oil [9]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMarshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931 and divorced in 1961 They had two sons together: J Howard Marshall III (born February 6, 1936) and E Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 – June 20, 2006) His second marriage, to Bettye Bohannon, lasted from 1961 until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 1991.\n\n\nMarriages and relationships\nMarshall married Eleanor Pierce in 1931 and divorced in 1961 They had two sons together: J Howard Marshall III (born February 6, 1936) and E Pierce Marshall (January 12, 1939 – June 20, 2006) His second marriage, to Bettye Bohannon, lasted from 1961 until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 1991.\n\n\nEldest son left out of estate\nIn 1980, when Marshall's eldest son, J Howard Marshall III, sided with Bill Koch, Frederick R Koch and other collateral family members in dispute with Charles Koch and David H Koch over making Koch Industries a public company and paying dividends, Marshall purchased back company stock from his son, given previously as a gift, for $8 million, considered to be a premium price, and removed the eldest son from his will and testament Conversely, during the same dispute, his youngest son E Pierce Marshall sided with his father, and that son received substantially all of Marshall's estate, valued at $1.6 billion at the time of his death.\n\n\nDeath and ensuing lawsuits\nOn August 4, 1995, Marshall died of pneumonia at age 90 in Houston, Texas [10] Following Marshall's death, Anna Nicole Smith (who died on February 8, 2007) became involved in a court battle with her former stepson, E Pierce Marshall (who died on June 20, 2006) J Howard's will and trust did not include Anna Nicole or J Howard's other son, J Howard Marshall III Anna Nicole and J Howard III both sought to overturn the will and trust In 2001, they both lost their cases during a six-month Texas state court jury trial [11]\n\n\nDispute over pledge to alma mater\nIn 1976, Marshall pledged $4 million to his alma mater, Haverford College However, by the time of his death in 1995, Marshall had only contributed $2 million Haverford sued his estate in a Houston probate court; in April 2003, a jury found that Haverford had not been injured because it had not relied on Marshall's pledges [21]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

team**\n\nThe Italy national football team, commonly referred to as the Azzurri, is the national football team of Italy. They are one of the most successful teams in international football, having won four FIFA World Cup titles and four European Championship titles.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Italy national football team was formed in 1910, and they have been a major force in international football ever since. They have a rich history, with a dedicated fan base and a reputation for producing talented players. In this article, we will explore the history of the Italian national team, their achievements, and their current status.\n\n**History**\n\nAn early attempt to create an Italian national team occurred on 30 April 1899, when an Italian selection played a Swiss eleven, losing 0–2 in Torino. The team's first official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910, Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy's first goal scored by Pietro Lana.\n\nThe Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and consisted of: De Simoni; Varisco, Calì; Trerè, Fossati, Capello; Debernardi, Rizzi, Cevenini I, Lana, Boiocchi. The first captain of the team was Francesco Calì.\n\n**Origins and first two World Cup titles in 1934 and 1938**\n\nAn early attempt to create an Italian national team occurred on 30 April 1899, when an Italian selection played a Swiss eleven, losing 0–2 in Torino. The team's first official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910, Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy's first goal scored by Pietro Lana.\n\nThe Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and consisted of: De Simoni; Varisco, Calì; Trerè, Fossati, Capello; Debernardi, Rizzi, Cevenini I, Lana, Boiocchi. The first captain of the team was Francesco Calì.\n\n**Reconstruction in the 1950s and 1960s**\n\nIn 1949, 10 of the 11 players in the team's initial line-up were killed in a plane crash that affected Torino, winners of the previous five Serie A titles. Italy did not advance further than the first round of the 1950 World Cup, as they were weakened severely due to the air disaster. The team had travelled by boat rather than by plane, fearing another accident.\n\nThe Italian national team began to rebuild in the 1950s and 1960s, with the emergence of new players such as Giampiero Boniperti and Giuseppe Meazza. Italy qualified for the 1962 World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, and then won the European Championship in 1968, defeating Yugoslavia in the final.\n\n**European champions and World Cup runners-up (1968–1974)**\n\nIn 1968, Italy hosted the European Championship and won the tournament in its first participation, beating Yugoslavia in Rome and winning their first major competition since the 1938 World Cup. The final ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time, and the rules of the time required the match to be replayed a few days later.\n\nOn 10 June 1968, Italy won the replay 2–0 (with goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi) to take the trophy. Italy also reached the final of the 1970 World Cup, where they lost to Brazil, and then reached the semi-finals of the 1974 World Cup, where they lost to the Netherlands.\n\n**Third World Cup title generation (1978–1986)**\n\nUnder the initial guide of Fulvio Bernardini and later that of head coach Enzo Bearzot, a new generation of Italian players came to the international stage in the second half of the 1970s. At the 1978 World Cup, Italy was the only team in the tournament to beat the eventual champions and host team Argentina, and the Azzurri made it to the third-place final, where they were defeated by Brazil 2–1.\n\nItaly hosted the 1980 European Championship, the first edition to be held between eight teams instead of four, automatically qualifying for the finals as hosts. After two draws with Spain and Belgium and a narrow 1–0 win over England, Italy were beaten by Czechoslovakia in the third-place match on penalties 9–8 after Fulvio Collovati missed his kick.\n\n**Vicini years and World Cup runners-up with Sacchi (1986–1994)**\n\nIn 1986, Azeglio Vicini was appointed as new head coach, replacing Bearzot. He granted a central role to players such as Walter Zenga and Gianluca Vialli, and conceded a chance to young players coming from the U21 team. Vialli scored goals that gave Italy a 1988 European Championship pass.\n\nThe team was also shown like Altobelli's possibly successor, having his same goal attitude. Both forwards stroke the target in Germany, where Soviet Union defeated the Azzurri in semi-finals.\n\n**Euro 2000 runners-up (1996–2000)**\n\nThe vice World champions, still led by Sacchi, qualified for Euro 1996 in England, but did not progress beyond the group stage. Having defeated Russia 2–1 and losing by the same score against the Czech Republic, Italy required a victory in their final group match against Germany to progress to the quarter-finals.\n\nHowever, Gianfranco Zola failed to convert a decisive penalty in a 0–0 draw against the Germans, who eventually won the tournament.\n\n**Trapattoni years (2000–2004)**\n\nGiovanni Trapattoni took charge of the team in July 2000 following the resignation of Dino Zoff.

At Euro 2008, the Azzurri lost 3–0 to the Netherlands in the opening match of the group stage.\n\nThe following game against Romania ended 1–1 thanks to a penalty save from Gianluigi Buffon. Italy would win their final group game against France 2–0, a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final.\n\nThe Azzurri were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties to eventual champions Spain.

In the 2014 World Cup, Italy was eliminated in the group stage.\n\nIn the 2016 European Championship, Italy was eliminated in the round of 16. The team's results have been fluctuating, with some good performances and some disappointing ones.\n\n**Failure to qualify for 2018 World Cup**\n\nAfter Conte's planned departure following Euro 2016, Gian Piero Ventura took over as manager for the team. During qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Italy finished second in Group G, five points behind Spain.\n\nItaly would compete in the play-off round against Sweden, where they lost 1–0 on aggregate and therefore eliminated. The first time that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1958.\n\nFollowing the match, veterans Andrea Barzagli, Daniele De Rossi and captain Gianluigi Buffon all declared their retirement from the national team. On 15 November 2017, Ventura was dismissed as head coach, and on 20 November 2017, Carlo Tavecchio resigned as president of the Italian Football Federation.\n\nLuigi Di Biagio was called as caretaker manager and led the team in subsequent friendlies in March 2018, including the last of Buffon's 176 appearances on 23 March in a friendly against Argentina.\n\n**Mancini era (2018–2023)**\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Roberto Mancini was announced as the new manager.

For this reason, the coach of the Italy national team is still called Technical Commissioner (Italian: commissario tecnico) or CT.\n\nThe use of this title has since then expanded into other team sports in Italy.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last twelve months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n2024\n\nThe following players were called up for 2024–25 UEFA Nations League matches against Belgium and France on 14 and 17 November 2024, respectively.\n\n**Players**\n\nThe following players were called up for 2024–25 UEFA Nations League matches against Belgium and France on 14 and 17 November 2024, respectively.\n\n**Current squad**\n\nThe following players were called up for 2024–25 UEFA Nations League matches against Belgium and France on 14 and 17 November 2024, respectively.\n\n**Recent call-ups**\n\nThe following players have also been called up for the team within the last twelve months.\n\n**Previous squads**\n\nThe following players have also been called up for the team within the last twelve months.\n\n**Individual records**\n\nList of captaincy periods of the various captains throughout the years.\n\n**Player records**\n\nList of captaincy periods of the various captains throughout the years.\n\n**Most appearances**\n\nList of captaincy periods of the various captains throughout the years.\n\n**Top goalscorers**\n\nList of captaincy periods of the various captains throughout the years.\n\n**Captains**\n\nList of captaincy periods of the various captains throughout the years.\n\n**Hat-tricks**\n\n List of hat-tricks scored by the Italy national team.\n\n**Manager records**\n\n List of Italy national team managers.\n\n**Team records**\n\n List of Italy national team records.\n\n**Competitive record**\n\n List of international competitions that Italy has participated in.\n\n**FIFA World Cup**\n\nAs of 14 October 2024, the complete official match record of the Italian national team comprises 883 matches: 471 wins, 240 draws and 172 losses.\n\nDuring these matches, the team scored 1,543 times and conceded 869 goals.

official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910 Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy's first goal scored by Pietro Lana [3] [4] [5] The Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and consisted of: De Simoni; Varisco, Calì; Trerè, Fossati, Capello; Debernardi, Rizzi, Cevenini I, Lana, Boiocchi The first captain of the team was Francesco Calì [6]\n\n\nOrigins and first two World Cup titles in 1934 and 1938\nAn early attempt to create an Italian national team occurred on 30 April 1899, when an Italian selection played a Swiss eleven, losing 0–2 in Torino [2] The team's first official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910 Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy's first goal scored by Pietro Lana [3] [4] [5] The Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and

1960s\nIn 1949, 10 of the 11 players in the team's initial line-up were killed in a plane crash that affected Torino, winners of the previous five Serie A titles Italy did not advance further than the first round of the 1950 World Cup, as they were weakened severely due to the air disaster The team had travelled by boat rather than by plane, fearing another accident [13]\n\n\nEuropean champions and World Cup runners-up (1968–1974)\nIn 1968, Italy hosted the European Championship and won the tournament in its first participation, beating Yugoslavia in Rome and winning their first major competition since the 1938 World Cup The final ended in a 1–1 draw after extra time, and the rules of the time required the match to be replayed a few days later This was the only time the final of the European Championship or World Cup was replayed [21] On 10 June 1968, Italy won the replay 2–0 (with goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi) to take the trophy.\n\n\nThird World Cup title generation (1978–1986)\nUnder the initial guide of Fulvio Bernardini and later that of head coach Enzo Bearzot, a new generation of Italian players came to the international stage in the second half of the 1970s At the 1978 World Cup, Italy was the only team in the tournament to beat the eventual champions and host team Argentina, and the Azzurri made it to the third-place final, where they were defeated by Brazil 2–1 In the second round group stage match against the Netherlands, which prevented Italy from reaching the final, Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff was beaten by a long-distance shot from Arie Haan, and Zoff was criticized for the defeat [23] Italy hosted the 1980 European Championship, the first edition to be held between eight teams instead of four, [24] automatically qualifying for the finals as hosts After two draws with Spain and Belgium and a narrow 1–0 win over England, Italy were beaten by Czechoslovakia in the third-place match on penalties 9–8 after Fulvio Collovati missed his kick [25] [26]\n\n\nVicini years and World Cup runners-up with Sacchi (1986–1994)\nIn 1986, Azeglio Vicini was appointed as new head coach, replacing Bearzot [41] He granted a central role to players such as Walter Zenga and Gianluca Vialli, and conceded a chance to young players coming from the U21 team; [42] Vialli scored goals that gave Italy a 1988 European Championship pass [43] He was also shown like Altobelli's possibly successor, having his same goal attitude [44] Both forwards stroke the target in Germany, where Soviet Union defeated the Azzurri in semi-finals [45]\n\n\nEuro 2000 runners-up (1996–2000)\nThe vice World champions, still led by Sacchi, qualified for Euro 1996 in England, but did not progress beyond the group stage Having defeated Russia 2–1 and losing by the same score against the Czech Republic, Italy required a victory in their final group match against Germany to progress to the quarter-finals However, Gianfranco Zola failed to convert a decisive penalty in a 0–0 draw against the Germans, who eventually won the tournament [57]\n\n\nTrapattoni years (2000–2004)\nGiovanni Trapattoni took charge of the team in July 2000 following the resignation of Dino Zoff [65] Playing in Group 8 of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification process, Italy finished undefeated after facing Romania, Georgia, Hungary and Lithuania In the final tournament, a 2–0 victory against Ecuador with a double from Christian Vieri was followed by a series of controversial matches During the match against Croatia, English referee Graham Poll incorrectly disallowed two regular goals resulting in a 2–1 defeat to Italy [66] Despite two goals being ruled for offsides, a late headed goal from Alessandro Del Piero helped Italy to a 1–1 draw with Mexico, proving enough to advance to the knockout stages [67]\n\n\n2006 World Cup victory\nThe Italian Football Federation replaced Trapattoni with Marcello Lippi [75] [76] With controversy plaguing the domestic league, Italy

become an EBU member, halted its plans after director Peter Kölbel's unexpected death, and did not resume them due to the lack of sufficient funds and of government support; thus it ruled out debuting in 2021 [43]\n\n\nProduction\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2021 was a co-production between three related Dutch television organisations — Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO), Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) and AVROTROS — of which each assumed a different role [44] Sietse Bakker and Astrid Dutrénit served as executive producers, while Emilie Sickinghe and Jessica Stam served as deputy executive producers [45] Marnix Kaart, Marc Pos and Daniel Jelinek served as directors of the three live shows, [46] [47] and Gerben Bakker served as head of show [48] [49] Background music for the shows was composed by Eric van Tijn [50] [51]\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nOn 7 May 2020, the Dutch authorities prohibited all mass gatherings in the country until a COVID-19 vaccine became available [55] The host broadcasters stated that they were assessing the decision and how it would impact the event [56]\n\n\nVisual design\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the planned visual design and slogan for 2020, \"Open Up\", would be used in 2021 as well [57] The revamped official logo and branding was unveiled on 4 December 2020 Designed by Clever°Franke, it is \"an abstract presentation inspired by the map of the world and visually connects the location of the capitals of the  [then] 41 participating countries with Rotterdam as Europe's beating heart\" [69] [70] The revamped visual identity, designed by MediaMonks and NEP, was built around patterns and 'tracks' that symbolises the Netherlands and the concept of \"opening up\" [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nStage design\nDuring the announcement of the dates of the 2021 contest, executive producer Sietse Bakker stated that the planned stage design for 2020 would also be used in 2021 [74] The design was inspired by the slogan \"Open Up\" and the typical Dutch flat landscape The Eurovision stage was designed by German stage designer Florian Wieder, who also designed the stages for the contests in 2011–12, 2015, and 2017–19 [75] [76] Its features included a revolvable primary LED screen that is 52 metres (171 ft) wide and 12 metres (39 ft) high, and a retractable semi-transparent LED screen which could be used as a backdrop for the secondary stage [77] [78] [79] The stage design was complemented by augmented reality effects [80] Unlike the 2019 contest, the green room was placed in the main performance venue, and encompassed the entire floor space previously reserved for the standing audience, so as to facilitate social distancing [81]\n\n\nPostcards\nThe \"postcards\" were 40-second video introductions shown on television whilst the stage was being prepared for the next contestant to perform their entry [82] Filmed between January and April, and directed by Martijn Nieman and Laurence Drenthe, with Kevin Soares serving as executive producer, the 2021 postcards were based on the \"Open Up\" theme of the contest In a departure from the initial concept created for the 2020 contest owing to travel restriction concerns, the postcards involved the acts being presented through footage shot in their country of origin These were inserted via chroma keying onto the framework of a 'tiny house' set-up in various locations around the Netherlands, and decorated with items personal to the artist At the end of each postcard, a light streak hit the house and was refracted into a country-specific coloured streak, mimicking the prism and transitions to the stage, where the ceiling was lit up with that country's flag colours using augmented reality [73] The postcards were produced by Amsterdam-based production company IDTV, with additional post-production and VFX work by Antwerp-based agency Storm [83] [84] The following locations were used for each participating country: [85] [86]\n\n\nPresenters\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the 2020 planned presenters would be appointed as presenters for the 2021

without any edits to the vocals or any part of the performance itself after the recording A set of production guidelines was also revealed to ensure fairness and the integrity of the recordings [97] All live-on-tape recordings, excluding those of Ireland and the United Kingdom, were later released on 28 and 29 May 2021, as part of the Eurovision Song Celebration: Live-on-Tape shows on the contest's official YouTube channel [98] [99]\n\n\nEntries\nFor this year, delegations were given the option to use pre-recorded backing vocals Each delegation could still choose to use backing

was modified or replaced [258] After failing to meet an extended deadline for submitting an eligible entry, with their second submission \"Pesnya pro zaytsa (Song About Hares)\" also being found to not comply with the rules, it was announced on 26 March 2021 that Belarus was disqualified from the contest [20]\n\n\nUkrainian rehearsal stand-in\nBefore Ukraine's second rehearsal on 12 May, the lead singer of Go_A, Kateryna Pavlenko, reported feeling unwell In accordance with the contest's health and safety protocols, Pavlenko was required to quarantine in her hotel room The other band members tested negative and were able to rehearse, with Dutch stand-in singer Emmie van Stijn providing vocals instead of Pavlenko [259] [260] [261] Pavlenko took a COVID-19 PCR test, which came back negative the following day, allowing her to perform again [262]\n\n\nCOVID-19 infections\nAhead of the \"Turquoise Carpet\" event, one member of each of the Polish and Icelandic delegations tested positive for COVID-19 As a result, those delegations were absent from the event, having gone into self-isolation in accordance with the contest's health and safety protocols [264] [265] The Romanian and Maltese delegations were also absent from the event on a precautionary measure, as they were based in the same hotel as the Polish and Icelandic delegations [266]\n\n\nTechnical issues\nDuring the jury show of the first semi-final, the Romanian, Ukrainian and Maltese delegations reported problems with their performances; most notably, Roxen was heard to be off-beat with the chorus of her song

caused an extended delay after the postcard was shown Co-presenter Chantal Janzen improvised in the green room during the live broadcast to fill in the time [275]\n\n\nFalse allegation of drug use\nDuring a green room segment in the final, Damiano David, lead singer of the Italian band Måneskin, was claimed by some online viewers on social media to be seen snorting a line of cocaine when leaned over a table, although there were no drugs in the footage and the singer was sitting away from the table, close to the Italian delegation members [276] [277] [278] In the band's press conference following their victory, Torbjörn Ek, a journalist working at the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, asked about the allegations, which David denied by suggesting that fellow member Thomas Raggi had broken a glass which David was picking up off the floor, going on to say \"I don't use drugs, please guys, do not say that.\" [279] [280] The band later released a statement on their official Instagram account, stating: \"We are really shocked about what some people are saying about Damiano doing drugs We really are AGAINST drugs and we never used cocaine We are ready to get tested, cause we got nothing to hide.\" [281] The EBU released a statement the following day, stating that the band, their management and the Italian head of delegation had denied any allegation, and the singer in question, Damiano, requested to be tested the same night, but as testing could not be immediately organized, he would \"take a voluntary drug test after arriving home\" It was also confirmed that \"broken glass was found after an on site check\" [282] The allegations were mostly covered by the French press and briefly commented on by the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, [283] but the French participating broadcaster France Télévisions announced that it won't file any official charges, while in the Italian press, it was described as a social media joke that had gone too far and become fake news [284] [285]\n\n\nDutch televoting issues\nThe EBU confirmed on 24 May that they had issues handling the Dutch televote in the final Numerous Dutch viewers complained on social media about their votes not being counted and had only received their confirmation texts hours after the show The EBU later confirmed to NOS that those votes were not counted due to a problem with the Dutch branch of the telecom provider T-Mobile, while clarifying that they had no authority over the issue The Dutch televoting results, therefore, remained valid [287] [288] [289]\n\n\nReception\nItaly's win in the 2021 contest marked the breakthrough of its entrant, Måneskin, in the international music market [290] Following the contest, the band's releases, including their second studio album Teatro d'ira: Vol I (2021), which contained their winning song \"Zitti e buoni\" as well as tracks \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" and \"Coraline\", entered European and global weekly charts [291] [292] [293] [294] \"Zitti e buoni\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" also entered the top ten of the Billboard Global Excl U.S chart [295] [296] [297] \"Zitti e buoni\" became the first Italian-language song in 30 years to chart on the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 17, [298] as well as \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" peaking at number five, [299] which was the first song by an Italian rock band to reach the UK top ten, [300] [301] [302] [303] thus making the band the first Eurovision winning act since Céline Dion to have two songs in the UK top 40, [304] [305] and a top ten hit with a non-contest song [306] Buoyed by viral success on video sharing service TikTok, their 2017 cover of \"Beggin'\" peaked at number six, [307] thus making them the first Italian act and the first Eurovision-associated act to have two songs charting in the UK top ten at the same time [308] [309] \"Beggin'\" later debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 78 and went on to peak at number 13, [310] making them the second Eurovision winning act in recent history to enter the chart, after 2019 winner Duncan Laurence had done so earlier in the year with his winning song \"Arcade\" [311] [312]\n\n\nOther awards\nIn addition to the main winner's trophy, the Marcel Bezençon Awards and the Barbara Dex Award were contested during the Eurovision Song Contest

"**Eurovision Song Contest 2021**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2021 was the 65th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, the annual international song competition produced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and broadcast worldwide. The contest took place in Rotterdam, Netherlands, from 18 to 22 May 2021, at the Ahoy Arena.\n\n**Location**\n\nThe 2021 contest was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, following the country's victory at the 2019 edition with the song \"Arcade\" performed by Duncan Laurence. It was the fifth time that the Netherlands had hosted the contest, having previously done so in 1958, 1970, 1976, and 1980. The selected venue was the 16,400-seat Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, a convention centre and multi-purpose indoor arena located on Ahoyweg, which serves as a venue for many events, including concerts, exhibitions, trade fairs, and conferences. Rotterdam Ahoy had previously hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and was set to host the 2020 contest before its cancellation.\n\n**Host City Selection**\n\nBy Eurovision tradition, the Netherlands received the right to host the Eurovision Song Contest after the country won the competition in 2019. The Dutch host broadcasters NPO, NOS, and AVROTROS launched the bidding process in the same month on 29 May, in which five cities – Arnhem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Maastricht, Rotterdam, and Utrecht – submitted their bid books during a ceremonial event held in Hilversum on 10 July 2019. On 16 July, Maastricht and Rotterdam were shortlisted, and after NPO visited both cities, on 30 August 2019, Rotterdam was announced as the host city of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.\n\n**Participating Countries**\n\nEligibility for potential participation in the Eurovision Song Contest requires a national broadcaster with active EBU membership capable of receiving the contest via the Eurovision network and broadcasting it live nationwide. The EBU issued an invitation to participate in the contest to all active members. Associate member Australia did not need an invitation for the 2021 contest, as it had previously been granted permission to participate at least until 2023.\n\n**Returning Artists**\n\nAfter the cancellation of the 2020 contest, the participating broadcasters of 24 countries announced that, for the 2021 contest, they would internally select the same artists initially selected for 2020. Those artists were: Efendi for Azerbaijan, Montaigne for Australia, Vincent Bueno for Austria, Hooverphonic for Belgium (albeit with a different lead singer), Victoria for Bulgaria, Benny Cristo for the Czech Republic, Tornike Kipiani for Georgia, Stefania for Greece, Eden Alene for Israel, Lesley Roy for Ireland, Daði og Gagnamagnið for Iceland, Samanta Tīna for Latvia, Destiny for Malta, Natalia Gordienko for Moldova, Roxen for Romania, Jeangu Macrooy for the Netherlands, Vasil for North Macedonia, Senhit for San Marino, Hurricane for Serbia, Ana Soklič for Slovenia, Blas Cantó for Spain, Gjon's Tears for Switzerland, Go_A for Ukraine, and James Newman for the United Kingdom. In addition, the artists initially selected for Estonia and Lithuania in 2020, Uku Suviste and The Roop respectively, won their countries' national finals again to represent their countries in 2021.\n\n**Other Countries**\n\nIn November 2019, Democrats for Andorra, the ruling party of former participant Andorra, stated that they would assess the costs in order to grant the country's return to the contest. In 2020, 2009 Andorran representative Susanne Georgi claimed to have secured the funding and held a meeting with Prime Minister of Andorra Xavier Espot Zamora, ultimately agreeing to push the Andorran return to 2022 in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former participants Morocco and Turkey, despite rumours of a possible return in 2021, did not appear on the final list of participants. Active EBU member broadcasters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luxembourg, Monaco, and Slovakia confirmed non-participation prior to the announcement of the participants list by the EBU.\n\n**Associate EBU Members**\n\nIn August 2020, the EBU stated that it did not intend to invite Kazakhstan for this year. Liechtensteiner broadcaster 1 FL TV, despite previous attempts to become an EBU member, halted its plans after director Peter Kölbel's unexpected death and did not resume them due to the lack of sufficient funds and of government support; thus it ruled out debuting in 2021.\n\n**Non-EBU Members**\n\nIn August 2020, the EBU stated that it did not intend to invite Kosovo to become a member.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2021 was a co-production between three related Dutch television organisations – Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO), Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS), and AVROTROS – of which each assumed a different role. Sietse Bakker and Astrid Dutrénit served as executive producers, while Emilie Sickinghe and Jessica Stam served as deputy executive producers. Marnix Kaart, Marc Pos, and Daniel Jelinek served as directors of the three live shows, and Gerben Bakker served as head of show. Background music for the shows was composed by Eric van Tijn.\n\n**Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**\n\nOn 7 May 2020, the Dutch authorities prohibited all mass gatherings in the country until a COVID-19 vaccine became available. The host broadcasters stated that they were assessing the decision and how it would impact the event.\n\n**Visual Design**\n\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the planned visual design and slogan for 2020, \"Open Up\", would be used in 2021 as well. The revamped official logo and branding was unveiled on 4 December 2020. Designed by Clever°Franke, it is \"an abstract presentation inspired by the map of the world and visually connects the location of the capitals of the  [then] 41 participating countries with Rotterdam as Europe's beating heart\". The revamped visual identity, designed by MediaMonks and NEP, was built around patterns and 'tracks' that symbolises the Netherlands and the concept of \"opening up\".\n\n**Stage Design**\n\nDuring the announcement of the dates of the 2021 contest, executive producer Sietse Bakker stated that the planned stage design for 2020 would also be used in 2021. The design was inspired by the slogan \"Open Up\" and the typical Dutch flat landscape. The Eurovision stage was designed by German stage designer Florian Wieder, who also designed the stages for the contests in 2011-2012, 2015, and 2017-2019. Its features included a revolvable primary LED screen that is 52 metres (171 ft) wide and 12 metres (39 ft) high, and a retractable semi-transparent LED screen which could be used as a backdrop for the secondary stage. The stage design was complemented by augmented reality effects. Unlike the 2019 contest, the green room was placed in the main performance venue, and encompassed the entire floor space previously reserved for the standing audience, so as to facilitate social distancing.\n\n**Postcards**\n\nThe \"postcards\" were 40-second video introductions shown on television whilst the stage was being prepared for the next contestant to perform their entry. Filmed between January and April, and directed by Martijn Nieman and Laurence Drenthe, with Kevin Soares serving as executive producer, the 2021 postcards were based on the \"Open Up\" theme of the contest. In a departure from the initial concept created for the 2020 contest owing to travel restriction concerns, the postcards involved the acts being presented through footage shot in their country of origin. These were inserted via chroma keying onto the framework of a 'tiny house' set-up in various locations around the Netherlands, and decorated with items personal to the artist. At the end of each postcard, a light streak hit the house and was refracted into a country-specific coloured streak, mimicking the prism and transitions to the stage, where the ceiling was lit up with that country's flag colours using augmented reality. The postcards were produced by Amsterdam-based production company IDTV, with additional post-production and VFX work by Antwerp-based agency Storm.\n\n**Presenters**\n\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the 2020 planned presenters would be appointed as presenters for the 2021 contest as well. Actress and television host Chantal Janzen, singer and commentator for the contest Jan Smit, singer Edsilia Rombley, who represented the Netherlands in the 1998 and 2007 contests, and beauty vlogger Nikkie de Jager (NikkieTutorials) were announced as presenters for the 2021 contest.\n\n**Format**\n\nFor this year, delegations were given the option to use pre-recorded backing vocals. Each delegation could still choose to use backing singers, whether on or off stage, or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. All lead vocals performing the melody of the song must still be live, according to the rules. As a measure to guarantee that all participants could take part in the contest, every national broadcaster were required to create a 'live-on-tape' backup recording prior to the contest, which could be used if a participant was unable to travel to Rotterdam, or subjected to quarantine on arrival. The recordings took place in a studio setting, in real-time (as it would be at the contest) without any edits to the vocals or any part of the performance itself after the recording. A set of production guidelines was also revealed to ensure fairness and the integrity of the recordings. All live-on-tape recordings, excluding those of Ireland and the United Kingdom, were later released on 28 and 29 May 2021, as part of the Eurovision Song Celebration: Live-on-Tape shows on the contest's official YouTube channel.\n\n**Entries**\n\nFor this year, delegations were given the option to use pre-recorded backing vocals.

\"Turquoise Carpet\" event, one member of each of the Polish and Icelandic delegations tested positive for", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eurovision_Song_Contest_2021\" following this outline:\n\n\nLocation\nThe 2021 contest was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, [3] following the country's victory at the 2019 edition with the song \"Arcade\", performed by Duncan Laurence It was the fifth time that the Netherlands had hosted the contest, having previously done so in 1958, 1970, 1976 and 1980 The selected venue was the 16,400-seat Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam Ahoy, a convention centre and multi-purpose indoor arena located on Ahoyweg, which serves as a venue for many events, including concerts, exhibitions, trade fairs, and conferences Rotterdam Ahoy had previously hosted the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2007, and was set to host the 2020 contest before its cancellation The \"Turquoise Carpet\" event, where the contestants and their delegations [b] are presented before the accredited press and fans, took place at the Rotterdam Cruise Terminal on 16 May 2021 [5] [6]\n\n\nHost city selection\nBy Eurovision tradition, the Netherlands received the right to host the Eurovision Song Contest after the country won the competition in 2019 The Dutch host broadcasters NPO, NOS and AVROTROS launched the bidding process in the same month on 29 May, [7] in which five cities – Arnhem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Maastricht, Rotterdam, and Utrecht – submitted their bid books during a ceremonial event held in Hilversum on 10 July 2019 [8] On 16 July, Maastricht and Rotterdam were shortlisted, [9] and after NPO visited both cities, [10] on 30 August 2019, Rotterdam was announced as the host city of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 [11]\n\n\nParticipating countries\nEligibility for potential participation in the Eurovision Song Contest requires a national broadcaster with active EBU membership capable of receiving the contest via the Eurovision network and broadcasting it live nationwide The EBU issued an invitation to participate in the contest to all active members Associate member Australia did not need an invitation for the 2021 contest, as it had previously been granted permission to participate at least until 2023 [17]\n\n\nReturning artists\nAfter the cancellation of the 2020 contest, the participating broadcasters of 24 countries announced that, for the 2021 contest, they would internally select the same artists initially selected for 2020 Those artists were: Efendi for Azerbaijan,

costs in order to grant the country's return to the contest; [35] in 2020, 2009 Andorran representative Susanne Georgi claimed to have secured the funding [36] and held a meeting with Prime Minister of Andorra Xavier Espot Zamora, ultimately agreeing to push the Andorran return to 2022 in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic [37] Former participants Morocco and Turkey, despite rumours of a possible return in 2021, [38] [39] did not appear on the final list of participants [18] Active EBU member broadcasters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luxembourg, Monaco and Slovakia confirmed

Monaco and Slovakia confirmed non-participation prior to the announcement of the participants list by the EBU [40] [41]\n\n\nAssociate EBU members\nIn August 2020, the EBU stated that it did not intend to invite Kazakhstan for this year [42]\n\n\nNon-EBU members\nIn August 2020, the EBU stated that it did not intend to invite Kosovo to become a member [42] Liechtensteiner broadcaster 1 FL TV, despite previous attempts to become an EBU member, halted its plans after director Peter Kölbel's unexpected death, and did not resume them due to the lack of sufficient funds and of government support; thus it ruled out debuting in 2021 [43]\n\n\nProduction\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2021 was a co-production between three related Dutch television organisations — Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO), Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) and AVROTROS — of which each assumed a different role [44] Sietse Bakker and Astrid Dutrénit served as executive producers, while Emilie Sickinghe and Jessica Stam served as deputy executive producers [45] Marnix Kaart, Marc Pos and Daniel Jelinek served as directors of the three live shows, [46] [47] and Gerben Bakker served as head of show [48] [49] Background music for the shows was composed by Eric van Tijn [50] [51]\n\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nOn 7 May 2020, the Dutch authorities prohibited all mass gatherings in the country until a COVID-19 vaccine became available [55] The host broadcasters stated that they were assessing the decision and how it would impact the event [56]\n\n\nVisual design\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the planned visual design and slogan for 2020, \"Open Up\", would be used in 2021 as well [57] The revamped official logo and branding was unveiled on 4 December 2020 Designed by Clever°Franke, it is \"an abstract presentation inspired by the map of the world and visually connects the location of the capitals of the  [then] 41 participating countries with Rotterdam as Europe's beating heart\" [69] [70] The revamped visual identity, designed by MediaMonks and NEP, was built around patterns and 'tracks' that symbolises the Netherlands and the concept of \"opening up\" [71] [72] [73]\n\n\nStage design\nDuring the announcement of the dates of the 2021 contest, executive producer Sietse Bakker stated that the planned stage design for 2020 would also be used in 2021 [74] The design was inspired by the slogan \"Open Up\" and the typical Dutch flat landscape The Eurovision stage was designed by German stage designer Florian Wieder, who also designed the stages for the contests in 2011–12, 2015, and 2017–19 [75] [76] Its features included a revolvable primary LED screen that is 52 metres (171 ft) wide and 12 metres (39 ft) high, and a retractable semi-transparent LED screen which could be used as a backdrop for the secondary stage [77] [78] [79] The stage design was complemented by augmented reality effects [80] Unlike the 2019 contest, the green room was placed in the main performance venue, and encompassed the entire floor space previously reserved for the standing audience, so as to facilitate social distancing [81]\n\n\nPostcards\nThe \"postcards\" were 40-second video introductions shown on television whilst the stage was being prepared for the next contestant to perform their entry [82] Filmed between January and April, and directed by Martijn Nieman and Laurence Drenthe, with Kevin Soares serving as executive producer, the 2021 postcards were based on the \"Open Up\" theme of the contest In a departure from the initial concept created for the 2020 contest owing to travel restriction concerns, the postcards involved the acts being presented through footage shot in their country of origin These were inserted via chroma keying onto the framework of a 'tiny house' set-up in various locations around the Netherlands, and decorated with items personal to the artist At the end of each postcard, a light streak hit the house and was refracted into a country-specific coloured streak, mimicking the prism and transitions to the stage, where the ceiling was lit up with that country's flag colours using augmented reality [73] The postcards were produced by Amsterdam-based production company IDTV, with additional post-production and VFX work by Antwerp-based agency Storm [83] [84] The following locations were used for each participating country: [85] [86]\n\n\nPresenters\nOn 18 September 2020, along with possible scenarios, the EBU confirmed that the 2020 planned presenters would be appointed as presenters for the 2021 contest as well: actress and television host Chantal Janzen, singer and commentator for the contest Jan Smit, singer Edsilia Rombley, who represented the Netherlands in the 1998 and 2007 contests, and beauty vlogger Nikkie de Jager (NikkieTutorials) [57] [87] [88]\n\n\nFormat\nFor this year, delegations were given the option to use pre-recorded backing vocals Each delegation could still choose to use backing singers, whether on or off stage, or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals All lead vocals performing the melody of the song must still be live, according to the rules [95] [96] As a measure to guarantee that all participants could take part in the contest, every national broadcaster were required to create a 'live-on-tape'

tested, cause we got nothing to hide.\" [281] The EBU released a statement the following day, stating that the band, their management and the Italian head of delegation had denied any allegation, and the singer in question, Damiano, requested to be tested the same night, but as testing could not be immediately organized, he would \"take a voluntary drug test after arriving home\" It was also confirmed that \"broken glass was found after an on site check\" [282] The allegations were mostly covered by the French press and briefly commented on by the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, [283] but the French participating broadcaster France Télévisions announced that it won't file any official charges, while in the Italian press, it was described as a social media joke that had gone too far and become fake news [284] [285]\n\n\nDutch televoting issues\nThe EBU confirmed on 24 May that they had issues handling the Dutch televote in the final Numerous Dutch viewers complained on social media about their votes not being counted and had only received their confirmation texts hours after the show The EBU later confirmed to NOS that those votes were not counted due to a problem with the Dutch branch of the telecom provider T-Mobile, while clarifying that they had no authority over the issue The Dutch televoting results, therefore, remained valid [287] [288] [289]\n\n\nReception\nItaly's win in the 2021 contest marked the breakthrough of its entrant, Måneskin, in the international music market [290] Following the contest, the band's releases, including

weekly charts [291] [292] [293] [294] \"Zitti e buoni\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" also entered the top ten of the Billboard Global Excl U.S chart [295] [296] [297] \"Zitti e buoni\" became the first Italian-language song in 30 years to chart on the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 17, [298] as well as \"I Wanna Be Your Slave\" peaking at number five, [299] which was the first song by an Italian rock band to reach the UK top ten, [300] [301] [302] [303] thus making the band the first Eurovision winning act since Céline Dion to have two songs in the UK top 40, [304] [305] and a top ten hit with a non-contest song [306] Buoyed by viral success on video sharing service TikTok, their 2017 cover of \"Beggin'\" peaked at number six, [307] thus making them the first Italian act and the first Eurovision-associated act to have two songs charting in the UK top ten at the same time [308] [309] \"Beggin'\" later debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 78 and went on to peak at number 13, [310] making them the second Eurovision winning act in recent history to enter the chart, after 2019 winner Duncan Laurence had done so earlier in the year with his winning song \"Arcade\" [311] [312]\n\n\nOther awards\nIn addition to the main winner's trophy, the Marcel Bezençon Awards and the Barbara Dex Award were contested during the Eurovision Song Contest

{"title": "Persecution_of_Uyghurs_in_China", "content": "\nBackground\nUyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China [40] Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity [40] The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region [41]\n\n\nUyghur identity\nUyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China [40] Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity [40] The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region [41]\n\n\nXinjiang conflict\nBoth Uyghurs and the predominantly Han government lay claim to Xinjiang [42] This prompted an ethnic conflict featuring resistance and sporadic violence as Uyghurs sought greater autonomy [43] Sinologists Anna Hayes and Michael Clarke have described Xinjiang as undergoing a process of transition as the Chinese government attempted to transform it from a frontier region to an \"integral\" province of a unitary Chinese state [44]\n\n\nImperial China\nHistorically, certain Chinese dynasties exerted control over parts of modern-day Xinjiang [45] The region fully came under Chinese rule as a result of the westward expansion of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the 1700s, which also saw the conquests of Tibet and Mongolia [46] Xinjiang was a peripheral part of the Qing empire and briefly regained independence during the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) [47] The Uyghur population participated in the Dzungar genocide, resulting in the Qianlong emperor granting them permission to resettle in the former territories of Dzungaria [48] [49]\n\n\nRepublican Era (1912–1949)\nThe region was semi-autonomous during the Republic of China's Warlord Era (1916–1928), with parts controlled by the Kumul Khanate, the Ma Clique and later the warlord Jin Shuren [50] [page needed] In 1933, the breakaway First East Turkestan Republic was established in the Kumul Rebellion, [51] but was conquered the following year by warlord Sheng Shicai with the help of Soviet aid [52] In 1944, the Ili Rebellion led to the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic, which was dependent on the Soviet Union until it was absorbed into the People's Republic of China in 1949 [53]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China (1949–present)\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the Chinese government sponsored a mass migration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang and introduced policies designed to suppress cultural identity and religion in the region [54] During this period, Uyghur independence organizations emerged with some support from the Soviet Union, with the East Turkestan People's Party being the largest in 1968 [55] During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) against the Han Chinese [56]\n\n\nGovernment policies\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest [2]\n\n\nInitial \"Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism\"\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest [2]\n\n\nRegulations since 2017\nFollowing a meeting with Xi in Beijing, Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles As they paraded, he announced a \"smashing, obliterating offensive,\" and declared that they would \"bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People's War.\" He ordered them to \"Round up everyone who should be rounded up,\" and by April 2017 mass arrests had begun [2] New bans and regulations were implemented on April 1, 2017 Abnormally long beards and the wearing of veils in public were both banned Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one's children to attend state-run schools were all prohibited [86]\n\n\nPropaganda campaign\nThe Chinese government has engaged in a propaganda campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang [93] [94] [95] [96] China initially denied the existence of the Xinjiang internment camps and attempted to cover up their existence [97] In 2018, after widespread reporting forced it to admit that the Xinjiang internment camps exist, the Chinese government initiated a campaign to portray the camps as humane and to deny that human rights abuses occurred in Xinjiang [98] In 2020 and 2021, the propaganda campaign expanded due to rising international backlash against government policies, [99] with the Chinese government worrying that it no longer had control of the narrative [97]\n\n\nCounter-terrorism justification\nChina has used the global \"war on terror\" of the 2000s to frame \"separatist\" and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its policies in Xinjiang [122] Scholars such as Sean Roberts and David Tobin have described Islamophobia and fear of terrorism as discourses that have been used within China to justify repressive policies targeting Uyghurs, arguing that violence against Uyghurs should be seen in the context of Chinese colonialism, rather than exclusively as a part of an anti-terrorism campaign [123] According to academic David Tobin, since 2012, \"Chinese education about Uyghurs tends to frame Uyghur identities as racialised, culturally external existential threats to be defeated by state violence or teaching them to be Chinese.\" [124]\n\n\nHuman rights abuses\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang [132] through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse [133] According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs [134] In September 2023, Amnesty International said that they were \"witnessing more and more arbitrary detention\", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into Chinese \"formal prisons\" [135] As of April 2024 [update], the Uyghur Human Rights Project estimated that China had imprisoned 449,000 Uyghurs or about one in 17 [136]\n\n\nInside internment camps\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang [132] through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse [133] According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs [134] In September 2023, Amnesty International said that they were \"witnessing more and more arbitrary detention\", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into Chinese \"formal prisons\" [135] As of April 2024 [update], the Uyghur Human Rights Project estimated that China had imprisoned 449,000 Uyghurs or about one in 17 [136]\n\n\nMass detention\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang [132] through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse [133] According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs [134] In September 2023, Amnesty International said that they were \"witnessing more and more arbitrary detention\", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into Chinese \"formal prisons\" [135] As of April 2024 [update], the Uyghur Human Rights Project estimated that China had imprisoned 449,000 Uyghurs or about one in 17 [136]\n\n\nTorture\nRights groups and others have reported that Uyghurs living in Xinjiang have been subject to torture by authorities [154] [155] [156] A former Chinese police detective, exiled in Europe, revealed to CNN in 2021 details of the systematic torture of Uyghurs in detention camps in Xinjiang, acts in which he had participated, and the fear of his own arrest had he dissented while in China [137] [157]: 24  [failed verification]\n\n\nCompulsory sterilizations and contraception\nIn 2019, reports of forced sterilization in Xinjiang began to surface [165] [166] [167] Zumrat Dwut, a Uyghur woman, says that she was forcibly sterilized by tubal ligation during her time in a camp before her husband was able to get her out through requests to Pakistani diplomats [17] [168] The Xinjiang regional government denies that she was forcibly sterilized [17] Sayragul Sauytbay, an ethnic Kazakh teacher who later fled China, said that rape and torture were commonplace and that authorities forced detainees to take a medicine that left some individuals sterile or cognitively impaired [169]\n\n\nBrainwashing\nFormer detainee Kayrat Samarkand described his camp routine in an article for NPR in 2018: \"In addition to living in cramped quarters, he says inmates had to sing songs praising Chinese leader Xi Jinping before being allowed to eat He says detainees were forced to memorize a list of what he calls '126 lies' about religion: 'Religion is opium, religion is bad, you must believe in no religion, you must believe in the Communist Party,' he remembers 'Only  [the] Communist Party could lead you to the bright future.'\" [163]\n\n\nForced labor\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has imposed forced labor conditions on Uyghurs [235] [236]\n\n\nMedical experiments\nFormer inmates have said that they were subjected to medical experimentation [182] [183]\n\n\nOrganized mass rape and sexual torture\nFrom 2019 to 2021, BBC News and other sources reported accounts of organized mass rape and sexual torture carried out by Chinese authorities in the internment camps [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189]\n\n\nOutside internment camps\nChina performs regular pregnancy checks on minority women within Xinjiang [9] Some CCP officials have spoken about the \"demographic imbalance\" in southern Xinjiang; Liu Yilei, deputy secretary-general of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps CCP Committee, said that the \"proportion of the Han population in southern Xinjiang is too low, less than 15 percent The problem of demographic imbalance is southern Xinjiang's core issue.\" [198]\n\n\nIUDs and birth control\nChina performs regular pregnancy checks on minority women within Xinjiang [9] Some CCP officials have spoken about the \"demographic imbalance\" in southern Xinjiang; Liu Yilei, deputy secretary-general of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps CCP Committee, said that the \"proportion of the Han population in southern Xinjiang is too low, less than 15 percent The problem of demographic imbalance is southern Xinjiang's core issue.\" [198]\n\n\nForced cohabitation, co-sleeping, rape, and abortion\nBeginning in 2018, [213] over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, as well as to watch for frowned-upon religious and cultural practices [214]\n\n\nOrgan harvesting allegations and concerns\nEthan Gutmann [219] states that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent when members of the Uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and \"strike hard campaigns\" during the 1990s According to Gutmann, organ harvesting from Uyghur prisoners dropped off by 1999 with members of the Falun Gong religious group overtaking the Uyghurs as a source of organs [220] [221] [222]\n\n\nForced labor\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has imposed forced labor conditions on Uyghurs [235] [236]\n\n\nOutside China\nChina has been accused of coordinating efforts to coerce Uyghurs living overseas into returning to China, using family still in China to pressure members of the diaspora Chinese officials dismiss the accusations as fabrications [243]\n\n\nUse of biometric and surveillance technology\nChinese authorities use biometric technology to track individuals [213] According to Yahir Imin, Chinese authorities drew his blood, scanned his face, recorded his fingerprints, and documented his voice [213] China collects genetic material from millions of Uyghurs China uses facial recognition technology to sort people by ethnicity, and uses DNA to tell if an individual is a Uyghur China has been accused of creating \"technologies used for hunting people.\" [252]\n\n\nBiometric data\nWhile he was Xinjiang Party secretary, Chen Quanguo launched \"Physicals for All\", purportedly a medical care program \"Every Xinjiang resident between the ages of twelve and 65\" was required to provide DNA samples Also collected were data on \"blood types, fingerprints, voice-prints, iris patterns\" [2] Officials in Tumxuk gathered hundreds of blood samples [252] Tumxuk was named a \"major battlefield for Xinjiang's security work\" by the state news media [252] In January 2018, a forensic DNA lab overseen by the Institute of Forensic Science of China was built there [252] Lab documents showed that it used software created by Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts company [252] This software was used in correspondence to create genetic sequencers, helpful in analyzing DNA In response, Thermo Fisher declared in February that it would cease sales to the Xinjiang region as a result of \"fact-specific assessments\" [252]\n\n\nGPS tracking of cars\nSecurity officials ordered residents in China's northwest region to install GPS tracking devices in their vehicles, allowing authorities to track their movements Authorities said that it \"is necessary to counteract the activities of Islamist extremists and separatists\" An announcement from officials in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture proclaimed that \"there is a severe threat from international terrorism, and cars have been used as a key means of transport for terrorists as well as constantly serving as weapons It is, therefore, necessary to monitor and track all vehicles in the prefecture.\" [259]\n\n\nCultural effects\nMosques, Muslim shrines, and cemeteries in Xinjiang have been the target of systematic destruction [2] [260] An estimated 16,000 mosques have been destroyed or damaged, minarets have been knocked down and \"decorative features scrubbed away or painted over\" [2]\n\n\nMosques\nMosques, Muslim shrines, and cemeteries in Xinjiang have been the target of systematic destruction [2] [260] An estimated 16,000 mosques have been destroyed or damaged, minarets have been knocked down and \"decorative features scrubbed away or painted over\" [2]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 2011, schools in Xinjiang transitioned to what officials called a policy of bilingual education The primary medium of instruction is Standard Chinese, with only a few hours a week devoted to Uyghur literature Despite this policy, few Han children are taught to speak Uyghur [273]\n\n\nDetained academics and religious figures\nIn 2019 the Uyghur Human Rights Project identified 386 Uyghur intellectuals who had been imprisoned, detained, or disappeared since early 2017 [276]\n\n\nCemeteries\nIn September 2019, Agence France-Presse (AFP) visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and witnessed exposed bones remaining in four of them Through an examination of satellite images, the press agency determined that the grave destruction campaign had been ongoing for more than a decade [280] According to a previous AFP report, three cemeteries in Xayar County were among dozens of Uyghur cemeteries destroyed in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019 The unearthed human bones from the cemeteries in Xayar County were discarded [281] [282] In January 2020, a CNN report based on an analysis of Google Maps satellite imagery said that Chinese authorities had destroyed more than 100 graveyards in Xinjiang, primarily Uyghur ones CNN linked the destruction of the cemeteries to the government's campaign to control the Uyghurs and Muslims more broadly The Chinese government claimed that the cemetery and tomb destruction were relocations due to lack of maintenance and that the dead were re-interred in new standardized cemeteries [283] [284]\n\n\nMarriage\nAccording to American journalist Leta Hong Fincher, the Chinese government offered Uyghur couples incentives to have fewer children, and for women to marry non-Uyghurs [291] According to the outreach coordinator for the U.S.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, [292] Zubayra Shamseden, the Chinese government \"wants to erase Uighur culture and identity by remaking its women.\" [293]\n\n\nClothing\nChinese authorities discourage the wearing of headscarves, veils, and other customary Islamic attire On May 20, 2014, a protest broke out in Alakaga (Alaqagha, Alahage), Kuqa (Kuchar, Kuche), Aksu Prefecture when 25 women and schoolgirls were detained for wearing headscarves According to a local official, two died and five were injured when police fired on protesters Subsequently, a Washington Post team was detained in Alakaga and ultimately deported from the region [298] [299] [300] [301]\n\n\nNaming\nRFA reported that in 2015, a list of banned names for children called \"Naming Rules for Ethnic Minorities\", was promulgated in Hotan, banning potential names including \"Islam\", \"Quran\", \"Mecca\", \"Jihad\", \"Imam\", \"Saddam\", \"Hajj\", and \"Medina\" Use of the list was later extended throughout Xinjiang [303] [304] Legislation in 2017 made it illegal to give children names that the Chinese government deemed to \"exaggerate religious fervor\" [86] [303] This prohibition included a ban on naming children \"Muhammad\" [303]\n\n\nChildren's names\nRFA reported that in 2015, a list of banned names for children called \"Naming Rules for Ethnic Minorities\", was promulgated in Hotan,

\"Muhammad\" [303]\n\n\nVillege Names\nA report by NGOs Human Rights Watch and Uyghur Hjelp found that 630 villeges in Xinjiang were renamed to reflect Communist party ideology and remove religious and cultural references Examples include Aq Meschit (\"white mosque\") villege being renamed to Unity villege and Dutar village being renamed to Red Flag village [305] [306]\n\n\nClassification of abuses\nSpecial purpose tribunals, scholars, commentators, journalists, governments, politicians, and diplomats from many countries have labeled China's actions variously as genocide, cultural genocide, ethnocide, settler colonialism, and/or crimes against humanity.\n\n\nEthnocide or cultural genocide\nIn 2008, Michael Clarke, an Australian terrorism scholar, noted that \"there has emerged within the Uighur émigré community a tendency to portray the Uighurs as experiencing a form of 'cultural genocide'\", citing as an example a 2004 speech by World Uyghur Congress president Erkin Alptekin [308] In a 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer described the CCP following \"policies of Uighur cultural genocide\" [309] [310] In 2018, UCL human rights scholar Kate Cronin-Furman argued in 2018 that the Chinese state policies constituted cultural genocide [311] [312]\n\n\nGenocide\nIn April 2019, Cornell University anthropologist Magnus Fiskesjö wrote in Inside Higher Ed that mass arrests of ethnic minority academics and intellectuals in Xinjiang indicated that \"the Chinese regime's current campaign against the native Uighur, Kazakh and other peoples is already a genocide.\" [321] Later, in 2020, Fiskejö wrote in academic journal Monde Chinois that \" [t]he evidence for genocide is thus already massive, and must, at the very least, be regarded as sufficient for prosecution under international law.. the number of competent authorities around the world concurring that this is indeed genocide are increasing.\" [322]\n\n\nCrimes against humanity\nIn June 2019, the China Tribunal, an independent judicial investigation into forced organ transplantation in China concluded that crimes against humanity had been committed beyond reasonable doubt against China's Uyghur Muslim and Falun Gong populations [354] [355]\n\n\nSettler colonialism\nIn addition to other classifications, some academics and researchers have also termed the abuses as part of an ongoing project of Han settler colonialism [359] [360] [361] [362] [363]\n\n\nView of discourse\nWriting in 2023, academic and former UK diplomat Kerry Brown observes that the clash of labels between western and Chinese discourse on the issue of Xinjiang makes it nearly impossible to reach an empirical or neutral description of China's actions in Xinjiang [92]: 136 \n\n\nInternational responses\nIn July 2019, 22 countries [note 1] issued a joint letter to the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), condemning China's mass

disclose their dealings with Xinjiang, [423] the president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association said that blanket import bans on cotton or other products from Xinjiang from such legislation would \"wreak havoc\" on legitimate supply chains in the apparel industry because Xinjiang cotton exports are often intermingled with cotton from other countries and there is no available origin-tracing technology for cotton fibers [490] On September 22, 2020, the US Chamber of Commerce issued a letter stating that the act \"would prove ineffective and may hinder efforts to prevent

abuses\n\nThe abuses against the Uyghurs and related ethnic groups have been denied by the Chinese government These denials have been both internal and external [562] The Chinese government has conducted propaganda campaigns on social media to further denial of the abuses In 2021, the Chinese government posted thousands of videos to social media showing residents of Xinjiang denying claims of abuse made by Mike Pompeo; a joint investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times found the videos were part of an influence campaign coordinated by the CCP's Central Propaganda Department

refers to the systematic suppression and repression of the Uyghur people, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group native to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China. The Uyghurs have faced a long history of marginalization, oppression, and violence at the hands of the Chinese government, with the most recent wave of persecution beginning in the 2000s.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang, a vast region in northwest China bordering Central Asia. They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China. Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity. The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region.\n\n**Uyghur Identity**\n\nUyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang. They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China. Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity. The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region.\n\n**Xinjiang Conflict**\n\nBoth Uyghurs and the predominantly Han government lay claim to Xinjiang. This prompted an ethnic conflict featuring resistance and sporadic violence as Uyghurs sought greater autonomy. Sinologists Anna Hayes and Michael Clarke have described Xinjiang as undergoing a process of transition as the Chinese government attempted to transform it from a frontier region to an \"integral\" province of a unitary Chinese state.\n\n**Imperial China**\n\nHistorically, certain Chinese dynasties exerted control over parts of modern-day Xinjiang. The region fully came under Chinese rule as a result of the westward expansion of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the 1700s, which also saw the conquests of Tibet and Mongolia. Xinjiang was a peripheral part of the Qing empire and briefly regained independence during the Dungan Revolt (1862-1877). The Uyghur population participated in the Dzungar genocide, resulting in the Qianlong emperor granting them permission to resettle in the former territories of Dzungaria.\n\n**Republican Era (1912-1949)**\n\nThe region was semi-autonomous during the Republic of China's Warlord Era (1916-1928), with parts controlled by the Kumul Khanate, the Ma Clique, and later the warlord Jin Shuren. In 1933, the breakaway First East Turkestan Republic was established in the Kumul Rebellion, but was conquered the following year by warlord Sheng Shicai with the help of Soviet aid. In 1944, the Ili Rebellion led to the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic, which was dependent on the Soviet Union until it was absorbed into the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\n**People's Republic of China (1949-present)**\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the Chinese government sponsored a mass migration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang and introduced policies designed to suppress cultural identity and religion in the region. During this period, Uyghur independence organizations emerged with some support from the Soviet Union, with the East Turkestan People's Party being the largest in 1968. During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) against the Han Chinese.\n\n**Government Policies**\n\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country. Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest.\n\n**Initial \"Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism\"**\n\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country. Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest.\n\n**Regulations since 2017**\n\nFollowing a meeting with Xi in Beijing, Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles. As they paraded, he announced a \"smashing, obliterating offensive,\" and declared that they would \"bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People's War.\" He ordered them to \"Round up everyone who should be rounded up,\" and by April 2017, mass arrests had begun. New bans and regulations were implemented on April 1, 2017. Abnormally long beards and the wearing of veils in public were both banned. Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one's children to attend state-run schools were all prohibited.\n\n**Propaganda Campaign**\n\nThe Chinese government has engaged in a propaganda campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang. China initially denied the existence of the Xinjiang internment camps and attempted to cover up their existence. In 2018, after widespread reporting forced it to admit that the Xinjiang internment camps exist, the Chinese government initiated a campaign to portray the camps as humane and to deny that human rights abuses occurred in Xinjiang.\n\n**Counter-Terrorism Justification**\n\nChina has used the global \"war on terror\" of the 2000s to frame \"separatist\" and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its policies in Xinjiang. Scholars such as Sean Roberts and David Tobin have described Islamophobia and fear of terrorism as discourses that have been used within China to justify repressive policies targeting Uyghurs, arguing that violence against Uyghurs should be seen in the context of Chinese colonialism, rather than exclusively as a part of an anti-terrorism campaign.\n\n**Human Rights Abuses**\n\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse. According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs. In September 2023, Amnesty International said that they were \"witnessing more and more arbitrary detention\", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into Chinese \"formal prisons\".\n\n**Inside Internment Camps**\n\nFormer detainees have said that they were subjected to medical experimentatio", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Persecution_of_Uyghurs_in_China\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nUyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China [40] Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity [40] The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region [41]\n\n\nUyghur identity\nUyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group native to Xinjiang They are distinct from the Han Chinese, the predominant ethnic group in China [40] Uyghurs are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China, after the Hui, and Sunni Islam is an important aspect of Uyghur identity [40] The Uyghur language has around 10 million speakers and is shared with other minority groups in the region [41]\n\n\nXinjiang conflict\nBoth Uyghurs and the predominantly Han government lay claim to Xinjiang [42] This prompted an ethnic conflict featuring resistance and sporadic violence as Uyghurs sought greater autonomy [43] Sinologists Anna Hayes and Michael Clarke have described Xinjiang as undergoing a process of transition as the Chinese government attempted to transform it from a frontier region to an \"integral\" province of a unitary Chinese state [44]\n\n\nImperial China\nHistorically, certain Chinese dynasties exerted control over parts of modern-day Xinjiang [45] The region fully came under Chinese rule as a result of the westward expansion of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty during the 1700s, which also saw the conquests of Tibet and Mongolia [46] Xinjiang was a peripheral part of the Qing empire and briefly regained independence during the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) [47] The Uyghur population participated in the Dzungar genocide, resulting in the Qianlong emperor granting them permission to resettle in the former territories of Dzungaria [48] [49]\n\n\nRepublican Era (1912–1949)\nThe region was semi-autonomous during the Republic of China's Warlord Era (1916–1928), with parts controlled by the Kumul Khanate, the Ma Clique and later the warlord Jin Shuren [50] [page needed] In 1933, the breakaway First East Turkestan Republic was established in the Kumul Rebellion, [51] but was conquered the following year by warlord Sheng Shicai with the help of Soviet aid [52] In 1944, the Ili Rebellion led to the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic, which was dependent on the Soviet Union until it was absorbed into the People's Republic of China in 1949 [53]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China (1949–present)\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the Chinese government sponsored a mass migration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang and introduced policies designed to suppress cultural identity and religion in the region [54] During this period, Uyghur independence organizations emerged with some support from the Soviet Union, with the East Turkestan People's Party being the largest in 1968 [55] During the 1970s, the Soviets supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) against the Han Chinese [56]\n\n\nGovernment policies\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest [2]\n\n\nInitial \"Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism\"\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese state began to emphasize weiwen (stability maintenance) which led to an intensification of repression across the country Some within the Party warned that increased action to combat instability which might not even exist could lead to a spiral of repression and unrest [2]\n\n\nRegulations since 2017\nFollowing a meeting with Xi in Beijing, Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles As they paraded, he announced a \"smashing, obliterating offensive,\" and declared that they would \"bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People's War.\" He ordered them to \"Round up everyone who should be rounded up,\" and by April 2017 mass arrests had begun [2] New bans and regulations were implemented on April 1, 2017 Abnormally long beards and the wearing of veils in public were both banned Not watching state-run television or listening to radio broadcasts, refusing to abide by family planning policies, or refusing to allow one's children to attend state-run schools were all prohibited [86]\n\n\nPropaganda campaign\nThe Chinese government has engaged in a propaganda campaign to defend its actions in Xinjiang [93] [94] [95] [96] China initially denied the existence of the Xinjiang internment camps and attempted to cover up their existence [97] In 2018, after widespread reporting forced it to admit that the Xinjiang internment camps exist, the Chinese government initiated a campaign to portray the camps as humane and to deny that human rights abuses occurred in Xinjiang [98] In 2020 and 2021, the propaganda campaign expanded due to rising international backlash against government policies, [99] with the Chinese government worrying that it no longer had control of the narrative [97]\n\n\nCounter-terrorism justification\nChina has used the global \"war on terror\" of the 2000s to frame \"separatist\" and ethnic unrest as acts of Islamist terrorism to legitimize its policies in Xinjiang [122] Scholars such as Sean Roberts and David Tobin have described Islamophobia and fear of terrorism as discourses that have been used within China to justify repressive policies targeting Uyghurs, arguing that violence against Uyghurs should be seen in the context of Chinese colonialism, rather than exclusively as a part of an anti-terrorism campaign [123] According to academic David Tobin, since 2012, \"Chinese education about Uyghurs tends to frame Uyghur identities as racialised, culturally external existential threats to be defeated by state violence or teaching them to be Chinese.\" [124]\n\n\nHuman rights abuses\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang [132] through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse [133] According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs [134] In September 2023, Amnesty International said that they were \"witnessing more and more arbitrary detention\", but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into Chinese \"formal prisons\" [135] As of April 2024 [update], the Uyghur Human Rights Project estimated that China had imprisoned 449,000 Uyghurs or about one in 17 [136]\n\n\nInside internment camps\nEspecially since 2016, internment camps have been a part of the Chinese government's strategy to govern Xinjiang [132] through the detention of ethnic minorities en masse [133] According to Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the camps, the mass internments peaked in 2018 and have abated since then, with officials shifting focus towards forced labor programs [134] In

Project estimated that China had imprisoned 449,000 Uyghurs or about one in 17 [136]\n\n\nTorture\nRights groups and others have reported that Uyghurs living in Xinjiang have been subject to torture by authorities [154] [155] [156] A former Chinese police detective, exiled in Europe, revealed to CNN in 2021 details of the systematic torture of Uyghurs in detention camps in Xinjiang, acts in which he had participated, and the fear of his own arrest had he dissented while in China [137] [157]: 24  [failed verification]\n\n\nCompulsory sterilizations and contraception\nIn 2019, reports of forced sterilization in Xinjiang began to surface [165] [166] [167] Zumrat Dwut, a Uyghur woman, says that she was forcibly sterilized by tubal ligation during her time in a camp before her husband was able to get her out through requests to Pakistani diplomats [17] [168] The Xinjiang regional government denies that she was forcibly sterilized [17] Sayragul Sauytbay, an ethnic Kazakh teacher who later fled China, said that rape and torture were commonplace and that authorities forced detainees to take a medicine that left some individuals sterile or cognitively impaired [169]\n\n\nBrainwashing\nFormer detainee Kayrat Samarkand described his camp routine in an article for NPR in 2018: \"In addition to living in cramped quarters, he says inmates had to sing songs praising Chinese leader Xi Jinping before being allowed to eat He says detainees were forced to memorize a list of what he calls '126 lies' about religion: 'Religion is opium, religion is bad, you must believe in no religion, you must believe in the Communist Party,' he remembers 'Only  [the] Communist Party could lead you to the bright future.'\" [163]\n\n\nForced labor\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has imposed forced labor conditions on Uyghurs [235] [236]\n\n\nMedical experiments\nFormer inmates have said that they were subjected to medical experimentation [182] [183]\n\n\nOrganized mass rape and sexual torture\nFrom 2019 to 2021, BBC News and other sources reported accounts of organized mass rape and sexual torture carried out by Chinese authorities in the internment camps [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] [189]\n\n\nOutside internment camps\nChina performs regular pregnancy checks on minority women within Xinjiang [9] Some CCP officials have spoken about the \"demographic imbalance\" in southern Xinjiang; Liu Yilei, deputy secretary-general of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps CCP Committee, said that the \"proportion of the Han population in southern Xinjiang is too low, less than 15 percent The problem of demographic imbalance is southern Xinjiang's core issue.\" [198]\n\n\nIUDs and birth control\nChina performs regular pregnancy checks on minority women within Xinjiang [9] Some CCP officials have spoken about the \"demographic imbalance\" in southern Xinjiang; Liu Yilei, deputy secretary-general of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps CCP Committee, said that the \"proportion of the Han population in southern Xinjiang is too low, less than 15 percent The problem of demographic imbalance is southern Xinjiang's core issue.\" [198]\n\n\nForced cohabitation, co-sleeping, rape, and abortion\nBeginning in 2018, [213] over one million Chinese government workers began forcibly living in the homes of Uyghur families to monitor and assess resistance to assimilation, as well as to watch for frowned-upon religious and cultural practices [214]\n\n\nOrgan harvesting allegations and concerns\nEthan Gutmann [219] states that organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience became prevalent when members of the Uyghur ethnic group were targeted in security crackdowns and \"strike hard campaigns\" during the 1990s According to Gutmann, organ harvesting from Uyghur prisoners dropped off by 1999 with members of the Falun Gong religious group overtaking the Uyghurs as a source of organs [220] [221] [222]\n\n\nForced labor\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has imposed forced labor conditions on Uyghurs [235] [236]\n\n\nOutside China\nChina has been accused of coordinating efforts to coerce Uyghurs living overseas into returning to China, using family still in China to pressure members of the diaspora Chinese officials dismiss the accusations as fabrications [243]\n\n\nUse of biometric and surveillance technology\nChinese authorities use biometric technology to track individuals [213] According to Yahir Imin, Chinese authorities drew his blood, scanned his face, recorded his fingerprints, and documented his voice [213] China collects genetic material from millions of Uyghurs China uses facial recognition technology to sort people by ethnicity, and uses DNA to tell if an individual is a Uyghur China has been accused of creating \"technologies used for hunting people.\" [252]\n\n\nBiometric data\nWhile he was Xinjiang Party secretary, Chen Quanguo launched \"Physicals for All\", purportedly a medical care program \"Every Xinjiang resident between the ages of twelve and 65\" was required to provide DNA samples Also collected were data on \"blood types, fingerprints, voice-prints, iris patterns\" [2] Officials in Tumxuk gathered hundreds of blood samples [252] Tumxuk was named a \"major battlefield for Xinjiang's security work\" by the state news media [252] In January 2018, a forensic DNA lab overseen by the Institute of Forensic Science of China was built there [252] Lab documents showed that it used software created by Thermo Fisher Scientific, a Massachusetts company [252] This software was used in correspondence to create genetic sequencers, helpful in analyzing DNA In response, Thermo Fisher declared in February that it would cease sales to the Xinjiang region as a result of \"fact-specific assessments\" [252]\n\n\nGPS tracking of cars\nSecurity officials ordered residents in China's northwest region to install GPS tracking devices in their vehicles, allowing authorities to track their movements Authorities said that it \"is necessary to counteract the activities of Islamist extremists and separatists\" An announcement from officials in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture proclaimed that \"there is a severe threat from international terrorism, and cars have been used as a key means of transport for terrorists as well as constantly serving as weapons It is, therefore, necessary to monitor and track all vehicles in the prefecture.\" [259]\n\n\nCultural effects\nMosques, Muslim shrines, and cemeteries in Xinjiang have been the target of systematic destruction [2] [260] An estimated 16,000 mosques have been destroyed or damaged, minarets have been knocked down and \"decorative features scrubbed away or painted over\" [2]\n\n\nMosques\nMosques, Muslim shrines, and cemeteries in Xinjiang have been the target of systematic destruction [2] [260] An estimated 16,000 mosques have been destroyed or damaged, minarets have been knocked down and \"decorative features scrubbed away or painted over\" [2]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 2011, schools in Xinjiang transitioned to what officials called a policy of bilingual education The primary medium of instruction is Standard Chinese, with only a few hours a week devoted to Uyghur literature Despite this policy, few Han children are taught to speak Uyghur [273]\n\n\nDetained academics and religious figures\nIn 2019 the Uyghur Human Rights Project identified 386 Uyghur intellectuals who had been imprisoned, detained, or disappeared since early 2017 [276]\n\n\nCemeteries\nIn September 2019, Agence France-Presse (AFP) visited 13 destroyed cemeteries across four cities and witnessed exposed bones remaining in four of them Through an examination of satellite images, the press agency determined that the grave destruction campaign had been ongoing for more than a decade [280] According to a previous AFP report, three cemeteries in Xayar County were among dozens of Uyghur cemeteries destroyed in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2019 The unearthed human bones from the cemeteries in Xayar County were discarded [281] [282] In January 2020, a CNN report based on an analysis of Google Maps satellite imagery said that Chinese authorities had destroyed more than 100 graveyards in Xinjiang, primarily Uyghur ones CNN linked the destruction of the cemeteries to the government's campaign to control the Uyghurs and Muslims more broadly The Chinese government claimed that the cemetery and tomb destruction were relocations due to lack of maintenance and that the dead were re-interred in new standardized cemeteries [283] [284]\n\n\nMarriage\nAccording to American journalist Leta Hong Fincher, the Chinese government offered Uyghur couples incentives to have fewer children, and for women to marry non-Uyghurs [291] According to the outreach coordinator for the U.S.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, [292] Zubayra Shamseden, the Chinese government \"wants to erase Uighur culture and identity by remaking its women.\" [293]\n\n\nClothing\nChinese authorities discourage the wearing of headscarves, veils, and other customary Islamic attire On May 20, 2014, a protest broke out in Alakaga (Alaqagha, Alahage), Kuqa (Kuchar, Kuche), Aksu Prefecture when 25 women and schoolgirls were detained for wearing headscarves According to a local official, two died and five were injured when police fired on protesters Subsequently, a Washington Post team was detained in Alakaga and ultimately deported from the region [298] [299] [300] [301]\n\n\nNaming\nRFA reported that in 2015, a list of banned names for children called \"Naming Rules for Ethnic Minorities\", was promulgated in Hotan, banning potential names including \"Islam\", \"Quran\", \"Mecca\", \"Jihad\", \"Imam\", \"Saddam\", \"Hajj\", and \"Medina\" Use of the list was later extended throughout Xinjiang [303] [304] Legislation in 2017 made it illegal to give children names that the Chinese government deemed to \"exaggerate religious fervor\" [86] [303] This prohibition included a ban on naming children \"Muhammad\" [303]\n\n\nChildren's names\nRFA reported that in 2015, a list of banned names for children called \"Naming Rules for Ethnic Minorities\", was promulgated in Hotan, banning potential names including \"Islam\", \"Quran\", \"Mecca\", \"Jihad\", \"Imam\", \"Saddam\", \"Hajj\", and \"Medina\" Use of the list was later extended throughout Xinjiang [303] [304] Legislation in 2017 made it illegal to give children names that the Chinese government deemed to \"exaggerate religious fervor\" [86] [303] This prohibition included a ban on naming children \"Muhammad\" [303]\n\n\nVillege Names\nA report by NGOs Human Rights Watch and Uyghur Hjelp found that 630 villeges in Xinjiang were renamed to reflect Communist party ideology and remove religious and cultural references Examples include Aq Meschit (\"white mosque\") villege being renamed to Unity villege and Dutar village being renamed to Red Flag village [305] [306]\n\n\nClassification of abuses\nSpecial purpose tribunals, scholars, commentators, journalists, governments, politicians, and diplomats from many countries have labeled China's actions variously as genocide, cultural genocide, ethnocide, settler colonialism, and/or crimes against humanity.\n\n\nEthnocide or cultural genocide\nIn 2008, Michael Clarke, an Australian terrorism scholar, noted that \"there has emerged within the Uighur émigré community a tendency to portray the Uighurs as experiencing a form of 'cultural genocide'\", citing as an example a 2004 speech by World Uyghur Congress president Erkin Alptekin [308] In a 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Uyghur activist Rebiya Kadeer described the CCP following \"policies of Uighur cultural genocide\" [309] [310] In 2018, UCL human rights scholar Kate Cronin-Furman argued in 2018 that the Chinese state policies constituted cultural genocide [311] [312]\n\n\nGenocide\nIn April 2019, Cornell University anthropologist Magnus Fiskesjö wrote in Inside Higher Ed that mass arrests of ethnic minority academics and intellectuals in Xinjiang indicated that \"the Chinese regime's current campaign against the native Uighur, Kazakh and other peoples is already a genocide.\" [321] Later, in 2020, Fiskejö wrote in academic journal Monde Chinois that \" [t]he evidence for genocide is thus already massive, and must, at the very least, be regarded as sufficient for prosecution under international law.. the number of competent authorities around the world concurring that this is indeed genocide are increasing.\" [322]\n\n\nCrimes against humanity\nIn June 2019, the China Tribunal, an independent judicial investigation into forced organ transplantation in China concluded that crimes against humanity had been committed beyond reasonable doubt against China's Uyghur Muslim and Falun Gong populations [354] [355]\n\n\nSettler colonialism\nIn addition to other classifications, some academics and researchers have also termed the abuses as part of an ongoing project of Han settler colonialism [359] [360] [361] [362] [363]\n\n\nView of discourse\nWriting in 2023, academic and former UK diplomat Kerry Brown observes that the clash of labels between western and Chinese discourse on the issue of Xinjiang makes it nearly impossible to reach an empirical or neutral description of China's actions in Xinjiang [92]: 136 \n\n\nInternational responses\nIn July 2019, 22 countries [note 1] issued a joint letter to the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), condemning China's mass detention of Uyghurs and other minorities, calling upon China to \"refrain from the arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uyghurs, and other Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang\" [364] [365] [366] In the same session, 50 countries [note 2] issued a joint letter supporting China's Xinjiang policies, [364] [367] criticizing the practice of \"politicizing human rights issues\" The letter stated, \"China has invited a number of diplomats, international organizations officials and journalist to Xinjiang\" and that \"what they saw and heard in Xinjiang completely

Parliament awarded its Sakharov Prize for Freedom and Thought to Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur intellectual and activist who had been sentenced to life in prison on charges pertaining to Uyghur separatism [388] [389] [390] As of March 2021, China has prohibited European Union diplomats from visiting Tohti [391] [392] The European Union has called upon China to release Tohti from his detention in prison [393]\n\n\nReactions by country\nSeveral African countries, including Algeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Nigeria, and Somalia, signed a July 2019 letter that publicly praised China's human rights record and dismissed reported abuses in Xinjiang [397] [398] Other African countries, including Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Morocco,

China's repression of its Uighur minority a \"great shame for humanity\" [457] [458] In response to a question on the reported death of Uyghur musician Abdurehim Heyit within the Xinjiang internment camps, the spokesperson stated \"more than one million Uyghur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons\" [457] In July 2019, Turkish journalists from Milliyet and Aydınlık interviewed Heyit in Ürümqi who denied that he was tortured [459] [460]\n\n\nEurope\nIn May 2021, testimony about the situation in Xinjiang to the foreign affairs committee of the Belgian chamber of representatives had to be postponed after a massive DDOS attack on the .be domain [467] [468] In June 2021, the Belgian Parliament's foreign

[38]\n\n\nFrance\nIn December 2020, France said that it would oppose the proposed Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between China and the European Union over the use of forced labour of Uyghurs [469] In February 2021, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced \"institutionalised repression\" of Uyghurs at the UNHRC [470]\nFrench parliament in January 2022 denounced a \"genocide\" by China against its Uyghur Muslim population in a resolution [36]\n\n\nFinland\nIn March 2021 Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin tweeted a condemnation of the human rights situation in Xinjiang [472]\n\n\nLithuania\nIn May 2021, the Lithuanian Parliament passed a resolution recognizing that the Chinese government's human rights abuses against the Uyghurs constitute genocide [35]\n\n\nNetherlands\nOn February 25, 2021, the Netherlands parliament passed a non-binding resolution declaring the Chinese government's actions against the Uyghurs as a genocide [33] [473] [474]\n\n\nUkraine\nUkraine had originally signed onto a 22 June 2021 statement to the UNHRC which called for independent observers to be provided immediate access to Xinjiang, but withdrew its signature two days later Ukrainian lawmakers later stated that China had forced the policy pivot by threatening to limit trade and block a scheduled shipment of at least 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses [475]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nOn 10 October 2020, Britain's Shadow Foreign Secretary, Lisa Nandy suggested that Britain must oppose giving China a seat on the UNHRC in protest against its abuse of Uyghur Muslims She added that the UN must be allowed to conduct an inquiry into possible crimes against humanity in Xinjiang [476]\n\n\nOceania\nIn September 2019, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne stated, \"I have previously raised Australia's concerns about reports of mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim peoples in Xinjiang We have consistently called for China to cease the arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim groups We have raised these concerns—and we will continue to raise them—both bilaterally and in relevant international meetings.\" [485] In March 2021, the federal government blocked a motion by Rex Patrick to recognize China's treatment of the Uyghurs as a genocide [486] [487]\n\n\nAustralia\nIn September 2019, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne

federal government blocked a motion by Rex Patrick to recognize China's treatment of the Uyghurs as a genocide [486] [487]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nIn 2018, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern raised the issue of Xinjiang while visiting Guangdong Party Secretary Leader Li Xi Ardern also raised such concerns during China's periodic review at the UN in November 2018, to immediate pushback from China [488]\n\n\nMultinational corporations\nIn reaction to the proposed Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2020 to impose sanctions on \"any foreign person who 'knowingly engages'\" and require firms to disclose their dealings with Xinjiang, [423] the president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association said that blanket import bans on cotton or other products from Xinjiang from such legislation would \"wreak havoc\" on legitimate supply chains in the apparel industry because Xinjiang cotton exports are often intermingled with cotton from other countries and there is no available origin-tracing technology for cotton fibers [490] On September 22, 2020, the US Chamber of Commerce issued a letter stating that the act \"would prove ineffective and may hinder efforts to prevent human rights abuses.\" [491] Major companies with supply chain ties to Xinjiang, including Apple Inc., Nike, Inc and The Coca-Cola Company, have lobbied Congress to weaken the legislation and amend its provisions [492]\n\n\nReligious groups\nIn July 2020, Marie van der Zyl, the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, pointed to similarities between the mass detention of Uyghur Muslims and concentration camps in the Holocaust [496] [497] On International Holocaust Remembrance Day in January 2021, van der Zyl urged the Chinese government to step back from committing atrocities [498]\n\n\nOther organizations\nIn January 2020, President Ghulam Osman Yaghma of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile wrote that \"the world is silently witnessing another Holocaust like genocide in East Turkistan....as the President of East Turkistan Government-in-Exile, on behalf of East Turkistan and its people, we again call on the international community including world governments to acknowledge and recognize China's brutal Holocaust like the oppression of East Turkistan's people as a genocide.\" [519]\n\n\nProtests\nThe Chinese Consulate in Almaty, Kazakhstan has been the site of a daily protest demonstration, primarily made up of old women whose relatives are believed to be detained in China [543] In 2020 Uyghur protesters outside the Consulate General of China, Los Angeles were joined by activists representing Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong [544]\n\n\n2022 Winter Olympics Boycott\nIn the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers which made

Committee (IOC) to reconsider the decision to hold the Olympics in Beijing [552] [553] In a non-binding motion in February 2021, the Canadian House of Commons called for the IOC to move the Olympics to a new location [554] The IOC met with activists in late 2020 about their request to move the Olympics [555] In March 2021, the President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach opposed a boycott, which would also damage the IOC image and finances, and said that the IOC must stay out of politics [555] On 6 April 2021, a senior U.S State Department official stated that the department's position \"on the 2022 Olympics has not changed\" and that it has not \"discussed and  [is] not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners.\" [556] Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, India, Kosovo, Lithuania, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics [557]\n\n\nLegal cases\nOn 4 January 2022, nineteen Uyghurs, with the help of lawyer Gulden Sonmez, filed a criminal case for torture, rape, crimes against humanity and genocide in the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office against Chinese officials Sonmez stated that Turkish legislation recognises universal jurisdiction for the offences alleged in the case [558]\n\n\nPublications\nNury Turkel published the book No Escape: The True Story of China's Genocide of the Uyghurs in 2022, which documented his personal story on the repression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang [559] [560] The book was long-listed for the 2022 Moore Prize for Human Rights Writing [561]\n\n\nDenial of abuses\n\nThe abuses against the Uyghurs and related ethnic groups have been denied by the Chinese government These denials have been both internal and external [562] The Chinese government has conducted propaganda campaigns on social media to further denial of the abuses In 2021, the Chinese government posted thousands of videos to social media showing residents of Xinjiang denying claims of abuse made by Mike Pompeo; a joint investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times found the videos were part of an influence campaign coordinated by the CCP's Central Propaganda Department [118] They have also used their existing disinformation networks, including social media trolls, to deny genocide and other human rights abuses against Uyghurs [563]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory

The Switchblade is a small, portable, and highly maneuverable UAV that is intended to provide precision firepower and reconnaissance capabilities to infantry units.\n\n## History\n\nThe Switchblade was designed by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and developed by the United States Army. The UAV was created in response to the need for a lightweight, portable, and highly effective system for responding to enemy ambushes in Afghanistan. Close air support takes time to arrive, is costly to operate, and risks collateral damage in urban areas. Troop-carried guided missiles, such as the FGM-148 Javelin, are also significantly larger, heavier, and more expensive, and only a few, if any, are carried on a typical patrol. Human-portable UAVs like the Raven or Puma can spot threats but lack weapons. The Switchblade fills this gap by providing a backpackable, relatively inexpensive system with sensors to help spot enemy fighters and an explosive warhead to attack them from above, which is especially helpful in dug-in positions like rooftops or ridge lines.\n\n## Design\n\nThe Switchblade 300 is designed as an expendable UAV to offer precision firepower for platoon-sized infantry units. The UAV is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry and deploy. The Switchblade 300 is equipped with a GPS locator, a day/night camera, and a warhead that is equivalent to a 40 mm grenade.

resistance against Russian imperialism has its origins from 1785 during the time of Sheikh Mansur, the first imam (leader) of the Caucasian peoples He united various North-Caucasian nations under his command to resist Russian invasions and expansion       \n\n\nDissolution of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation Treaty\nRussia became an independent state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991 The Russian Federation was widely accepted as the successor state to the USSR, but it lost a significant amount of its military and economic power Ethnic Russians made up more than 80% of the population of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but significant ethnic and religious differences posed a threat of political disintegration in some regions In the Soviet period, some of Russia's approximately 100 nationalities were granted ethnic enclaves that had various formal federal rights attached Relations of these entities with the federal government and demands for autonomy erupted into a major political issue in the early 1990s Boris Yeltsin incorporated these demands into his 1990 election campaign by claiming that their resolution was a high priority.\n\n\nChechen declaration of independence\nMeanwhile, on 6 September 1991, militants of the All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP) party, created by the former Soviet Air Force general Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed a session of the Supreme Soviet of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with the aim of asserting independence The storming caused the death of the head of Grozny's branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Vitaliy Kutsenko, who was defenestrated or fell while trying to escape This effectively dissolved the government of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union [29] [30] [31]\n\n\nInternal conflict in Chechnya and the Grozny–Moscow tensions\nThe economy of Chechnya collapsed as Dudayev severed economic links with Russia while black market trading, arms trafficking and counterfeiting grew [33] Violence and social disruption increased and the marginal social groups, such as unemployed young men from the countryside, became armed [34] Ethnic Russians and other non-Chechens faced constant harassment as they fell outside the vendetta system which protected the Chechens to a certain extent [35] From 1991 to 1994, tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity left the republic [35]\n\n\nInitial stages of conflict\nOn 11 December 1994, Russian forces launched a three-pronged ground attack towards Grozny The main attack was temporarily halted by the deputy commander of the Russian Ground Forces, General Eduard Vorobyov  [ru], who then resigned in protest, stating that it is \"a crime\" to \"send the army against its own people.\" [41] Many in the Russian military and government opposed the war as well Yeltsin's adviser on nationality affairs, Emil Pain  [ru], and Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense General Boris Gromov (commander of the Afghan War), also resigned in protest of the invasion (\"It will be a bloodbath, another Afghanistan\", Gromov said on television), as did General Boris Poliakov More than 800 professional soldiers and officers refused to take part in the operation; of these, 83 were convicted by military courts and the rest were discharged Later General Lev Rokhlin also refused to be decorated as a Hero of the Russian Federation for his part in the war.\n\n\nInitial conflict\nOn 11 December 1994, Russian forces launched a three-pronged ground attack

General Boris Poliakov More than 800 professional soldiers and officers refused to take part in the operation; of these, 83 were convicted by military courts and the rest were discharged Later General Lev Rokhlin also refused to be decorated as a Hero of the Russian Federation for his part in the war.\n\n\nStorming of Grozny\nWhen the Russians besieged the Chechen capital, thousands of civilians died from a week-long series of air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden [43] The initial assault on New Year's Eve 1994 ended in a big Russian defeat, resulting in many casualties and at first a nearly complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces The fighting claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained conscripts; the worst losses were inflicted on the 131st 'Maikop' Motor Rifle Brigade, which was destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station [41] Despite the early Chechen defeat of the New Year's assault and the many further casualties that the Russians had suffered, Grozny was eventually conquered by Russian forces after an urban warfare campaign After armored assaults failed, the Russian military set out to take the city using air power and artillery At the same time, the Russian military accused the Chechen fighters of using civilians as human shields by preventing them from leaving the capital as it was bombarded [44] On 7 January 1995, the Russian Major-General Viktor Vorobyov was killed by mortar fire, becoming the first on a long list of Russian generals to be killed in Chechnya On 19 January, despite many casualties, Russian forces seized the ruins of the Chechen presidential palace, which had been fought over for more than three weeks as the Chechens abandoned their positions in the ruins of the downtown area The battle for the southern part of the city continued until the official end on 6 March 1995.\n\n\nContinued Russian offensive\nFollowing the fall of Grozny, the Russian government slowly and methodically expanded its control over the lowland areas and then into the mountains In what was dubbed the worst massacre in the war, the OMON and other federal forces killed up to 300 civilians while seizing the border village of Samashki on 7 April (several hundred more were detained and beaten or otherwise tortured) [47] In the southern mountains, the Russians launched an offensive along all the front on 15 April, advancing in large columns of 200–300 vehicles [48] The ChRI forces defended the city of Argun, moving their military headquarters first to surrounded Shali, then shortly after to the village of Serzhen'-Yurt as they were forced into the mountains and finally to Shamil Basayev's ancestral stronghold of Vedeno Chechnya's second-largest city of Gudermes was surrendered without a fight but the village of Shatoy was fought for and defended by the men of Ruslan Gelayev Eventually, the Chechen command withdrew from the area of Vedeno to the Chechen opposition-aligned village of Dargo and from there to Benoy [49] According to an estimate cited in a United States Army analysis report, between January and May 1995, when the Russian forces conquered most of the republic in the conventional campaign, their losses in Chechnya were approximately 2,800 killed, 10,000 wounded and more than 500 missing or captured [50] Some Chechen fighters infiltrated occupied areas, hiding in crowds of returning refugees [51]\n\n\nContinuation of the conflict and mounting Russian defeats\nOn 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command [57] In the same month in March, Chechen fighters and Russian federal troops clashed near the village of Samashki The losses on the Russian side amounted to 28 killed and 116 wounded [58]\n\n\nGrowing Russian defeats and unpopularity in Russia\nOn 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command [57] In the same month in March, Chechen fighters and Russian federal troops clashed near the village of Samashki The losses on the Russian side amounted to 28 killed and 116 wounded [58]\n\n\nThird Battle of Grozny and the Khasavyurt Accord\nDespite Russian troops in and around Grozny numbering approximately 12,000, more than 1,500 Chechen guerrillas (whose numbers soon swelled) overran the key districts within hours in an operation prepared and led by Aslan Maskhadov (who named it Operation Zero) and Shamil Basayev (who called it Operation Jihad) The fighters then laid siege to the Russian posts and bases and the government compound in the city centre, while a number of Chechens deemed to be Russian collaborators were rounded up, detained and, in some cases, executed [62] At the same time, Russian troops in the cities of Argun and Gudermes were also surrounded in their garrisons Several attempts by the armored columns to rescue the units trapped in Grozny were repelled with heavy Russian casualties (the 276th Motorized Regiment of 900 men suffered 50% casualties in a two-day attempt to reach the city centre) Russian military officials said that more than 200 soldiers had been killed and nearly 800 wounded in five days of fighting, and that an unknown number were missing; Chechens put the number of Russian dead at close to 1,000 Thousands of troops were either taken prisoner or surrounded and largely disarmed, their heavy weapons and ammunition commandeered by Chechen fighters.\n\n\nHuman rights violations and war crimes\nHuman rights organizations accused Russian forces of engaging in indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force whenever they encountered resistance, resulting in numerous civilian deaths (According to Human Rights Watch, Russian artillery and rocket attacks killed at least 267 civilians during the December 1995 raid by the Chechens on the city of Gudermes [47]) Throughout the span of the first Chechen war, Russian forces have been accused by human rights organizations of starting a brutal war with total disregard for humanitarian law, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary civilian casualties among the Chechen population The main strategy in the Russian war effort had been to use heavy artillery and air strikes leading to numerous indiscriminate attacks on civilians This has led to Western and Chechen sources calling the Russian strategy deliberate terror bombing on parts of Russia [66] According to Human Rights Watch, the campaign was \"unparalleled in the area since World War II for its scope and destructiveness, followed by months of indiscriminate and targeted fire against civilians\" [67]   Due to  ethnic Chechens in Grozny seeking refuge among their respective teips in the surrounding villages of the countryside, a high proportion of initial civilian casualties were inflicted against ethnic Russians who were unable to find viable escape routes The villages were also attacked from the first weeks of the conflict (Russian cluster bombs, for example, killed at least 55 civilians during the 3 January 1995 Shali cluster bomb attack).\n\n\nSpread of the war\nThe declaration by Chechnya's Chief Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov that the ChRI was waging a Jihad (struggle) against Russia raised the spectre that Jihadis from other regions and even outside Russia would enter the war  [citation needed]\n\n\nAftermath\nAccording to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 3,826 troops were killed, 17,892 troops were wounded, and 1,906 troops are missing in action [19] According to the NVO, the authoritative Russian independent military weekly, at least 5,362 Russian soldiers died during the war, 52,000 Russian soldiers were wounded or became diseased and some 3,000 more Russian soldiers were still missing in 2005 [20] However, the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia estimated that the total number of Russian military deaths was 14,000, [25] based on information which it collected from wounded troops and soldiers' relatives (only counting regular troops, i.e not the kontraktniki (contract soldiers, not conscripts) and members of the special service forces) [78] The list which contains the names of the dead soldiers, drawn up by the Human Rights Center \"Memorial\", contains 4,393 names [79] In 2009, the official number of Russian troops who fought in the two wars and were still missing in Chechnya and presumed dead was some 700, while about 400 remains of the missing servicemen were said to have been recovered up to that point [80] The Russian military was notorious for hiding casualties.\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 3,826 troops were killed, 17,892 troops were wounded, and 1,906 troops are missing in action [19] According to the NVO, the authoritative Russian independent military weekly, at least 5,362 Russian soldiers died during the war, 52,000 Russian soldiers were wounded or became diseased and some 3,000 more Russian soldiers were still missing in 2005 [20] However, the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia estimated that the total number of Russian military deaths was 14,000, [25] based on information which it collected from wounded troops

Chechnya and presumed dead was some 700, while about 400 remains of the missing servicemen were said to have been recovered up to that point [80] The Russian military was notorious for hiding casualties.\n\n\nPrisoners and missing persons\nIn the Khasavyurt Accord, both sides agreed to an \"all for all\" exchange of prisoners to be carried out at the end of the war However, despite this commitment, many persons remained forcibly detained A partial analysis of the list of 1,432 reported missing found that, as of 30 October 1996, at least 139 Chechens were still being forcibly detained by the Russian side; it was entirely unclear how many of these men were alive [87] As of mid-January 1997, the Chechens still held between 700 and 1,000 Russian soldiers and officers as prisoners of war, according to Human Rights Watch [87] According to Amnesty International that same month, 1,058 Russian soldiers and officers were being detained by Chechen fighters who were willing to release them in exchange for members of Chechen armed groups [88] American freelance journalist Andrew Shumack has been missing from the Chechen capital, Grozny since July 1995 and is presumed dead [89]\n\n\nMoscow peace treaty\nThe Khasavyurt Accord paved the way for the signing of two further agreements between Russia and Chechnya In mid-November 1996, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed an agreement on economic relations and reparations to Chechens who had been affected by the 1994–96 war In February 1997, Russia also approved an amnesty for Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters alike who committed illegal acts in connection with the War in Chechnya between December 1994 and September 1996 [91]\n\n\nForeign policy implications\nFrom the outset of the First Chechen conflict, Russian authorities struggled to reconcile new international expectations with widespread accusations of Soviet-style heaviness in their execution of the war For example, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who was generally regarded as a Western-leaning liberal, made the following remark when questioned about Russia's conduct during the war; \"'Generally speaking, it is not only our right but our duty not to allow uncontrolled armed formations on our territory The Foreign Ministry stands on guard over the country's territorial unity International law says that a country not only can but must use force in such instances .. I say it was the right thing to do .. The way in which it was done is not my business.\" [93] These attitudes contributed greatly to the growing doubts in the West as to whether Russia was sincere in its stated intentions to implement democratic reforms The general disdain for Russian behavior in the Western political establishment contrasted heavily with widespread support in the Russian public [94] Domestic political authorities' arguments emphasizing stability and the restoration of order resonated with the public and quickly became an issue of state identity.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**First Chechen War**\n\nThe First Chechen War was a military conflict between Russia and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) that lasted from 1994 to 1996.

Ethnic Russians made up more than 80% of the population of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, but significant ethnic and religious differences posed a threat of political disintegration in some regions. In the Soviet period, some of Russia's approximately 100 nationalities were granted ethnic enclaves that had various formal federal rights attached. Relations of these entities with the federal government and demands for autonomy erupted into a major political issue in the early 1990s.\n\n**Chechen declaration of independence**\n\nMeanwhile, on 6 September 1991, militants of the All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP) party, created by the former Soviet Air Force general Dzhokhar Dudayev, stormed a session of the Supreme Soviet of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with the aim of asserting independence. The storming caused the death of the head of Grozny's branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Vitaliy Kutsenko, who was defenestrated or fell while trying to escape. This effectively dissolved the government of the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union.\n\n**Internal conflict in Chechnya and the Grozny-Moscow tensions**\n\nThe economy of Chechnya collapsed as Dudayev severed economic links with Russia while black market trading, arms trafficking and counterfeiting grew. Violence and social disruption increased and the marginal social groups, such as unemployed young men from the countryside, became armed. Ethnic Russians and other non-Chechens faced constant harassment as they fell outside the vendetta system which protected the Chechens to a certain extent. From 1991 to 1994, tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity left the republic.\n\n**Initial stages of conflict**\n\nOn 11 December 1994, Russian forces launched a three-pronged ground attack towards Grozny. The main attack was temporarily halted by the deputy commander of the Russian Ground Forces, General Eduard Vorobyov, who then resigned in protest, stating that it is \"a crime\" to \"send the army against its own people.\" Many in the Russian military and government opposed the war as well. Yeltsin's adviser on nationality affairs, Emil Pain, and Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense General Boris Gromov (commander of the Afghan War), also resigned in protest of the invasion.\n\n**Storming of Grozny**\n\nWhen the Russians besieged the Chechen capital, thousands of civilians died from a week-long series of air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden. The initial assault on New Year's Eve 1994 ended in a big Russian defeat, resulting in many casualties and at first a nearly complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces. The fighting claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained conscripts; the worst losses were inflicted on the 131st 'Maikop' Motor Rifle Brigade, which was destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station.\n\n**Continued Russian offensive**\n\nFollowing the fall of Grozny, the Russian government slowly and methodically expanded its control over the lowland areas and then into the mountains. In what was dubbed the worst massacre in the war, the OMON and other federal forces killed up to 300 civilians while seizing the border village of Samashki on 7 April. In the southern mountains, the Russians launched an offensive along all the front on 15 April, advancing in large columns of 200–300 vehicles. The ChRI forces defended the city of Argun, moving their military headquarters first to surrounded Shali, then shortly after to the village of Serzhen'-Yurt as they were forced into the mountains and finally to Shamil Basayev's ancestral stronghold of Vedeno. Chechnya's second-largest city of Gudermes was surrendered without a fight but the village of Shatoy was fought for and defended by the men of Ruslan Gelayev.\n\n**Continuation of the conflict and mounting Russian defeats**\n\nOn 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition. During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing. After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city. Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command.\n\n**Third Battle", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"First_Chechen_War\"

air raids and artillery bombardments in the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the destruction of Dresden [43] The initial assault on New Year's Eve 1994 ended in a big Russian defeat, resulting in many casualties and at first a nearly complete breakdown of morale in the Russian forces The fighting claimed the lives of an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 Russian soldiers, mostly barely trained conscripts; the worst losses were inflicted on the 131st 'Maikop' Motor Rifle Brigade, which was destroyed in the fighting near the central railway station [41] Despite the early Chechen defeat of the New Year's assault and the many further casualties that the Russians had suffered, Grozny was eventually conquered by Russian forces after an urban warfare campaign After armored assaults failed, the Russian military set out to take the city using air power and artillery At the same time, the Russian military accused the Chechen fighters of using civilians as human shields by preventing them from leaving the capital as it was bombarded [44] On 7 January 1995, the Russian Major-General Viktor Vorobyov was killed by mortar fire, becoming the first on a long list of Russian generals to be killed in Chechnya On 19 January, despite many casualties, Russian forces seized the ruins of the Chechen presidential palace, which had been fought over for more than three weeks as the Chechens abandoned their positions in the ruins of the downtown area The battle for the southern part of the city continued until the official end on 6 March 1995.\n\n\nContinued Russian offensive\nFollowing the fall of Grozny, the Russian government slowly and methodically expanded its control over the lowland areas and then into the mountains In what was dubbed the worst massacre in the war, the OMON and other federal forces killed up to 300 civilians while seizing the border village of Samashki on 7 April (several hundred more were detained and beaten or otherwise tortured) [47] In the southern mountains, the Russians launched an offensive along all the front on 15 April, advancing in large columns of 200–300 vehicles [48] The ChRI forces defended the city of Argun, moving their military headquarters first to surrounded Shali, then shortly after to the village of Serzhen'-Yurt as they were forced into the mountains and finally to Shamil Basayev's ancestral stronghold of Vedeno Chechnya's second-largest city of Gudermes was surrendered without a fight but the village of Shatoy was fought for and defended by the men of Ruslan Gelayev Eventually, the Chechen command withdrew from the area of Vedeno to the Chechen opposition-aligned village of Dargo and from there to Benoy [49] According to an estimate cited in a United States Army analysis report, between January and May 1995, when the Russian forces conquered most of the republic in the conventional campaign, their losses in Chechnya were approximately 2,800 killed, 10,000 wounded and more than 500 missing or captured [50] Some Chechen fighters infiltrated occupied areas, hiding in crowds of returning refugees [51]\n\n\nContinuation of the conflict and mounting Russian defeats\nOn 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command [57] In the same month in March, Chechen fighters and Russian federal troops clashed near the village of Samashki The losses on the Russian side amounted to 28 killed and 116 wounded [58]\n\n\nGrowing Russian defeats and unpopularity in Russia\nOn 6 March 1996, a group of Chechen fighters infiltrated Grozny and launched a three-day surprise raid on the city, taking most of it and capturing caches of weapons and ammunition During the battle, much of the Russian troops were wiped out, with most of them surrendering or routing After two columns of Russian reinforcements were destroyed on the roads leading to the city, Russian troops eventually gave up on trying to reach the trapped soldiers in the city Chechen fighters subsequently withdrew from the city on orders from the high command [57] In the same month in March, Chechen fighters and Russian federal troops clashed near the village of Samashki The losses on the Russian side amounted to 28 killed and 116 wounded [58]\n\n\nThird Battle of Grozny and the Khasavyurt Accord\nDespite Russian troops in and around Grozny numbering approximately 12,000, more than 1,500 Chechen guerrillas (whose numbers soon swelled) overran the key districts within hours in an operation prepared and led by Aslan Maskhadov (who named it Operation Zero) and Shamil Basayev (who called it Operation Jihad) The fighters then laid siege to the Russian posts and bases and the government compound in the city centre, while a number of Chechens deemed to be Russian collaborators were rounded up, detained and, in some cases, executed [62] At the same time, Russian troops in the cities of Argun and Gudermes were also surrounded in their garrisons Several attempts by the armored columns to rescue the units trapped in Grozny were repelled with heavy Russian casualties (the 276th Motorized Regiment of 900 men suffered 50% casualties in a two-day attempt to reach the city centre) Russian military officials said that more than 200 soldiers had been killed and nearly 800 wounded in five days of fighting, and that an unknown number were missing; Chechens put the number of Russian dead at close to 1,000 Thousands of troops were either taken prisoner or surrounded and largely disarmed, their heavy weapons and ammunition commandeered by Chechen fighters.\n\n\nHuman rights violations and war crimes\nHuman rights organizations accused Russian forces of engaging in indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force whenever they encountered resistance, resulting in numerous civilian deaths (According to Human Rights Watch, Russian artillery and rocket attacks killed at least 267 civilians during the December 1995 raid by the Chechens on the city of Gudermes [47]) Throughout the span of the first Chechen war, Russian forces have been accused by human rights organizations of starting a brutal war with total disregard for humanitarian law, causing tens of thousands of unnecessary civilian casualties among the Chechen population The main strategy in the Russian war effort had been to use heavy artillery and air strikes leading to numerous indiscriminate attacks on civilians This has led to Western and Chechen sources calling the Russian strategy deliberate terror bombing on parts of Russia [66] According to Human Rights Watch, the campaign was \"unparalleled in the area since World War II for its scope and destructiveness, followed by months of indiscriminate and targeted fire against civilians\" [67]   Due to  ethnic Chechens in Grozny seeking refuge among their respective teips in the surrounding villages of the countryside, a high proportion of initial civilian casualties were inflicted against ethnic Russians who were unable to find viable escape routes The villages were also attacked from the first weeks of the conflict (Russian cluster bombs, for example, killed at least 55 civilians during the 3 January 1995 Shali cluster bomb attack).\n\n\nSpread of the war\nThe declaration by Chechnya's Chief Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov that the ChRI was waging a Jihad (struggle) against Russia raised the spectre that Jihadis from other regions and even outside Russia would enter the war  [citation needed]\n\n\nAftermath\nAccording to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 3,826 troops were killed, 17,892 troops were wounded, and 1,906 troops are missing in action [19] According to the NVO, the authoritative Russian independent military weekly, at least 5,362 Russian soldiers died during the war, 52,000 Russian soldiers were wounded or became diseased and some 3,000 more Russian soldiers were still missing in 2005 [20] However, the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia estimated that the total number of Russian military deaths was 14,000, [25] based on information which it collected from wounded troops and soldiers' relatives (only counting regular troops, i.e not the kontraktniki (contract soldiers, not conscripts) and members of the special service forces) [78] The list which contains the names of the dead soldiers, drawn up by the Human Rights Center \"Memorial\", contains 4,393 names [79] In 2009, the official number of Russian troops who fought in the two wars and were still missing in Chechnya and presumed dead was some 700, while about 400 remains of the missing servicemen were said to have been recovered up to that point [80] The Russian military was notorious for hiding casualties.\n\n\nCasualties\nAccording to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 3,826 troops were killed, 17,892 troops were wounded, and 1,906 troops are missing in action [19] According to the NVO, the authoritative Russian independent military weekly, at least 5,362 Russian soldiers died during the war, 52,000 Russian soldiers were wounded or became diseased and some 3,000 more Russian soldiers were still missing in 2005 [20] However, the Committee

some 700, while about 400 remains of the missing servicemen were said to have been recovered up to that point [80] The Russian military was notorious for hiding casualties.\n\n\nPrisoners and missing persons\nIn the Khasavyurt Accord, both sides agreed to an \"all for all\" exchange of prisoners to be carried out at the end of the war However, despite this commitment, many persons remained forcibly detained A partial analysis of the list of 1,432 reported missing found that, as of 30 October 1996, at least 139 Chechens were still being forcibly detained by the Russian side; it was entirely unclear how many of these men were alive [87] As of mid-January 1997, the Chechens still held between 700 and 1,000 Russian soldiers and officers as prisoners of war, according to Human Rights Watch [87] According to Amnesty International that same month, 1,058 Russian soldiers and officers were being detained by Chechen fighters who were willing to release them in exchange for members of Chechen armed groups [88] American freelance journalist Andrew Shumack has been missing from the Chechen capital, Grozny since July 1995 and is presumed dead [89]\n\n\nMoscow peace treaty\nThe Khasavyurt Accord paved the way for the signing of two further agreements between Russia and Chechnya In mid-November 1996, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed an agreement on economic relations and reparations to Chechens who had been affected by the 1994–96 war In February 1997, Russia also approved an amnesty for Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters alike who committed illegal acts in connection with the War in Chechnya between December 1994 and September 1996 [91]\n\n\nForeign policy implications\nFrom the outset of the First Chechen conflict, Russian authorities struggled to reconcile new international expectations with widespread accusations of Soviet-style heaviness in their execution of the war For example, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, who was generally regarded as a Western-leaning liberal, made the following remark when questioned about Russia's conduct during the war; \"'Generally speaking, it is not only our right but our duty not to allow uncontrolled armed formations on our territory The Foreign Ministry stands on guard over the country's territorial unity International law says that a country not only can but must use force in such instances .. I say it was the right thing to do .. The way in which it was done is not my business.\" [93] These attitudes contributed greatly to the growing doubts in the West as to whether Russia was sincere in its stated intentions to implement democratic reforms The general disdain for Russian behavior in the Western political establishment contrasted heavily with widespread support in the Russian public [94] Domestic political authorities' arguments emphasizing stability and the restoration of order resonated with the public and quickly became an issue of state identity.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [12] [13] while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [14]\n\n\nEvent\nOn the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura (accompanied by

with Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch taking on SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair The two started the match by slapping and hair pulling Flair attempted the Top Rope Moonsault, but Lynch shoved her off the top rope to the floor Lynch applied the Dis-Arm-Her, but Flair countered with a Powerbomb Lynch performed a leg drop to the back of Flair's neck while she was caught up in the ropes Lynch attempted her own version of Flair's figure-four leglock, but Flair reversed the pressure until Lynch made it to the ropes Flair performed a Queen's Boot for a nearfall Lynch performed an Inverted DDT and a Manhandle Slam, but Flair put her foot on the bottom rope to void the pin Flair performed a Top Rope Moonsault on Lynch outside the ring Back inside, Flair did a roll-up pin, but the referee caught her holding onto the ropes for leverage Lynch then reversed the pin and used the ropes herself as leverage to win the match, giving Raw its first match of the night [1]\n\n\nMain

and threw Big E into the steel steps Reigns performed a Superman Punch, and back in the ring, Reigns attacked Big E's injured knee and performed a second Spear on Big E to win the match Although this gave SmackDown another win, it was only SmackDown's second win for the night, with the final score being Raw 5, SmackDown 2 [1]\n\n\nReception\nThe event received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike, specifically towards the Survivor Series elimination matches, which received average reviews, but the battle royal being the most disliked match Criticism was also directed at promoting the event as the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut but without a live appearance or even a pre-recorded message by The Rock himself The Rock only appeared in archive footage that highlighted his career [1] [29]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe following night on Raw, Mr McMahon addressed the entire Raw and SmackDown roster over the stolen Cleopatra Egg, stating that whoever found it would be rewarded with a WWE Championship match He also threatened to fire Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville if the egg was not found Sami Zayn revealed to McMahon that it was Austin Theory who stole the egg, and Theory explained that he had just wanted to take a selfie with it McMahon was first mad at Theory, but then told Theory he showed intestinal fortitude, rewarding him a WWE Championship match against Big E in the main event, much to Zayn's confusion and displeasure Theory, however, lost the title match This began a storyline between McMahon and Theory, [30] with Theory becoming McMahon's protégé until McMahon announced his first retirement in July 2022 [31]\n\n\nRaw\nThe following night on Raw, Mr McMahon addressed the entire Raw and SmackDown roster over the stolen Cleopatra Egg,

Battle Royal took place, where the winner would face Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at a future date In the end, Jeff Hardy thought he won by last eliminating Happy Corbin, but Sami Zayn, who wasn't officially eliminated, eliminated Hardy to win the match Immediately afterwards, it was announced that Brock Lesnar's suspension was lifted and he would return the following week [34] There, he convinced Zayn into cashing in his title shot that night It was then announced that the winner would defend the title against Lesnar at Day 1 Just before the match, Lesnar attacked Zayn, allowing Reigns to quickly defeat Zayn and retain the title, officially scheduling Reigns to defend the championship against Lesnar at Day 1 [35]\n\n\nFuture\nThe 2021 Survivor Series would be the final Survivor Series to carry the brand supremacy theme, as on September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 event would not be based on this concept He also announced that the 2022 event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match; this in turn discontinued NXT's annual WarGames event, which was held from 2017 until 2021 The 2022 Survivor Series was subsequently rebranded as \"Survivor Series: WarGames\" [36] That would be the theme for future Survivor Series events

The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history, it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Royal Rumble, originally referred to as the \"Big Four\". As of August 2021, it is considered one of the \"Big Five\", along with Money in the Bank.

In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view worldwide and the WWE Network in international markets, it was the first Survivor Series to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March. Tickets went on sale on September 24 through SeatGeek.\n\n**Storylines**\n\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown.\n\n**Event**\n\nOn the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion Shinsuke Nakamura (accompanied by Rick Boogs) faced Raw's United States Champion Damian Priest. Priest controlled the match early while Boogs played his guitar to try and distract Priest. Priest performed a Falcon Arrow for a near-fall, Nakamura countered a Chokeslam with his knee. Priest performed a South of Heaven for a nearfall, Priest attempted The Reckoning, but Nakamura countered with an armbar. In the end, Priest broke Boogs' guitar over his knee and hit Boogs over the head before accidentally hitting Nakamura with it and getting himself disqualified, thus Nakamura won, giving SmackDown the first match of the night.\n\n**Preliminary matches**\n\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch taking on SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair. The two started the match by slapping and hair pulling. Flair attempted the Top Rope Moonsault, but Lynch shoved her off the top rope to the floor. Lynch applied the Dis-Arm-Her, but Flair countered with a Powerbomb. Lynch performed a leg drop to the back of Flair's neck while she was caught up in the ropes. Lynch attempted her own version of Flair's figure-four leglock, but Flair reversed the pressure until Lynch made it to the ropes. Flair performed a Queen's Boot for a nearfall, Lynch performed an Inverted DDT and a Manhandle Slam, but Flair put her foot on the bottom rope to void the pin. Flair performed a Top Rope Moonsault on Lynch outside the ring. Back inside, Flair did a roll-up pin, but the referee caught her holding onto the ropes for leverage. Lynch then reversed the pin and used the ropes herself as leverage to win the match, giving Raw its first match of the night.\n\n**Main event**\n\nIn the main event, Raw's WWE Champion Big E faced SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman). Big E attempted the Apron Splash, but Reigns moved out of the way. Big E applied a Stretch Muffler, but Reigns escaped. Reigns performed a Rock Bottom on Big E for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman Punch twice, but missed a Spear attempt and Big E performed a Spear through the ropes to put Reigns on the floor. Big E attempted a second one, but Reigns countered with the Guillotine submission. Big E countered the submission and performed a Big Ending on Reigns, who got his foot on the bottom rope during the pin. Reigns performed a Spear for a nearfall. On the outside, Big E threw Reigns into the announce table and the barricade, but Reigns reversed another attack and threw Big E into the steel steps. Reigns performed a Superman Punch, and back in the ring, Reigns attacked Big E's injured knee and performed a second Spear on Big E to win the match. Although this gave SmackDown another win, it was only SmackDown's second win for the night, with the final score being Raw 5, SmackDown 2.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe event received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike, specifically towards the Survivor Series elimination matches, which received average reviews, but the battle royal being the most disliked match. Criticism was also directed at promoting the event as the 25th anniversary of The Rock's WWE debut but without a live appearance or even a pre-recorded message by The Rock himself. The Rock only appeared in archive footage that highlighted his career.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe following night on Raw, Mr. McMahon addressed the entire Raw and SmackDown roster over the stolen Cleopatra Egg, stating that whoever found it would be rewarded with a WWE Championship match. He also threatened to fire Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville if the egg was not found. Sami Zayn revealed to McMahon that it was Austin Theory who stole the egg, and Theory explained that he had just wanted to take a selfie with it. McMahon was first mad at Theory, but then told Theory he showed intestinal fortitude, rewarding him a WWE Championship match against Big E in the main event, much to Zayn's confusion and displeasure. Theory, however, lost the title match. This began a storyline between McMahon and Theory, with Theory becoming McMahon's protégé until McMahon announced his first retirement in July 2022.\n\n**SmackDown**\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, a Black Friday Invitational Battle Royal took place, where the winner would face Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at a future date. In the end, Jeff Hardy thought he won by last eliminating Happy Corbin, but Sami Zayn, who wasn't officially eliminated, eliminated Hardy to win the match. Immediately afterwards, it was announced that Brock Lesnar's suspension was lifted and he would return the following week. There, he convinced Zayn into cashing in his title shot that night. It was then announced that the winner would defend the title against Lesnar at Day 1. Just before the match, Lesnar attacked Zayn, allowing Reigns to quickly defeat Zayn and retain the title, officially scheduling Reigns to defend the championship against Lesnar at Day 1.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe 2021 Survivor Series would be the final Survivor Series to carry the brand supremacy theme, as on September 19, 2022, WWE executive Triple H announced that the 2022 event would not be based on this concept. He also announced that the 2022 event would feature two WarGames matches, one each for the men and women, marking the first time for a main roster WWE event to feature the match; this in turn discontinued NXT's annual WarGames event, which was held from 2017 until 2021.

{"title": "M62_coach_bombing", "content": "\nThe bombing\nThe bombed coach had been specially commissioned to carry British Army and Royal Air Force personnel—on weekend leave with their families—to and from bases at Catterick and Darlington during a period of railway strike action sourcing from a labour dispute [15] [16] The vehicle itself had departed from Manchester in the late evening of Sunday 3 February and was travelling at approximately 60 mph (100 km/h) along the M62 motorway en route to Catterick Garrison [17] Shortly after midnight, as most of those aboard were sleeping and when the bus was travelling between junctions 26 and 27 of the M62, the bomb—concealed within a suitcase or similar parcel inside the coach's luggage compartment—exploded [18] [n 2]\n\n\nImmediate efforts\nOne surviving soldier later described his recollections of having been blown through the emergency doors of the coach, only to find himself lying upon the ground viewing a \"mangled wreck\" This soldier later assisted a young girl aged approximately 17 with injured legs whom he found lying on her back approximately 200 yards (180 m) \"back up the  [motorway]\" According to this individual, the girl had repeatedly hysterically screamed: \"My God! The floor just opened up and I fell through!\" as he provided medical assistance [25] Another survivor, nine-year-old David Dendeck, regained consciousness to find himself trapped in the wreckage of the coach listening to his 14-year-old sister, Catherine, shouting his name as he observed other survivors \"screaming and running up the verge\" alongside the coach [26]\n\n\nFatalities\nThe explosion killed eleven people outright and wounded over thirty others, [28] one of whom died four days later Amongst the dead were nine soldiers – two from the Royal Artillery, three from the Royal Corps of Signals and four from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers Four of the servicemen killed in the bombing were teenagers and all but one of the serving personnel killed in the explosion hailed from Greater Manchester [n 4] Twelve others upon the coach suffered severe injuries, [30] including a six-year-old boy, who was badly burned [21]\n\n\nReaction\nAlthough mainland Britain had seen several IRA attacks—successful or otherwise—within the previous year, the M62 coach bombing was the most severe attack upon the mainland to date [33] Press and public alike were incensed, with the BBC describing the bombing as \"one of the IRA's worst mainland terror attacks\" [34] and national newspapers such as The Guardian describing the atrocity as an \"IRA outrage on the British mainland\" [35] [36] In Northern Ireland, the Ulster Defence Association launched a renewed wave of revenge attacks on Irish Catholics in response to the M62 coach bomb, promising their campaign of sectarian violence would continue unabated \"until the IRA ceased  [their] bombing in England\" Within days of the bombings, loyalists had shot and killed three Catholic civilians and wounded a further eight, some critically [37]\n\n\nIRA Army Council response\nIn an interview shortly after the bombing, IRA Army Council member Dáithí Ó Conaill was challenged over the choice of target, the lack of the official IRA protocol of a given advance warning, and the resulting deaths of civilians, including children Ó Conaill replied that the coach was selected as a legitimate target because IRA intelligence had indicated that the vehicle was commissioned to carry military personnel only [40]\n\n\nInvestigation\nAlthough a police spokesman initially emphasised that investigators were keeping an \"open mind\" as to the cause of the explosion, in the days immediately following the bombing, suspicion quickly fell upon the IRA, [41] which had extended its campaign to England the previous year [42] and had recently begun efforts to force the British Government to transfer four IRA members serving life imprisonment in English jails and currently engaging in hunger strikes to prisons in Northern Ireland [43] [37]\n\n\nArrest of Judith Ward\nAt 6:30 a.m on 14 February, [45] police encountered a 25-year-old mentally ill English woman named Judith Teresa Ward [46] [n 6] standing in a shop doorway in Liverpool city centre, seeking shelter from the cold and rain [48] As her driving licence had been issued in Northern Ireland and a letter from the Royal Ulster Constabulary was also found in her possession, Ward was detained for questioning [49]\n\n\nConfessions\nThe ensuing police investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent George Oldfield This investigation would prove to be rushed, careless and ultimately forged, but culminated in Ward claiming culpability for the M62 coach bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions Initially, Ward was questioned by two members of the Metropolitan Police Service at Wakefield's Police Training College The conclusion of the Detective Inspector and Detective Constable following the first of their three interviews with Ward on 16 February was that she held \"poor knowledge\" of the construction of explosive devices and, although discrepancies were noted between the various oral statements Ward made and earlier statements she and others had provided to investigators, by 7:45 p.m., Ward had provided a written confession claiming culpability for the M62 coach bombing [52] She would initially be charged with conspiracy to cause an explosion on the M62 motorway on 18 February [53]\n\n\nSuspect background\nWard had been born in Stockport, England, on 10 January 1949 She was the second of five children born to an English mother and an Irish father [66] [n 10] Contemporary records indicate she was a lonely child who was raised in a broken home [68] Upon leaving school in 1965, Ward trained as a riding instructor and stable hand in Wiltshire, England before obtaining employment at a riding school in Ravensdale, County Louth, Ireland, close to the town of Dundalk In the years between leaving school and her arrest, she had frequently divided her time between Ravensdale, Wiltshire, and her home town of Stockport, which she had first returned to from Dundalk in October 1970 [69]\n\n\nJanuary–February 1974\nIn the weeks prior to her arrest, Ward had lived a somewhat nomadic and destitute lifestyle; alternately sleeping rough around Euston station and hitchhiking to locations such as Cardiff to temporarily sleep at the house of an acquaintance Less than two weeks prior to her arrest, Ward obtained employment as a groom with Chipperfields Circus [48] She commenced her employment with the circus in Belle Vue, Manchester on 26 January Shortly thereafter, the circus relocated to the Cotswolds, arriving at Chipping Norton at approximately 2:30 a.m on 3 February That evening, Ward and several colleagues visited the local Blue Boar pub on nearby Goddards Lane, remaining at this venue for several hours [n 12] The following day, Ward quit her employment [8]\n\n\nTrial\nWard's trial began before Mr Justice Waller at Wakefield Crown Court on 3 October 1974 [75] She was charged with fifteen separate offences consisting of twelve charges of murder relating to the fatalities of the bombing, causing an explosion likely to endanger life and property with regards to this particular incident, and two separate, non-fatal IRA attacks at Euston railway station and the Latimer National Defence College committed in September 1973 and February 1974 respectively [76] Ward pleaded not guilty to all charges [77] Initial arraignment hearings were held on this date [78]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nIn the prosecution's closing argument, Cobb repeatedly referred to the physical evidence which he portrayed as conclusive proof Ward had handled explosives, emphasising the insistence of Skuse and others who had delivered forensic testimony on behalf of the prosecution that their findings were conclusive Ward's confessions were also outlined as her willing admissions of guilt [86] Ward was described as a ruthless individual with a sole passion for her \"political aim\" to unite all of Ireland Acknowledging that others should also be prosecuted for the three bombings, Cobb concluded his speech by stating to the jury: \"You are sitting in judgment on the gravest charge, short of treason, ever known There are, perhaps, bigger fish in the sea, but  [Ward is] no sprat\" [87]\n\n\nConviction\nThe jury deliberated for five hours and forty minutes before reaching their verdicts [87] On 4 November 1974, Ward was found guilty of all charges [88] She was sentenced to serve five years' imprisonment in relation to the Euston railway station bombing, twenty years' imprisonment in relation to the coach bombing, to be served concurrently with the sentence relating to the Euston bombing, twelve concurrent terms of life imprisonment with no recommended minimum term of imprisonment in relation to each of the fatalities of the coach bombing, [89] plus ten years' consecutive imprisonment in relation to the Latimer bombing, thus meaning she would have to serve a minimum sentence of thirty years' imprisonment before being eligible for parole [90]\n\n\nIRA statement\nShortly after Ward's November 1974 convictions, the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau issued a formal statement pertaining to her arrest and conviction This statement again emphasised that Ward had not been a member of the IRA and that she had taken no role in any of the activities for which she had been convicted, [92] stating: \n\n\nCourt of Appeal hearing\nOn 17 September 1991, the Home Secretary referred Ward's case to the Court of Appeal, with the primary reasons for this referral being the validity of the scientific evidence presented by Skuse and others at her trial, and that the prosecution had failed to disclose relevant evidence to her defence team, as they had been legally obliged to do Ward's appeal specifically listed 43 items of evidence \"consisting of, or contained in witness statements, notes of interviews and reports (including medical reports)\" which had not been disclosed at her trial [93]\n\n\nRelease\nWard was released on bail, pending the conclusion of the legal proceedings of her appeal, [97] on 11 May 1992, with Lord Justice Glidewell not immediately dismissing the charges against Ward, but stating a reversal of her sentence was fully expected She exited the courtroom to a positive public reaction, having wrongly served over seventeen years' imprisonment [103] Although Ward was the first of eighteen innocent English and Irish nationals known to have been falsely convicted of IRA atrocities, she was the last to be released from custody [97]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe most enduring consequence of the M62 coach bombing was the adoption of much stricter anti-terrorism laws in Great Britain and Northern Ireland [105] These laws enabled police to hold individuals suspected of terrorism for up to seven days without charge, and to deport these individuals to Northern Ireland to face trial, where special courts with specific rules applying to terrorism suspects were based [106]\n\n\nSee also\n

were keeping an \"open mind\" as to the cause of the explosion, in the days immediately following the bombing, suspicion quickly fell upon the IRA, [41] which had extended its campaign to England the previous year [42] and had recently begun efforts to force the British Government to transfer four IRA members serving life imprisonment in English jails and currently engaging in hunger strikes to prisons in Northern Ireland [43] [37]\n\n\nArrest of Judith Ward\nAt 6:30 a.m on 14 February, [45] police encountered a 25-year-old mentally ill English woman named Judith Teresa Ward [46] [n 6] standing in a shop doorway in Liverpool city centre, seeking shelter from the cold and rain [48] As her driving licence had been issued in Northern Ireland and a letter from the Royal Ulster Constabulary was also found in her possession, Ward was detained for questioning [49]\n\n\nConfessions\nThe ensuing police investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent George Oldfield This investigation would prove to be rushed, careless and ultimately forged, but culminated in Ward claiming culpability for the M62 coach bombing and two separate, non-fatal explosions Initially, Ward was questioned by two members of the Metropolitan Police Service at Wakefield's Police Training College The conclusion of the Detective Inspector and Detective Constable following the first of their three interviews with Ward on 16 February was that she held \"poor knowledge\" of the construction of explosive devices and, although discrepancies were noted between the various oral statements Ward made and earlier statements she and others had provided to investigators, by 7:45 p.m., Ward had provided a written confession claiming culpability for the M62 coach bombing [52] She would initially be charged with conspiracy to cause an explosion on the M62 motorway on 18 February [53]\n\n\nSuspect background\nWard had been born in Stockport, England, on 10 January 1949 She was the second of five children born to an English mother and an Irish father [66] [n 10] Contemporary records indicate she was a lonely child who was raised in a broken home [68] Upon leaving school in 1965, Ward trained as a riding instructor and stable hand in Wiltshire, England before obtaining employment at a riding school in Ravensdale, County Louth, Ireland, close to the town of Dundalk In the years between leaving school and her arrest, she had frequently divided her time between Ravensdale, Wiltshire, and her home town of Stockport, which she had first returned to from Dundalk in October 1970 [69]\n\n\nJanuary–February 1974\nIn the weeks prior to her arrest, Ward had lived a somewhat nomadic and destitute lifestyle; alternately sleeping rough around Euston station and hitchhiking to locations such as Cardiff to temporarily sleep at the house of an acquaintance Less than two weeks prior to her arrest, Ward obtained employment as a groom with Chipperfields Circus [48] She commenced her employment with the circus in Belle Vue, Manchester on 26 January Shortly thereafter, the circus relocated to the Cotswolds, arriving at Chipping Norton at approximately 2:30 a.m on 3 February That evening, Ward and several colleagues visited the local Blue Boar pub on nearby Goddards Lane, remaining at this venue for several hours [n 12] The following day, Ward quit her employment [8]\n\n\nTrial\nWard's trial began before Mr Justice Waller at Wakefield Crown Court on 3 October 1974 [75] She was charged with fifteen separate offences consisting of twelve charges of murder relating to the fatalities of the bombing, causing an explosion likely to endanger life and property with regards to this particular incident, and two separate, non-fatal IRA attacks at Euston railway station and the Latimer National Defence College committed in September 1973 and February 1974 respectively [76] Ward pleaded not guilty to all charges [77] Initial arraignment hearings were held on this date [78]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nIn the prosecution's closing argument, Cobb repeatedly referred to the physical evidence which he portrayed as conclusive proof Ward had handled explosives, emphasising the insistence of Skuse and others who had delivered forensic testimony on behalf of the prosecution that their findings were conclusive Ward's confessions were also outlined as her willing admissions of guilt [86] Ward was described as a ruthless individual with a sole passion for her \"political aim\" to unite all of Ireland Acknowledging that others should also be prosecuted for the three bombings, Cobb concluded his speech by stating to the jury: \"You are sitting in judgment on the gravest charge, short of treason, ever known There are, perhaps, bigger fish in the sea, but  [Ward is] no sprat\" [87]\n\n\nConviction\nThe jury deliberated for five hours and forty minutes before reaching their verdicts [87] On 4 November 1974, Ward was found guilty of all charges [88] She was sentenced to serve five years' imprisonment in relation to the Euston railway station bombing, twenty years' imprisonment in relation to the coach bombing, to be served concurrently with the sentence relating to the Euston bombing, twelve concurrent terms of life imprisonment with no recommended minimum term of imprisonment in relation to each of the fatalities of the coach bombing, [89] plus ten years' consecutive imprisonment in relation to the Latimer bombing, thus meaning she would have to serve a minimum sentence of thirty years' imprisonment before being eligible for parole [90]\n\n\nIRA statement\nShortly after Ward's November 1974 convictions, the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau issued a formal statement pertaining to her arrest and conviction This statement again emphasised that Ward had not been a member of the IRA and that she had taken no role in any of the activities for which she had been convicted, [92] stating: \n\n\nCourt of Appeal hearing\nOn 17 September 1991, the Home Secretary referred Ward's case to the Court of Appeal, with the primary reasons for this referral being the validity of the scientific evidence presented by Skuse and others at her trial, and that the prosecution had failed to disclose relevant evidence to her defence team, as they had been legally obliged to do Ward's appeal specifically listed 43 items of evidence \"consisting of, or contained in witness statements, notes of interviews and reports (including medical reports)\" which had not been disclosed at her trial [93]\n\n\nRelease\nWard was released on bail, pending the conclusion of the legal proceedings of her appeal, [97] on 11 May 1992, with Lord Justice Glidewell not immediately dismissing the charges against Ward, but stating a reversal of her sentence was fully expected She exited the courtroom to a positive public reaction, having wrongly served over seventeen years' imprisonment [103] Although Ward was the first of eighteen innocent English and Irish nationals known to have been falsely convicted of IRA atrocities, she was the last to be released from custody [97]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe most enduring consequence of the M62 coach bombing was the adoption of much stricter anti-terrorism laws in Great Britain and Northern Ireland [105] These laws enabled police to hold individuals suspected of terrorism for up to seven days without charge, and to deport these individuals to Northern Ireland to face trial, where special courts with specific rules applying to terrorism suspects were based [106]\n\n\nSee also\n

{"title": "Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce", "content": "\nBiography\nShelly-Ann Fraser was born to Orane Fraser and Maxine Simpson in the inner city community of Waterhouse, in Kingston [14] [15] She was raised with her two brothers by her mother, a former athlete who worked as a street vendor [16] [17] A gifted sprinter from a very young age, she started running barefoot in primary school [18] [19] Throughout her time at the Wolmer's High School for Girls, she was uncertain about pursuing a career in track and field [20] However, she was active on the youth athletics scene, competing in the famous Inter-Secondary Schools Boys and Girls Championships (known locally as \"Champs\"), and winning 100 m bronze at age 16 [14] [21] In 2002, she ran 25.35 s to win the 200 m title at the Jamaican Under-18 Championships, and later that year helped the Jamaican junior team win 4 × 100 m relay gold at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships, held in Bridgetown, Barbados [22] [23] At the 2005 CARIFTA Games in Trinidad and Tobago, she won bronze in the 100 m in 11.73 s, and earned a gold medal as part of the 4 × 100 m relay team [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nEarly years\nShelly-Ann Fraser was born to Orane Fraser and Maxine Simpson in the inner city community of Waterhouse, in Kingston [14] [15] She was raised with her two brothers by her mother, a former athlete who worked as a street

100 m in 11.73 s, and earned a gold medal as part of the 4 × 100 m relay team [24] [25] [26]\n\n\n2008: First Olympic 100 m gold\nFraser-Pryce's breakthrough in 2008 was sudden and unexpected [19] [32] At the Jamaican Olympic trials in June, she was a surprise second-place finisher in the hotly contested 100 m final, posting her first ever sub-11 s clocking of 10.85 s [28] [33] Compatriots Kerron Stewart won the national title in 10.80 s and Sherone Simpson was third in 10.87 s, completing the Olympic team for this event [33] [34] However, Jamaican sprint darling Veronica Campbell-Brown, the 2007 world 100 m champion and 2004 Olympic 200 m champion, finished fourth in 10.88 s, failing to make the team [33] [35] With Fraser-Pryce barely known among the local athletics scene, many considered her too inexperienced for the Olympics, and petitioned the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) to have her swapped in favour of Campbell-Brown [31] [33] However, the JAAA upheld its rule permitting only the top-three finishers on the team [31] Fraser-Pryce recalled being disappointed but mostly unfazed by the backlash, and saw her underdog status as an advantage: \"I went in just wanting to do well So there was no pressure and nobody expected anything of me and I was able to compete better, relaxed and be my best.\" [14]\n\n\n2009: First 100 m world title\nThe following year, Fraser-Pryce proved that she was no one-hit wonder by capturing 100 m gold at the 2009 Berlin World Championships [31] Despite ultimately taking the title, her early season was marred by injury, followed by an appendix surgery in April, which impeded her training and preparation [47] [48] In June, she finished fourth at the Prefontaine Classic, but later that month, she ran a world-leading 10.88 s to claim her first 100 m national title at the Jamaican Championships, finishing ahead of defending champion Kerron Stewart (10.93 s) [33] [47] At the Rome Golden Gala in July, Stewart emerged as gold medal favourite after defeating Fraser-Pryce in 10.75 s, becoming the fifth fastest woman in history at the time [49]\n\n\n2010–2011: Suspension and return\nIn June 2010, Fraser-Pryce received a six-month suspension from athletics after a urine sample taken at the Shanghai Diamond League tested positive for oxycodone [56] [57] [58] Fraser-Pryce insisted that her positive result was due to medication her coach recommended for a toothache, and that she had neglected to properly declare it Although oxycodone is banned as a narcotic, it is not considered performance enhancing or to be a masking agent [58] [59] She later stated, \" [I'm] supposed to set examples – so whatever it is I put in my body it's up to me to take responsibility for it and I have done that.\" [59] She resumed competition in January 2011, and her track results from 2010 were nullified [59] [60]\n\n\n2012: Olympic 100 m title defence\nBeginning with her first Olympic win in 2008, Fraser-Pryce had been at the forefront of a booming sprint rivalry between Jamaica and the United States [73] [74] At the Beijing Olympics, Jamaica captured five of a possible six gold medals in the sprints, with Fraser-Pryce and Campbell-Brown winning the women's 100 m and 200 m respectively, and Usain Bolt dominating the men's 100 m, 200 m, and 4 × 100 m relay [73] [75] Jamaica's success continued through the 2009 and 2011 World Championships, highlighted by Bolt's record-breaking performances at each event [76] Fraser-Pryce's career dip in 2010 and 2011 saw U.S sprinter Carmelita Jeter rising to prominence in the 100 m, becoming the fastest woman alive (at the time) and clinching the world title in 2011 [77] Fraser-Pryce later described Jeter as one of the toughest rivals she faced throughout her career [78]\n\n\n2013: Triple gold and IAAF World Athlete of the Year\nIn 2013, Fraser-Pryce continued to show her consistency when she became the first woman to sweep the 100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100 m at a single World Championship [37] [100] Her achievements were matched by Usain Bolt in the men's events, giving Jamaica a clean sweep of the sprinting gold medals at the championships [101] Fraser-Pryce attributed her successful year to an increase in focus on her track career (after finishing school in November 2012) [102] and a new training regimen that emphasised the 200 m [103] [104] She started the season early, recording 11.47 s for an easy win at the Kingston Invitational in January [100] Over the next few months, she secured Diamond League wins in Shanghai, Eugene, and Paris in the 100 m, followed by a 200 m victory in Doha [100] In June, she claimed her second consecutive national 200 m title at the Jamaican Championships, setting a new world-leading time of 22.13 s [100] [105]\n\n\n2014: World indoor champion and injury\nOn the heels of a successful 2013 season, Fraser-Pryce made her World Indoor Championships debut in Sopot, Poland in March 2014 [6] Early into her 2014 season, she posted 7.11 s in an outdoor 60 m race in Kingston Months later in Birmingham, she finished second in her only 60 m loss of the season to world 100 m and 200 m silver medallist Murielle Ahouré [6] She decided to compete at the World Indoor Championships as part of her preparation for her outdoor season [6]\n\n\n2015: Third 100 m world title\nIn 2015, Fraser-Pryce decided not to defend her 200 m title at the Beijing World Championships, opting instead to focus on the 100 m for the season [126] [127] Speaking at the Meeting de Paris in July, she stated that although the longer sprint helped to improve her speed endurance for the 100 m, her coach believed she had lost some of her explosiveness from the blocks [126] As part of her preparation for the Rio Olympics in 2016, she wanted to prioritize the 100 m for the 2015 season to sharpen her technique [127]  She ran only two 200 m races that year—in two minor meets in Kingston—finishing first and third in 22.96 s and 22.37 s respectively [128] In the 100 m, she started the season strong, setting an early world lead of 10.81 s at the Prefontaine Classic in May [129] She lowered the mark to 10.79 s at the Jamaican Championships at the end of June, and a week later, set a new world lead and meet record of 10.74 s in Paris [129] [130]\n\n\n2016: Injury, Rio Olympics and brief split from coach\nBy 2016, Fraser-Pryce had won 100 m gold at the past two Olympics (2008, 2012) and at three of the past four World Championships (2009, 2013, 2015), [142] becoming the most decorated female sprinter ever in this event [133] [143] For the upcoming 2016 Rio Olympics, she set her sights on capturing an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic 100 m title [144] [143] Her season did not go as planned, however, after an onset of sesamoiditis caused chronic pain and inflammation to her big toe, hindering her ability to train or compete [145] [146] Unable to run in spikes, she withdrew from several events earlier in the year [66] [143] In her season opener at the Prefontaine Classic in May, she finished last in 11.18 s [147] [148]\n\n\n2017–2018: Motherhood and comeback\nIn early 2017, Fraser-Pryce announced that she was pregnant and would not be defending her title at the 2017 World Championships in London [162] She went into labour while watching the world 100 m final that year, and gave birth to her son Zyon the next day via emergency C-section [163] Despite expectations that she would retire after becoming a mother, she publicly promised a major comeback [163] She returned to training within eleven weeks [163] [86] However, her early sessions were more challenging than she had anticipated [163] Due to her C-section, she required special compression bandages to help stabilise her stomach during training [164] She was unable to train her core or lift heavy weights, and frequently had to take time off due to the pain [163] [86] At times, she doubted if she could ever return to peak form: \"I  [wondered] whether my body would allow me to put the level of work in to get it done.” [163] [165]\n\n\n2019: Fourth 100 m world title\nAfter ending her 2018 season ranked 10th in the world in the 100 m, [176] Fraser-Pryce made steady progress with her training into the 2019 season At the Jamaican Championships in June, she again finished second to Elaine Thompson in both the 100 m and the 200 m [8] However, the 100 m final ended with both sprinters sharing the world-leading time of 10.73 s, and Thompson declared the winner in a photo finish [177] [178] It was the first race in history in which two women finished inside 10.75 s; Fraser-Pryce's 10.73 s in this race also became the fastest non-winning time in history (at the time) [179]\n\n\n2020–2021: New coach and Tokyo Olympics\nFraser-Pryce kickstarted her season in February on the indoor circuit, winning the 60 m at the Muller Indoor Athletics Grand Prix in 7.16 s [119] [194] It was her first indoor competition since she won gold in Sopot back in 2014 [119] The rest of her 2020 season was inhibited by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until 2021 [195] In August 2020, she ran 100 m times of 10.87 s and 10.86 s in local track meets in Kingston, ending her season as the second fastest of the year behind Elaine Thompson's 10.85 s [196] In the 200 m, she held a season's best of 22.57 s, the sixth fastest in the world for the year [197]\n\n\n2022: Fifth 100 m world title\nBy 2022, the sprinting landscape had changed Many of Fraser-Pryce's contemporaries, including Usain Bolt, Carmelita Jeter, Kerron Stewart and Veronica Campbell-Brown, had retired from the sport [219] [220] Although the U.S men regained sprinting prominence in the post-Bolt era, [221] [222] Jamaica maintained its dominance in the women's events [223] [224] Women's sprinting also began to take centre stage in athletics [225] due in large part to the fierce rivalry between Fraser-Pryce and Thompson-Herah, as well as the rise of flamboyant American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson [226] [227] Fraser-Pryce and Thompson-Herah became the two fastest women alive in 2021, and their performances throughout the season reignited the conversations around Florence Griffith Joyner's long-standing 100 m and 200 m world records [228] [229]\n\n\n2023: Injuries and world 100 m bronze\nFor her 2022 season, Fraser-Pryce won the 2023 Laureus World Sports Awards for Sportswoman of the Year [257] [258] She was expected to open her 2023 season at the Botswana Golden Grand Prix on April 29, but withdrew shortly before the event due to an undisclosed family emergency [259] In early May, she was slated  to appear at the Kip Keino Classic in Nairobi, Kenya, where she ran her world leading 10.67 s season opener in 2022 [260] However, a few days before the event, she suffered a knee injury during her warmup, and left Kenya to seek treatment [260] She remained out of competition for the next few months, opening her season at the Jamaican Championships on July 8, a month before the Budapest World Championships As the defending world 100 m champion, she had automatic qualification for the event at the 2023 World Championships She competed only in the 200 m at the Jamaican Championships, finishing second in 22.26 s behind world 200 m champion Shericka Jackson [261]\n\n\n2024: Paris Olympics\nIn 2023, Fraser-Pryce stated that she would no longer compete in the 200 m: “I’ll just focus on the 100 m The double is very hard It is strenuous The workload that you need to do it is definitely hard.” [265] In February 2024, the 37-year-old announced that the Paris Olympics would be her final Olympics [266] [267]\n\n\nLegacy and achievements\nFraser-Pryce is widely recognized as one of the greatest sprinters of all time [1] [12] [274] In 2022, British sports radio station Talksport ranked her as the greatest female sprinter of the 21st century and the fourth greatest overall female athlete, behind Brazilian soccer player Marta, as well as gymnast Simone Biles and tennis player Serena Williams, both of the U.S [275] The second fastest woman alive, the Olympic Channel also referred to Fraser-Pryce as \"the most successful female sprinter in history\" [8] Track & Field News listed her at number one on their annual world 100 m rankings in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2019 and 2022 (she also appeared in the top 10 in 2009, 2011, 2016 and 2021) [276] [277] In the 200 m, they ranked her at number one in 2013, number two in 2012 and 2022, and the top 10 in 2011 and 2019 [278] In 2020, they ranked her as the top female 100 m sprinter of the 2010s decade, as well as the fifth greatest in the 200 m [279] She was also ranked at number two in the 100 m for the 2000s decade [279] Sean Ingle of The Guardian lauded her achievements after the 2019 World Championships, stating that she had \"legitimate claim to be considered the greatest ever.\" [280] After her record-extending fifth 100 m world title in 2022, he asked, \"Who would now dare doubt that she is the greatest female sprinter of them all?\" [11] In 2019, she was listed among BBC's 100 inspiring and influential women in the world [281] In 2020, after her maternity leave and return, World Athletics included her on their list of the 10 greatest comebacks in track and field [176]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nIn 2008, Fraser-Pryce was honoured with the Order of Distinction for her achievements in athletics [301] In October 2018, she was also honoured with a statue at the Jamaica National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica [302] During the ceremony, Minister of Sports Olivia Grange hailed her a role model for young girls and a Jamaican \"modern-day hero.\" [302] In 2022, Fraser-Pryce's Order of Distinction was upgraded to Order of Jamaica, which she received \"for outstanding performance in the field of Athletics at the\nInternational Level.\" [303]  In December 2022, The Penwood Church of Christ Early Childhood Institution, which she attended, was renamed The Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce Early Childhood Institution, in her honor [304]\n\n\nTechnique and running style\nUnder the guidance of her coach Stephen Francis, and later Reynaldo Walcott, Fraser-Pryce honed her technique to become one of the most decorated track athletes of all time [71] [8] She stated that none of her technique came naturally, and that when she began competing, she ran with an exaggerated forward lean: \"I had a really bad running posture, like I ran, literally, dropping on my face Stephen saw all of this and, as a coach, he analyzed and he took a year to actually go through my core needs.\" [27] [312] By 2008, she had improved her posture and sharpened her start, including her first stride, the placement of her arms and the different phases of the sprint [312] Over time, she became more confident in her technique: \"You feel all of your phases, like a sixth sense So I focus on nailing each phase properly, and if I’m able to, then I know that’s history.” [312]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn November 2012, Fraser-Pryce graduated from the University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Child and Adolescent Development [317] In 2016, she announced that she would pursue a Master of Science in Applied Psychology at the University of the West Indies [143] A committed Christian, [230] she married Jason Pryce in 2011, [59] and announced her pregnancy in early 2017 [318] On her Facebook page she wrote, \"All my focus heading into training for my 2017 season was on getting healthy and putting myself in the best possible fitness to successfully defend my title in London 2017, but .. here I am thinking about being the greatest mother I can be.\" [318] On 7 August 2017, she and her husband welcomed a son named Zyon [318]\n\n\nSponsorship, charities and businesses\nFraser-Pryce has signed sponsorship deals with Digicel, GraceKennedy and Nike [319] To promote her chase for Olympic glory in 2016, Nike released a series of promotional videos of her training sessions for the 100 m

Fraser-Pryce**\n\nShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is a Jamaican sprinter who has been one of the most dominant athletes in her sport for over a decade. Born on December 27, 1986, in Kingston, Jamaica, Fraser-Pryce has won numerous gold medals at the Olympics, World Championships, and Commonwealth Games, and has set multiple world records.\n\n**Biography**\n\nFraser-Pryce was born to Orane Fraser and Maxine Simpson in the inner city community of Waterhouse, in Kingston. She was raised with her two brothers by her mother, a former athlete who worked as a street vendor. A gifted sprinter from a very young age, she started running barefoot in primary school. Throughout her time at the Wolmer's High School for Girls, she was uncertain about pursuing a career in track and field. However, she was active on the youth athletics scene, competing in the famous Inter-Secondary Schools Boys and Girls Championships (known locally as \"Champs\"), and winning 100m bronze at age 16.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nFraser-Pryce's early years in track and field were marked by her participation in the Jamaican Under-18 Championships, where she won the 200m title in 2002 with a time of 25.35s. She also helped the Jamaican junior team win 4x100m relay gold at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Bridgetown, Barbados. At the 2005 CARIFTA Games in Trinidad and Tobago, she won bronze in the 100m in 11.73s, and earned a gold medal as part of the 4x100m relay team.\n\n**2008: First Olympic 100 m Gold**\n\nFraser-Pryce's breakthrough in 2008 was sudden and unexpected. At the Jamaican Olympic trials in June, she was a surprise second-place finisher in the hotly contested 100m final, posting her first-ever sub-11s clocking of 10.85s. Compatriots Kerron Stewart won the national title in 10.80s and Sherone Simpson was third in 10.87s, completing the Olympic team for this event. With Fraser-Pryce barely known among the local athletics scene, many considered her too inexperienced for the Olympics, and petitioned the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) to have her swapped in favor of Stewart. However, the JAAA upheld its rule permitting only the top-three finishers on the team.\n\n**2009: First 100 m World Title**\n\nThe following year, Fraser-Pryce proved that she was no one-hit wonder by capturing 100m gold at the 2009 Berlin World Championships. Despite ultimately taking the title, her early season was marred by injury, followed by an appendix surgery in April, which impeded her training and preparation. In June, she finished fourth at the Prefontaine Classic, but later that month, she ran a world-leading 10.88s to claim her first 100m national title at the Jamaican Championships, finishing ahead of Stewart (10.93s).\n\n**2010–2011: Suspension and Return**\n\nIn June 2010, Fraser-Pryce received a six-month suspension from athletics after a urine sample taken at the Shanghai Diamond League tested positive for oxycodone. Fraser-Pryce insisted that her positive result was due to medication her coach recommended for a toothache, and that she had neglected to properly declare it. She resumed competition in January 2011, and her track results from 2010 were nullified.\n\n**2012: Olympic 100 m Title Defence**\n\nBeginning with her first Olympic win in 2008, Fraser-Pryce had been at the forefront of a booming sprint rivalry between Jamaica and the United States. At the Beijing Olympics, Jamaica captured five of a possible six gold medals in the sprints, with Fraser-Pryce and Veronica Campbell-Brown winning the women's 100m and 200m respectively, and Usain Bolt dominating the men's 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay.\n\n**2013: Triple Gold and IAAF World Athlete of the Year**\n\nIn 2013, Fraser-Pryce continued to show her consistency when she became the first woman to sweep the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m at a single World Championship. Her achievements were matched by Usain Bolt in the men's events, giving Jamaica a clean sweep of the sprinting gold medals at the championships.\n\n**2014: World Indoor Champion and Injury**\n\nOn the heels of a successful 2013 season, Fraser-Pryce made her World Indoor Championships debut in Sopot, Poland in March 2014. Early into her 2014 season, she posted 7.11s in an outdoor 60m race in Kingston. She decided to compete at the World Indoor Championships as part of her preparation for her outdoor season.\n\n**2015: Third 100 m World Title**\n\nIn 2015, Fraser-Pryce decided not to defend her 200m title at the Beijing World Championships, opting instead to focus on the 100m for the season. Speaking at the Meeting de Paris in July, she stated that although the longer sprint helped to improve her speed endurance for the 100m, her coach believed she had lost some of her explosiveness from the blocks.\n\n**2016: Injury, Rio Olympics, and Brief Split from Coach**\n\nBy 2016, Fraser-Pryce had won 100m gold at the past two Olympics (2008, 2012) and at three of the past four World Championships (2009, 2013, 2015). For the upcoming 2016 Rio Olympics, she set her sights on capturing an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic 100m title. Her season did not go as planned, however, after an onset of sesamoiditis caused chronic pain and inflammation to her big toe, hindering her ability to train or compete.\n\n**2017–2018: Motherhood and Comeback**\n\nIn early 2017, Fraser-Pryce announced that she was pregnant and would not be defending her title at the 2017 World Championships in London. She gave birth to her son Zyon on August 7, 2017. Despite expectations that she would retire after becoming a mother, she publicly promised a major comeback. She returned to training within eleven weeks, but her early sessions were more challenging than she had anticipated.\n\n**2019: Fourth 100 m World Title**\n\nAfter ending her 2018 season ranked 10th in the world in the 100m, Fraser-Pryce made steady progress with her training into the 2019 season. At the Jamaican Championships in June, she again finished second to Elaine Thompson in both the 100m and the 200m. However, the 100m final ended with both sprinters sharing the world-leading time of 10.73s, and Thompson declared the winner in a photo finish.\n\n**2020–2021: New Coach and Tokyo Olympics**\n\nFraser-Pryce kickstarted her season in February on the indoor circuit, winning the 60m at the Muller Indoor Athletics Grand Prix in 7.16s. The rest of her 2020 season was inhibited by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until 2021. In August 2020, she ran 100m times of 10.87s and 10.86s in local track meets in Kingston, ending her season as the second-fastest of the year behind Thompson's 10.85s.\n\n**2022: Fifth 100 m World Title**\n\nBy 2022, the sprinting landscape had changed. Many of Fraser-Pryce's contemporaries, including Usain Bolt, Carmelita Jeter, Kerron Stewart, and Veronica Campbell-Brown, had retired from the sport. Fraser-Pryce was now one of the fastest women alive, and her performances throughout the season reignited conversations around Florence Griffith Joyner's long-standing 100m and 200m world records.\n\n**2023: Injuries and World 100 m Bronze**\n\nFor her 2022 season, Fraser-Pryce won the 2023 Laureus World Sports Awards for Sportswoman of the Year. She was expected to open her 2023 season at the Botswana Golden Grand Prix on April 29, but withdrew shortly before the event due to an undisclosed family emergency.

was a surprise second-place finisher in the hotly contested 100 m final, posting her first ever sub-11 s clocking of 10.85 s [28] [33] Compatriots Kerron Stewart won the national title in 10.80 s and Sherone Simpson was third in 10.87 s, completing the Olympic team for this event [33] [34] However, Jamaican sprint darling Veronica Campbell-Brown, the 2007 world 100 m champion and 2004 Olympic 200 m champion, finished fourth in 10.88 s, failing to make the team [33] [35] With Fraser-Pryce barely known among the local athletics scene, many considered her too inexperienced for the Olympics, and petitioned the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) to have her swapped in favour of Campbell-Brown [31] [33] However, the JAAA upheld its rule permitting only the top-three finishers on the team [31] Fraser-Pryce recalled being disappointed but mostly unfazed by the backlash, and saw her underdog status as an advantage: \"I went in just wanting to do well So there was no pressure and nobody expected anything of me and I was able to compete better, relaxed and be my best.\" [14]\n\n\n2009: First 100 m world title\nThe following year, Fraser-Pryce proved that she was no one-hit wonder by capturing 100 m gold at the 2009 Berlin World Championships [31] Despite ultimately taking the title, her early season was marred by injury, followed by an appendix surgery in April, which impeded her training and preparation [47] [48] In June, she finished fourth at the Prefontaine Classic, but later that month, she ran a world-leading 10.88 s to claim her first 100 m national title at the Jamaican Championships, finishing ahead of defending champion Kerron Stewart (10.93 s) [33] [47] At the Rome Golden Gala in July, Stewart emerged as gold medal favourite after defeating Fraser-Pryce in 10.75 s, becoming the fifth fastest woman in history at the time [49]\n\n\n2010–2011: Suspension and return\nIn June 2010, Fraser-Pryce received a six-month suspension from athletics after a urine sample taken at the Shanghai Diamond League tested positive for oxycodone [56] [57] [58] Fraser-Pryce insisted that her positive result was due to medication her coach recommended for a toothache, and that she had neglected to properly declare it Although oxycodone is banned as a narcotic, it is not considered performance enhancing or to be a masking agent [58] [59] She later stated, \" [I'm] supposed to set examples – so whatever it is I put in my body it's up to me to take responsibility for it and I have done that.\" [59] She resumed competition in January 2011, and her track results from 2010 were nullified [59] [60]\n\n\n2012: Olympic 100 m title defence\nBeginning with her first Olympic win in 2008, Fraser-Pryce had been at the forefront of a booming sprint rivalry between Jamaica and the United States [73] [74] At the Beijing Olympics, Jamaica captured five of a possible six gold medals in the sprints, with Fraser-Pryce and Campbell-Brown winning the women's 100 m and 200 m respectively, and Usain Bolt dominating the men's 100 m, 200 m, and 4 × 100 m relay [73] [75] Jamaica's success continued through the 2009 and 2011 World Championships, highlighted by Bolt's record-breaking performances at each event [76] Fraser-Pryce's career dip in 2010 and 2011 saw U.S sprinter Carmelita Jeter rising to prominence in the 100 m, becoming the fastest woman alive (at the time) and clinching the world title in 2011 [77] Fraser-Pryce later described Jeter as one of the toughest rivals she faced throughout her career [78]\n\n\n2013: Triple gold and IAAF World Athlete of the Year\nIn 2013, Fraser-Pryce continued to show her consistency when she became the first woman to sweep the 100 m, 200 m and 4 × 100 m at a single World Championship [37] [100] Her achievements were matched by Usain Bolt in the men's events, giving Jamaica a clean sweep of the sprinting gold medals at the championships [101] Fraser-Pryce attributed her successful year to an increase in focus on her track career (after finishing school in November 2012) [102] and a new training regimen that emphasised the 200 m [103] [104] She started the season early, recording 11.47 s for an easy win at the Kingston Invitational in January [100] Over the next few months, she secured Diamond League wins in Shanghai, Eugene, and Paris in the 100 m, followed by a 200 m victory in Doha [100] In June, she claimed her second consecutive national 200 m title at the Jamaican Championships, setting a new world-leading time of 22.13 s [100] [105]\n\n\n2014: World indoor champion and injury\nOn the heels of a successful 2013 season, Fraser-Pryce made her World Indoor Championships debut in Sopot, Poland in March 2014 [6] Early into her 2014 season, she posted 7.11 s in an outdoor 60 m race in Kingston Months later in Birmingham, she finished second in her only 60 m loss of the season to world 100 m and 200 m silver medallist Murielle Ahouré [6] She decided to compete at the World Indoor Championships as part of her preparation for her outdoor season [6]\n\n\n2015: Third 100 m world title\nIn 2015, Fraser-Pryce decided not to defend her 200 m title at the Beijing World Championships, opting instead to focus on the 100 m for the season [126] [127] Speaking at the Meeting de Paris in July, she stated that although the longer sprint helped to improve her speed endurance for the 100 m, her coach believed she had lost some of her explosiveness from the blocks [126] As part of her preparation for the Rio Olympics in 2016, she wanted to prioritize the 100 m for the 2015 season to sharpen her technique [127]  She ran only two 200 m races that year—in two minor meets in Kingston—finishing first and third in 22.96 s and 22.37 s respectively [128] In the 100 m, she started the season strong, setting an early world lead of 10.81 s at the Prefontaine Classic in May [129] She lowered the mark to 10.79 s at the Jamaican Championships at the end of June, and a week later, set a new world lead and meet record of 10.74 s in Paris [129] [130]\n\n\n2016: Injury, Rio Olympics and brief split from coach\nBy 2016, Fraser-Pryce had won 100 m gold at the past two Olympics (2008, 2012) and at three of the past four World Championships (2009, 2013, 2015), [142] becoming the most decorated female sprinter ever in this event [133] [143] For the upcoming 2016 Rio Olympics, she set her sights on capturing an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic 100 m title [144] [143] Her season did not go as planned, however, after an onset of sesamoiditis caused chronic pain and inflammation to her big toe, hindering her ability to train or compete [145] [146] Unable to run in spikes, she withdrew from several events earlier in the year [66] [143] In her season opener at the Prefontaine Classic in May, she finished last in 11.18 s [147] [148]\n\n\n2017–2018: Motherhood and comeback\nIn early 2017, Fraser-Pryce announced that she was pregnant and would not be defending her title at the 2017 World Championships in London [162] She went into labour while watching the world 100 m final that year, and gave birth to her son Zyon the next day via emergency C-section [163] Despite expectations that she would retire after becoming a mother, she publicly promised a major comeback [163] She returned to training within eleven weeks [163] [86] However, her early sessions were more challenging than she had anticipated [163] Due to her C-section, she required special compression bandages to help stabilise her stomach during training [164] She was unable to train her core or lift heavy weights, and frequently had to take time off due to the pain [163] [86] At times, she doubted if she could ever return to peak form: \"I  [wondered] whether my body would allow me to put the level of work in to get it done.” [163] [165]\n\n\n2019: Fourth 100 m world title\nAfter ending her 2018 season ranked 10th in the world in the 100 m, [176] Fraser-Pryce made steady progress with her training into the 2019 season At the Jamaican Championships in June, she again finished second to Elaine Thompson in both the 100 m and the 200 m [8] However, the 100 m final ended with both sprinters sharing the world-leading time of 10.73 s, and Thompson declared the winner in a photo finish [177] [178] It was the first race in history in which two women finished inside 10.75 s; Fraser-Pryce's 10.73 s in this race also became the fastest non-winning time in history (at the time) [179]\n\n\n2020–2021: New coach and Tokyo Olympics\nFraser-Pryce kickstarted her season in February on the indoor circuit, winning the 60 m at the Muller Indoor Athletics Grand Prix in 7.16 s [119] [194] It was her first indoor competition since she won gold in Sopot back in 2014 [119] The rest of her 2020 season was inhibited by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until 2021 [195] In August 2020, she ran 100 m times of 10.87 s and 10.86 s in local track meets in Kingston, ending her season as the second fastest of the year behind Elaine Thompson's 10.85 s [196] In the 200 m, she held a season's best of 22.57 s, the sixth fastest in the world for the year [197]\n\n\n2022: Fifth 100 m world title\nBy 2022, the sprinting landscape had changed Many of Fraser-Pryce's contemporaries, including Usain Bolt, Carmelita Jeter, Kerron Stewart and Veronica Campbell-Brown, had retired from the sport [219] [220] Although the U.S men regained sprinting prominence in the post-Bolt era, [221] [222] Jamaica maintained its dominance in the women's events [223] [224] Women's sprinting also began to take centre stage in athletics [225] due in large part to the fierce rivalry between Fraser-Pryce and Thompson-Herah, as well as the rise of flamboyant American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson [226] [227] Fraser-Pryce and Thompson-Herah became the two fastest women alive in 2021, and their performances throughout the season reignited the conversations around Florence Griffith Joyner's long-standing 100 m and 200 m world records [228] [229]\n\n\n2023: Injuries and world 100 m bronze\nFor her 2022 season, Fraser-Pryce won the 2023 Laureus World Sports Awards for Sportswoman of the Year [257] [258] She was expected to open her 2023 season at the Botswana Golden Grand Prix on April 29, but withdrew shortly before the event due to an undisclosed family emergency [259] In early May, she was slated  to appear at the Kip Keino Classic in Nairobi, Kenya, where she ran her world leading 10.67 s season opener in 2022 [260] However, a few days before the event, she suffered a knee injury during her warmup, and left Kenya to seek treatment [260] She remained out of competition for the next few months, opening her season at the Jamaican Championships on July 8, a month before the Budapest World Championships As the defending world 100 m champion, she had automatic qualification for the event at the 2023 World Championships She competed only in the 200 m at the Jamaican Championships, finishing second in 22.26 s behind world 200 m champion Shericka Jackson [261]\n\n\n2024: Paris Olympics\nIn 2023, Fraser-Pryce stated that she would no longer compete in the 200 m: “I’ll just focus on the 100 m The double is very hard It is strenuous The workload that you need to do it is definitely hard.” [265] In February 2024, the 37-year-old announced that the Paris Olympics would be her final Olympics [266] [267]\n\n\nLegacy and achievements\nFraser-Pryce is widely recognized as one of the greatest sprinters of all time [1] [12] [274] In 2022, British sports radio station Talksport ranked her as the greatest female sprinter of the 21st century and the fourth greatest overall female athlete, behind Brazilian soccer player Marta, as well as gymnast Simone Biles and tennis player Serena Williams, both of the U.S [275] The second fastest woman alive, the Olympic Channel also referred to Fraser-Pryce as \"the most successful female sprinter in history\" [8] Track & Field News listed her at number one on their annual world 100 m rankings in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2019 and 2022 (she also appeared in the top 10 in 2009, 2011, 2016 and 2021) [276] [277] In the 200 m, they ranked her at number one in 2013, number two in 2012 and 2022, and the top 10 in 2011 and 2019 [278] In 2020, they ranked her as the top female 100 m sprinter of the 2010s decade, as well as the fifth greatest in the 200 m [279] She was also ranked at number two in the 100 m for the 2000s decade [279] Sean Ingle of The Guardian lauded her achievements after the 2019 World Championships, stating that she had \"legitimate claim to be considered the greatest ever.\" [280] After her record-extending fifth 100 m world title in 2022, he asked, \"Who would now dare doubt that she is the greatest female sprinter of them all?\" [11] In 2019, she was listed among BBC's 100 inspiring and influential women in the world [281] In 2020, after her maternity leave and return, World Athletics included her on their list of the 10 greatest comebacks in track and field [176]\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nIn 2008, Fraser-Pryce was honoured with the Order of Distinction for her achievements in athletics [301] In October 2018, she was also honoured with a statue at the Jamaica National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica [302] During the ceremony, Minister of Sports Olivia Grange hailed her a role model for young girls and a Jamaican \"modern-day hero.\" [302] In 2022, Fraser-Pryce's Order of Distinction was upgraded to Order of Jamaica, which she received \"for outstanding performance in the field of Athletics at the\nInternational Level.\" [303]  In December 2022, The Penwood Church of Christ Early Childhood Institution, which she attended, was renamed The Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce Early Childhood Institution, in her honor [304]\n\n\nTechnique and running style\nUnder the guidance of her coach Stephen Francis, and later Reynaldo Walcott, Fraser-Pryce honed her technique to become one of the most decorated track athletes of all time [71] [8] She stated that none of her technique came naturally, and that when she began competing, she ran with an exaggerated forward lean: \"I had a really bad running posture, like I ran, literally, dropping on my face Stephen saw all of this and, as a coach, he analyzed and he took a year to actually go through my core needs.\" [27] [312] By 2008, she had improved her posture and sharpened her start, including her first stride, the placement of her arms and the different phases of the sprint [312] Over time, she became more confident in her technique: \"You feel all of your phases, like a sixth sense So I focus on nailing each phase properly, and if I’m able to, then I know that’s history.” [312]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn November 2012, Fraser-Pryce graduated from the University of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Child and Adolescent Development [317] In 2016, she announced that she would pursue a Master of Science in Applied Psychology at the University of the West Indies [143] A committed Christian, [230] she married Jason Pryce in 2011, [59] and announced her pregnancy in early 2017 [318] On her Facebook page she wrote, \"All my focus heading into training for my 2017 season was on getting healthy and putting myself in the best possible fitness to successfully defend my title in London 2017, but .. here I am thinking about being the greatest mother I can be.\" [318] On 7 August 2017, she and her husband welcomed a son named Zyon [318]\n\n\nSponsorship, charities and businesses\nFraser-Pryce has signed sponsorship deals with Digicel, GraceKennedy and Nike [319] To promote her chase for Olympic glory in 2016, Nike released a series of promotional videos of her training sessions for the 100 m [312]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAll information taken from World Athletics profile [22]\n\n\nPersonal bests\nAll information taken

President Reuven Rivlin below at the Western Wall would not be disturbed Israeli police declined to comment [1] The incident was condemned by Jordan, [71] and the Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the incident \"a racist hate crime\", [71] [72] but it did not draw other international attention [1] In the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, a traditional holiday gathering spot for Palestinians [73] [1] The closure triggered violent night clashes, the barricades were removed after several days [73] [74] On 15 April, a TikTok video of a Palestinian teen slapping an ultra-orthodox Jewish man went viral, leading to several copycat incidents [75] The next day, tens of thousands of Palestinian worshippers were turned away from al-Aqsa, on the first Friday of Ramadan when Israel imposed a 10,000-person limit on prayers at the mosque [75] [76] On the same day, a rabbi was beaten in Jaffa, causing two days of protests [75] On 22 April, the far-right Jewish supremacist [77] group Lehava held a march through Jerusalem chanting \"death to Arabs.\" [75] On 23 April, after fringe military groups fired 36 rockets at southern Israel, the IDF launched missiles at Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip [75] The barrage of rocket fire came as hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli police in East Jerusalem and on 25 April, the United Nations envoy Tor Wennesland condemned the violence and said, \"The provocative acts across Jerusalem must cease The indiscriminate launching of rockets towards Israeli population centers violates international law and must stop immediately.\" [78] On 26 April, after more than 40 rockets have been launched from the Gaza Strip into Israel while one projectile exploded inside the Gaza Strip over of the previous three days, the Security Cabinet of Israel voted in favor after an hours-long debate of an operational plan to strike Hamas if rocket fire from Gaza continues [79] In the following days, a Palestinian boy and a 19-year-old Israeli settler were killed On 6 May, the Israel Police shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian during a raid of Nablus in the West Bank [80] According to Addameer, Israeli police arrested at least 61 children from mid-April during clashes in and about East Jerusalem, and 4 were shot dead in three weeks [81]\n\n\nApril–May 2021 Ramadan events\nAt the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2021, Jerusalem Islamic Waqf officials said that on the night of 13 April, the Israeli police entered

Jarrah district houses the descendants of refugees expelled or displaced from their homes in Jaffa and Haifa in the Nakba of 1948 [83] [84] Today, around 75 Palestinian families live on this disputed land [85] The long-running dispute over land ownership in Sheikh Jarrah is considered a microcosm of the Israeli–Palestinian disputes over land since 1948 [86] Currently, more than 1,000 Palestinians living across East Jerusalem face possible eviction [85] Israeli law allows Israeli land owners to file claims over land in East Jerusalem which they have owned prior to 1948, except where expropriated by the Jordanian government, [87] but rejects Palestinian claims over land in Israel which they owned [88] The international community considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian territory held under Israeli occupation and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called on Israel to stop all forced evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, saying that if carried out the expulsions of the Palestinians would violate Israel's responsibilities under international law which prohibit the transfer of civilians in to or out of occupied territory by the occupying power A spokesman for the OHCHR said that such transfers may constitute a \"war crime\" [39] Human rights organizations have been critical of Israeli efforts to remove Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, with Human Rights Watch releasing a statement saying that the disparate rights between Palestinian and Jewish residents of East Jerusalem \"underscores the reality of apartheid that Palestinians in East Jerusalem face.\" [89] Israeli human rights group estimate that over 1,000 Palestinian families are at risk of eviction in East Jerusalem [90]\n\n\nPolitical instability\nThe 2021 Palestinian legislative election for the Palestinian Legislative Council, originally scheduled for 22 May 2021, was indefinitely postponed on 29 April by President Mahmoud Abbas [104] [105] [106] Hamas, which was expected to do well in the elections, called the move a \"coup\", [106] and some Palestinians believed Abbas had delayed the election to avoid political defeat for his party Fatah [73] [107] [108] Analysts say the postponement contributed towards the current crisis, [44] and encouraged Hamas to resort to military confrontation rather than diplomatic tactics [109] [110] [111] [112] Opinion pieces in NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and Foreign Policy argued that by taking responsibility for the rocket fire, Hamas had improved its standing among Palestinians wary of the delayed elections [113] [114] [115] [112]\n\n\nEscalation\nPalestinian protests began on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, but clashes soon spread to the al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, other Arab localities in Israel, and the West Bank [38] Between 10 and 14 May Israeli security inflicted injuries on approximately 1,000 Palestinian protesters in East Jerusalem [29]\n\n\nSheikh Jarrah\nPalestinians and Israeli settlers first clashed on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinian families are at risk of being evicted Palestinian protesters had been holding nightly outdoor iftars On 6 May, Israeli settlers and members of the far-right political party Otzma Yehudit set up a table across the street from Palestinians Social media videos showed both sides hurling rocks and chairs at each other Israeli police intervened and arrested at least 7 people [119] Israeli police subsequently engaged in extensive spraying of Sheikh Jarrah's Palestinian homes, shops, restaurants, public spaces and cultural institutions with Skunk, a lasting stench used to contain protests [120]\n\n\nAl-Aqsa Mosque compound\nOn 7 May, large numbers of police were deployed on the Temple Mount as around 70,000 worshippers attended the final Friday prayers of Ramadan at al-Aqsa After the evening prayers, some Palestinian worshippers began throwing previously stockpiled rocks and other objects at Israeli police officers Police officers fired stun grenades into the mosque compound, and into a field clinic [44] [75] [121] A mosque spokesman stated the clashes broke out after Israeli police

violence between Israelis and Palestinians that began in April 2021 and continued for several weeks. The crisis was sparked by a series of events, including the Israeli police's decision to close the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during Ramadan, the eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem, and the firing of rockets by Palestinian militant groups in Gaza.\n\n**Background**\n\nAt the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2021, Jerusalem Islamic Waqf officials said that on the night of 13 April, the Israeli police entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and severed the loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the muezzin's ritual call to prayer so that the Memorial Day speech being delivered by President Reuven Rivlin below at the Western Wall would not be disturbed. Israeli police declined to comment. The incident was condemned by Jordan, and the Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the incident \"a racist hate crime.\" However, it did not draw other international attention. In the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, a traditional holiday gathering spot for Palestinians. The closure triggered violent night clashes, and the barricades were removed after several days.\n\n**April–May 2021 Ramadan events**\n\nAt the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2021, Jerusalem Islamic Waqf officials said that on the night of 13 April, the Israeli police entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and severed the loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the muezzin's ritual call to prayer so that the Memorial Day speech being delivered by President Reuven Rivlin below at the Western Wall would not be disturbed.

In the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City's Damascus Gate, a traditional holiday gathering spot for Palestinians. The closure triggered violent night clashes, and the barricades were removed after several days. On 15 April, a TikTok video of a Palestinian teen slapping an ultra-orthodox Jewish man went viral, leading to several copycat incidents. The next day, tens of thousands of Palestinian worshippers were turned away from al-Aqsa, on the first Friday of Ramadan when Israel imposed a 10,000-person limit on prayers at the mosque.\n\n**Sheikh Jarrah controversy**\n\nThe Sheikh Jarrah district houses the descendants of refugees expelled or displaced from their homes in Jaffa and Haifa in the Nakba of 1948. Today, around 75 Palestinian families live on this disputed land. The long-running dispute over land ownership in Sheikh Jarrah is considered a microcosm of the Israeli–Palestinian disputes over land since 1948. Currently, more than 1,000 Palestinians living across East Jerusalem face possible eviction. Israeli law allows Israeli land owners to file claims over land in East Jerusalem which they have owned prior to 1948, except where expropriated by the Jordanian government, but rejects Palestinian claims over land in Israel which they owned. The international community considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian territory held under Israeli occupation, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called on Israel to stop all forced evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, saying that if carried out the expulsions of the Palestinians would violate Israel's responsibilities under international law which prohibit the transfer of civilians in to or out of occupied territory by the occupying power. A spokesman for the OHCHR said that such transfers may constitute a \"war crime.\" Human rights organizations have been critical of Israeli efforts to remove Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah, with Human Rights Watch releasing a statement saying that the disparate rights between Palestinian and Jewish residents of East Jerusalem \"underscores the reality of apartheid that Palestinians in East Jerusalem face.\" Israeli human rights groups estimate that over 1,000 Palestinian families are at risk of eviction in East Jerusalem.\n\n**Political instability**\n\nThe 2021 Palestinian legislative election for the Palestinian Legislative Council, originally scheduled for 22 May 2021, was indefinitely postponed on 29 April by President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas, which was expected to do well in the elections, called the move a \"coup,\" and some Palestinians believed Abbas had delayed the election to avoid political defeat for his party Fatah. Analysts say the postponement contributed towards the current crisis, and encouraged Hamas to resort to military confrontation rather than diplomatic tactics. Opinion pieces in NBC News, the Wall Street Journal, and Foreign Policy argued that by taking responsibility for the rocket fire, Hamas had improved its standing among Palestinians wary of the delayed elections.\n\n**Escalation**\n\nPalestinian protests began on 6 May in Sheikh Jarrah, but clashes soon spread to the al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, other Arab localities in Israel, and the West Bank. Between 10 and 14 May, Israeli security inflicted injuries on approximately 1,000 Palestinian protesters in East Jerusalem.\n\n**Arab communities in Israel**\n\nDuring the evening and night of 10 May, Arab rioters in Lod threw stones and firebombs at Jewish homes, a school, and a synagogue, later attacking a hospital. Shots were fired at the rioters, killing one and wounding two; a Jewish suspect in the shooting was arrested.\n\n**Gaza**\n\n232 housing units in high-rises were bombed over 11 days. According to a 23 May post-ceasefire UNOCHA estimate, the destruction and damage in Gaza was significant, with 60% of the population affected by the conflict.\n\n**Casualties and damage**\n\nThirteen people were killed in Israel, including two children, one Indian woman, and two Thai men living and working in Israel. By May 18, the Magen David Adom ambulance service had treated 114 injuries directly related to rocket attacks, and another 198 indirectly related to rocket attacks.\n\n**Medical facilities and personnel**\n\nHamas has been accused by Israel of using medical facilities to cover its activities.

then work together to restore order and get off the island The film adaptation omits certain characters, such as park publicist Ed Regis, and condenses the roles of others such as geneticist Henry Wu and veterinarian Dr Harding.\n\n\nDr. Alan Grant\nDr Alan Grant is a paleontologist and the main protagonist in the first novel, as well as the first and third films Crichton based Grant on paleontologist Jack Horner [1] Grant's research is partly focused on velociraptors When the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar escape their enclosures, Grant becomes stranded in the park with Hammond's two grandchildren Throughout a large portion of the book, Grant and the children explore the park trying to find their way back to the rest of the group In the film adaptation, much of this period is omitted.\n\n\nDr. Ellie Sattler\nDr Ellie Sattler is a paleobotanist who, in the novel, is a graduate student studying under Dr Alan Grant In the film adaptation, they are a couple, and she has a more prominent role Sattler is one of Dern's most popular film roles She briefly appears in Jurassic Park III, in which she and Grant have broken up, although they remain close friends She is married to Mark, an employee of the U.S State Department, and they have two young children An early draft had featured Grant and Sattler as a couple in the process of splitting up [5]\n\n\nDr. Ian Malcolm\nDr Ian Malcolm is a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory His character is based on Ivar Ekeland and James Gleick [jp 1] Malcolm's all-black clothing style reflects that of Heinz-Otto Peitgen, a mathematician who wrote a richly illustrated book on fractals According to Crichton, Malcolm's character functions as the \"ironic commentator inside the story who talks about the action as it takes place\" [7]\n\n\nJohn Hammond\nJohn Hammond is the wealthy owner of Jurassic Park and founder of InGen He is also the grandfather to Lex and Tim Murphy.\n\n\nRobert Muldoon\nRobert Muldoon is Jurassic Park's game warden He is described in the novel as a burly White Kenyan man fifty years of age, with deep blue eyes and a steel gray mustache In the movie he is portrayed by Englishman Bob Peck and given the characteristics of the traditional 'British' gamekeeper He is a former professional hunter who worked with Hammond at one of his previous parks in Kenya He has experience working with dangerous predators and (unlike most other characters) his attitude toward the dinosaurs is realistic and unromantic He believes that the Velociraptors should be destroyed, describing them as smart and potentially dangerous [jp 2] He also recommended that the park be equipped with more military-grade weapons for use in emergencies, but was overruled He reminds Hammond of this when it dawns on them that they have no way of stopping the escaped T rex Muldoon spends most of the novel riding around the park, drinking whiskey and attempting to restore order He is later attacked by a pack of Velociraptors, but survives by wedging himself into a pipe He manages to kill a few of them, and eventually escapes the island with the other survivors.\n\n\nDonald Gennaro\nDonald Gennaro is a corporate attorney representing Jurassic Park's investors He is sent on their behalf to investigate the safety of the park after several reports of missing or dead workers In the novel, he is described as a short muscular man and represents an \"every-man\" personality among the characters [22] Although he is initially worried only about disappointing his supervisors, he soon drops this concern when his life is threatened, focusing on survival instead When problems begin to occur, he consistently handles them appropriately, accompanying Robert Muldoon on a mission to subdue the Tyrannosaurus and successfully restoring power, despite being ambushed by a Velociraptor Grant claims that his negative attitude comes from trying to avoid responsibility for his role in creating the park Near the end of the novel, Gennaro realizes that he is partially responsible for everything occurring when Grant says: \"You sold investors on an undertaking you didn't fully understand.. You did not check on the activities of a man whom you knew from experience to be a liar, and you permitted that man to screw around with the most dangerous technology in human history\" Gennaro then helps Grant in his attempt to wipe out the remaining Velociraptors and their eggs with nerve gas [jp 3] Although he survives the events on the island, he dies of dysentery sometime after [23] [24]\n\n\nDr. Henry Wu\nDr Henry Wu is a character in the first novel and film, and returns throughout the Jurassic World trilogy He is initially the chief geneticist at Jurassic Park and head of the team that created the dinosaurs In the novel, he is killed by a Velociraptor He has a greatly reduced role in the film adaptation, but returns in a larger role for the Jurassic World films Wong believed that his diminished role in the first film was the result of \"racial exclusion in Hollywood\" [27] Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, the writers of Jurassic World, considered Wu a logical character to return, given his role in recreating dinosaurs [28]\n\n\nTim Murphy\nTim Murphy is Lex Murphy's brother and John Hammond's grandson.\n\n\nLex Murphy\nAlexis (Lex) Murphy is Tim Murphy's sister and John Hammond's granddaughter.\n\n\nJohn Arnold/Ray Arnold\nJohn Arnold is Jurassic Park's chief engineer, running the main control center from the Visitor Center He is described as a thin chain-smoker and chronic worrier A gifted systems engineer, Arnold had designed weapons for the U.S military, and later worked at several theme parks and zoos before joining the Jurassic Park team He is a grudgingly optimistic man, who maintains total faith in the computer systems and continues to believe that despite the setbacks, things will eventually work out When Dennis Nedry locks them out of the system, Arnold, after much persuasion by Donald Gennaro, shuts off all power to the park and resets the computer-control systems After turning the power back on, he believes the problem has been solved, when it has actually been made worse The reset has left the park running only on auxiliary power and disabled the electric fences around the dinosaur paddocks, allowing the creatures to break free Upon realizing his mistake, Arnold volunteers to go to the power plant and restart the main generator; before he can accomplish this task, though, he is killed by an escaped Velociraptor.\n\n\nDennis Nedry\nDennis Nedry is one of the main human antagonists in the novel and film In the novel, he is described as an obese, messy and an increasingly obnoxious computer scientist Nedry works for Hammond as the system's programmer and is in charge of networking Jurassic Park's computers Although he was not given any details about InGen's operation, Nedry was expected to fix numerous bugs and issues without understanding the ultimate goal After InGen makes him make changes to the system without further payment, he makes a deal with Dodgson of Biosyn to steal embryos of the park's 15 dinosaur species He is promised $50,000 for each species he delivers, and an additional $50,000 for each embryo that proves viable, for a maximum payment of $1.5 million Dodgson provides Nedry with an embryo carrier/cooler disguised as a can of shaving cream Nedry records their conversation, intending to enclose a copy with the embryos as a reminder of their agreement In order to carry out the theft, he shuts down the park's security systems, including several electric fences surrounding select dinosaur paddocks He plans to steal embryos from a secure lab, drive across the park to hand them off to a Biosyn agent waiting at the dock, and then return to the control room and reactivate the security systems before his absence becomes suspicious On his way to deliver the embryos, a tropical storm causes him to miss crucial road signs, and he becomes lost in the jungle and is subsequently blinded and killed by a venomous Dilophosaurus In the novel, his body is later found by Muldoon and Gennaro Nedry's intricate, complex computer knowledge makes him vain and prideful although later, one of Hammond's grandchildren is able to navigate Nedry's system and restore power to the Visitor Center [jp 7]\n\n\nDr. Harding\nDr Harding is Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian In the novel, he had been the chief of veterinary medicine for the San Diego Zoo, and was the world's leading expert on avian care He accepted the job at Jurassic Park because he wanted to become famous for writing the first textbook on the care of dinosaurs When the group first encounters him, he is caring for an ill Stegosaurus With the help of Ellie, he finds the source of the animal's sickness and is able to treat it Being the only medical doctor on the island, he treats Malcolm's injuries He is attacked by a Velociraptor during the assault on the Visitor Center, but ultimately survives his time on the island It is implied in the second novel that Sarah Harding is his daughter [a]\n\n\nDr. Lewis Dodgson\nDr Lewis Dodgson [60] is the main antagonist of both the Jurassic Park novels, and the main antagonist in Jurassic World Dominion.\n\n\nMr. DNA\nMr DNA is a cartoon character that resembles an anthropomorphic DNA helix with a face and arms [70] He is the mascot for the theme parks Jurassic Park and Jurassic World Most of his lines and explanations are said by Henry Wu in the novel during a tour of the genetics lab, some of which is still given to the cameo Wu makes in the original film.\n\n\nEd Regis\nEd Regis is a publicist for InGen and the head of public relations for Jurassic Park Regis is often given odd jobs by Hammond that are outside his area of expertise, such as escorting a wounded worker to a Costa Rican hospital, and acting as a babysitter for Lex and Tim during their visit to the park Despite being overconfident about the park and almost negligent about the accidents that have been occurring, fear quickly overtakes him as things begin to go wrong, since he had already witnessed the brutality of dinosaur attacks When the Tyrannosaurus breaks free of its pen, he abandons the tour vehicle, leaving Tim and Lex behind After hiding between some boulders, he tries to make his way back to the cars, but is killed by a juvenile Tyrannosaurus His severed leg is later discovered by Gennaro and Muldoon as they investigate the attack.\n\n\nDr. Marty Gutierrez\nDr Marty Gutierrez is an American biologist who lives in Costa Rica He plays an expository role in both novels In the first novel, he identifies an unknown lizard that attacks a little girl as Basiliscus amoratus He is initially unhappy with this identification because the lizard was more venomous than expected and had three toes He searches the beach where she was attacked and finds the corpse of a similar lizard in the mouth of a howler monkey; he promptly sends the body for laboratory analysis He also appears at the end of the novel, when the survivors are being held back for questioning by the Costa Rican government He tells Dr Grant that the survivors, with the exception of the children, will not be leaving any time soon.\n\n\nAppearing in The Lost World\nCrichton wrote a sequel novel, The Lost World, which was published in 1995 Spielberg returned to direct a film adaptation, released as The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997 In both the novel and film, two teams travel to Isla Sorna, a second island of dinosaurs that served as the breeding site before moving the animals to Isla Nublar While one team intends to observe the dinosaurs, the other attempts to take them off the island and exploit them for profit Like its predecessor, the film adaptation omits certain characters while adding new ones.\n\n\nDr. Sarah Harding\nIn the novel, Dr Sarah Harding is an ethologist (animal behaviorist) who specializes in African predators She is depicted as dark-haired and muscular She is intelligent, feisty and rugged, and employs common sense and practicality in dangerous situations, putting the safety of her colleagues first Her calm personality permits her to quickly take command of the group and devise ways for them to survive and escape Isla Sorna She and Dr Ian Malcolm were in a relationship for a period, and at one point she claimed she was in love with him The relationship did not work out, although they remained close friends She is idolized by Kelly Curtis who sees her as tough and smart In the novel, she mentions that her father was a veterinarian and bird specialist at the San Diego Zoo, implying that Dr Harding is her father She rides a motorcycle on several occasions, including an instance where she is being chased by raptors.\n\n\nRoland Tembo\nRoland Tembo is a hunter hired by InGen to lead its expedition on Isla Sorna His primary motivation for going to the island is so he and Ajay Sidhu, his hunting partner and close friend, can hunt the ultimate trophy, a male Tyrannosaurus Although he gets his prize in the end, he is devastated by the death of Ajay When Ludlow offers him a job at the planned Jurassic Park attraction in San Diego, he declines by saying: \"I believe I've spent enough time in

leads to a series of incidents proving Malcolm right The group then work together to restore order and get off the island The film adaptation omits certain characters, such as park publicist Ed Regis, and condenses the roles of others such as geneticist Henry Wu and veterinarian Dr Harding.\n\n\nDr. Alan Grant\nDr Alan Grant is a paleontologist and the main protagonist in the first novel, as well as the first and third films Crichton based Grant on paleontologist Jack Horner [1] Grant's research is partly focused on velociraptors When the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar escape their enclosures, Grant becomes stranded in the park with Hammond's two grandchildren Throughout a large portion of the book, Grant and the children explore the park trying to find their way back to the rest of the group In the film adaptation, much of this period is omitted.\n\n\nDr. Ellie Sattler\nDr Ellie Sattler is a paleobotanist who, in the novel, is a graduate student studying under Dr Alan Grant In the film adaptation, they are a couple, and she has a more prominent role Sattler is one of Dern's most popular film roles She briefly appears in Jurassic Park III, in which she and Grant have broken up, although they remain close friends She is married to Mark, an employee of the U.S State Department, and they have two young children An early draft had featured Grant and Sattler as a couple in the process of splitting up [5]\n\n\nDr. Ian Malcolm\nDr Ian Malcolm is a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory His character is based on Ivar Ekeland and James Gleick [jp 1] Malcolm's all-black clothing style reflects that of Heinz-Otto Peitgen, a mathematician who wrote a richly illustrated book on fractals According to Crichton, Malcolm's character functions as the \"ironic commentator inside the story who talks about the action as it takes place\" [7]\n\n\nJohn Hammond\nJohn Hammond is the wealthy owner of Jurassic Park and founder of InGen He is also the grandfather to Lex and Tim Murphy.\n\n\nRobert Muldoon\nRobert Muldoon is Jurassic Park's game warden He is described in the novel as a burly White Kenyan man fifty years of age, with deep blue eyes and a steel gray mustache In the movie he is portrayed by Englishman Bob Peck and given the characteristics of the traditional 'British' gamekeeper He is a former professional hunter who worked with Hammond at one of his previous parks in Kenya He has experience working with dangerous predators and (unlike most other characters) his attitude toward the dinosaurs is realistic and unromantic He believes that the Velociraptors should be destroyed, describing them as smart and potentially dangerous [jp 2] He also recommended that the park be equipped with more military-grade weapons for use in emergencies, but was overruled He reminds Hammond of this when it dawns on them that they have no way of stopping the escaped T rex Muldoon spends most of the novel riding around the park, drinking whiskey and attempting to restore order He is later attacked by a pack of Velociraptors, but survives by wedging himself into a pipe He manages to kill a few of them, and eventually escapes the island with the other survivors.\n\n\nDonald Gennaro\nDonald Gennaro is a corporate attorney representing Jurassic Park's investors He is sent on their behalf to investigate the safety of the park after several reports of missing or dead workers In the novel, he is described as a short muscular man and represents an \"every-man\" personality among the characters [22] Although he is initially worried only about disappointing his supervisors, he soon drops this concern when his life is threatened, focusing on survival instead When problems begin to occur, he consistently handles them appropriately, accompanying Robert Muldoon on a mission to subdue the Tyrannosaurus and successfully restoring power, despite being ambushed by a Velociraptor Grant claims that his negative attitude comes from trying to avoid responsibility for his role in creating the park Near the end of the novel, Gennaro realizes that he is partially responsible for everything occurring when Grant says: \"You sold investors on an undertaking you didn't fully understand.. You did not check on the activities of a man whom you knew from experience to be a liar, and you permitted that man to screw around with the most dangerous technology in human history\" Gennaro then helps Grant in his attempt to wipe out the remaining Velociraptors and their eggs with nerve gas [jp 3] Although he survives the events on the island, he dies of dysentery sometime after [23] [24]\n\n\nDr. Henry Wu\nDr Henry Wu is a character in the first novel and film, and returns throughout the Jurassic World trilogy He is initially the chief geneticist at Jurassic Park and head of the team that created the dinosaurs In the novel, he is killed by a Velociraptor He has a greatly reduced role in the film adaptation, but returns in a larger role for the Jurassic World films Wong believed that his diminished role in the first film was the result of \"racial exclusion in Hollywood\" [27] Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, the writers of Jurassic World, considered Wu a logical character to return, given his role in recreating dinosaurs [28]\n\n\nTim Murphy\nTim Murphy is Lex Murphy's brother and John Hammond's grandson.\n\n\nLex Murphy\nAlexis (Lex) Murphy is Tim Murphy's sister and John Hammond's granddaughter.\n\n\nJohn Arnold/Ray Arnold\nJohn Arnold is Jurassic Park's chief engineer, running the main control center from the Visitor Center He is described as a thin chain-smoker and chronic worrier A gifted systems engineer, Arnold had designed weapons for the U.S military, and later worked at several theme parks and zoos before joining the Jurassic Park team He is a grudgingly optimistic man, who maintains total faith in the computer systems and continues to believe that despite the setbacks, things will eventually work out When Dennis Nedry locks them out of the system, Arnold, after much persuasion by Donald Gennaro, shuts off all power to the park and resets the computer-control systems After turning the power back on, he believes the problem has been solved, when it has actually been made worse The reset has left the park running only on auxiliary power and disabled the electric fences around the dinosaur paddocks, allowing the creatures to break free Upon realizing his mistake, Arnold volunteers to go to the power plant and restart the main generator; before he can accomplish this task, though, he is killed by an escaped Velociraptor.\n\n\nDennis Nedry\nDennis Nedry is one of the main human antagonists in the novel and film In the novel, he is described as an obese, messy and an increasingly obnoxious computer scientist Nedry works for Hammond as the system's programmer and is in charge of networking Jurassic Park's computers Although he was not given any details about InGen's operation, Nedry was expected to fix numerous bugs and issues without understanding the ultimate goal After InGen makes him make changes to the system without further payment, he makes a deal with Dodgson of Biosyn to steal embryos of the park's 15 dinosaur species He is promised $50,000 for each species he delivers, and an additional $50,000 for each embryo that proves viable, for a maximum payment of $1.5 million Dodgson provides Nedry with an embryo carrier/cooler disguised as a can of shaving cream Nedry records their conversation, intending to enclose a copy with the embryos as a reminder of their agreement In order to carry out the theft, he shuts down the park's security systems, including several electric fences surrounding select dinosaur paddocks He plans to steal embryos from a secure lab, drive across the park to hand them off to a Biosyn agent waiting at the dock, and then return to the control room and reactivate the security systems before his absence becomes suspicious On his way to deliver the embryos, a tropical storm causes him to miss crucial road signs, and he becomes lost in the jungle and is subsequently blinded and killed by a venomous Dilophosaurus In the novel, his body is later found by Muldoon and Gennaro Nedry's intricate, complex computer knowledge makes him vain and prideful although later, one of Hammond's grandchildren is able to navigate Nedry's system and restore power to the Visitor Center [jp 7]\n\n\nDr. Harding\nDr Harding is Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian In the novel, he had been the chief of veterinary medicine for the San Diego Zoo, and was the world's leading expert on avian care He accepted the job at Jurassic Park because he wanted to become famous for writing the first textbook on the care of dinosaurs When the group first encounters him, he is caring for an ill Stegosaurus With the help of Ellie, he finds the source of the animal's sickness and is able to treat it Being the only medical doctor on the island, he treats Malcolm's injuries He is attacked by a Velociraptor during the assault on the Visitor Center, but ultimately survives his time on the island It is implied in the second novel that Sarah Harding is his daughter [a]\n\n\nDr. Lewis Dodgson\nDr Lewis Dodgson [60] is the main antagonist of both the Jurassic Park novels, and the main antagonist in Jurassic World Dominion.\n\n\nMr. DNA\nMr DNA is a cartoon character that resembles an anthropomorphic DNA helix with a face and arms [70] He is the mascot for the theme parks Jurassic Park and Jurassic World Most of his lines and explanations are said by Henry Wu in the novel during a tour of the genetics lab, some of which is still given to the cameo Wu makes in the original film.\n\n\nEd Regis\nEd Regis is a publicist for InGen and the head of public relations for Jurassic Park Regis is often given odd jobs by Hammond that are outside his area of expertise, such as escorting a wounded worker to a Costa Rican hospital, and acting as a babysitter for Lex and Tim during their visit to the park Despite being overconfident about the park and almost negligent about the accidents that have been occurring, fear quickly overtakes him as things begin to go wrong, since he had already witnessed the brutality of dinosaur attacks When the Tyrannosaurus breaks free of its pen, he abandons the tour vehicle, leaving Tim and Lex behind After hiding between some boulders, he tries to make his way back to the cars, but is killed by a juvenile Tyrannosaurus His severed leg is later discovered by Gennaro and Muldoon as they investigate the attack.\n\n\nDr. Marty Gutierrez\nDr Marty Gutierrez is an American biologist who lives in Costa Rica He plays an expository role in both novels In the first novel, he identifies an unknown lizard that attacks a little girl as Basiliscus amoratus He is initially unhappy with this identification because the lizard was more venomous than expected and had three toes He searches the beach where she was attacked and finds the corpse of a similar lizard in the mouth of a howler monkey; he promptly sends the body for laboratory analysis He also appears at the end of the novel, when the survivors are being held back for questioning by the Costa Rican government He tells Dr Grant that the survivors, with the exception of the children, will not be leaving any time soon.\n\n\nAppearing in The Lost World\nCrichton wrote a sequel novel, The Lost World, which was published in 1995 Spielberg returned to direct a film adaptation, released as The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997 In both the novel and film, two teams travel to Isla Sorna, a second island of dinosaurs that served as the breeding site before moving the animals to Isla Nublar While one team intends to observe the dinosaurs, the other attempts to take them off the island and exploit them for profit Like its predecessor, the film adaptation omits certain characters while adding new ones.\n\n\nDr. Sarah Harding\nIn the novel, Dr Sarah Harding is an ethologist (animal behaviorist) who specializes in African predators She is depicted as dark-haired and muscular She is intelligent, feisty and rugged, and employs common sense and practicality in dangerous situations, putting the safety of her colleagues first Her calm personality permits her to quickly take command of the group and devise ways for them to survive and escape Isla Sorna She and Dr Ian Malcolm were in a relationship for a period, and at one point she claimed she was in love with him The relationship did not work out, although they remained close friends She is idolized by Kelly Curtis who sees her as tough and smart In the novel, she mentions that her father was a veterinarian and bird specialist at the San Diego Zoo, implying that Dr Harding is her father She rides a motorcycle on several occasions, including an instance where she is being chased by raptors.\n\n\nRoland Tembo\nRoland Tembo is a hunter hired by InGen to lead its expedition on Isla Sorna His primary motivation for going to the island is so he and Ajay Sidhu, his hunting partner and close friend, can hunt the ultimate trophy, a male Tyrannosaurus Although he gets his prize in the end, he is devastated by the death of Ajay When Ludlow offers him a job at the planned Jurassic Park attraction in San Diego, he declines by saying: \"I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death\" Without hesitation, Roland leaves the island by helicopter.\n\n\nPeter Ludlow\nPeter Ludlow is the main antagonist of the second film, John Hammond's nephew, and the newly elected CEO of InGen He attained this position after convincing InGen's board of directors to oust Hammond following an accident on Isla Sorna, in which a group of Compsognathus attacked a girl who was visiting the island with her family Ludlow is also directly responsible for tarnishing Ian Malcolm's reputation, through outright bribes to Costa Rican officials and misinformation to the press, when Malcolm tries to expose InGen's cover-up of the Jurassic Park incident His character is ruthless, selfish, greedy and condescending toward those who work for him or those he dislikes As a result, he is not well respected by the members of his team who instead choose to follow Roland Tembo or Nick Van Owen In an attempt to revitalize Hammond's original Jurassic Park attraction in San Diego, Ludlow assembles an InGen team to recover Isla Sorna's dinosaurs and move them to the original park But Ludlow only manages to bring back the male T rex and his infant, with disastrous results leading to his own demise as the adult T rex wreaks havoc on San Diego.\n\n\nNick Van Owen\nNick Van Owen is a video documentarian and member of Malcolm's expedition to Isla Sorna He is an experienced field photographer who has covered wildlife and combat situations, and began volunteering with Greenpeace to meet women His experience with Greenpeace later spurs him to act in defense of the dinosaurs He is the only member of his team to be warned by Hammond about InGen's expedition, and sneaks into their camp to release captured animals and disrupt their harvesting operation He also rescues the infant T rex from Roland Tembo, leading to a confrontation with its parents which strands both teams on the island As the teams merge and form an escape plan, Nick easily gains the tacit respect of the rugged InGen men, as in one scene he is shown to effortlessly motivate the men while Peter Ludlow fails His activist nature conflicts with the hunter style of Roland, and he covertly switches the latter's ammunition to ensure the T rex adults will not be killed When the group reaches the island's InGen compound, Nick uses the radio to call for rescue He leaves on the first evacuation helicopter departing Isla Sorna.\n\n\nKelly Curtis\nKelly Curtis is a close friend of Arby in the novel, and is Dr Ian Malcolm's daughter in the film In the novel, Kelly is a 13-year-old girl who is

by Velociraptors hiding in the grass Ajay's death is not shown on screen, but Roland later confirms it by stating that Ajay \"didn't make it\".\n\n\nEddie Carr\nEddie Carr is the key assistant to Doc Thorne He is added to the team because the vehicles he help designed have not been field-tested Eddie is frightened by Isla Sorna and wants nothing more than to retrieve Richard Levine and get off the island as soon as possible Dr Ian Malcolm does not like that Eddie's life is so heavily influenced by unreliable electronics When a pack of raptors attack the high hide, they yank him off and kill him, before dragging his body to their nest.\n\n\nDr. Robert Burke\nDr Robert Burke is the InGen team's paleontologist who provides several pieces of incorrect information During a conversation with Malcolm, Sarah Harding states, \"Robert Burke said that the T rex was a rogue that would abandon its young at the earliest opportunity\" Burke's theory is disproved later in the film when adult Tyrannosaurs attack the trailer in which their infant is being held Burke and others hide behind a waterfall when they are pursued by a Tyrannosaurus, but he is startled when a milk snake slithers down into his shirt He panics and is subsequently caught and eaten by the T rex.\n\n\nDr. Richard Levine\nRichard Levine is one of the most brilliant and wealthy paleontologists in the Jurassic Park

judge to teach a junior high school class, where he meets students Arby Benton and Kelly Curtis Aware that he is being followed by Ed James, Levine hires Arby and Kelly as his assistants to run errands for him ahead of the expedition.\n\n\nJack \"Doc\" Thorne\nJack \"Doc\" Thorne is a former university professor of applied engineering from Stanford who specializes in building field equipment, vehicles, and weaponry for field scientists Thorne is also the boss of Eddie Carr He exhibits an eclectic mix of character traits, relying on both practical expertise and Eastern philosophy, claiming that one needs to know philosophy and history to succeed in engineering His company, Thorne Mobile Field Systems, is hired to outfit Richard Levine's expedition to Isla Sorna Thorne's contribution to Levine's mission includes a large research trailer, nicknamed \"The Challenger\", an electric SUV, a motor bike, a pair of air rifles with poisonous darts, and a modified satellite phone When Levine goes missing on the island, Thorne heads to Isla Sorna with Dr Ian Malcolm and Eddie Carr to rescue him Thorne saves his colleague multiple times, and survives his time on

Baselton is a biology professor and assistant to Dr Lewis Dodgson He is characterized as a \"celebrity biologist\" As a well known authority and pundit, he is retained by Biosyn and Dodgson to spin any bad press that may arise When he, Howard King and Dodgson try to steal Tyrannosaurus eggs, the sonic device Dodgson is using to keep the parent Tyrannosaurs at bay becomes unplugged Dodgson and Baselton stand still, believing a paleontological article which theorized that the dinosaur's vision is based on movement This turns out to be false, and the Tyrannosaurus eats Baselton alive.\n\n\nDiego\nDiego is Dr Richard Levine's guide on Isla Sorna He is a young and enthusiastic Costa Rican who visited the island several times as a boy and knows it well When Levine warns him to be quiet, he simply says that they have nothing to fear He seems to annoy Levine many times, not only with his insistence that only birds live on the island, but also by disobeying his orders to refrain from using items like cigarettes and making noise Diego is ambushed and killed by a Carnotaurus while he and Levine watch a Mussaurus in total awe He has a cousin named Gandoca who takes Dodgson, King, Baselton, and Harding on a boat trip to Isla Sorna.\n\n\nEd James\nEd James is a private investigator hired by Dr Lewis Dodgson to get information about Dr Richard Levine and the

{"title": "Cuban_Missile_Crisis", "content": "\nBackground\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership In the interval, Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance In March 1962, Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as raised fears of a possible US invasion As a result, the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops [7]\n\n\nCuba–Soviet relations\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked

Revolutionary Organizations This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as raised fears of a possible US invasion As a result, the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops [7]\n\n\nCuba–US relations\nThe Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses [9] The US government provided weapons, money, and its authority to the military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista that ruled Cuba until 1958 The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country The Cuban government was thus aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable [9] [10]\n\n\nUS–Soviet relations\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets In fact, the US at that time led the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75 [34]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles [37] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union [38] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965 [38]\n\n\nConception\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles [37] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union [38] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965 [38]\n\n\nSoviet military deployments\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro According to one report, Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp [45] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nMissiles reported\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US The planned arsenal was forty launchers The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nAerial confirmation\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion [68] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on 30 August, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2 [69] [70] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM) US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on 10 September, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\" [71] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence [72] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship Kasimov, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages [34]\n\n\nPresident notified\nOn 15 October, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6 Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery [75]\n\n\nResponses considered\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action: [82]\n\n\nOperational plans\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nBlockade\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout 21 October, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba [90] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade [93] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS) [94]\n\n\nSpeech to the nation\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on 22 October, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196 At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response All were supportive of the US position Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions [99]\n\n\nCrisis deepens\nAt 11:24 am EDT on 24 October, a cable from US Secretary of State George Ball to the US Ambassadors in Turkey and NATO notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country [106] One day later, on the morning of 25 October, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection [15]\n\n\nInternational response\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese People's Daily announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\" [107] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin In France on 23 October, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers The next day, an editorial in Le Monde expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs In the 29 October issue of Le Figaro, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response [108] On 24 October, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\" [109]\n\n\nSoviet broadcast and communications\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of 24 October, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war [110] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it [105] After 23 October, Soviet communications with the US increasingly showed indications of having been rushed Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing [111] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations [clarification needed] [112]\n\n\nUS alert level raised\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 25 October US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles Ambassador Zorin refused to answer At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2 For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice [113] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba [114] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status [91] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious [115] Jack J Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A Burchinal recalled that, by contrast: [116]\n\n\nBlockade challenged\nAt 7:15 am EDT on 25 October, USS Essex and USS Gearing attempted to intercept Bucharest but failed to do so Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS Joseph P Kennedy Jr to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter Marucla That took place the next day, and Marucla was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked [117]\n\n\nRaising the stakes\nThe next morning, 26 October, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead [citation needed]\n\n\nSecret negotiations\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on 26 October, John A Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU, [122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba [123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed [106]\n\n\nCrisis continues\nDirect aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n\nDrafting response\nEmissaries sent by both Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to meet at the Yenching Palace Chinese restaurant in the Cleveland Park neighbourhood of Washington, DC, on Saturday evening, 27 October [139] Kennedy suggested to take Khrushchev's offer to trade away the missiles Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine [140] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAverted nuclear launch\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (\"practice\" depth charges the size of hand grenades) [146] on a Soviet submarine (B-59) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire [147] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, [148] [149] the captain of the B-59, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, assumed after live ammunition fire at his submarine, that a war had already started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo [150] [better source needed] The decision to launch these normally only required the agreement of the ship's commanding officer and political officer However, the commander of the submarine flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard B-59 and so he also had to agree Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted (These events only publicly became known in 2002 See Submarine close call.) \n\n\nResolution\nOn Saturday, 27 October, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey [158]\n\n\nNuclear forces\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe [182] [183]\n\n\nUnited States\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come [44]: 278 \n\n\nSoviet Union\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been

Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come [44]: 278 \n\n\nRomanian leadership\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow [188]\n\n\nSoviet leadership\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US [189] In a letter to President Kennedy dated 30 October 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962 [190]\n\n\nUS leadership\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on 20 November 1962 General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position [84] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles [192] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\" [116]\n\n\nHuman casualties\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between 27 September and 11 November 1962 [202] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on 23 October [203]\n\n\nLater revelations\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002, marking the 40th anniversary of the crisis A three-day conference sponsored by the private National Security Archive, Brown University, and the Cuban government [204] Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on 27 October 1962, a group of eleven United States Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph located the B-59, a diesel-powered nuclear-armed Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine, near Cuba Despite being in international waters, the Americans started dropping depth charges There had been no contact from Moscow for a number of days and the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, so those on board did not know whether war had broken out The captain of the submarine, Valentin Savitsky, had no way of knowing that the depth charges were non-lethal \"practice\" rounds intended as warning shots to force the B-59 to surface Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface While surfacing, the B-59 “came under machine-gun fire from  [U.S ASW S-2] Tracker aircraft The fire rounds landed either to the sides of the submarine’s hull or near the bow All these provocative actions carried out by surface ships in immediate proximity, and ASW aircraft flying some 10 to 15 meters above the boat had a detrimental impact on the commander, prompting him to take extreme measures… the use of special weapons.” [205] As firing live ammunition at a submarine was strictly prohibited, Captain Savitsky assumed that his submarine was doomed and that World War III already had broken out The Americans, for their part, did not know, that the B-59 was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo, roughly the power of the bomb at Hiroshima [206] [150] [better source needed] The USS Beale was

and the Soviet Union that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The crisis began on October 14, 1962, when American U-2 spy planes discovered Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles under construction in Cuba, just 90 miles from the United States. The crisis ended on October 28, 1962, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the Soviet missile sites in Cuba in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade the island.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn the early 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a Cold War, a global ideological and strategic rivalry between the two superpowers. The Soviet Union, under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, was seeking to expand its influence in the Western Hemisphere and to counter the growing power of the United States. In 1961, the Soviet Union had helped to establish a communist government in Cuba, led by Fidel Castro, which was seen as a threat to the United States.\n\n**Cuba–Soviet relations**\n\nIn 1962, the Soviet Union began to construct nuclear-armed ballistic missile sites in Cuba, just 90 miles from the United States. The Soviet Union had already provided Cuba with conventional military equipment, including fighter jets and tanks, but the construction of nuclear-armed missile sites was a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n**US–Soviet relations**\n\nThe United States had been aware of the Soviet Union's plans to deploy nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba, but it had not taken any action to prevent it. The United States had a policy of containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism and to limit the Soviet Union's influence in the world. The deployment of nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba was seen as a threat to the United States and its allies, and it led to a major crisis in US-Soviet relations.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba. Despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles, Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage.\n\n**Soviet military deployments**\n\nA group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana and obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. According to one report, Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n**Missiles reported**\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers, and the Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.\n\n**Aerial confirmation**\n\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on 30 August, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized.\n\n**President notified**\n\nOn 15 October, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium-range ballistic missiles. The US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba.\n\n**Operational plans**\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes.\n\n**Blockade**\n\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout 21 October, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba. A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option.\n\n**Speech to the nation**\n\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on 22 October, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response.\n\n**Crisis deepens**\n\nThe next morning, 26 October, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure.\n\n**Secret negotiations**\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on 26 October, John A Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request. Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nOn Saturday, 27 October, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe crisis ended on October 28, 1962, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the Soviet missile sites in Cuba. The crisis had brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, but it had also revealed the limits of Soviet power and the willingness of the United States to use military force to protect its interests.\n\n**Human casualties**\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honors in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously.\n\n**Later revelations**\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002, marking the 40th anniversary of the crisis.

following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership In the interval, Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance In March 1962, Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as raised fears of a possible US invasion As a result, the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops [7]\n\n\nCuba–Soviet relations\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2

provided weapons, money, and its authority to the military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista that ruled Cuba until 1958 The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country The Cuban government was thus aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable [9] [10]\n\n\nUS–Soviet relations\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets In fact, the US at that time led the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75 [34]\n\n\nPrelude\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba,

situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union [38] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965 [38]\n\n\nConception\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing

Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro According to one report, Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp [45] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nMissiles reported\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US The planned arsenal was forty launchers The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nAerial confirmation\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion [68] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on 30 August, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2 [69] [70] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM) US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on 10 September, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\" [71] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence [72] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship Kasimov, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages [34]\n\n\nPresident notified\nOn 15 October, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6 Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery [75]\n\n\nResponses considered\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action: [82]\n\n\nOperational plans\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nBlockade\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout 21 October, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba [90] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade [93] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS) [94]\n\n\nSpeech to the nation\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on 22 October, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196 At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response All were supportive of the US position Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions [99]\n\n\nCrisis deepens\nAt 11:24 am EDT on 24 October, a cable from US Secretary of State George Ball to the US Ambassadors in Turkey and NATO notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country [106] One day later, on the morning of 25 October, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection [15]\n\n\nInternational response\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese People's Daily announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\" [107] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin In France on 23 October, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers The next day, an editorial in Le Monde expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs In the 29 October issue of Le Figaro, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response [108] On 24 October, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\" [109]\n\n\nSoviet broadcast and communications\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of 24 October, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war [110] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it [105] After 23 October, Soviet communications with the US increasingly showed indications of having been rushed Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing [111] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations [clarification needed] [112]\n\n\nUS alert level raised\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on 25 October US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles Ambassador Zorin refused to answer At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2 For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice [113] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba [114] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status [91] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious [115] Jack J Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A Burchinal recalled that, by contrast: [116]\n\n\nBlockade challenged\nAt 7:15 am EDT on 25 October, USS Essex and USS Gearing attempted to intercept Bucharest but failed to do so Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS Joseph P Kennedy Jr to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter Marucla That took place the next day, and Marucla was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked [117]\n\n\nRaising the stakes\nThe next morning, 26 October, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead [citation needed]\n\n\nSecret negotiations\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on 26 October, John A Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU, [122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba [123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed [106]\n\n\nCrisis continues\nDirect aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n\nDrafting response\nEmissaries sent by both Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to meet at the Yenching Palace Chinese restaurant in the Cleveland Park neighbourhood of Washington, DC, on Saturday evening, 27 October [139] Kennedy suggested to take Khrushchev's offer to trade away the missiles Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine [140] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAverted nuclear launch\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (\"practice\" depth charges the size of hand grenades) [146] on a Soviet submarine (B-59) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire [147] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, [148] [149] the captain of the B-59, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, assumed after live ammunition fire at his submarine, that a war had already started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo [150] [better source needed] The decision to launch these normally only required the agreement of the ship's commanding officer and political officer However, the commander of the submarine flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard B-59 and so he also had to agree Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted (These events only publicly became known in 2002 See Submarine close call.) \n\n\nResolution\nOn Saturday, 27 October, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey [158]\n\n\nNuclear forces\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe [182] [183]\n\n\nUnited States\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come [44]: 278 \n\n\nSoviet Union\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been

Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come [44]: 278 \n\n\nRomanian leadership\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow [188]\n\n\nSoviet leadership\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US [189] In a letter to President Kennedy dated 30 October 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962 [190]\n\n\nUS leadership\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on 20 November 1962 General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position [84] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles [192] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\" [116]\n\n\nHuman casualties\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between 27 September and 11 November 1962 [202] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on 23 October [203]\n\n\nLater revelations\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002, marking the 40th anniversary of the crisis A three-day conference sponsored by the private National Security Archive, Brown University, and the Cuban government [204] Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on 27 October 1962, a group of eleven United States Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph located the B-59, a diesel-powered nuclear-armed Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine, near Cuba Despite being in international waters, the Americans started dropping depth charges There had been no contact from Moscow for a number of days and the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, so those on board did not know whether war had broken out The captain of the submarine, Valentin Savitsky, had no way of knowing that the depth charges were non-lethal \"practice\" rounds intended as warning shots to force the B-59 to surface Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface While surfacing, the B-59 “came under machine-gun fire from  [U.S ASW S-2] Tracker aircraft The fire rounds landed either to the sides of the submarine’s hull or near the bow All these provocative actions carried out by surface ships in immediate proximity, and ASW aircraft flying some 10 to 15 meters above the boat had a detrimental impact on the commander, prompting him to take extreme measures… the use of special weapons.” [205] As firing live ammunition at a submarine was strictly prohibited, Captain Savitsky assumed that his submarine was doomed and that World War III already had broken out The Americans, for their part, did not know, that the B-59 was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo, roughly the power of the bomb at Hiroshima [206] [150] [better source needed] The USS Beale was joined by other US destroyers who piled in to pummel the submerged B-59 with more explosives \n\n\nSubmarine close call\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the

\n\n\nPossibility of nuclear launch\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke [208] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed [208]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms [212] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\" [213] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during

Her life and tragic death have been the subject of much attention and speculation over the years.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nNeilia Hunter was born on July 28, 1942, in Skaneateles, New York, to Louise (née Basel) and Robert Hunter. She was the daughter of a Presbyterian family and had two brothers, John and Michael. Neilia attended Penn Hall, a secondary boarding school in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where she was active in the school's French club, field hockey, swimming, and student council. After completing her secondary education, she attended Syracuse University and began her career as a school teacher in the Syracuse City School District.\n\nNeilia's teaching career spanned several years, during which she worked as an English teacher at the Bellevue School in Syracuse, New York. Her experience and dedication to education made her a respected member of her community. It is worth noting that Neilia was a first cousin of former Auburn city councilman Robert Hunter.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNeilia's life took a significant turn when she met Joe Biden in Nassau, Bahamas, while they were both on spring break. Shortly after their meeting, Biden moved to Syracuse to be closer to Neilia and attend law school. The couple married on August 27, 1966, and after Biden's graduation from law school, they moved to Wilmington, Delaware, where he was on the New Castle County Council. Neilia and Joe had three children: Joseph Robinette \"Beau\" III, Robert Hunter, and Naomi Christina, \"Amy.\"\n\nNeilia's role as a wife and mother was a central part of her life, and she was devoted to her family. Her relationship with Joe was strong, and she was his partner in every sense of the word. The couple's life together was marked by love, laughter, and adventure, but it was also marked by tragedy.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn December 18, 1972, Neilia was driving with her three children west along rural Valley Road in Hockessin, Delaware. At the intersection with Delaware Route 7 (Limestone Road), their vehicle pulled out in front of a tractor-trailer truck traveling north along Route 7 and was hit by the tractor-trailer. The truck driver, Curtis C Dunn, escaped without any major injury, but Neilia and her children were not so fortunate.\n\nAll four occupants were taken to Wilmington General Hospital, where Neilia and Naomi were pronounced dead on arrival. Beau and Hunter were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. Two weeks after the crash, Joe was sworn into the Senate at the hospital, where Beau and Hunter were being treated.\n\nThe accident was a devastating blow to Joe and their family, and it had a profound impact on his life and career. The loss of Neilia and their young daughter Naomi was a tragedy that would stay with Joe for the rest of his life.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn a commencement speech at Yale University in 2015, Joe Biden spoke of his wife, saying, \"The incredible bond I have with my children is the gift I'm not sure I would have had, had I not been through what I went through  [after the fatal crash] But by focusing on my sons, I found my redemption.\" Neilia's legacy lives on through her children and husband, who have gone on to achieve great things in their lives.\n\nNeilia and Naomi were buried in St Joseph on the Brandywine Cemetery in Greenville, Delaware.

{"title": "2020–21_Australian_region_cyclone_season", "content": "\nSeason forecasts\nIn October 2020, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issued its tropical cyclone outlook for the 2020–21 season, and in the same month, the agency contributed towards the Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Outlook, along with New Zealand's MetService, NIWA and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) Each of the outlooks accounted for analogue seasons and the effects of various climate drivers, which included the state of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Below average sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmospheric conditions indicated a La Niña pattern, and it was declared that a La Niña had emerged on 29 September 2020 The BOM predicted that the La Niña pattern will persist into early 2021, and waters north of Australia and the Southwestern Pacific Ocean will be warmer than average in the coming three months [1] [2] The bureau also advised that cyclone kits include a supply of face masks and hand sanitisers, owing to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic [3]\n\n\nSeason summary\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes [6] [7] The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November [6] [7] On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860 km (530 mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands [8] [9] The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM [10] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear [11] Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week [10] [11]\n\n\nSystems\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes [6] [7] The

conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear [11] Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week [10] [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 01U (Bongoyo)\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes [6] [7] The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November [6] [7] On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860 km (530 mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands [8] [9] The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM [10] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear [11] Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week [10] [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 02U\nOn 6 December, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough near the western end of Java, approximately 200 km (120 mi) north-northeast of Christmas Island [26] [27] The system was assigned the official identifier code 02U upon formation [26] Initially located in an unfavourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions as it tracked towards the southeast [28] [29] On 7 December, warm sea surface temperatures and strong diffluence in the upper troposphere fuelled the development of deep convection around the system's low-level circulation centre Referencing the tropical low's quickly improving structure and the presence of a weak eye feature in microwave satellite imagery, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 05:30 UTC [28] After tracking in a clockwise path around the northeastern side of Christmas Island, Tropical Low 02U became quasi-stationary on 8 December [30] [31] Deep convection continued to develop near the centre during the overnight period, and as the low began to track eastwards, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 18:00 UTC on 8 December [32]\n\n\nTropical Low\nThe presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Rossby wave in the Australian region contributed to the formation of another broad low-pressure system in the monsoon trough over the far eastern Indian Ocean during early December [48] [49] Initially lacking organised deep convection, the system proceeded to track in a generally southwards direction towards the Kimberley region of Western Australia By late on 7 December, infrared satellite imagery indicated an improvement in the structure of the low, with the system displaying an increase in flaring deep convection, accompanied by rotation evident in the lower troposphere [50] Owing to the increase in organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 21:00 UTC, [51] when it was located approximately 330 km (210 mi) northwest of Broome [52] Environmental conditions around the system were conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with low vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) [50] Due to the system's proximity to the coast, however, both the BOM and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast only a low chance of development into a tropical cyclone before making landfall [48] [50]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nDuring mid December, favourable conditions from a pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) located over the eastern Maritime Continent contributed to the re-formation of the monsoon trough over northern Australia [79] The combined influence of the MJO and the monsoonal conditions generated widespread cloudiness and rainfall across the Australian tropics, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation in the region [79] On 17 December, a low-pressure system developed within the monsoon trough, near the northern coast of the Top End, and began to move westwards [80] The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 06:00 UTC the following day while it was located near the Tiwi Islands, and assigned the identifier code 03U [81] [82] The system soon assumed a southwestward track towards the Kimberley region [81] Environmental conditions were favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with low to moderate vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and very warm sea surface temperatures nearing 31 °C (88 °F) [83] Despite this, the tropical low's close proximity to land hindered intensification, and only limited development occurred before the system made landfall on 19 December near the Cambridge Gulf, between Wyndham and Kalumburu [83] [84] [85] Around this time, the BOM estimated the tropical low's central atmospheric pressure to be 995 hPa (29.38 inHg) [86]\n\n\nTropical Low 04U\nOn 20 December, a tropical disturbance that was being monitored by Météo-France's tropical cyclone warning centre in Réunion crossed into the Australian region from the South-West Indian Ocean basin [95] Upon entering the region, the system was classified as a tropical low by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), and had an estimated central atmospheric pressure of 1006 hPa (29.71 inHg) [96] Initially situated approximately 825 km (513 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands, the system was located in an environment that was generally unfavourable for intensification, with moderate to strong vertical wind shear offsetting otherwise conducive upper-level outflow and warm sea surface temperatures of 28–29 °C (82–84 °F) [97] [96] It again exited the basin on 28 December without any significant intensification where RSMC Réunion reclassified the system as Tropical Depression 05 [98]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Imogen\nOn 1 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had formed near Groote Eylandt in the western Gulf of Carpentaria, located about 635 km (395 mi) east-southeast of Darwin [99] The system was assigned the identifier code 05U by the BOM [100] Environmental conditions were assessed as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, characterised by very warm sea surface temperatures of up to 31 °C (88 °F), low to moderate vertical wind shear and an established poleward outflow channels in the upper levels [101] Flaring convection began to develop around the consolidating low-level circulation centre as the system tracked southeastward over the Gulf of Carpentaria, and at 00:00 UTC on 2 January, the BOM issued a tropical cyclone watch for parts of the northwestern Queensland coast [101] [102] The tropical low continued to strengthen as convective rainbands began to wrap into the system's centre, with moist northwesterly cross-equatorial flow from over Indonesia feeding the system in the low to mid troposphere [100] By 18:00 UTC, vertical wind shear values had decreased further as the tropical low moved underneath an upper-level ridge; however, despite the highly favourable environmental conditions, intensification was limited somewhat by the broad and elongated nature of the low-level circulation center [103] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 20:00 UTC [104]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 5 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a weak tropical low had formed within a trough over the eastern Indian Ocean, centred approximately 500 km (310 mi) northeast of the Cocos Islands [115] [116] Environmental conditions were assessed by the BOM as being unfavourable for significant intensification of the low, citing in particular the strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere that were forecast to develop by 10 January [117] The tropical low meandered gradually southwards over the following days, [118] passing well to the east of the Cocos Islands on 8–9 January, around which time the system began to accelerate towards the west-southwest [117] [119] On 9 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported the development of formative convective rainbands wrapping into the tropical low's centre, and determined that environmental conditions were favourable for the system to strengthen, in contrast with the BOM's assessment The JTWC noted the presence of strong poleward upper-level outflow, low vertical wind shear values and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [120] By 05:00 UTC on 10 January, gale-force winds had developed in the southern quadrants of the tropical low, in part due to the fast translational velocity of the system towards the west-southwest [119] The system's minimum atmospheric pressure was estimated at 1002 hPa (29.59 inHg) at that time [121] Then, the system exited the basin towards the Southwest Indian Ocean on 10 January, before dissipating immediately thereafter, due to unfavourable high wind shear.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Joshua\nOn 13 January, a tropical low developed approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) east-northeast of the Cocos Islands, which the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) designated as 07U Afterward, the tropical low began moving southwestward, while gradually organizing [122] On 16 January, gale-force winds started to develop and by 12:00 UTC on the same day, the low had intensified further into Tropical Cyclone Joshua, which became the second named storm both in the 2020–21 Australian region cyclone season and worldwide Joshua continued to move southwestwards, before moving into the South-West Indian Ocean on 17 January [123]\n\n\nTropical Low 08U\nOn 15 January, the BoM began monitoring a developing tropical low embedded within a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, near Northern Territory, designating it as 08U [124] The system moved ashore on Northern Territory near Nhulunbuy and emerged over the Timor Sea the next morning [124] The tropical low then moved slowly to the southwest for several days The BoM issued Tropical Cyclone Watches from Bidyadanga to Roebourne on 21 January as they forecasted it to become a Category 1 tropical cyclone before landfall [125] Despite a favorable environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, the storm remained a tropical low due to lack of outflow On the same day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) due to an improvement in the structure of the storm The JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm 14S the next day as the system had gale-force winds; however, the BoM didn't upgrade the tropical low to a Category 1 cyclone Later, the storm made landfall over Western Australia near Broome, and the JTWC issued its final warning soon thereafter The low rapidly weakened before dissipating completely on 23 January, as it entered South Australia.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Kimi\nOn 12 January, the Bureau of Meteorology noted that a monsoonal trough could develop within a week, that would make conditions in the Australian Region basin favorable for tropical cyclogenesis [127] On 16 January, a weak tropical low formed to the northeast of Queensland [128] Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system [129] At 02:10 UTC on 17 January, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the tropical low into Tropical Cyclone Kimi, while located northeast of Cooktown [130] A small tropical cyclone, Kimi moved slowly southward while remaining offshore of the Australian coastline [131]\n\n\nTropical Low 10U\nOn 19 January, a tropical low formed to the southeast of Christmas Island, with the BoM designating the system as 10U The low moved towards the west, prompting the BoM to issue rainfall warnings to the Cocos Islands by that time [137] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the same day and upgraded it as Tropical Storm 13S by the next morning on the Saffir–Simpson scale It passed very close to the Cocos Islands while having gale-force winds, before turning towards the south late on 21 January [138] Despite favorable conditions, the tropical low remained weak due to persistent high wind shear around the system The JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds of 10U peaked at 65 km/h (40 mph) while BoM recorded ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) Despite these wind readings, the low was not named due to gale winds not exceeding half of the storm's centre [139] Without any further intensification, it exited the basin towards the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 27 January and was reclassified as Tropical Depression 09 [140]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Lucas\nOn 25 January, a tropical low formed from a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, about 210 kilometres (130 mi) to the north of Mornington Island, with the BoM designating the system as 11U [141] The system slowly moved to the east, before moving ashore over Cape York Peninsula near Pormpuraaw on 27 January [142] It weakened as it traversed land and on 29 January, it moved offshore on Princess Charlotte Bay as it continued to move eastward [143] On the afternoon of 31 January, it strengthened further to Tropical Cyclone Lucas while moving away from the Queensland coast On the afternoon of 1 February, Lucas crossed into the South Pacific cyclone region as a Category 2 tropical cyclone, to the north-northwest of Nouméa, New Caledonia [144]\n\n\nTropical Low 12U\nDuring 25 January, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 12U was forming over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf [145] At that time, the tropical low was already producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the Kimberley and Pilbara coast [146] On 28 January, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed over the coastal region of the Northern Territory, with the low proceeding to move southwestward, overland The storm moved in a southwestward direction over Australia's coastal region for the next several days, roughly parallel to the coastline Early on 4 February, 12U emerged over water near Shark Bay, as the storm turned to the west Upon emerging over water, 12U began to strengthen slowly However, on 5 February, the BoM issued their final warning for 12U, as it was no longer expected to develop into a tropical cyclone [147] The JTWC followed suit and issued their final warning on the system Later that day, the tropical low turned back towards the coast and became extratropical, before proceeding to move south-southeastward, along the coastline of Western Australia On 8 February, the system left the coast of Australia, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm a day later.\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Marian\nOn 21 February, a tropical low formed, approximately 540 kilometres (340 mi) to the north-northwest of Broome, with the BoM designating the system as 15U [148] At 03:30 UTC on 25 February the JTWC issued a TCFA on the disturbance, tracking it as Invest 98S [149] Roughly 24 hours later, the agency released its first warning on the tropical cyclone [150] By 06:00 UTC that day, the BOM upgraded the tropical low into a tropical cyclone, giving it the name Marian [151] Soon after formation, the storm started to rapidly intensify amid favorable conditions, and early on 28 February, the storm reached Severe Tropical Cyclone status, with a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection Meanwhile, the JTWC assessed the storm as a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone, before upgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent storm later that day [152] The storm briefly crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility before abruptly turning to the southeast where it reached the peak intensity It again reentered into the Australian region basin on 2 March and very slowly weakened [153] By 6 March, the storm was downgraded to a tropical low as it encountered high wind shear and sea surface temperatures as low as 24 °C, while it rapidly weakened [154] [155]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Niran\nDuring 27 February, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) began to monitor a developing tropical low off the coast of northern Queensland [156] The low began to strengthen while remaining offshore the state, within an area favorable for tropical cyclogenesis [157] On 1 March, the tropical low was upgraded into a tropical cyclone by the BOM, and was provided the name Niran [158] Later that same day, the strengthening cyclone reached Category 2 status on the Australian scale [159] Niran soon began to pull away from the coast of Australia while intensifying, reaching Category 3 status on the Australian scale, late on 3 March [160] Niran later reached category 4 status on the Australian scale late on the next day [161] and Category 5 on 5 March [162] The storm accelerated southwestwards and crossed into the FMS' area of responsibility on 6 March whilst weakening.\n\n\nTropical Low 21U\nA tropical low developed near the Cocos Islands on 21 March, with the BoM designating the system as 21U as it moved west-northwest at 8 km/h [165] It was last noted on 26 March.\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Seroja\nOn 29 March, the BoM mentioned that Tropical Low 22U was forming to the south of Timor By 3 April, the tropical low fully developed within an active trough [166] The low was located in a generally favorable environment with deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and defined outflow [167] The low drifted close to the coast of Timor very slowly with persistent spiraling bands of convection occupying the storm's circulation, producing prolific rainfall in the surrounding regions on 3–4 April [168] At this time, the low-pressure system was located inside the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of TCWC Jakarta [169] By the early morning of 4 April, the presentation of its structure had improved with spiral bands of deep convection and tight curvature at its center [10] Although there were fluctuations in central convection, a favorable environment of deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow meant further development of the system was expected [11] [13]\nMeanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first warning on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 26S at 15:00 on UTC 4 April [170] The tropical low slowly gained strength, intensifying to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and was given the name Seroja by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) Jakarta at 20:00 UTC on 4 April, about 95 km (59 mi) north-northwest of Rote Island [171] [172]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Odette\nA well-defined and slow-moving tropical low, 23U, formed near Christmas Island on 3 April, on the same day where a trough spawned another system in the Northern Region near Timor [166] [191] It caused some sporadic rain showers on the island On 8 April, the system began interacting with Cyclone Seroja to the northeast, due to the Fujiwhara effect, causing both systems to weaken, though the tropical low subsequently strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Odette later that day [175] On 9 April, Odette began to weaken, as the storm was gradually absorbed into Seroja, which was strengthening around the same time On 10 April, Odette had lost most of its convection, and the storm began to be drawn into Seroja's circulation During this time, Odette weakened further into a tropical low Later that day, Odette was fully absorbed into Seroja, and the BoM issued their final advisory on the storm [192]\n\n\nTropical Low 24U\nAn active phase of Madden-Julian Oscillation spawned a tropical low in the central Indian Ocean, northwest of the Cocos Islands on 6 April [193] [194] Moving east-southeastwards, the system gradually organized; it eventually attained gale-force winds in the southwest portion of the system on 9 April [194] However, the Bureau of Meteorology didn't classify the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone as these winds did not extend more than halfway around the centre of the low [194] Also that day, 24U passed to the south of the islands, causing little impacts [194] As the storm neared the proximity of restrengthening Cyclone Odette, the system started to weaken, dissipating on 11 April [194]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Australian TCWC) monitors all tropical cyclones that

Region Cyclone Season**\n\nThe 2020–21 Australian region cyclone season was a period of the year when tropical cyclones formed in the Australian region of the southeastern Indian Ocean. The season officially began on November 1, 2020, and ended on April 30, 2021.\n\n**Season Forecasts**\n\nIn October 2020, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) issued its tropical cyclone outlook for the 2020–21 season, and in the same month, the agency contributed towards the Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Outlook, along with New Zealand's MetService, NIWA, and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) Each of the outlooks accounted for analogue seasons and the effects of various climate drivers, which included the state of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Below average sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and atmospheric conditions indicated a La Niña pattern, and it was declared that a La Niña had emerged on 29 September 2020 The BOM predicted that the La Niña pattern will persist into early 2021, and waters north of Australia and the Southwestern Pacific Ocean will be warmer than average in the coming three months. The bureau also advised that cyclone kits include a supply of face masks and hand sanitisers, owing to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Season Summary**\n\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes. The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November. On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860 km (530 mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands. The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear. Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week.\n\n**Systems**\n\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes.

Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week.\n\n**Tropical Low 01U (Bongoyo)**\n\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes. The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November. On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860 km (530 mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands. The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear. Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week.\n\n**Tropical Low 02U**\n\nOn 6 December, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough near the western end of Java, approximately 200 km (120 mi) north-northeast of Christmas Island. The system was assigned the official identifier code 02U upon formation. Initially located in an unfavourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions as it tracked towards the southeast. On 7 December, warm sea surface temperatures and strong diffluence in the upper troposphere fuelled the development of deep convection around the system's low-level circulation centre. Referencing the tropical low's quickly improving structure and the presence of a weak eye feature in microwave satellite imagery, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 05:30 UTC. After tracking in a clockwise path around the northeastern side of Christmas Island, Tropical Low 02U became quasi-stationary on 8 December. Deep convection continued to develop near the centre during the overnight period, and as the low began to track eastwards, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 18:00 UTC on 8 December.\n\n**Tropical Low**\n\nThe presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Rossby wave in the Australian region contributed to the formation of another broad low-pressure system in the monsoon trough over the far eastern Indian Ocean during early December. Initially lacking organised deep convection, the system proceeded to track in a generally southwards direction towards the Kimberley region of Western Australia. By late on 7 December, infrared satellite imagery indicated an improvement in the structure of the low, with the system displaying an increase in flaring deep convection, accompanied by rotation evident in the lower troposphere. Owing to the increase in organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 21:00 UTC, when it was located approximately 330 km (210 mi) northwest of Broome. Environmental conditions around the system were conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with low vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F). Due to the system's proximity to the coast, however, both the BOM and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast only a low chance of development into a tropical cyclone before making landfall.\n\n**Tropical Low 03U**\n\nDuring mid December, favourable conditions from a pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) located over the eastern Maritime Continent contributed to the re-formation of the monsoon trough over northern Australia. The combined influence of the MJO and the monsoonal conditions generated widespread cloudiness and rainfall across the Australian tropics, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation in the region. On 17 December, a low-pressure system developed within the monsoon trough, near the northern coast of the Top End, and began to move westwards. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 06:00 UTC the following day, while it was located near the Tiwi Islands, and assigned the identifier code 03U. The system soon assumed a southwestward track towards the Kimberley region. Environmental conditions were favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with low to moderate vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and very warm sea surface temperatures nearing 31 °C (88 °F). Despite this, the tropical low's close proximity to land hindered intensification, and only limited development occurred before the system made landfall on 19 December near the Cambridge Gulf, between Wyndham and Kalumburu.\n\n**Tropical Low 04U**\n\nOn 20 December, a tropical disturbance that was being monitored by Météo-France's tropical cyclone warning centre in Réunion crossed into the Australian region from the South-West Indian Ocean basin. Upon entering the region, the system was classified as a tropical low by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), and had an estimated central atmospheric pressure of 1006 hPa (29.71 inHg). Initially situated approximately 825 km (513 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands, the system was located in an environment that was generally unfavourable for intensification, with moderate to strong vertical wind shear offsetting otherwise conducive upper-level outflow and warm sea surface temperatures of 28–29 °C (82–84 °F). It again exited the basin on 28 December without any significant intensification, where RSMC Réunion reclassified the system as Tropical Depression 05.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Imogen**\n\nOn 1 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had formed near Groote Eylandt in the western Gulf of Carpentaria, located about 635 km (395 mi) east-southeast of Darwin. The system was assigned the identifier code 05U by the BOM. Environmental conditions were assessed as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, characterised by very warm sea surface temperatures of up to 31 °C (88 °F), low to moderate vertical wind shear and an established poleward outflow channels in the upper levels. Flaring convection began to develop around the consolidating low-level circulation centre as the system tracked southeastward over the Gulf of Carpentaria, and at 00:00 UTC on 2 January, the BOM issued a tropical cyclone watch for parts of the northwestern Queensland coast. The tropical low continued to strengthen as convective rainbands began to wrap into the system's centre, with moist northwesterly cross-equatorial flow from over Indonesia feeding the system in the low to mid troposphere. By 18:00 UTC, vertical wind shear values had decreased further as the tropical low moved underneath an upper-level ridge; however, despite the highly favourable environmental conditions, intensification was limited somewhat by the broad and elongated nature of the low-level circulation centre. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 20:00 UTC.\n\n**Tropical Low 06U**\n\nOn 5 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a weak tropical low had formed within a trough over the eastern Indian Ocean, centred approximately 500 km (310 mi) northeast of the Cocos Islands. Environmental conditions were assessed by the BOM as being unfavourable for significant intensification of the low, citing in particular the strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere that were forecast to develop by 10 January. The tropical low meandered gradually southwards over the following days, passing well to the east of the Cocos Islands on 8–9 January, around which time the system began to accelerate towards the west-southwest. On 9 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported the development of formative convective rainbands wrapping into the tropical low's centre, and determined that environmental conditions were favourable for the system to strengthen, in contrast with the BOM's assessment. By 05:00 UTC on 10 January, gale-force winds had developed in the southern quadrants of the tropical low, in part due to the fast translational velocity of the system towards the west-southwest. The system exited the basin towards the Southwest Indian Ocean on 10 January, before dissipating immediately thereafter, due to unfavourable high wind shear.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Joshua**\n\nOn 13 January, a tropical low developed approximately 200 km (120 mi) east-northeast of the Cocos Islands, which the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) designated as 07U. The tropical low began moving southwestward, while gradually organizing. On 16 January, gale-force winds started to develop and by 12:00 UTC on the same day, the low had intensified further into Tropical Cyclone Joshua, which became the second named storm both in the 2020–21 Australian region cyclone season and worldwide. Joshua continued to move southwestwards, before moving into the South-West Indian Ocean on 17 January.\n\n**Tropical Low 08U**\n\nOn 15 January, the BoM began monitoring a developing tropical low embedded within a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, near Northern Territory, designating it as 08U. The system moved ashore on Northern Territory near Nhulunbuy and emerged over the Timor Sea the next morning. The tropical low then moved slowly to the southwest for several days. The BoM issued Tropical Cyclone Watches from Bidyadanga to Roebourne on 21 January as they forecasted it to become a Category 1 tropical cyclone before landfall. Despite a favorable environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, the storm remained a tropical low due to lack of outflow. On the same day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) due to an improvement in the structure of the storm. The JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm 14S the next day as the system had gale-force winds; however, the BoM didn't upgrade the tropical low to a Category 1 cyclone. Later, the storm made landfall over Western Australia near Broome, and the JTWC issued its final warning soon thereafter. The low rapidly weakened before dissipating completely on 23 January, as it entered South Australia.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Kimi**\n\nOn 12 January, the Bureau of Meteorology noted that a monsoonal trough could develop within a week, that would make conditions in the Australian Region basin favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. On 16 January, a weak tropical low formed to the northeast of Queensland. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. At 02:10 UTC on 17 January, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the tropical low into Tropical Cyclone Kimi, while located northeast of Cooktown. A small tropical cyclone, Kimi moved slowly southward while remaining offshore of the Australian coastline.\n\n**Tropical Low 10U**\n\nOn 19 January, a tropical low formed to the southeast of Christmas Island, with the BoM designating the system as 10U. The low moved towards the west, prompting the BoM to issue rainfall warnings to the Cocos Islands by that time. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the same day and upgraded it as Tropical Storm 13S by the next morning on the Saffir–Simpson scale. It passed very close to the Cocos Islands while having gale-force winds, before turning towards the south late on 21 January. Despite favorable conditions, the tropical low remained weak due to persistent high wind shear around the system. The JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds of 10U peaked at 65 km/h (40 mph) while BoM recorded ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Despite these wind readings, the low was not named due to gale winds not exceeding half of the storm's centre. Without any further intensification, it exited the basin towards the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 27 January and was reclassified as Tropical Depression 09.\n\n**Tropical Cyclone Lucas**\n\nOn 25 January, a tropical low formed from a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, about 210 km (130 mi) to the north of Mornington Island, with the BoM designating the system as 11U. The system slowly moved to the east, before moving ashore over Cape York Peninsula near Pormpuraaw on 27 January. It weakened as it traversed land and on 29 January, it moved offshore on Princess Charlotte Bay as it continued to move eastward. On the afternoon of 31 January, it strengthened further to Tropical Cyclone Lucas while moving away from the Queensland coast. On the afternoon of 1 February, Lucas crossed into the South Pacific cyclone region as a Category 2 tropical cyclone, to the north-northwest of Nouméa, New Caledonia.\n\n**Tropical Low 12U**\n\nDuring 25 January, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 12U was forming over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. At that time, the tropical low was already producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the Kimberley and Pilbara coast. On 28 January, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed over the coastal region of the Northern Territory, with the low proceeding to move southwestward, overland. The storm moved in a southwestward direction over Australia's coastal region for the next several days, roughly parallel to the coastline. Early on 4 February, 12U emerged over water near Shark Bay, as the storm turned to the west. Upon emerging over water, 12U began to strengthen slowly. However, on 5 February, the BoM issued their final warning for 12U, as it was no longer expected to develop into a tropical cyclone. The JTWC followed suit and issued their final warning on the system. Later that day, the tropical low turned back towards the coast and became extratropical, before proceeding to move south-southeastward, along the coastline of Western Australia. On 8 February, the system left the coast of Australia, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm a day later.\n\n**Severe Tropical Cyclone Marian**\n\nOn 21 February, a tropical low formed, approximately 540 km (340 mi) to the north-northwest of Broome, with the BoM designating the system as 15U. At 03:30 UTC on 25 February, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the disturbance, tracking it as Invest 98S. Roughly 24 hours later, the agency released its first warning on the tropical cyclone. By 06:00 UTC that day, the BOM upgraded the tropical low into a tropical cyclone, giving it the name Marian. Soon after formation, the storm started to rapidly intensify amid favourable conditions, and early on 28 February, the storm reached Severe Tropical Cyclone status, with a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection. Meanwhile, the JTWC assessed the storm as a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone, before upgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent storm later that day. The storm briefly crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility before abruptly turning to the southeast where it reached the peak intensity. It again reentered into the Australian region basin on 2 March and very slowly weakened. By 6 March, the storm was downgraded to a tropical low as it encountered high wind shear and sea surface temperatures as low as 24 °C", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English

[10] [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 01U (Bongoyo)\nDuring mid to late November 2020, a moderate strength pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards across the equatorial Indian Ocean towards the Maritime Continent and Australian longitudes [6] [7] The presence of the MJO brought an increase in tropical moisture to the atmospheric environment, as well as aiding the formation of Tropical Cyclone Alicia in the South-West Indian Ocean region in mid November [6] [7] On 24 November, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a trough in the far northwestern corner of the Australian region, located approximately 860 km (530 mi) northwest of the Cocos Islands [8] [9] The system was assigned the identifier code 01U by the BOM [10] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed environmental conditions as being only marginally conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with good poleward outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) being offset by the effects of moderate vertical wind shear [11] Consequently, the tropical low was expected to have only a low chance of developing into a tropical cyclone prior to moving westwards out of the Australian region later in the week [10] [11]\n\n\nTropical Low 02U\nOn 6 December, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had developed within a monsoon trough near the western end of Java, approximately 200 km (120 mi) north-northeast of Christmas Island [26] [27] The system was assigned the official identifier code 02U upon formation [26] Initially located in an unfavourable environment for intensification, the tropical low began to encounter somewhat improved conditions as it tracked towards the southeast [28] [29] On 7 December, warm sea surface temperatures and strong diffluence in the upper troposphere fuelled the development of deep convection around the system's low-level circulation centre Referencing the tropical low's quickly improving structure and the presence of a weak eye feature in microwave satellite imagery, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 05:30 UTC [28] After tracking in a clockwise path around the northeastern side of Christmas Island, Tropical Low 02U became quasi-stationary on 8 December [30] [31] Deep convection continued to develop near the centre during the overnight period, and as the low began to track eastwards, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 18:00 UTC on 8 December [32]\n\n\nTropical Low\nThe presence of the Madden–Julian Oscillation and an equatorial Rossby wave in the Australian region contributed to the formation of another broad low-pressure system in the monsoon trough over the far eastern Indian Ocean during early December [48] [49] Initially lacking organised deep convection, the system proceeded to track in a generally southwards direction towards the Kimberley region of Western Australia By late on 7 December, infrared satellite imagery indicated an improvement in the structure of the low, with the system displaying an increase in flaring deep convection, accompanied by rotation evident in the lower troposphere [50] Owing to the increase in organisation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 21:00 UTC, [51] when it was located approximately 330 km (210 mi) northwest of Broome [52] Environmental conditions around the system were conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, with low vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and sea surface temperatures near 30 °C (86 °F) [50] Due to the system's proximity to the coast, however, both the BOM and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast only a low chance of development into a tropical cyclone before making landfall [48] [50]\n\n\nTropical Low 03U\nDuring mid December, favourable conditions from a pulse of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) located over the eastern Maritime Continent contributed to the re-formation of the monsoon trough over northern Australia [79] The combined influence of the MJO and the monsoonal conditions generated widespread cloudiness and rainfall across the Australian tropics, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation in the region [79] On 17 December, a low-pressure system developed within the monsoon trough, near the northern coast of the Top End, and began to move westwards [80] The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) classified the system as a tropical low by 06:00 UTC the following day while it was located near the Tiwi Islands, and assigned the identifier code 03U [81] [82] The system soon assumed a southwestward track towards the Kimberley region [81] Environmental conditions were favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, with low to moderate vertical wind shear, good upper-level outflow and very warm sea surface temperatures nearing 31 °C (88 °F) [83] Despite this, the tropical low's close proximity to land hindered intensification, and only limited development occurred before the system made landfall on 19 December near the Cambridge Gulf, between Wyndham and Kalumburu [83] [84] [85] Around this time, the BOM estimated the tropical low's central atmospheric pressure to be 995 hPa (29.38 inHg) [86]\n\n\nTropical Low 04U\nOn 20 December, a tropical disturbance that was being monitored by Météo-France's tropical cyclone warning centre in Réunion crossed into the Australian region from the South-West Indian Ocean basin [95] Upon entering the region, the system was classified as a tropical low by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), and had an estimated central atmospheric pressure of 1006 hPa (29.71 inHg) [96] Initially situated approximately 825 km (513 mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands, the system was located in an environment that was generally unfavourable for intensification, with moderate to strong vertical wind shear offsetting otherwise conducive upper-level outflow and warm sea surface temperatures of 28–29 °C (82–84 °F) [97] [96] It again exited the basin on 28 December without any significant intensification where RSMC Réunion reclassified the system as Tropical Depression 05 [98]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Imogen\nOn 1 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had formed near Groote Eylandt in the western Gulf of Carpentaria, located about 635 km (395 mi) east-southeast of Darwin [99] The system was assigned the identifier code 05U by the BOM [100] Environmental conditions were assessed as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, characterised by very warm sea surface temperatures of up to 31 °C (88 °F), low to moderate vertical wind shear and an established poleward outflow channels in the upper levels [101] Flaring convection began to develop around the consolidating low-level circulation centre as the system tracked southeastward over the Gulf of Carpentaria, and at 00:00 UTC on 2 January, the BOM issued a tropical cyclone watch for parts of the northwestern Queensland coast [101] [102] The tropical low continued to strengthen as convective rainbands began to wrap into the system's centre, with moist northwesterly cross-equatorial flow from over Indonesia feeding the system in the low to mid troposphere [100] By 18:00 UTC, vertical wind shear values had decreased further as the tropical low moved underneath an upper-level ridge; however, despite the highly favourable environmental conditions, intensification was limited somewhat by the broad and elongated nature of the low-level circulation center [103] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 20:00 UTC [104]\n\n\nTropical Low 06U\nOn 5 January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a weak tropical low had formed within a trough over the eastern Indian Ocean, centred approximately 500 km (310 mi) northeast of the Cocos Islands [115] [116] Environmental conditions were assessed by the BOM as being unfavourable for significant intensification of the low, citing in particular the strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere that were forecast to develop by 10 January [117] The tropical low meandered gradually southwards over the following days, [118] passing well to the east of the Cocos Islands on 8–9 January, around which time the system began to accelerate towards the west-southwest [117] [119] On 9 January, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported the development of formative convective rainbands wrapping into the tropical low's centre, and determined that environmental conditions were favourable for the system to strengthen, in contrast with the BOM's assessment The JTWC noted the presence of strong poleward upper-level outflow, low vertical wind shear values and warm sea surface temperatures of 29–30 °C (84–86 °F) [120] By 05:00 UTC on 10 January, gale-force winds had developed in the southern quadrants of the tropical low, in part due to the fast translational velocity of the system towards the west-southwest [119] The system's minimum atmospheric pressure was estimated at 1002 hPa (29.59 inHg) at that time [121] Then, the system exited the basin towards the Southwest Indian Ocean on 10 January, before dissipating immediately thereafter, due to unfavourable high wind shear.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Joshua\nOn 13 January, a tropical low developed approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) east-northeast of the Cocos Islands, which the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) designated as 07U Afterward, the tropical low began moving southwestward, while gradually organizing [122] On 16 January, gale-force winds started to develop and by 12:00 UTC on the same day, the low had intensified further into Tropical Cyclone Joshua, which became the second named storm both in the 2020–21 Australian region cyclone season and worldwide Joshua continued to move southwestwards, before moving into the South-West Indian Ocean on 17 January [123]\n\n\nTropical Low 08U\nOn 15 January, the BoM began monitoring a developing tropical low embedded within a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, near Northern Territory, designating it as 08U [124] The system moved ashore on Northern Territory near Nhulunbuy and emerged over the Timor Sea the next morning [124] The tropical low then moved slowly to the southwest for several days The BoM issued Tropical Cyclone Watches from Bidyadanga to Roebourne on 21 January as they forecasted it to become a Category 1 tropical cyclone before landfall [125] Despite a favorable environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, the storm remained a tropical low due to lack of outflow On the same day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) due to an improvement in the structure of the storm The JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm 14S the next day as the system had gale-force winds; however, the BoM didn't upgrade the tropical low to a Category 1 cyclone Later, the storm made landfall over Western Australia near Broome, and the JTWC issued its final warning soon thereafter The low rapidly weakened before dissipating completely on 23 January, as it entered South Australia.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Kimi\nOn 12 January, the Bureau of Meteorology noted that a monsoonal trough could develop within a week, that would make conditions in the Australian Region basin favorable for tropical cyclogenesis [127] On 16 January, a weak tropical low formed to the northeast of Queensland [128] Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system [129] At 02:10 UTC on 17 January, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the tropical low into Tropical Cyclone Kimi, while located northeast of Cooktown [130] A small tropical cyclone, Kimi moved slowly southward while remaining offshore of the Australian coastline [131]\n\n\nTropical Low 10U\nOn 19 January, a tropical low formed to the southeast of Christmas Island, with the BoM designating the system as 10U The low moved towards the west, prompting the BoM to issue rainfall warnings to the Cocos Islands by that time [137] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the same day and upgraded it as Tropical Storm 13S by the next morning on the Saffir–Simpson scale It passed very close to the Cocos Islands while having gale-force winds, before turning towards the south late on 21 January [138] Despite favorable conditions, the tropical low remained weak due to persistent high wind shear around the system The JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds of 10U peaked at 65 km/h (40 mph) while BoM recorded ten-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) Despite these wind readings, the low was not named due to gale winds not exceeding half of the storm's centre [139] Without any further intensification, it exited the basin towards the South-West Indian Ocean basin on 27 January and was reclassified as Tropical Depression 09 [140]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Lucas\nOn 25 January, a tropical low formed from a monsoon trough in the Gulf of Carpentaria, about 210 kilometres (130 mi) to the north of Mornington Island, with the BoM designating the system as 11U [141] The system slowly moved to the east, before moving ashore over Cape York Peninsula near Pormpuraaw on 27 January [142] It weakened as it traversed land and on 29 January, it moved offshore on Princess Charlotte Bay as it continued to move eastward [143] On the afternoon of 31 January, it strengthened further to Tropical Cyclone Lucas while moving away from the Queensland coast On the afternoon of 1 February, Lucas crossed into the South Pacific cyclone region as a Category 2 tropical cyclone, to the north-northwest of Nouméa, New Caledonia [144]\n\n\nTropical Low 12U\nDuring 25 January, the BoM reported that Tropical Low 12U was forming over the southern Joseph Bonaparte Gulf [145] At that time, the tropical low was already producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds across the Kimberley and Pilbara coast [146] On 28 January, the BoM reported that the tropical low had developed over the coastal region of the Northern Territory, with the low proceeding to move southwestward, overland The storm moved in a southwestward direction over Australia's coastal region for the next several days, roughly parallel to the coastline Early on 4 February, 12U emerged over water near Shark Bay, as the storm turned to the west Upon emerging over water, 12U began to strengthen slowly However, on 5 February, the BoM issued their final warning for 12U, as it was no longer expected to develop into a tropical cyclone [147] The JTWC followed suit and issued their final warning on the system Later that day, the tropical low turned back towards the coast and became extratropical, before proceeding to move south-southeastward, along the coastline of Western Australia On 8 February, the system left the coast of Australia, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm a day later.\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Marian\nOn 21 February, a tropical low formed, approximately 540 kilometres (340 mi) to the north-northwest of Broome, with the BoM designating the system as 15U [148] At 03:30 UTC on 25 February the JTWC issued a TCFA on the disturbance, tracking it as Invest 98S [149] Roughly 24 hours later, the agency released its first warning on the tropical cyclone [150] By 06:00 UTC that day, the BOM upgraded the tropical low into a tropical cyclone, giving it the name Marian [151] Soon after formation, the storm started to rapidly intensify amid favorable conditions, and early on 28 February, the storm reached Severe Tropical Cyclone status, with a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection Meanwhile, the JTWC assessed the storm as a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone, before upgrading it to a Category 3-equivalent storm later that day [152] The storm briefly crossed into the MFR's area of responsibility before abruptly turning to the southeast where it reached the peak intensity It again reentered into the Australian region basin on 2 March and very slowly weakened [153] By 6 March, the storm was downgraded to a tropical low as it encountered high wind shear and sea surface temperatures as low as 24 °C, while it rapidly weakened [154] [155]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Niran\nDuring 27 February, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) began to monitor a developing tropical low off the coast of northern Queensland [156] The low began to strengthen while remaining offshore the state, within an area favorable for tropical cyclogenesis [157] On 1 March, the tropical low was upgraded into a tropical cyclone by the BOM, and was provided the name Niran [158] Later that same day, the strengthening cyclone reached Category 2 status on the Australian scale [159] Niran soon began to pull away from the coast of Australia while intensifying, reaching Category 3 status on the Australian scale, late on 3 March [160] Niran later reached category 4 status on the Australian scale late on the next day [161] and Category 5 on 5 March [162] The storm accelerated southwestwards and crossed into the FMS' area of responsibility on 6 March whilst weakening.\n\n\nTropical Low 21U\nA tropical low developed near the Cocos Islands on 21 March, with the BoM designating the system as 21U as it moved west-northwest at 8 km/h [165] It was last noted on 26 March.\n\n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Seroja\nOn 29 March, the BoM mentioned that Tropical Low 22U was forming to the south of Timor By 3 April, the tropical low fully developed within an active trough [166] The low was located in a generally favorable environment with deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and defined outflow [167] The low drifted close to the coast of Timor very slowly with persistent spiraling bands of convection occupying the storm's circulation, producing prolific rainfall in the surrounding regions on 3–4 April [168] At this time, the low-pressure system was located inside the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of TCWC Jakarta [169] By the early morning of 4 April, the presentation of its structure had improved with spiral bands of deep convection and tight curvature at its center [10] Although there were fluctuations in central convection, a favorable environment of deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow meant further development of the system was expected [11] [13]\nMeanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first warning on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 26S at 15:00 on UTC 4 April [170] The tropical low slowly gained strength, intensifying to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and was given the name Seroja by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) Jakarta at 20:00 UTC on 4 April, about 95 km (59 mi) north-northwest of Rote Island [171] [172]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Odette\nA well-defined and slow-moving tropical low, 23U, formed near Christmas Island on 3 April, on the same day where a trough spawned another system in the Northern Region near Timor [166] [191] It caused some sporadic rain showers on the island On 8 April, the system began interacting with Cyclone Seroja to the northeast, due to the Fujiwhara effect, causing both systems to weaken, though the tropical low subsequently strengthened into Tropical Cyclone Odette later that day [175] On 9 April, Odette began to weaken, as the storm was gradually absorbed into Seroja, which was strengthening around the same time On 10 April, Odette had lost most of its convection, and the storm began to be drawn into Seroja's circulation During this time, Odette weakened further into a tropical low Later that day, Odette was fully absorbed into Seroja, and the BoM issued their final advisory on the storm [192]\n\n\nTropical Low 24U\nAn active phase of Madden-Julian Oscillation spawned a tropical low in the central Indian Ocean, northwest of the Cocos Islands on 6 April [193] [194] Moving east-southeastwards, the system gradually organized; it eventually attained gale-force winds in the southwest portion of the system on 9 April [194] However, the Bureau of Meteorology didn't classify the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone as these winds did not extend more than halfway around the centre of the low [194] Also that day, 24U passed to the south of the islands, causing little impacts [194] As the storm neared the proximity of restrengthening Cyclone Odette, the system started to weaken, dissipating on 11 April [194]\n\n\nStorm names\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (Australian TCWC) monitors all tropical cyclones that form within the Australian region, including any within the areas of responsibility of TCWC Jakarta or TCWC Port Moresby [195] Should a tropical low reach tropical cyclone strength within the

{"title": "Hmong_people", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe term Hmong is the English pronunciation of the Hmong's native name It is a singular and plural noun (e.g., Japanese, French, etc.) Very little is known about the native Hmong name as it is not mentioned in Chinese historical records, since the Han identified the Hmong as Miao The meaning of it is debatable and no one is sure of its origin, although it can be traced back to several provinces in China However, Hmong Americans and Hmong Laotians often associate it with \"Free\" and/or \"Hmoov\" (Fate); it serves as a reminder to them of their history of fighting oppression [8] [9]\n\n\nOrigins\nA DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes The Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand; they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation.\nAccording to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that they have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000 years [26] Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong–Mien–speaking populations supports the existence of southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time, although it has been shown that Hmong-speaking populations had comparatively more contact with northern East Asians than had the Mien [27]\n\n\nGenetic origins\nA DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes The Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand;

They are a linguistically and culturally diverse group, with a rich history and traditions that have been shaped by their experiences as a minority group in various countries.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe term \"Hmong\" is the English pronunciation of the group's native name, which is not mentioned in Chinese historical records. The Han Chinese identified the Hmong as Miao, which is a term that is still used by some Chinese people to refer to the group. The meaning of the Hmong's native name is debatable, and it is unclear whether it is related to the word \"Miao.\" Some Hmong people believe that their name means \"Free\" or \"Hmoov\" (Fate), which reflects their history of fighting oppression.\n\n**Origins**\n\nA DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from Lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes. The Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand, and they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation. According to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that the Hmong have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000 years. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong-Mien-speaking populations supports the existence of southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time.\n\n**Genetic origins**\n\nThe Hmong have a unique genetic profile, which is distinct from other Southeast Asian groups. A DNA study in 2005 in Thailand found that Hmong paternal lineage is quite different from Lu Mien and other Southeast Asian tribes. The Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan speaking people are known as hill tribes in Thailand, and they were the subject of the first studies to show an impact of patrilocality vs matrilocality on patterns of mitochondrial (mt) DNA vs the male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) variation.\n\n**Homeland**\n\nThe most likely homeland of the Hmong-Mien languages is in southern China between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers. This region has been home to various ethnic groups, including the Hmong, for thousands of years.\n\n**History**\n\nHmong traditions and legends indicate that they originated near the Yellow River region of northern China, but this is not substantiated by any scientific evidence. According to linguist Martha Ratliff, there is linguistic evidence to suggest that the Hmong have occupied some of the same areas of southern China for over 8,000 years. Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong-Mien-speaking populations supports the southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time.\n\n**China**\n\nHmong traditions and legends indicate that they originated near the Yellow River region of northern China, but this is not substantiated by any scientific evidence.

Evidence from mitochondrial DNA in Hmong-Mien-speaking populations supports the southern origins of maternal lineages even further back in time.\n\n**Vietnam**\n\nHmong people in Vietnam have been perceived differently by various modern political organizations and in different historical periods. Since the Hmong are an ethnic minority in Vietnam, their loyalty toward the Vietnamese state has been frequently questioned by the state. However, many Hmong in Vietnam are fiercely loyal, regardless of the current ideologies of the government.\n\n**Laos**\n\nThere are 595,028 Hmong people in Laos. They mainly live in northern regions. The Hmong in Laos have a long history of conflict with the Lao government, which has led to the displacement of many Hmong people.\n\n**The U.S. and the Laotian Civil War**\n\nIn the early 1960s, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Special Activities Division began to recruit, train, and lead the indigenous Hmong people in Laos to fight against North Vietnamese Army divisions that were invading Laos during the Vietnam War. The \"Secret Army\" was organized into various mobile regiments and divisions, including Special Guerrilla Units, all of whom were led by General Vang Pao. An estimated sixty-percent (60%) of Hmong men in Laos joined up.\n\n**Hmong Lao resistance**\n\nFor many years, the Neo Hom political movement played a key role in resistance to the Vietnam People's Army in Laos following the U.S. withdrawal in 1975. Vang Pao played a significant role in this movement. Additionally, a spiritual leader, Zong Zoua Her, as well as other Hmong leaders, including Pa Kao Her or Pa Khao Her, rallied some of their followers in a factionalized guerrilla resistance movement called ChaoFa (RPA: Cob Fab, Pahawh Hmong: 𖬒𖬯 𖬖𖬜𖬵).\n\n**Controversy over repatriation**\n\nIn June 1991, after talks with the UNHCR and the Thai government, Laos agreed to the repatriation of over 60,000 Lao refugees living in Thailand, including tens of thousands of Hmong people. Very few of the Lao refugees, however, were willing to return voluntarily. Pressure to resettle the refugees grew as the Thai government worked to close its remaining refugee camps. While some Hmong people returned to Laos voluntarily, with development assistance from UNHCR, coercive measures and forced repatriation was used to send thousands of Hmong back to the places they had fled.\n\n**Alleged plot to overthrow the government of Laos**\n\nOn 4 June 2007, as part of an investigation labeled Operation Tarnished Eagle, U.S. federal courts ordered warrants issued for the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of federal Neutrality Acts and for multiple weapons charges. The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including AK-47s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, in order to buy and smuggle into Thailand in June 2007, where they were intended to be used by Hmong resistance forces in Laos.\n\n**Thailand**\n\nThe Hmong presence in Thailand dates back to the turn of the 20th century when families migrated from China through Laos and Burma, according to most authors. A relatively small population, they still formed dozens of villages and hamlets throughout the northern provinces. The Hmong were registered by the state as the Meo hill tribe. Then, more Hmong migrated from Laos to Thailand following the victory of the Pathet Lao in 1975.

Hmong Der (Hmoob Dawb), and Hmong Leng (Hmoob Leeg) are the terms for two of the largest groups in the United States and Southeast Asia. These subgroups are also known as the White Hmong, and Blue or Green Hmong, respectively. These names originate from the color and designs of women's dresses in each respective group, with the White Hmong distinguished by the white dresses women wear on special occasions, and the Blue/Green Hmong by the blue batiked dresses.\n\n**Hmong and Miao**\n\nSome non-Chinese Hmong advocate for the term 'Hmong' to be used not only to designate their dialect group but also other Miao groups living in China. They generally claim that the word \"Miao\" or \"Meo\" is a derogatory term, with connotations of barbarism, that probably should not be used at all. The term was later adopted by Tai-speaking groups in Southeast Asia where it took on especially insulting associations for Hmong people despite its official status.\n\n**Diaspora**\n\nLinguistic data shows that the Hmong of the peninsula stem from the Miao of southern China as one among a set of ethnic groups belonging to the Hmong-Mien language family. Linguistically and culturally speaking, the Hmong and the other sub-groups of the Miao have little in common.\n\n**Vietnam and Laos**\n\nHmong people in Vietnam have been perceived differently by various modern political organizations and in different historical periods.

[99] the Hmong in Laos and Cambodia are the most supportive of active resistance These tend to be Hmong Christians that have been targeted by all three Vietnamese governments [100] The Hmong in Vietnam also receive cultural and political incentives from the government, [101] which led to the Vietnamese Hmong further diverging from the Laotian Hmong, since the latter are strongly anti-Vietnamese due to the Secret War and Communism.\n\n\nLaos\nThere are 595,028 Hmong people in Laos They mainly live in northern regions.\n\n\nThailand\nThe Hmong presence in Thailand dates back to the turn of the 20th century when families migrated from China through Laos and Burma, according to most authors A relatively small population, they still formed dozens of villages and hamlets throughout the northern provinces The Hmong were registered by the state as the Meo hill tribe Then, more Hmong migrated from Laos to Thailand following the victory of the Pathet Lao in 1975 While some ended up in refugee camps, others settled in mountainous areas among more ancient Hill Tribes [102]\n\n\nAmericas\nMany Hmong refugees resettled in the United States after the Vietnam War Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand;

After finding the murderer, he is ordered by his supervisors to replace the victim and stay on as the detective inspector of the island, much to his dismay.

The island's culture is a unique blend of British, French, and Caribbean influences. The show's creators have taken inspiration from the island's history and culture to create a rich and vibrant setting for the show.\n\nOther Locations\n----------------\n\nIn addition to the main setting of Saint Marie, the show has also featured other locations, including an islet just off the coast of the island, which is privately owned and relatively small. This episode was actually filmed on the island of Kahouanne, around 1.2 miles off the northwest coast of Guadeloupe.

and so rather than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate the social and political order with subtlety and insinuation, often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for the rise and fall of governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee [4] [5]\n\n\nMissionaria Protectiva\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus) And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n\nSpice agony\nThe spice agony is an ordeal in which an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit takes a poisonous \"awareness spectrum\" narcotic and, by internally changing the substance and neutralizing its toxicity, gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors In Dune, Lady Jessica notes that the ritual originated with the \"discovery of the poison drug on Rossak\" On Arrakis, the Fremen Reverend Mothers use a poison called Water of Life, which is the exhalation of a drowning \"little maker\" (small sandworm) in water In the Fremen version of the rite, after the ordeal the Reverend Mother also provides the changed poison for the sietch orgy.\n\n\nPowers\nOne of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.\n\n\nOther Memory\nOne of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.\n\n\nThe Voice\nBene Gesserit are trained in what they call \"the Voice\" – a means \"to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice\" [22] By modulating the subtleties of her voice, a Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance the effect of the words being spoken To affect this, the Bene Gesserit must \"register\" the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions [23]\n\n\nAcute observation and Truthsay\nBene Gesserit are trained in \"the minutiae of observation\", noticing details that the common person would miss in the people and environment around them When combined with their analytical abilities, this \"hyperawareness\" enables the Bene Gesserit to divine secrets and arrive at conclusions that are invisible to everyone else Slight differences in air currents or the design of a room might allow a Bene Gesserit to detect hidden portals and spyholes; minute variations in a person's vocal inflection and body language allow a Bene Gesserit to deeply understand a person's emotional state, and manipulate it Knowing that any schooling impresses a particular pattern in its students, they are able to use these clues to predict and anticipate actions The Bene Gesserit can easily determine a person's origins and root language by analyzing their speech patterns, cadence, and pacing, as Jessica does when she realizes that a visiting Spacing Guild banker is a Harkonnen agent [4]\n\n\nSimulflow\nBene Gesserit also practice simulflow, the flow of several threads of consciousness at once—mental multitasking, as it were The combination of simulflow with their analytical abilities and Other Memory are responsible for the frightening intelligence of the average Bene Gesserit, though this ability is less powerful than the analytical abilities of a Mentat This simulflow can also be held with Other Memory; Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade practiced both forms in Heretics of Dune.\n\n\nPrana-bindu training and the \"weirding way\"\nThe Bene Gesserit develop their physical abilities as well as their mental abilities A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device (\"the box\") that causes the sensation of intense pain Paul learns that he is not the only one to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.\n\n\nInternal organic-chemical control\nJust as the prana-bindu allows the Bene Gesserit to precisely control each muscle and nerve, they also have complete conscious control over the functions of their internal organs and body chemistry  A Sister can completely control her breathing and heart rate to the degree that she can appear dead to most tests even after intense physical exertion They can control their need for food and water to the extremes of hunger and thirst, and even commit suicide at will by simply stopping their hearts or shutting down their brains The Bene Gesserit are therefore immune to poisons, as they can simply change the chemical makeup of any harmful substance in their body and render it harmless It is hinted that should a Bene Gesserit wish to, she could slow her aging process dramatically, controlling every aspect of her metabolism It is suggested that a Sister would never attempt this, as it might call attention to the Sisterhood and reveal too much of their abilities In Children of Dune, Jessica realizes that her daughter Alia has done this, which is her first sign that her daughter is sinking into Abomination [24]\n\n\nSexual talents\nThe Bene Gesserit are notable for their extensive skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting The most talented and most highly trained are known as Imprinters Men in a position of power or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter consciously or subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood An imprinter can be successfully resisted if the subject has been psychologically pre-conditioned to do so, and the subject's automatic defensive response may even be entirely subconscious.\n\n\nWeaknesses\nReverend Mothers are dependent on melange to give them their abilities Any person who consumes melange regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need Though the effects of melange are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death Melange is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood's wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply in a show of hydraulic despotism.\n\n\nAddiction to melange\nReverend Mothers are dependent on melange to give them their abilities Any person who consumes melange regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need Though the effects of melange are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death Melange is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood's wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply in a show of hydraulic despotism.\n\n\nAbomination\nA Bene Gesserit who survives the ritual spice agony gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors An adult Reverend Mother can manage the presence of these subordinate inner voices because she has a full personality of her own and a solid sense of self However, if a Bene Gesserit undergoes the agony while pregnant, the fetus will also experience it, acquiring full consciousness and access to Other Memory Since the child has not yet developed a sufficiently strong ego before being exposed to her tide of ancestors, she is more susceptible to their influence, and there is a danger that she will ultimately be overcome and possessed by a strong ancestral ego The Bene Gesserit call this \"Abomination\", and such children are killed immediately They are also referred to as \"pre-born\" in Children of Dune.\n\n\nLitany against fear\nThe litany against fear is an incantation used by the Bene Gesserit throughout the series to focus their minds and calm themselves in times of peril  The litany is as follows:\n\n\nAnalysis\n\"Bene Gesserit\" is derived from Latin [25]\n\n\nIn adaptations\nThe Bene Gesserit appear in all of the Dune adaptations to date: the 1984 film Dune; [28] the 2000 TV miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune; [29] [30] [31] [32] and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune; [33] [34] as well as the 2021 feature film Dune, [35] [36] and its 2024 sequel, Dune: Part Two [37]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Bene Gesserit**\n\nThe Bene Gesserit is a secretive matriarchal order in Frank Herbert's Dune universe.

Among the Bene Gesserit, some are willing to accept the merger with the Honored Matres, while others oppose allying with their enemies; a group of dissenters led by Reverend Mother Sheeana having fled Chapterhouse aboard a no-ship upon Murbella's ascension to leadership. Within the Honored Matres, many admire Murbella's strength and abilities and desire Bene Gesserit training, but resist assimilation. Additionally, a number of Honored Matres refuse to acknowledge Murbella as their leader; the largest such rebel group is led by Matre Superior Hellica on Tleilax. As Murbella amasses weapons for the coming battle with the unknown enemy, she trains an elite force of commando troops with the combined battle talents of Bene Gesserit, Honored Matres, and even the Swordmasters of Ginaz. These \"Valkyries\" are able to effect Hellica's defeat, galvanizing many dissenters into finally joining Murbella's cause against the unknown enemy, now revealed to be the resurrected thinking machines thought destroyed 15,000 years before. In the 2007 sequel, Sandworms of Dune, the thinking machines have unleashed decimating viruses on planet after planet, while Face Dancers infiltrate human civilization in their own insidious plot to take over the universe. The New Sisterhood's fleet of warships succumbs to Face Dancer sabotage, but is saved from thinking machine attack by a host of Guild Navigators in heighliners, brought together by the Oracle of Time, Norma Cenva. Thinking machine leader Omnius is wiped out of existence by the Oracle, and the Face Dancer threat eliminated. As Murbella joins Duncan Idaho in his plan to rule a universe in which humanity and thinking machines co-exist, Sheeana introduces sandworms to the former thinking machine planet Synchrony, where she will found an orthodox Sisterhood.\n\n**Legends of Dune**\n\nIn the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Anderson, it is revealed that the Sorceresses of Rossak, who possess destructive telekinetic powers existing only in women and have a breeding plan to create more powerful telepaths, had been the predecessors of the Bene Gesserit. As a Sorceress is always killed when she unleashes her full power, they sacrifice themselves to destroy some of the Titans and Neo-Cymeks during the Butlerian Jihad, over 10,000 years before the events in Dune. Later, they expand their genetic program to preserve human bloodlines when humanity is endangered by a widespread plague called the \"Demon Scourge\", genetically engineered and unleashed by the thinking machines. Raquella Berto-Anirul becomes their leader after surviving a poisoning attempt by being the first to internally render the toxin harmless. The ordeal also makes Raquella the first to access Other Memory and use the power of Voice; she later establishes the Bene Gesserit, instituting a similar ritualized poisoning to unlock the same abilities in others.\n\n**Great Schools of Dune**\n\nIn Sisterhood of Dune (2012), 80 years have passed since the end of the Butlerian Jihad, and an aging Raquella remains the only Sister to have survived the Agony. Ambitious young Valya Harkonnen has hopes of using her Bene Gesserit training to complete her family's vendetta against Vorian Atreides and his entire bloodline. Valya is one of the Sisters trusted with the records of Raquella's breeding program, which are maintained by a secret cache of forbidden computers, concealed in a cave outside the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Raquella's granddaughter Dorotea undergoes the Agony and becomes a Reverend Mother, discovering the truth about her parentage and the existence of computers. As a devout anti-technology Butlerian, she assists Emperor Salvador Corrino in his raid on the Rossak school. Salvador has several dozen Sisters executed and disbands the Sisterhood, except for Dorotea's Orthodox followers, who return to the Imperial capital on Salusa Secundus to serve as court Truthsayers.\n\n**Goals, strategies, and ritual**\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, up to the end of the novel Dune, is the creation of a male Bene Gesserit they call the Kwisatz Haderach (/ˈkwɪsɑːts ˈhɑːdəræk/). They intend to achieve this superbeing through a massive human breeding program, which they have conducted for countless generations; using careful manipulations of relationships and breeding sisters to \"collect\" key genes, the Bene Gesserit have controlled and finessed bloodlines through the ages. Also called \"the one who can be two places simultaneously\" or \"the one who can be many places at once\", the Kwisatz Haderach (defined by Herbert as \"The Shortening of the Way\"), with mental powers that would bridge space and time and access to both male and female lines in Other Memory, will be an overt figure in the Bene Gesserit's manipulations and thrust upon the universe as a messiah.\n\n**Breeding program**\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, up to the end of the novel Dune, is the creation of a male Bene Gesserit they call the Kwisatz Haderach (/ˈkwɪsɑːts ˈhɑːdəræk/).

The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for the rise and fall of governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash. To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee.\n\n**Missionaria Protectiva**\n\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n\n**Spice agony**\n\nThe spice agony is an ordeal in which an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit takes a poisonous \"awareness spectrum\" narcotic and, by internally changing the substance and neutralizing its toxicity, gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors. In Dune, Lady Jessica notes that the ritual originated with the \"discovery of the poison drug on Rossak\". On Arrakis, the Fremen Reverend Mothers use a poison called Water of Life, which is the exhalation of a drowning \"little maker\" (small sandworm) in water.

and so rather than taking direct control of the human race, they instead manipulate the social and political order with subtlety and insinuation, often using extraordinarily long-term stratagems spanning generations The Bene Gesserit avoid appearing too rich or powerful, or revealing the extent of their powers, to prevent being seen as overtly responsible for the rise and fall of governments and empires, and to avoid any organized backlash To this end, the Bene Gesserit provide some of their trained initiates as wives and concubines, and will train the daughters of noble families for a fee [4] [5]\n\n\nMissionaria Protectiva\nWith the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-ut-extremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation The prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus) And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were grossly underestimated.\n\nSpice agony\nThe spice agony is an ordeal in which an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit takes a poisonous \"awareness spectrum\" narcotic and, by internally changing the substance and neutralizing its toxicity, gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors In Dune, Lady Jessica notes that the ritual originated with the \"discovery of the poison drug on Rossak\" On Arrakis, the Fremen Reverend Mothers use a poison called Water of Life, which is the exhalation of a drowning \"little maker\" (small sandworm) in water In the Fremen version of the rite, after the ordeal the Reverend Mother also provides the changed poison for the sietch orgy.\n\n\nPowers\nOne of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.\n\n\nOther Memory\nOne of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, up to the point where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's ego is always dominant The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.\n\n\nThe Voice\nBene Gesserit are trained in what they call \"the Voice\" – a means \"to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice\" [22] By modulating the subtleties of her voice, a Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance the effect of the words being spoken To affect this, the Bene Gesserit must \"register\" the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions [23]\n\n\nAcute observation and Truthsay\nBene Gesserit are trained in \"the minutiae of observation\", noticing details that the common person would miss in the people and environment around them When combined with their analytical abilities, this \"hyperawareness\" enables the Bene Gesserit to divine secrets and arrive at conclusions that are invisible to everyone else Slight differences in air currents or the design of a room might allow a Bene Gesserit to detect hidden portals and spyholes; minute variations in a person's vocal inflection and body language allow a Bene Gesserit to deeply understand a person's emotional state, and manipulate it Knowing that any schooling impresses a particular pattern in its students, they are able to use these clues to predict and anticipate actions The Bene Gesserit can easily determine a person's origins and root language by analyzing their speech patterns, cadence, and pacing, as Jessica does when she realizes that a visiting Spacing Guild banker is a Harkonnen agent [4]\n\n\nSimulflow\nBene Gesserit also practice simulflow, the flow of several threads of consciousness at once—mental multitasking, as it were The combination of simulflow with their analytical abilities and Other Memory are responsible for the frightening intelligence of the average Bene Gesserit, though this ability is less powerful than the analytical abilities of a Mentat This simulflow can also be held with Other Memory; Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade practiced both forms in Heretics of Dune.\n\n\nPrana-bindu training and the \"weirding way\"\nThe Bene Gesserit develop their physical abilities as well as their mental abilities A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device (\"the box\") that causes the sensation of intense pain Paul learns that he is not the only one to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.\n\n\nInternal organic-chemical control\nJust as the prana-bindu allows the Bene Gesserit to precisely control each muscle and nerve, they also have complete conscious control over the functions of their internal organs and body chemistry  A Sister can completely control her breathing and heart rate to the degree that she can appear dead to most tests even after intense physical exertion They can control their need for food and water to the extremes of hunger and thirst, and even commit suicide at will by simply stopping their hearts or shutting down their brains The Bene Gesserit are therefore immune to poisons, as they can simply change the chemical makeup of any harmful substance in their body and render it harmless It is hinted that should a Bene Gesserit wish to, she could slow her aging process dramatically, controlling every aspect of her metabolism It is suggested that a Sister would never attempt this, as it might call attention to the Sisterhood and reveal too much of their abilities In Children of Dune, Jessica realizes that her daughter Alia has done this, which is her first sign that her daughter is sinking into Abomination [24]\n\n\nSexual talents\nThe Bene Gesserit are notable for their extensive skill in seduction, sex and sexual imprinting The most talented and most highly trained are known as Imprinters Men in a position of power or future power, or those with specific qualities that the order wishes to incorporate into their breeding program, are typical targets of a Bene Gesserit imprinter Men seduced by an imprinter are permanently affected (imprinted) by the intense sexual experience and are thereafter consciously or subconsciously favorable to the Sisterhood An imprinter can be successfully resisted if the subject has been psychologically pre-conditioned to do so, and the subject's automatic defensive response may even be entirely subconscious.\n\n\nWeaknesses\nReverend Mothers are dependent on melange to give them their abilities Any person who consumes melange regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need Though the effects of melange are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death Melange is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood's wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply in a show of hydraulic despotism.\n\n\nAddiction to melange\nReverend Mothers are dependent on melange to give them their abilities Any person who consumes melange regularly becomes addicted to it and requires it for survival; however, one who has gone through the agony has a far greater need Though the effects of melange are highly favorable, including vastly increased lifespan and mental powers, withdrawal results in death Melange is expensive and thus is a continual drain on the Sisterhood's wealth; the most significant threat to the Bene Gesserit is the potential loss of their supply Paul Atreides and then his son Leto II assert control over the Bene Gesserit and keep them in check by grasping control of the planet Arrakis and the spice supply in a show of hydraulic despotism.\n\n\nAbomination\nA Bene Gesserit who survives the ritual spice agony gains access to Other Memory, the combined ego and memories of all her female ancestors An adult Reverend Mother can manage the presence of these subordinate inner voices because she has a full personality of her own and a solid sense of self However, if a Bene Gesserit undergoes the agony while pregnant, the fetus will also experience it, acquiring full consciousness and access to Other Memory Since the child has not yet developed a sufficiently strong ego before being exposed to her tide of ancestors, she is more susceptible to their influence, and there is a danger that she will ultimately be overcome and possessed by a strong ancestral ego The Bene Gesserit call this \"Abomination\", and such children are killed immediately They are also referred to as \"pre-born\" in Children of Dune.\n\n\nLitany against fear\nThe litany against fear is an incantation used by the Bene Gesserit throughout the series to focus their minds and calm themselves in times of peril  The litany is as follows:\n\n\nAnalysis\n\"Bene Gesserit\" is derived from Latin [25]\n\n\nIn adaptations\nThe Bene Gesserit appear in all of the Dune adaptations to date: the 1984 film Dune; [28] the 2000 TV miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune; [29] [30] [31] [32] and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune; [33] [34] as well as the 2021 feature film Dune, [35] [36] and its 2024 sequel, Dune: Part Two [37]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.\" [93]\n\n\nElections\nIn March 2017, after Mark Dayton, the incumbent governor, chose not to seek another term, Walz announced he would run for governor [140] His main opponent in the Democratic primary was originally state representative Erin Murphy, who won the state party endorsement at the party's convention in June 2018 [141] [142] Shortly thereafter, state attorney general Lori Swanson entered the race late in the campaign Walz defeated Murphy and Swanson in the August primary election with a 41.60% plurality [143] [144] On November 6, 2018, he was elected governor, defeating the Republican nominee, Hennepin County commissioner Jeff Johnson, 53.84% to 42.43% [145]\n\n\nCongressional tenure\nSwearing in at the beginning of the 110th Congress, Walz became the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress, [96] [97] [98] as well as only the fourth Democrat/DFLer to represent his district The others were Thomas Wilson (1887–1889), William Harries (1891–1893), and Tim Penny (1983–1995) Even as he represented a district that had usually voted Republican, pundits described Walz's policy positions as ranging from moderate to progressive [99]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nIn March 2017, after

nominee Scott Jensen in the November general election On November 8, 2022, Walz defeated Jensen, 52.3% to 44.6% [147] [148]\n\n\nTenure\nWalz was sworn in as governor of Minnesota on January 7, 2019, at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul He took the oath of office alongside the incoming lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan; Minnesota secretary of state Steve Simon; Minnesota state auditor Julie Blaha; and Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison, all Democrats [149] Walz spoke about education and healthcare reform in his inauguration speech [150]\n\n\nPolice reform and protest response\nOn May 26, 2020, the day after the murder of George Floyd, Walz and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan demanded justice and called the video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd's neck \"disturbing\" [154] Walz elaborated, \"The lack of humanity in this disturbing video is sickening We will get answers and seek justice\" [154]\n\n\nAbortion\nWalz supports a legal right to abortion, [242] and has a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood [243] The National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion organization, gave him a rating of zero [243] In a March 2024 interview with CNN's Kaitlin Collins, he said, \"my neighboring states have tried to criminalize women getting health care\", and characterized their policies as \"a health care crisis\", adding that states need to \"trust women to make their own health care decisions\" and to \"understand that abortion is health care\" Also during the interview, he said, \"I think old white men need to learn how to talk about this a little more And I think the biggest thing is: listen to women.\" [244] [245]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn early 2023, Walz signed a law requiring Minnesota to obtain all of its electricity from wind, solar, and other carbon-free sources by 2040, phasing out the climate-warming pollution generated by coal and gas-fired power plants, in addition to a variety of other measures to preserve and expand peatlands, forests, pollinator habitats, electric vehicle charger networks, access to home weatherization, embedded emissions cuts in buildings, green banking, and green-collar worker apprenticeships [175] [176] [177] \"As I sign this legislation, communities from one end of our state to the other are looking at months of rebuilding after an extreme weather event exacerbated by climate change\", Walz said in June, after catastrophic flooding devastated parts of the state \"This is a measure that will help protect our environment and get the clean energy projects that are going to help fight climate change in motion.\" [175]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nIn 2023, Walz signed a bipartisan $2.6 billion infrastructure spending package that funded numerous union construction jobs focused on repairing roads, bridges, and other essential infrastructure [183] [184] Other projects funded included a new fire hall in Dilworth, Minnesota, a water treatment plant in Mankato, and $78 million for the state veterans' home in Hastings, Minnesota [184] Soon afterward, Walz signed into law HF2887, which provides $9 billion over the long term to transportation projects, including reforms to climate impact considerations and transit infrastructure permitting [185] [186] [187]\n\n\nEducation\nAfter schools closed in 2020 due to COVID-19, Walz was cautious about reopening them, which aligned closely with the concerns of teachers, who were hesitant to return to in-person learning due to fear of contracting COVID-19 [193] According to Nat Malkus of the American Enterprise Institute, Minnesota schools remained remote longer than the national average during the 2020–21 school year Malkus ranked Minnesota 19th out of 50 states for the duration of remote learning, adjusted for student enrollment [193] Between 2017 and 2022, Minnesota fourth-graders' test scores decreased from 10 points above the national average to 4 points above [193]\n\n\nCannabis\nWalz advocated for the legalization of recreational cannabis as governor of Minnesota [198] [199] [200] As a candidate for governor in 2017, he said: \"We have an opportunity in Minnesota to replace the current failed policy with one that creates tax revenue, grows jobs, builds opportunities for Minnesotans, protects Minnesota kids, and trusts adults to make personal decisions based on their personal freedoms.\" [201] In 2022, he proposed the creation of a Cannabis Management Office to develop and implement the \"regulatory framework for adult-use cannabis\" in Minnesota [202] [203] [204] On May 30, 2023, he signed into law House File 100 to legalize recreational cannabis in Minnesota, which went into effect on August 1, 2023 [205] [206]\n\n\nMedical debt\nIn June 2024, Walz signed the Minnesota Debt Fairness Act [207] Among other things, the act prevents health care providers from denying medically necessary treatment because of outstanding medical debt and prevents medical debt from affecting credit scores [208]\n\n\nNative Americans\nIn 2019, Walz issued Executive Order 19-24, which requires state agencies to create and implement tribal consultation policies to guide their interaction with tribal nations in Minnesota [209] In November 2021, he signed the \"Government to Government Relationship with Tribal Governments\" bill, which codified the order into state law [210] In 2022, Walz appointed attorney Tadd Johnson to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents, the first Native American appointed to the board since it was established [211] In August 2023, Walz signed an education bill that included education of Indigenous cultural heritage for all students [212] In September, he signed the return of parts of Upper Sioux Agency State Park land to the Upper Sioux Community [213] In December, Walz became the first Minnesota governor to visit all 11 tribal nations in the state [209] In 2024, he appointed Melanie Benjamin of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe and Johnny Johnson of the Prairie Island Indian Community to the nine-member Minnesota Racing Commission [214]\n\n\n2023 legislative session\nThe 93rd Minnesota Legislature, in session from January to May 2023, was the first legislature to be fully Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party-controlled since the 88th Minnesota Legislature in 2013–2015 It passed several major reforms to Minnesota law, including requiring paid leave, banning noncompete agreements, cannabis legalization, and environmental issues, tax modifications, codifying abortion rights, universal free school meals, and universal gun background checks [215] The Star Tribune called the session \"one of the most consequential\" ever in Minnesota; Walz called it the \"most productive session in Minnesota history\" [215] While Walz signed almost all legislation passed by the legislature, he vetoed a bill intended to increase pay for rideshare drivers, his first veto as governor, saying that it did not strike the right balance [216] [217]\n\n\nNational politics\nIn February 2019, Walz endorsed the candidacy of Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota's senior U.S senator, in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary [218] In August 2020, he endorsed the candidacy of Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris [219] In October 2023, Walz publicly supported Biden for reelection and dismissed U.S Representative Dean Phillips's announcement of a run for the Democratic nomination for president, saying, \"It's not going to be relevant, and we'll just move on.\" [220] [221] [222] In July 2024, Walz was among 20 Democratic governors who met with Biden at the White House after the first presidential debate Walz said the debate was a \"bad hit\" for Biden's campaign [223]\n\n\n2024 vice presidential campaign\nOn July 22, 2024, Walz endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris after incumbent president Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race [224] After a rapid selection process in which the Harris campaign also vetted Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Illinois governor J B Pritzker, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro [225] (with Shapiro, Kelly and Walz the only three to be interviewed by Harris in person [226]), Harris announced on August 6 that she had chosen Walz as her running mate [227] [228] [229]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nWalz has been described as holding both moderate and progressive policy stances [241]\n\n\nAbortion\nWalz supports a legal right to abortion, [242] and has a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood [243] The National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion organization, gave him a rating of zero [243] In a March 2024 interview with CNN's Kaitlin Collins, he said, \"my neighboring states have tried to criminalize women getting health care\", and characterized their policies as \"a health care crisis\", adding that states need to \"trust women to make their own health care decisions\" and to \"understand that abortion is health care\" Also during the interview, he said, \"I think old white men need to learn how to talk about this a little more And I think

Walz**\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nTimothy James Walz was born on April 6, 1964, at Memorial Hospital in West Point, Nebraska. His mother, Darlene Rose Reiman, was a homemaker who grew up on a farm. His father, James Frederick Walz, was a teacher and school superintendent who served in the U.S Army during the Korean War. Tim is of German, Swedish, Luxembourgish, and Irish descent. In 1867, his great-great-grandfather Sebastian Walz emigrated to the United States from Kuppenheim, Germany. One of his grandmothers was Swedish American, and one of his great-grandmothers was Irish American. He was raised Catholic.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nAfter graduating from Chadron State College, Walz accepted a one-year teaching position with WorldTeach at Foshan No.1 High School in Guangdong, China. He went to teach in August 1989, following the Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent government crackdown in June of that year. Upon returning to the U.S., Walz became a teacher and coach in Alliance, a town of 10,000 in western Nebraska. In 1993, he was named an Outstanding Young Nebraskan by the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce.\n\n**Teaching**\n\nAfter graduating from Chadron State College, Walz accepted a one-year teaching position with WorldTeach at Foshan No.1 High School in Guangdong, China.

In 1993, he was named an Outstanding Young Nebraskan by the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nWith his father's encouragement, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard two days after he turned 17.

He was inspired to volunteer in the presidential election after he took a group of students to a George W Bush rally in Mankato.

The district consisted mostly of Republican-leaning independents. He had no opponent for the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) nomination in the 2006 primary election. In the general election, he faced Republican Gil Gutknecht, a six-term incumbent. Walz won the election with 53% of the vote. After his victory, Politico said Gutknecht had been caught \"off guard\" and Walz had \"resolved never to get caught like that himself... He packaged himself as a moderate from Day One, built an office centered on constituent service and carved out a niche as a tireless advocate for veterans.\"\n\n**Elections**\n\nIn March 2017, after Mark Dayton, the incumbent governor, chose not to seek another term, Walz announced he would run for governor. His main opponent in the Democratic primary was originally state representative Erin Murphy, who won the state party endorsement at the party's convention in June 2018.

campaign\nOn July 22, 2024, Walz endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris after incumbent president Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race [224] After a rapid selection process in which the Harris campaign also vetted Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Illinois governor J B Pritzker, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro [225] (with Shapiro, Kelly and Walz the only three to be interviewed by Harris in person [226]), Harris announced on August 6 that she had chosen Walz as her running mate [227] [228] [229]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nWalz has been described as holding both moderate and progressive policy stances [241]\n\n\nAbortion\nWalz supports a legal right to abortion, [242] and has a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood [243] The National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion organization, gave him a rating of zero [243] In a March 2024 interview with CNN's Kaitlin Collins, he said, \"my neighboring states have tried to criminalize women getting health care\", and characterized their policies as \"a health care crisis\", adding that states need to \"trust women to make their own health care decisions\" and to \"understand that abortion is health care\" Also during the interview, he said, \"I think old white men need to learn how to talk about this a little more And I think the biggest thing is: listen to women.\" [244] [245]\n\n\nGuns\nWalz is a gun owner and supports increased regulations on firearms [247] While in Congress, Walz was a strong supporter of gun rights and was endorsed by the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) multiple times, receiving an A grade from the organization [248] [249] Following the Parkland high school shooting in 2018, he denounced the NRA in a Star Tribune opinion piece, and announced that he would donate the equivalent of all of the campaign contributions the NRA-PVF had given him—$18,000—to the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund [250] As governor, Walz expressed support for gun regulation [251] In 2023, he signed into law a public safety bill that establishes universal background checks and red-flag laws in Minnesota [252]\n\n\nIsrael–Hamas war\nWalz condemned Hamas's October 7 attacks in Israel [253] He ordered flags to be lowered to half staff in the following days [254] After the 2024 Minnesota Democratic presidential primary, in which 19% of voters cast \"uncommitted\" ballots, Walz took a sympathetic view toward those doing so to protest President Biden's handling of the war in Gaza, calling them \"civically engaged\" [255]\n\n\nLabor and workers' rights\nIn 2023, Walz signed a law banning captive audience meetings and non-compete clauses [257] [258] The law also mandates paid sick leave for employees and increases safety inspections and ergonomics requirements to reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries for warehouse, meatpacking, and healthcare facility workers [257] [258] It also grants workers some of the strongest protections against wage theft [257] [258] In October 2023, Walz joined the striking United Auto Workers' picket line [259] He is a former member of two teachers' unions, the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers [260] Addressing the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in August 2024, Walz said, \"It's not just a saying, it's a fact: when unions are strong, America is strong.\" [261]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nWalz supports LGBTQ rights, including federal anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual

{"title": "Underground_Railroad", "content": "\nOrigin of the name\nEric Foner wrote that the term \"was perhaps first used by a Washington newspaper in 1839, quoting a young slave hoping to escape bondage via a railroad that 'went underground all the way to Boston'\" [17] [18] Dr Robert Clemens Smedley wrote that following slave catchers' failed searches and lost traces of fugitives as far north as Columbia, Pennsylvania, they declared in bewilderment that \"there must be an underground railroad somewhere,\" giving origin to the term [19] Scott Shane wrote that the first documented use of the term was in an article written by Thomas Smallwood in the August 10, 1842, edition of Tocsin of Liberty, an abolitionist newspaper published in Albany He also wrote that the 1879 book Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad said the phrase was mentioned in an 1839 Washington newspaper article and that the book's author said 40 years later that he had quoted the article from memory as closely as he could [20] [21]\n\n\nTerminology\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the railway For example:\n\n\nPolitical background\nFor the fugitive slaves who \"rode\" the Underground Railroad, many of them considered Canada their final destination An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 of them settled in Canada, half of whom came between 1850 and 1860 Others settled in free states in the north [25] Thousands of court cases for fugitive slaves were recorded between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War [26] Under the original Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured fugitives, but some state legislatures prohibited this The law made it easier for slaveholders and slave catchers to capture African Americans and return them to slavery, and in some cases allowed them to enslave free blacks It also created an eagerness among abolitionists to help enslaved people, resulting in the growth of anti-slavery societies and the Underground Railroad [27]\n\n\nRoutes and methods of escape\nUnderground Railroad routes went north to free states and Canada, to the Caribbean, to United States western territories, and to Indian territories Some fugitive slaves traveled south into Mexico for their freedom [35] [36] Many escaped by sea, including Ona Judge, who had been enslaved by President George Washington [37] Some historians view the waterways of the South as an important component for freedom seekers to escape as water sources were pathways to freedom In addition, historians of the Underground Railroad found 200,000 runaway slave advertisements in North American newspapers from the middle of the 1700s until the end of the American Civil War [38] Freedom seekers in Alabama hid on steamboats heading to Mobile, Alabama in hopes of blending in among the city's free Black community, and also hid on other steamboats leaving Alabama that were headed further northward into free territories and free states In 1852, a law was passed by the Alabama legislature to reduce the number of freedom seekers escaping on boats The law penalized slaveholders and captains of vessels if they allowed enslaved people on board without a pass Alabama freedom seekers also made canoes to escape [39] Freedom seekers escaped from their enslavers in Panama on boats heading for California by way of the Panama route Slaveholders used the Panama route to reach California In Panama slavery was illegal and Black Panamanians encouraged enslaved people from the United States to escape into the local city of Panama [40]\n\n\nNorth to free states and Canada\nDespite the thoroughfare's name, the escape network was neither literally underground nor a railroad (The first literal underground railroad did not exist until 1863.) According to John Rankin, \"It was so called because they who took passage on it disappeared from public view as really as if they had gone into the ground After the fugitive slaves entered a depot on that road no trace of them could be found They were secretly passed from one depot to another until they arrived at a destination where they were able to remain free.\" [47] It was known as a railroad, using rail terminology such as stations and conductors, because that was the transportation system in use at the time [48]\n\n\nStructure\nDespite the thoroughfare's name, the escape network was neither literally underground nor a railroad (The first literal underground railroad did not exist until 1863.)

railroad, using rail terminology such as stations and conductors, because that was the transportation system in use at the time [48]\n\n\nGeography\nThe Underground Railroad benefited greatly from the geography of the U.S.–Canada border: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and most of New York were separated from Canada by water, over which transport was usually easy to arrange and relatively safe The main route for freedom seekers from the South led up the Appalachians, Harriet Tubman going via Harpers Ferry, through the highly anti-slavery Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio to the vast shore of Lake Erie, and then to Canada by boat A smaller number, traveling by way of New York or New England, went via Syracuse (home of Samuel May) and Rochester, New York (home of Frederick Douglass), crossing the Niagara River or Lake Ontario into Canada By 1848 the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge had been built—it crossed the Niagara River and connected New York to Canada Enslaved runaways used the bridge to escape their bondage, and Harriet Tubman used the bridge to take freedom seekers into Canada [58] [59] Those traveling via the New York Adirondacks, sometimes via Black communities like Timbuctoo, New York, entered Canada via Ogdensburg, on the St Lawrence River, or on Lake Champlain (Joshua Young assisted) The western route, used by John Brown among others, led from Missouri west to free Kansas and north to free Iowa, then east via Chicago to the Detroit River \n\n\nTraveling conditions\nAlthough the freedom seekers sometimes traveled on boat or train, [70] they usually traveled on foot or by wagon, sometimes lying down, covered with hay or similar products, in groups of one to three escapees Some groups were considerably larger Abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey and his colleagues rented horses and wagons and often transported as many as 15 or 20 people at a time [71] Free and enslaved black men occupied as mariners (sailors) helped enslaved people escape from slavery by providing a ride on their ship, providing information on the safest and best escape routes, and safe locations on land, and locations of trusted people for assistance Enslaved African-American mariners had information about slave revolts occurring in the Caribbean, and relayed this news to enslaved people they had contact with in American ports Free and enslaved African-American mariners assisted Harriet Tubman in her rescue missions Black mariners provided to her information about the best escape routes and helped her on her rescue missions In New Bedford, Massachusetts, freedom seekers stowed away on ships leaving the docks with the assistance of Black and white crewmembers and hid in the ships' cargoes during their journey to freedom [72]\n\n\nMaroons\nThe majority of freedom seekers that escaped from slavery did not have help from an abolitionist Although there are stories of black and white abolitionists helping freedom seekers escape from slavery, many escapes were unaided [79] [80] \nOther Underground Railroad escape routes for freedom seekers were maroon communities Maroon communities were hidden places, such as wetlands or marshes, where escaped slaves established their own independent communities Examples of maroon communities in the United States include the Black Seminole communities in Florida, as well as groups that lived in the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and in the Okefenokee swamp of Georgia and Florida, among others [81] [82] In the 1780s, Louisiana had a maroon community in the bayous of Saint Malo The leader of the Saint Malo maroon community was Jean Saint Malo, a freedom seeker who escaped to live among other runaways in the swamps and bayous of Saint Malo The population of maroons was fifty and the Spanish colonial government broke up the community and on June 19, 1784, Jean Saint Malo was executed [83] [84] Colonial South Carolina had a number of maroon settlements in its marshland regions in the Lowcountry and near rivers Maroons in South Carolina fought to maintain their freedom and prevent enslavement in Ashepoo in 1816, Williamsburg County in 1819, Georgetown in 1820, Jacksonborough in 1822, and near Marion in 1861 Historian Herbert Aptheker found evidence that fifty maroon communities existed in the United States between 1672 and 1864 [85] [86] The history of maroons showed how the enslaved resisted enslavement by living in free independent settlements Historical archeologist Dan Sayer says that historians downplay the importance of maroon settlements and place valor in white involvement in the Underground Railroad, which he argues shows a racial bias, indicating a \"...reluctance to acknowledge the strength of black resistance and initiative.\" [87]\n\n\nFreedom routes into Native American lands\nFrom colonial America into the 19th century, Indigenous peoples of North America assisted and protected enslaved Africans journey to freedom [88] [89] However, not all Indigenous communities were accepting of freedom seekers, some of whom they enslaved themselves or returned to their former enslavers [90] The earliest accounts of escape are from the 16th century In 1526, Spaniards established the first European colony in the continental United States in South Carolina called San Miguel de Gualdape The enslaved Africans revolted and historians suggest they escaped to Shakori Indigenous communities [91] [92] As early as 1689, enslaved Africans fled from the South Carolina Lowcountry to Spanish Florida seeking freedom [93] The Seminole Nation accepted Gullah runaways (today called Black Seminoles) into their lands [94] This was a southern route on the Underground Railroad into Seminole Indian lands that went from Georgia and the Carolinas into Florida In Northwest Ohio in the 18th and 19th centuries, three Indigenous/Native American nations, the Shawnee, Ottawa, and Wyandot assisted freedom seekers escape from slavery The Ottawa people accepted and protected runaways in their villages Other escapees were taken to Fort Malden by the Ottawa In Upper Sandusky, Wyandot people allowed a maroon community of freedom seekers in their lands called Negro Town for four decades [95]\n\n\nSouth to Florida and Mexico\nBeginning in the 16th century, Spaniards brought enslaved Africans to New Spain, including Mission Nombre de Dios in what would become the city of St Augustine in Spanish Florida Over time, free Afro-Spaniards took up various trades and occupations and served in the colonial militia [102] After King Charles II of Spain proclaimed Spanish Florida a safe haven for escaped slaves from British North America, they began escaping to Florida by the hundreds from as far north as New York The Spanish established Fort Mose for free Blacks in the St Augustine area in 1738.\n\n\nBackground\nBeginning in the 16th century, Spaniards brought enslaved Africans to New Spain, including Mission Nombre de

Fort Mose for free Blacks in the St Augustine area in 1738.\n\n\nSlave states and slave hunters\nThe Southern Underground Railroad went through slave states, lacking the abolitionist societies and the organized system of the north People who spoke out against slavery were subject to mobs, physical assault, and being hanged There were slave catchers who looked for runaway slaves There were never more than a few hundred free blacks in Texas, which meant that free blacks did not feel safe in the state The network to freedom was informal, random, and dangerous [107]\n\n\nRoutes\nThousands of freedom seekers traveled along a network from the southern United States to Texas and ultimately Mexico [110] Southern enslaved people generally traveled across \"unforgiving country\" on foot or horseback while pursued by lawmen and slave hunters [107] Some stowed away on ferries bound for a Mexican port [105] [110] from New Orleans, Louisiana and Galveston, Texas [106] There were some who transported cotton to Brownsville, Texas on wagons and then crossed into Mexico at Matamoros [106]\n\n\nAssistance\nSome journeyed on their own without assistance, and others were helped by people along the southern Underground Railroad [105] Assistance included guidance, directions, shelter, and supplies [107]\n\n\nSouthern freedom seekers\nAdvertisements were placed in newspapers offering rewards for the return of their \"property\" Slave catchers traveled through Mexico There were Black Seminoles, or Los Mascogos who lived in northern Mexico who provided armed resistance [110]\n\n\nRio Grande stations\nTwo families, the Webbers and the Jacksons, lived along the Rio Grande and helped people escape slavery The husbands were white and the wives were black women who had been formerly enslaved [110] It is not known if Nathaniel Jackson purchased the freedom of Matilda Hicks and her family, but in the early 1860s they moved to Hidalgo county, where they settled and lived as a family He was a white southerner and she was an enslaved woman, who had been childhood sweethearts in Alabama [110] He was the son of her slaveholder, [105] who helped a group of seven families in 1857 and others cross into Mexico [107]\n\n\nArrival in Mexico\nFugitive slaves who made it to Mexico lived with the knowledge that they could be illegally kidnapped by slave catchers or blackbirders [107] Slave hunters who tried to kidnap former slaves from Mexico could be taken to court or shot [104]\n\n\nColonies\nThere were abolitionists from the north who petitioned the Mexican government to establish colonies for free and runaway blacks Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, lobbied for a colony to be established in what is now Texas during the early 1830s, but he was unable to do so when Texas legalized slavery when it separated from Mexico and became the Republic of Texas (1836) [105] Black Seminoles successfully petitioned for land and established a colony in 1852 The land is still owned by their descendants [105]\n\n\nScholarship\nThe Texas Runaway Slave Project, located in Nacogdoches at the Stephen F Austin State University, has researched runaway advertisements that appeared in 19,000 editions of newspapers from the mid-19th century [106]\n\n\n\"Reverse Underground Railroad\"\nFreedom seekers were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was planted, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as in the well-documented case of Solomon Northup, a New York-born free black who was kidnapped by Southern slavers while visiting Washington, DC \"Certificates of freedom\", also known as \"free papers\", were signed and notarized statements attesting to the free status of individual Blacks They could easily be destroyed or stolen, so they provided little protection.\n\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War routes (1775 to 1783)\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, enslaved people escaped from bondage and fled to British forces, Canada, Florida, and Native American lands The last Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, planned to weaken American colonists by issuing a proclamation in 1775 that gave freedom to the enslaved who escaped their American colonial masters and joined the British According to a PBS and National Park Service article this proclamation resulted in an estimated 100,000 freedom seekers escaping during the war American colonial officers received numerous requests for the return of escaped slaves In November of 1775, Dunmore started a military unit of 300 freedom seekers in North Carolina called \"the Ethiopian Regiment.\" In Virginia 800 freedom seekers joined the regiment [122] [123] American colonists tried to deter freedom seekers from joining the British by sending slave patrols to stop runaways, and published newspapers and editorials stating the British will not act on their promise of granting freedom to runaway slaves [124] Thousands of free and enslaved Black people fought with the British in hopes to gain their freedom were called Black Loyalists Black Loyalists who served with the British for one year received Certificates of Freedom and were taken to Caribbean British colonies to live as free people in the Bahamas and Jamaica, and others were taken north to Canada [125] Between 1783 and 1785, 3,000 enslaved and free Black Americans settled in the British colony of Nova Scotia, Canada [126] Other enslaved people ran away to join the Continental Army or Patriot militias Black Americans who fought in the Continental Army were called Black Patriots, and some did earn their freedom through their military service Some enslaved runaways took the war as an opportunity to escape using their enslaver's horse [127] [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nWar of 1812 routes\nDuring the War of 1812, 700 enslaved people in Maryland escaped from slavery [132] Before the war, freedom seekers escaped to the Michigan Territory by crossing the Detroit River Over the years the numbers of escaped African Americans grew in the territory Territorial governor William Hull offered Peter Denison, an enslaved man, \"a written license\" allowing him to form a militia company of free Blacks and escaped slaves The men were armed and trained but Hull disbanded the militia Some of the Black men in the militia escaped from slavery in British Canada In the 18th century, slavery was practiced in Canada, and by 1793 it was phased out, but some Black Canadians remained enslaved During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the route of freedom seekers went south beginning in British Canada to their final destination in free American territories in the Old Northwest By the War of 1812, slave laws in British Canada prohibited the continuation of slavery This changed the final destinations of freedom seekers in the United States to look north to Canada to obtain their freedom In the summer of 1812, Hull declared that enslaved runaways and free Blacks in the Michigan Territory were free citizens, and when war broke out with Britain Black citizens of Michigan were armed to fight against the British After his military service, Peter Denison and his family left Michigan and relocated north to Canada [133]\n\n\nBlack Refugees\nIn April of 1814, the British Army promised freedom to enslaved Black Americans who joined the British military or who choose freedom in British colonies In the Chesapeake Region of Virginia and Maryland and coastal areas of Georgia, about 4,000 enslaved Black Americans escaped from slavery Within the number of 4,000 freedom seekers who escaped, 2,000 sailed to Nova Scotia between September 1813 and August 1816 on naval vessels and private ships chartered by the British and were taken to Nova Scotia and News Brunswick, Canada and 400 freedom seekers were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean The Black people who settled in British Canada are known as Black refugees who escaped slavery in the United States and sided with the British during the War of 1812 [134]\n\n\nMerikens\nThe Merikins were formerly enslaved Black Americans that escaped slavery and joined the British military's all-Black unit of Colonial Marines during the War of 1812 When the war ended, they were taken to numerous British colonies to live as free people About 700 Colonial Marines were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean Although slavery was legal in Trinidad, they were guaranteed protection under commander Robert Mitchell The formerly Black Americans called themselves Merikens, \"an abbreviated word for 'Americans'\" and started new lives in Trinidad in six Company Villages in the southern part of the island [135] The Trinidadian government provided the Merikens with food, rations, clothing, and tools needed to build their homes, and they grew their own food of corn, pumpkin, plantain, and rice [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nThe \"Saltwater Railroad\" freedom route\nFrom 1821 to 1861, freedom seekers escaped from the Southeastern slave states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida to the Bahamas on a secret route called the \"Saltwater Railroad.\" Prior to 1821, Florida was a Spanish colony called by historians, Spanish Florida, where enslaved runaways were declared free under Spanish laws However, by 1821 Florida was under the control of the United States Free Blacks in Florida feared they might be re-enslaved under American laws and hundreds of free people escaped to the Bahamas From 1821 to 1825, the Southern beaches of Florida provided a safe haven for freedom seekers looking to escape on boats that departed from Florida going to the island Other freedom seekers escaped by making their own canoes and boats and sailed to the Bahamas unaided [139] [140]\n\n\nFugitive Slave Act of 1850\nUnder the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special magistrate known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify on their own behalf Between 1850 and 1860, 343 freedom seekers were taken before a commissioner and 332 were returned to slavery Commissioners received ten dollars when they ruled in favor of a slaveholder and received five dollars if they ruled in a slave's favor Technically, they were not accused of a crime The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a writ of replevin for the return of property A fine of 1,000 dollars was charged to individuals who assisted a freedom seeker's escape [144]\n\n\nAmerican Civil War routes (1861 to 1865)\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army captured Southern towns in Beaufort, South Carolina, St Simons Island, Georgia, and other areas and setup encampments As a result, enslaved people on nearby plantations escaped from slavery and ran to Union lines for freedom and to sign up to fight in the Union Army American historian Eric Foner explains in his book, Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad, that: \"...the Civil War fundamentally transformed the opportunities available for slaves seeking freedom As soon as federal troops which in Maryland meant the very beginning of the war, slaves sought refuge with the Union...\" [54] Susie King Taylor was born enslaved in Liberty County, Georgia and escaped from slavery with her family to Union lines in St Catherine's Island, Georgia with the help of her uncle who put her on a federal gunboat plying the waters near Confederate-held Fort Pulaski In addition, thousands of enslaved Black Americans escaped slavery and fled to Union lines in the South Carolina Sea Islands [152] [153] In 1861, Jarvis Harvey escaped from slavery and sailed to Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia [154] Robert Sutton was born enslaved in Alberti Plantation along Florida’s northeastern boundary with Georgia, and during the Civil War he escaped from slavery by making a canoe and sailed out to Port Royal, South Carolina where Black Americans were freed from slavey after the Battle of Port Royal and signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment [155] Prince Rivers escaped from slavery and found freedom in Union lines in Port Royal, South Carolina after his enslaver fled Beaufort upon arrival of the Union Navy and Army Rivers later signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment [156] On May 12, 1862, Robert Smalls and sixteen enslaved people escaped from slavery during the Civil War on a Confederate ship and sailed it out the Charleston Harbor to a Union blockade in South Carolina [157]\n\n\nUnion Navy and Emancipation\nThe Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War was Gideon Welles and in September of 1861 Welles declared that enslaved and free African Americans could enlist at the lowest rating of \"Boy\" in the Union Navy Union vessels located in Southern ports received numbers of runaways who fled slavery by way of small boats to vessels docked in Union controlled territories Benjamin Gould recorded in his journal that by September 22, 1862, eight freedom seekers had arrived at the USS Cambridge and that 20 more runaways arrived two weeks later One of the escaped freedom seekers listed was William Gould, who later joined the Union (U.S.) Navy and fought against the Confederacy from 1862 to 1865 The Union vessel USS Harftford helped to liberate enslaved people while going up the Mississippi River Bartholomew Diggins, who served aboard the vessel, recalled the events of liberating the enslaved He said: \"we picked  [up] many negroes  [sic] slaves who would come out to the ships in small boats at every place we anchored.\" Other Union vessels that helped to liberate the enslaved were the USS Essex and USS Iroquois A few Union soldiers and sailors returned escaped slaves back to their enslavers [168] [169] By the end of the war, 179,000 formerly enslaved and free Black Americans had fought in the Union Army, and 21,000 had fought in the Union Navy [170]\n\n\nLegal and political\nWhen frictions between North and South culminated in the Civil War, many Black people, both enslaved and free, fought for the Union Army [172] Following Union victory in the Civil War, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed slavery except as punishment for a crime [173] Following its passage, in some cases the Underground Railroad operated in the opposite direction, as people who had escaped to Canada returned to the United States [174]\n\n\nCriticism\nFrederick Douglass was a writer and orator who had escaped slavery He wrote critically of the attention drawn to the ostensibly secret Underground Railroad in his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845):\n\n\nArrival in Canada\nBritish North America (present-day Canada) was a desirable destination, as its long border gave many points of access, it was farther from slave catchers, and it was beyond the reach of the United States' Fugitive Slave Acts Further, slavery ended decades earlier in Canada than in the United States  Britain banned the institution of slavery in present-day Canada (and in most British colonies) in 1833, though the practice of slavery in Canada had effectively ended already early in the 19th century through case law, due to court decisions

Underground Railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses used by enslaved African Americans to escape from the Southern United States to freedom in the Northern states and in Canada. The network, which was active from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century, played a significant role in the abolition of slavery in the United States. The Underground Railroad was not a physical railroad, but rather a series of hidden routes and safe houses that were used to transport people to freedom.\n\n# Origin of the name\n\nThe term \"Underground Railroad\" was perhaps first used by a Washington newspaper in 1839, quoting a young slave hoping to escape bondage via a railroad that \"went underground all the way to Boston.\" Dr. Robert Clemens Smedley wrote that following slave catchers' failed searches and lost traces of fugitives as far north as Columbia, Pennsylvania, they declared in bewilderment that \"there must be an underground railroad somewhere,\" giving origin to the term. Scott Shane wrote that the first documented use of the term was in an article written by Thomas Smallwood in the August 10, 1842, edition of Tocsin of Liberty, an abolitionist newspaper published in Albany.\n\n# Terminology\n\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the railway. For example, they used terms such as \"stations\" and \"conductors\" to describe the safe houses and the people who helped guide the fugitive slaves to freedom.\n\n# Political background\n\nFor the fugitive slaves who \"rode\" the Underground Railroad, many of them considered Canada their final destination. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 of them settled in Canada, half of whom came between 1850 and 1860. Others settled in free states in the north. Thousands of court cases for fugitive slaves were recorded between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. Under the original Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured fugitives, but some state legislatures prohibited this. The law made it easier for slaveholders and slave catchers to capture African Americans and return them to slavery, and in some cases allowed them to enslave free blacks.\n\n# Routes and methods of escape\n\nUnderground Railroad routes went north to free states and Canada, to the Caribbean, to United States western territories, and to Indian territories. Some fugitive slaves traveled south into Mexico for their freedom. Many escaped by sea, including Ona Judge, who had been enslaved by President George Washington. Others hid on steamboats heading to Mobile, Alabama or further northward into free territories and free states.\n\n# North to free states and Canada\n\nDespite the thoroughfare's name, the escape network was neither literally underground nor a railroad. According to John Rankin, \"It was so called because they who took passage on it disappeared from public view as really as if they had gone into the ground After the fugitive slaves entered a depot on that road no trace of them could be found They were secretly passed from one depot to another until they arrived at a destination where they were able to remain free.\" The network benefited greatly from the geography of the U.S.–Canada border: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and most of New York were separated from Canada by water, over which transport was usually easy to arrange and relatively safe.\n\n# Structure\n\nThe Underground Railroad was not a physical railroad, but rather a series of hidden routes and safe houses that were used to transport people to freedom. The network was made up of a variety of individuals and organizations, including abolitionists, free black communities, and sympathetic white communities. These individuals and organizations provided food, shelter, and guidance to fugitive slaves, helping them to navigate the treacherous journey to freedom.\n\n# Geography\n\nThe geography of the United States and Canada played a significant role in the Underground Railroad. The network of rivers, lakes, and mountains provided a natural route for fugitive slaves to travel to freedom. The Underground Railroad also made use of the fact that many of the northern states had laws that prohibited the return of fugitive slaves, making it easier for them to escape.\n\n# Traveling conditions\n\nFugitive slaves often traveled on foot or by wagon, sometimes lying down, covered with hay or similar products, in groups of one to three escapees. Free and enslaved black men occupied as mariners (sailors) helped enslaved people escape from slavery by providing a ride on their ship, providing information on the safest and best escape routes, and safe locations on land, and locations of trusted people for assistance.\n\n# Maroons\n\nThe majority of freedom seekers that escaped from slavery did not have help from an abolitionist. Other Underground Railroad escape routes for freedom seekers were maroon communities. Maroon communities were hidden places, such as wetlands or marshes, where escaped slaves established their own independent communities. Examples of maroon communities in the United States include the Black Seminole communities in Florida, as well as groups that lived in the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and in the Okefenokee swamp of Georgia and Florida.\n\n# Freedom routes into Native American lands\n\nFrom colonial America into the 19th century, Indigenous peoples of North America assisted and protected enslaved Africans journey to freedom. However, not all Indigenous communities were accepting of freedom seekers, some of whom they enslaved themselves or returned to their former enslavers. The earliest accounts of escape are from the 16th century. In 1526, Spaniards established the first European colony in the continental United States in South Carolina called San Miguel de Gualdape. The enslaved Africans revolted and historians suggest they escaped to Shakori Indigenous communities.\n\n# South to Florida and Mexico\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, Spaniards brought enslaved Africans to New Spain, including Mission Nombre de Dios in what would become the city of St Augustine in Spanish Florida. Over time, free Afro-Spaniards took up various trades and occupations and served in the colonial militia. After King Charles II of Spain proclaimed Spanish Florida a safe haven for escaped slaves from British North America, they began escaping to Florida by the hundreds from as far north as New York.\n\n# Slave states and slave hunters\n\nThe Southern Underground Railroad went through slave states, lacking the abolitionist societies and the organized system of the north. People who spoke out against slavery were subject to mobs, physical assault, and being hanged. There were slave catchers who looked for runaway slaves. There were never more than a few hundred free blacks in Texas, which meant that free blacks did not feel safe in the state.\n\n# Routes\n\nThousands of freedom seekers traveled along a network from the southern United States to Texas and ultimately Mexico. Southern enslaved people generally traveled across \"unforgiving country\" on foot or horseback while pursued by lawmen and slave hunters. Some stowed away on ferries bound for a Mexican port from New Orleans, Louisiana and Galveston, Texas. There were some who transported cotton to Brownsville, Texas on wagons and then crossed into Mexico at Matamoros.\n\n# Assistance\n\nSome journeyed on their own without assistance, and others were helped by people along the southern Underground Railroad. Assistance included guidance, directions, shelter, and supplies.\n\n# Fugitive Slave Act of 1850\n\nUnder the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special magistrate known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify on their own behalf. Between 1850 and 1860, 343 freedom seekers were taken before a commissioner and 332 were returned to slavery.\n\n# American Civil War routes (1861 to 1865)\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army captured Southern towns in Beaufort, South Carolina, St Simons Island, Georgia, and other areas and set up encampments. As a result, enslaved people on nearby plantations escaped from slavery and ran to Union lines for freedom and to sign up to fight in the Union Army.\n\n# Union Navy and Emancipation\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War was Gideon Welles and in September of 1861 Welles declared that enslaved and free African Americans could enlist at the lowest rating of \"Boy\" in the Union Navy. Union vessels located in Southern ports received numbers of runaways who fled slavery by way of small boats to vessels docked in Union controlled territories.\n\n# Legal and political\n\nWhen frictions between North and South culminated in the Civil War, many Black people, both enslaved and free, fought for the Union Army. Following Union victory in the Civil War, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed slavery except as punishment for a crime.\n\n# Criticism\n\nFrederick Douglass was a writer and orator who had escaped slavery. He wrote critically of the attention drawn to the ostensibly secret Underground Railroad in his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845).\n\n# Arrival in Canada\n\nBritish North America (present-day Canada) was a desirable destination, as its long border gave many points of access, it was farther from slave catchers, and it was beyond the reach of the United States' Fugitive Slave Acts.\n\n# Folklore\n\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that quilt designs were used to signal and direct enslaved people to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct enslaved people to take particular actions.\n\n# Notable people\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990 for the National Park Service to perform a special resource study of the Underground Railroad, in 1997, the 105th Congress introduced and subsequently passed H.R 1635 – National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which President Bill Clinton signed into law that year.\n\n# National Underground Railroad Network\n\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990 for the National Park Service to perform a special resource study of the Underground Railroad, in 1997, the 105th Congress introduced and subsequently passed H.R 1635 – National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which President Bill Clinton signed into law that year.\n\n# International Underground Railroad Month\n\nThe month of September was designated International Underground Railroad Month, because September was the month Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Underground_Railroad\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigin of the name\nEric Foner wrote that the term \"was perhaps first used by a Washington newspaper in 1839, quoting a young slave hoping to escape bondage via a railroad that 'went underground all the way to Boston'\" [17] [18] Dr Robert Clemens Smedley wrote that following slave catchers' failed searches and lost traces of fugitives as far north as Columbia, Pennsylvania, they declared in bewilderment that \"there must be an underground railroad somewhere,\" giving origin to the term [19] Scott Shane wrote that the first documented use of the term was in an article written by Thomas Smallwood in the August 10, 1842, edition of Tocsin of Liberty, an abolitionist newspaper published in Albany He also wrote that the 1879 book Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad said the phrase was mentioned in an 1839 Washington newspaper article and that the book's author said 40 years later that he had quoted the article from memory as closely as he could [20] [21]\n\n\nTerminology\nMembers of the Underground Railroad often used specific terms, based on the metaphor of the railway For example:\n\n\nPolitical background\nFor the fugitive slaves who \"rode\" the Underground Railroad, many of them considered Canada their final destination An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 of them settled in Canada, half of whom came between 1850 and 1860 Others settled in free states in the north [25] Thousands of court cases for fugitive slaves were recorded between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War [26] Under the original Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, officials from free states were required to assist slaveholders or their agents who recaptured fugitives, but some state legislatures prohibited this The law made it easier for slaveholders and slave catchers to capture African Americans and return them to slavery, and in some cases allowed them to enslave free blacks It also created an eagerness among abolitionists to help enslaved people, resulting in the growth of anti-slavery societies and the Underground Railroad [27]\n\n\nRoutes and methods of escape\nUnderground Railroad routes went north to free states and Canada, to the Caribbean, to United States western territories, and to Indian territories Some fugitive slaves traveled south into Mexico for their freedom [35] [36] Many escaped by sea, including Ona Judge, who had been enslaved by President George Washington [37] Some historians view the waterways of the South as an important component for freedom seekers to escape as water sources were pathways to freedom In addition, historians of the Underground Railroad found 200,000 runaway slave advertisements in North American newspapers from the middle of the 1700s until the end of the American Civil War [38] Freedom seekers in Alabama hid on steamboats heading to Mobile, Alabama in hopes of blending in among the city's free Black community, and also hid on other steamboats leaving Alabama that were headed further northward into free territories and free states In 1852, a law was passed by the Alabama legislature to reduce the number of freedom seekers escaping on boats The law penalized slaveholders and captains of vessels if they allowed enslaved people on board without a pass Alabama freedom seekers also made canoes to escape [39] Freedom seekers escaped from their enslavers in Panama on boats heading for California by way of the Panama route Slaveholders used the Panama route to reach California In Panama slavery was illegal and Black Panamanians encouraged enslaved people from the United States to escape into the local city of Panama [40]\n\n\nNorth to free states and Canada\nDespite the thoroughfare's name, the escape network was neither literally underground nor a railroad (The first literal underground railroad did not exist until 1863.)

geography of the U.S.–Canada border: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and most of New York were separated from Canada by water, over which transport was usually easy to arrange and relatively safe The main route for freedom seekers from the South led up the Appalachians, Harriet Tubman going via Harpers Ferry, through the highly anti-slavery Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio to the vast shore of Lake Erie, and then to Canada by boat A smaller number, traveling by way of New York or New England, went via Syracuse (home of Samuel May) and Rochester, New York (home of Frederick Douglass), crossing the Niagara River or Lake Ontario into Canada By 1848 the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge had been built—it crossed the Niagara River and connected New York to Canada Enslaved runaways used the bridge to escape their bondage, and Harriet Tubman used the bridge to take freedom seekers into Canada [58] [59] Those traveling via the New York Adirondacks, sometimes via Black communities like Timbuctoo, New York, entered Canada via Ogdensburg, on the St Lawrence River, or on Lake Champlain (Joshua Young assisted) The western route, used by John Brown among others, led from Missouri west to free Kansas and north to free Iowa, then east via Chicago to the Detroit River \n\n\nTraveling conditions\nAlthough the freedom seekers sometimes traveled on boat or train, [70] they usually traveled on foot or by wagon, sometimes lying down, covered with hay or similar products, in groups of one to three escapees Some groups were considerably larger Abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey and his colleagues rented horses and wagons and often transported as many as 15 or 20 people at a time [71] Free and enslaved black men occupied as mariners (sailors) helped enslaved people escape from slavery by providing a ride on their ship, providing information on the safest and best escape routes, and safe locations on land, and locations of trusted people for assistance Enslaved African-American mariners had information about slave revolts occurring in the Caribbean, and relayed this news to enslaved people they had contact with in American ports Free and enslaved African-American mariners assisted Harriet Tubman in her rescue missions Black mariners provided to her information about the best escape routes and helped her on her rescue missions In New Bedford, Massachusetts, freedom seekers stowed away on ships leaving the docks with the assistance of Black and white crewmembers and hid in the ships' cargoes during their journey to freedom [72]\n\n\nMaroons\nThe majority of freedom seekers that escaped from slavery did not have help from an abolitionist Although there are stories of black and white abolitionists helping freedom seekers escape from slavery, many escapes were unaided [79] [80] \nOther Underground Railroad escape routes for freedom seekers were maroon communities Maroon communities were hidden places, such as wetlands or marshes, where escaped slaves established their own independent communities Examples of maroon communities in the United States include the Black Seminole communities in Florida, as well as groups that lived in the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and in the Okefenokee swamp of Georgia and Florida, among others [81] [82] In the 1780s, Louisiana had a maroon community in the bayous of Saint Malo The leader of the Saint Malo maroon community was Jean Saint Malo, a freedom seeker who escaped to live among other runaways in the swamps and bayous of Saint Malo The population of maroons was fifty and the Spanish colonial government broke up the community and on June 19, 1784, Jean Saint Malo was executed [83] [84] Colonial South Carolina had a number of maroon settlements in its marshland regions in the Lowcountry and near rivers Maroons in South Carolina fought to maintain their freedom and prevent enslavement in Ashepoo in 1816, Williamsburg County in 1819, Georgetown in 1820, Jacksonborough in 1822, and near Marion in 1861 Historian Herbert Aptheker found evidence that fifty maroon communities existed in the United States between 1672 and 1864 [85] [86] The history of maroons showed how the enslaved resisted enslavement by living in free independent settlements Historical archeologist Dan Sayer says that historians downplay the importance of maroon settlements and place valor in white involvement in the Underground Railroad, which he argues shows a racial bias, indicating a \"...reluctance to acknowledge the strength of black resistance and initiative.\" [87]\n\n\nFreedom routes into Native American lands\nFrom colonial America into the 19th century, Indigenous peoples of North America assisted and protected enslaved Africans journey to freedom [88] [89] However, not all Indigenous communities were accepting of freedom seekers, some of whom they enslaved themselves or returned to their former enslavers [90] The earliest accounts of escape are from the 16th century In 1526, Spaniards established the first European colony in the continental United States in South Carolina called San Miguel de Gualdape The enslaved Africans revolted and historians suggest they escaped to Shakori Indigenous communities [91] [92] As early as 1689, enslaved Africans fled from the South Carolina Lowcountry to Spanish Florida seeking freedom [93] The Seminole Nation accepted Gullah runaways (today called Black Seminoles) into their lands [94] This was a southern route on the Underground Railroad into Seminole Indian lands that went from Georgia and the Carolinas into Florida In Northwest Ohio in the 18th and 19th centuries, three Indigenous/Native American nations, the Shawnee, Ottawa, and Wyandot assisted freedom seekers escape from slavery The Ottawa people accepted and protected runaways in their villages Other escapees were taken to Fort Malden by the Ottawa In Upper Sandusky, Wyandot people allowed a maroon community of freedom seekers in their lands called Negro Town for four decades [95]\n\n\nSouth to Florida and Mexico\nBeginning in the 16th century, Spaniards brought enslaved Africans to New Spain, including Mission Nombre de Dios in what would become the city of St Augustine in Spanish Florida Over time, free Afro-Spaniards took up various trades and occupations and served in the colonial militia [102] After King Charles II of Spain proclaimed Spanish Florida a safe haven for escaped slaves from British North America, they began escaping to Florida by the hundreds from as far north as New York The Spanish

more than a few hundred free blacks in Texas, which meant that free blacks did not feel safe in the state The network to freedom was informal, random, and dangerous [107]\n\n\nRoutes\nThousands of

rewards for the return of their \"property\" Slave catchers traveled through Mexico There were Black Seminoles, or Los Mascogos who lived in northern Mexico who provided armed resistance [110]\n\n\nRio Grande stations\nTwo families, the Webbers and the Jacksons, lived along the Rio Grande and helped people escape slavery The husbands were white and the wives were black women who had been formerly enslaved [110] It is not known if Nathaniel Jackson purchased the freedom of Matilda Hicks and her family, but in the early 1860s they moved to Hidalgo county, where they settled and lived as a family He was a white southerner and she was an enslaved woman, who had been childhood sweethearts in Alabama [110] He was the son of her slaveholder, [105] who helped a group of seven families in 1857 and others cross into Mexico [107]\n\n\nArrival in Mexico\nFugitive slaves who made it to Mexico lived with the knowledge that they could be illegally kidnapped by slave catchers or blackbirders [107] Slave hunters who tried to kidnap former slaves from Mexico could be taken to court or shot [104]\n\n\nColonies\nThere were abolitionists from the north who petitioned the Mexican government to establish colonies for free and runaway blacks Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, lobbied for a colony to be established in what is now Texas during the early 1830s, but he was unable to do so when Texas legalized slavery when it separated from Mexico and became the Republic of Texas (1836) [105] Black Seminoles successfully petitioned for land and established a colony in 1852 The land is still owned by their descendants [105]\n\n\nScholarship\nThe Texas Runaway Slave Project, located in Nacogdoches at the Stephen F Austin State University, has researched runaway advertisements that appeared in 19,000 editions of newspapers from the mid-19th century [106]\n\n\n\"Reverse Underground Railroad\"\nFreedom seekers were not the only black people at risk from slave catchers With demand for slaves high in the Deep South as cotton was planted, strong, healthy blacks in their prime working and reproductive years were seen and treated as highly valuable commodities Both former slaves and free blacks were sometimes kidnapped and sold into slavery, as in the well-documented case of Solomon Northup, a New York-born free black who was kidnapped by Southern slavers while visiting Washington, DC \"Certificates of freedom\", also known as \"free papers\", were signed and notarized statements attesting to the free status of individual Blacks They could easily be destroyed or stolen, so they provided little protection.\n\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War routes (1775 to 1783)\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, enslaved people escaped from bondage and fled to British forces, Canada, Florida, and Native American lands The last Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, planned to weaken American colonists by issuing a proclamation in 1775 that gave freedom to the enslaved who escaped their American colonial masters and joined the British According to a PBS and National Park Service article this proclamation resulted in an estimated 100,000 freedom seekers escaping during the war American colonial officers received numerous requests for the return of escaped slaves In November of 1775, Dunmore started a military unit of 300 freedom seekers in North Carolina called \"the Ethiopian Regiment.\" In Virginia 800 freedom seekers joined the regiment [122] [123] American colonists tried to deter freedom seekers from joining the British by sending slave patrols to stop runaways, and published newspapers and editorials stating the British will not act on their promise of granting freedom to runaway slaves [124] Thousands of free and enslaved Black people fought with the British in hopes to gain their freedom were called Black Loyalists Black Loyalists who served with the British for one year received Certificates of Freedom and were taken to Caribbean British colonies to live as free people in the Bahamas and Jamaica, and others were taken north to Canada [125] Between 1783 and 1785, 3,000 enslaved and free Black Americans settled in the British colony of Nova Scotia, Canada [126] Other enslaved people ran away to join the Continental Army or Patriot militias Black Americans who fought in the Continental Army were called Black Patriots, and some did earn their freedom through their military service Some enslaved runaways took the war as an opportunity to escape using their enslaver's horse [127] [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nWar of 1812 routes\nDuring the War of 1812, 700 enslaved people in Maryland escaped from slavery [132] Before the war, freedom seekers escaped to the Michigan Territory by crossing the Detroit River Over the years the numbers of escaped African Americans grew in the territory Territorial governor William Hull offered Peter Denison, an enslaved man, \"a written license\" allowing him to form a militia company of free Blacks and escaped slaves The men were armed and trained but Hull disbanded the militia Some of the Black men in the militia escaped from slavery in British Canada In the 18th century, slavery was practiced in Canada, and by 1793 it was phased out, but some Black Canadians remained enslaved During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the route of freedom seekers went south beginning in British Canada to their final destination in free American territories in the Old Northwest By the War of 1812, slave laws in British Canada prohibited the continuation of slavery This changed the final destinations of freedom seekers in the United States to look north to Canada to obtain their freedom In the summer of 1812, Hull declared that enslaved runaways and free Blacks in the Michigan Territory were free citizens, and when war broke out with Britain Black citizens of Michigan were armed to fight against the British After his military service, Peter Denison and his family left Michigan and relocated north to Canada [133]\n\n\nBlack Refugees\nIn April of 1814, the British Army promised freedom to enslaved Black Americans who joined the British military or who choose freedom in British colonies In the Chesapeake Region of Virginia and Maryland and coastal areas of Georgia, about 4,000 enslaved Black Americans escaped from slavery Within the number of 4,000 freedom seekers who escaped, 2,000 sailed to Nova Scotia between September 1813 and August 1816 on naval vessels and private ships chartered by the British and were taken to Nova Scotia and News Brunswick, Canada and 400 freedom seekers were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean The Black people who settled in British Canada are known as Black refugees who escaped slavery in the United States and sided with the British during the War of 1812 [134]\n\n\nMerikens\nThe Merikins were formerly enslaved Black Americans that escaped slavery and joined the British military's all-Black unit of Colonial Marines during the War of 1812 When the war ended, they were taken to numerous British colonies to live as free people About 700 Colonial Marines were taken to Trinidad in the Caribbean Although slavery was legal in Trinidad, they were guaranteed protection under commander Robert Mitchell The formerly Black Americans called themselves Merikens, \"an abbreviated word for 'Americans'\" and started new lives in Trinidad in six Company Villages in the southern part of the island [135] The Trinidadian government provided the Merikens with food, rations, clothing, and tools needed to build their homes, and they grew their own food of corn, pumpkin, plantain, and rice [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nThe \"Saltwater Railroad\" freedom route\nFrom 1821 to 1861, freedom seekers escaped from the Southeastern slave states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida to the Bahamas on a secret route called the \"Saltwater Railroad.\" Prior to 1821, Florida was a Spanish colony called by historians, Spanish Florida, where enslaved runaways were declared free under Spanish laws However, by 1821 Florida was under the control of the United States Free Blacks in Florida feared they might be re-enslaved under American laws and hundreds of free people escaped to the Bahamas From 1821 to 1825, the Southern beaches of Florida provided a safe haven for freedom seekers looking to escape on boats that departed from Florida going to the island Other freedom seekers escaped by making their own canoes and boats and sailed to the Bahamas unaided [139] [140]\n\n\nFugitive Slave Act of 1850\nUnder the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, when suspected fugitives were seized and brought to a special magistrate known as a commissioner, they had no right to a jury trial and could not testify on their own behalf Between 1850 and 1860, 343 freedom seekers were taken before a commissioner and 332 were returned to slavery Commissioners received ten dollars when they ruled in favor of a slaveholder and received five dollars if they ruled in a slave's favor Technically, they were not accused of a crime The marshal or private slave-catcher needed only to swear an oath to acquire a writ of replevin for the return of property A fine of 1,000 dollars was charged to individuals who assisted a freedom seeker's escape [144]\n\n\nAmerican Civil War routes (1861 to 1865)\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army captured Southern towns in Beaufort, South Carolina, St Simons Island, Georgia, and other areas and setup encampments As a result, enslaved people on nearby plantations escaped from slavery and ran to Union lines for freedom and to sign up to fight in the Union Army American historian Eric Foner explains in his book, Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad, that: \"...the Civil War fundamentally transformed the opportunities available for slaves seeking freedom As soon as federal troops which in Maryland meant the very beginning of the war, slaves sought refuge with the Union...\" [54] Susie King Taylor was born enslaved in Liberty County, Georgia and escaped from slavery with her family to Union lines in St Catherine's Island, Georgia with the help of her uncle who put her on a federal gunboat plying the waters near Confederate-held Fort Pulaski In addition, thousands of enslaved Black Americans escaped slavery and fled to Union lines in the South Carolina Sea Islands [152] [153] In 1861, Jarvis Harvey escaped from slavery and sailed to Union lines at Fortress Monroe, Virginia [154] Robert Sutton was born enslaved in Alberti Plantation along Florida’s northeastern boundary with Georgia, and during the Civil War he escaped from slavery by making a canoe and sailed out to Port Royal, South Carolina where Black Americans were freed from slavey after the Battle of Port Royal and signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment [155] Prince Rivers escaped from slavery and found freedom in Union lines in Port Royal, South Carolina after his enslaver fled Beaufort upon arrival of the Union Navy and Army Rivers later signed up to fight in the 1st South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment [156] On May 12, 1862, Robert Smalls and sixteen enslaved people escaped from slavery during the Civil War on a Confederate ship and sailed it out the Charleston Harbor to a Union blockade in South Carolina [157]\n\n\nUnion Navy and Emancipation\nThe Secretary of the Navy during the Civil War was Gideon Welles and in September of 1861 Welles declared that enslaved and free African Americans could enlist at the lowest rating of \"Boy\" in the Union Navy Union vessels located in Southern ports received numbers of runaways who fled slavery by way of small boats to vessels docked in Union controlled territories Benjamin Gould recorded in his journal that by September 22, 1862, eight freedom seekers had arrived at the USS Cambridge and that 20 more runaways arrived two weeks later One of the escaped freedom seekers listed was William Gould, who later joined the Union (U.S.) Navy and fought against the Confederacy from 1862 to 1865 The Union vessel USS Harftford helped to liberate enslaved people while going up the Mississippi River Bartholomew Diggins, who served aboard the vessel, recalled the events of liberating the enslaved He said: \"we picked  [up] many negroes  [sic] slaves who would come out to the ships in small boats at every place we anchored.\" Other Union vessels that helped to liberate the enslaved were the USS Essex and USS Iroquois A few Union soldiers and sailors returned escaped slaves back to their enslavers [168] [169] By the end of the war, 179,000 formerly enslaved and free Black Americans had fought in the Union Army, and 21,000 had fought in the Union Navy [170]\n\n\nLegal and political\nWhen frictions between North and South culminated in the Civil War, many Black people, both enslaved and free, fought for the Union Army [172] Following Union victory in the Civil War, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed slavery except as punishment for a crime [173] Following its passage, in some cases the Underground Railroad operated in the opposite direction, as people who had escaped to Canada returned to the United States [174]\n\n\nCriticism\nFrederick Douglass was a writer and orator who had escaped slavery He wrote critically of the attention drawn to the ostensibly secret Underground Railroad in his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845):\n\n\nArrival in Canada\nBritish North America (present-day Canada) was a desirable destination, as its long border gave many points of access, it was farther from slave catchers, and it was beyond the reach of the United States' Fugitive Slave Acts Further, slavery ended decades earlier in Canada than in the United States  Britain banned the institution of slavery in present-day Canada (and in most British colonies) in 1833, though the practice of slavery in Canada had effectively ended already early in the 19th century through case law, due to court decisions resulting from litigation on behalf of slaves seeking manumission [176]\n\n\nFolklore\nSince the 1980s, claims have arisen that quilt designs were used to signal and direct enslaved people to escape routes and assistance According to advocates of the quilt theory, ten quilt patterns were used to direct enslaved people to take particular actions The quilts were placed one at a time on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves The code had a dual meaning: first to signal enslaved people to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey [191]\n\n\nNotable people\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990 for the National Park Service to perform a special resource study of the Underground Railroad, [221] in 1997, the 105th Congress introduced and subsequently passed H.R 1635 – National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1998, which President Bill Clinton signed into law that year [222] This act authorized the United States National Park Service to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites, as well as preserve them and popularize the Underground Railroad and stories of people involved in it The National Park Service has designated many sites within the network, posted stories about people and places, sponsors an essay contest, and holds a national conference about the Underground Railroad in May or June each year [223]\n\n\nNational Underground Railroad Network\nFollowing upon legislation passed in 1990 for the National Park Service to

Railroad Month\nThe month of September was designated International Underground Railroad Month, because September was the month Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery [226] [227]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nUnderground Railroad was a company created by Tupac Shakur, Big D the Impossible, Shock G, Pee Wee, Jeremy, Raw Fusion and Live Squad with the purpose of promoting and

when the baby woke up and cried, Tubman was whipped She later recounted a particular day when she was lashed five times before breakfast She carried the scars for the rest of her life [23] She found ways to resist, such as running away for five days, [24] wearing layers of clothing as protection against beatings, and fighting back [25]\n\n\nFamily and marriage\nAnthony Thompson promised to manumit Tubman's father at age 45 After Thompson died, his son followed through with that promise in 1840 Tubman's father continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family [39] Later in the 1840s, Tubman paid a white attorney five dollars (equivalent to $160 in 2023) to investigate the legal status of her mother, Rit The lawyer discovered that Atthow Pattison, the grandfather of Mary Brodess, indicated in his will that Rit and any of her children would be manumitted at age 45, and that any children born after she reached age 45 would be freeborn The Pattison and Brodess families ignored this stipulation when they inherited the enslaved family, but taking legal action to enforce it was an impossible task for Tubman [40] [41]\n\n\nEscape from slavery\nIn 1849, Tubman became ill again, which diminished her value to slave traders Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer [46] Angry at him for trying to sell her and for continuing to enslave her relatives, Tubman began to pray for God to make Brodess change his ways [47] She said later: \"I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me.\" When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, Tubman changed her prayer: \"First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way'.\" [48] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments [49]\n\n\nNicknamed \"Moses\"\nAfter reaching Philadelphia, Tubman thought of her family \"I was a stranger in a strange land,\" she said later \" [M]y father, my mother, my brothers, and sisters, and friends were  [in Maryland] But I was free, and they should be free.\" [67] While Tubman saved money from working odd jobs in Philadelphia and Cape May, New Jersey, [68] the U.S Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which forced law enforcement officials to assist in the capture of escaped slaves – even in states that had outlawed slavery – and heavily punished abetting escape [69] The law increased risks for those who had escaped slavery, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario, where slavery had been abolished [70] [a] Racial tensions were also increasing in Philadelphia as poor Irish immigrants competed with free blacks for work [71]\n\n\nRoutes and methods\nTubman's dangerous work required ingenuity She usually worked during winter, when long nights and cold weather minimized the chance of being seen [79] She would start the escapes on Saturday evenings, since newspapers would not print runaway notices until Monday morning [82] She used subterfuges to avoid detection Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former enslaver, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact [83] Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as a former enslaver; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read Tubman was known to be illiterate, and the man ignored her [84]\n\n\nJohn Brown and Harpers Ferry\nIn April 1858, Tubman was introduced to the abolitionist John Brown, an insurgent who advocated the use of violence to destroy slavery in the United States [97] Although she was not previously involved in armed insurrection, she agreed with his course of direct action and supported his goals [98] Like Tubman, he spoke of being called by God, and trusted the divine to protect him from the wrath of slavers She, meanwhile, claimed to have had a prophetic vision of meeting Brown before their encounter [99]\n\n\nAuburn and Margaret\nIn early 1859, Frances Adeline Seward, the wife of abolitionist Republican U.S Senator William H Seward, sold Tubman a seven-acre (2.8 ha) farm in Fleming, New York, [111] [112] for $1,200 (equivalent to $43,900 in 2023 [45]) [113] [c] The adjacent city of Auburn was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman took the opportunity to move her parents from Canada back to the U.S [118] Her farmstead became a haven for Tubman's family and friends For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north [76]\n\n\nAmerican Civil War\nWhen the Civil War broke out in 1861, Tubman had a vision that the war would soon lead to the abolition of slavery [129] More immediately, enslaved people near Union positions began escaping in large numbers General Benjamin Butler declared these escapees to be \"contraband\" – property seized by northern forces – and put them to work, initially without pay, at Fort Monroe in Virginia [130] [131] The number of \"contrabands\" encamped at Fort Monroe and other Union positions rapidly increased [132] [133] In January 1862, Tubman volunteered to support the Union cause and began helping refugees in the camps, particularly in Port Royal, South Carolina [134]\n\n\nScouting and the Combahee River Raid\nWhen Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Tubman considered it a positive but incomplete step toward the goal of liberating all black people from slavery She turned her own efforts towards more direct actions to defeat the Confederacy [138] [139] In early 1863, Tubman used her knowledge of covert travel and subterfuge to lead a band of scouts through the land around Port Royal [140] Her group, working under the orders of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, mapped the unfamiliar terrain and reconnoitered its inhabitants She later worked alongside Colonel James Montgomery and provided him with intelligence that aided in the temporary capture of Jacksonville, Florida in March 1863 [141]\n\n\nLater life\nTubman had received little pay for her Union military service She was not a regular soldier and was only occasionally compensated for her work as a spy and scout; her work as a nurse was entirely unpaid [157] [158] For over three years of service, she received a total of $200 (equivalent to $3,980 in 2023 [45]) [159] [160] Her unofficial status caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S government was slow to recognize any debt to her [161] Meanwhile, her humanitarian work for her family and the formerly enslaved kept her in a state of constant poverty [162]\n\n\nSuffragist activism\nIn her later years, Tubman worked to promote the cause of women's suffrage A white woman once asked Tubman whether she believed women ought to have the vote, and received the reply: \"I suffered enough to believe it.\" [189] Tubman began attending meetings of suffragist organizations, and was soon working alongside women such as Susan B Anthony and Emily Howland [5] [190]\n\n\nChurch, illness, and death\nIn the 1870s, Tubman became active in the Thompson Memorial African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion Church in Auburn [195] In 1895, she began discussions with AME Zion leaders and others to create a Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged that would care for \"indigent colored people\" [196] Despite her financial limitations, in 1896 Tubman bid $1215 (equivalent to $44,500 in 2023 [45]) at auction for a 25-acre (10 ha) farm adjacent to the one she already owned, to use for the new facility [197] She designated one of the farm's buildings as its primary residence and named it \"John Brown Hall\" to honor her late abolitionist ally [198] However, raising funds for the project was difficult, and attempts to donate the property were complicated by the multiple mortgage loans used to pay for it After Tubman almost lost the property because of her financial difficulties, AME Zion agreed to take it over in 1903 [199]\n\n\nLegacy\nWidely known and well-respected while she was alive, Tubman became an American icon in the years after she died [209] By the 1980s, Tubman had become one of American history's most famous figures [210] She inspired generations of African Americans struggling for equality and civil rights; she was praised by leaders across the political spectrum [211]\n\n\nParks, monuments, and historical sites\nNational parks and national monuments related to Tubman in the United States are the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park, both in Maryland, [212] and the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn [213] The Salem Chapel in St. Catharines, where Tubman worshipped, is a National Historic Site of Canada [214]\n\n\nArtistic portrayals\nTubman is the subject of many works of art Musicians including Woody Guthrie, Wynton Marsalis, and Walter Robinson have written songs celebrating her [220] She is the subject of operas by Thea Musgrave, [221] Nkeiru Okoye, [222] and Hilda Paredes, [223] as well as plays by Carolyn Gage and a collaboration of May Miller and Willis Richardson [224] Tubman is the focus of novels by Elizabeth Cobbs, [225] Marcy Heidish, [226] and Anne Parrish, [227] and is a character in novels by Terry Bisson, [228] Ta-Nehisi Coates, [229] and James McBride [230]\n\n\nOther honors and commemorations\nIn 1978, Tubman became the first African-American woman honored on a U.S postage stamp; she appeared on a second stamp in 1995 [240] Beginning in 2016, there have been plans to add a portrait of Tubman to the front of the twenty-dollar bill, moving the portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a slaveholder, to the back of the bill [241] In 2024, the United States Mint issued three commemorative coins featuring Tubman; each coin depicts Tubman at a different stage of her life [242]\n\n\nHistoriography\nTubman hoped to become literate and write her own memoirs, but she never did [247] Instead, Sarah Hopkins Bradford combined Tubman's personal recollections, journalistic accounts, and letters from Tubman's friends and supporters to create Scenes from the Life of Harriet Tubman in 1868 [248] [f] Criticized by modern biographers for its artistic license and highly subjective point of view, [250] the book nevertheless provides insight into Tubman's own view of her experiences [251] In 1886, Bradford released a re-written volume called Harriet, the Moses of her People [252] In both volumes Harriet Tubman is hailed as a latter-day Joan of Arc [253] The revision took a more moralistic and literary tone than the prior work, including changes of many event descriptions from first to third person [254] A final revision in 1901 added an appendix with more stories about Tubman's life [255]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Harriet Tubman**\n\nHarriet Tubman (c. 1822 – March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist, humanitarian, and suffragist who escaped from slavery and helped hundreds of others do the same. Born Araminta \"Minty\" Ross, she became known as \"Moses\" for her bravery and determination in leading others to freedom. Throughout her life, Tubman worked tirelessly to end slavery and fight for women's rights, earning her a place as one of the most iconic figures in American history.\n\n**Birth and Family**\n\nTubman was born Araminta \"Minty\" Ross to enslaved parents, Harriet (\"Rit\") Green and Ben Ross.

She is a central antagonist in the game and has become a memorable and iconic character in the Resident Evil series.\n\n## Concept and Creation\n\nLady Dimitrescu was created by Capcom as a charismatic femme fatale character. She was designed as a vampire-like character, drawing inspiration from various sources. Her character design was influenced by the 16th century Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory, a figure known for her alleged cruelty and bloodthirst. Additionally, her design was inspired by the Japanese urban legend and internet ghost story of Hasshaku-sama, also known as Hachishaku-sama. The character's portrayal was also influenced by Anjelica Huston's performance as Morticia Addams in the TV series The Addams Family. Dimitrescu's characterization also references Ramon Salazar, a diminutive villain from Resident Evil 4, who was a memorable antagonist in the series.\n\n## Appearances\n\nLady Dimitrescu was born into the noble Dimitrescu family sometime before World War I. Her family claimed to have originated from Cesare, one of the four founders of an isolated mountain village in Europe. However, it is unclear whether this is accurate or if it is a fabricated history. In the aftermath of World War II and the abolition of the nobility, Dimitrescu returned to her family's former lands, which had fallen under the control of a neopagan cult worshipping the Black God. Before meeting Miranda, Dimitrescu suffered from a hereditary blood disease. To test if she was compatible with Miranda's plans to revive her daughter, Dimitrescu was infected with the Cadou parasite. As a result, she was bestowed with profound regenerative capabilities and eternal life. However, her pre-existing blood disease required her to ingest large quantities of human blood and flesh on a regular basis to maintain her condition. This led to her increasing size, and she eventually sired her \"daughters\", Daniela, Bela, and Cassandra.\n\n## Inhabiting the Estate\n\nUpon inhabiting the estate, Lady Dimitrescu took over her family's vineyard and wine-distribution business as a means of supporting herself. The Dimitrescu family was closely associated with the noble Beneviento, Moreau, and Heisenberg families, and maintained an alliance with them in controlling the region. This control allowed Dimitrescu's family to rule her castle with barbarous cruelty, regularly taking in new staff to replace those who were taken to the dungeon to be killed. Their blood was then used to create an enriched red wine.\n\n## Promotion and Reception\n\nTo promote Resident Evil Village, Capcom distributed life-size standees of Lady Dimitrescu in video game stores. In Hong Kong, promotional material featuring the character was displayed on public transportation in early 2021. Notable merchandise featuring the character include life-sized towels, which were offered as prizes for Japanese participants in a competition held on Twitter. Cosplayer Yaya Han uploaded a video sponsored by Capcom on her YouTube channel, which documents the process behind her cosplay activities as the character in April 2021.\n\n## Merchandise and Appearances\n\nA puppet show miniseries featuring Dimitrescu alongside her peers was released on Capcom's official YouTube channel for the series on April 30, 2021. A three-foot-tall statue of Lady Dimitrescu made by PureArts in collaboration with Capcom was released in the second quarter of 2023. Her likeness has been co-opted by third-party brands, such as Domino's Pizza Malaysia, to promote their products. In 2023, Capcom released car signs and car sign stickers depicting her. A US$1649, 26-inch deluxe Lady Dimitrescu Figure has also been made.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLady Dimitrescu is a memorable and iconic character in the Resident Evil series. Her design and characterization were influenced by various sources, including Elizabeth Báthory and Morticia Addams. Her appearances in the game and in promotional materials have made her a popular character among fans. The merchandise released featuring Dimitrescu has been a significant part of the game's marketing and promotion.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lady_Dimitrescu\" following this outline:\n\n\nConcept and creation\nCreated by Capcom for the 2021 video game Resident Evil Village, Lady Dimitrescu was born from the desire to create a charismatic femme fatale character [6] She was designed as a vampire-like character [7] [8] Her character design was inspired by the 16th century Hungarian noblewoman Elizabeth Báthory, the Japanese urban legend and internet ghost story of Hasshaku-sama (or Hachishaku-sama), and Anjelica Huston's portrayal of the character Morticia Addams from The Addams Family [9] [10] Aspects of Dimitrescu's characterization also references Ramon Salazar from Resident Evil 4, a diminutive villain said to have resonated with many players as a memorable antagonist [8] Dimitrescu has been incorrectly pronounced as Dimitreesk in English, with the final \"u\" letter being silent [11] This approach has been criticized by Romanian speakers who have said that the correct pronunciation is \"dimi-tres-ku\", as it is a Romanian name [12] [13]\n\n\nAppearances\nAlcina was born into the noble Dimitrescu family sometime before World War I Although her family traced their origins to Cesare, one of the four founders of an isolated mountain village in Europe, Alcina lived elsewhere, perhaps through a cadet branch In the aftermath of World War II and the abolition of the nobility, Dimitrescu returned to her family's former lands, which had fallen under the control of a neopagan cult worshipping the Black God Dimitrescu suffered a hereditary blood disease prior to meeting Miranda who infected her with the Cadou parasite to see if she was compatible for her plans to revive her daughter Although bestowed with profound regenerative capabilities and eternal life, Alcina's preexisting blood disease required her to ingest large quantities of human blood and flesh on a regular basis to maintain her condition, increasing her size while siring her \"daughters\" Daniela, Bela and Cassandra Upon inhabiting the estate, she took over her family's vineyard and wine-distribution business as a means of supporting herself The Dimitrescu family was closely associated with the noble Beneviento, Moreau, and Heisenberg families, and maintained an alliance with them in controlling the region This control allowed Dimitrescu's family to rule her castle with barbarous cruelty, regularly taking in new staff to replace those who were taken to the dungeon to be killed with their blood used to create an enriched red wine [6]\n\n\nPromotion and reception\nTo promote Resident Evil Village, Capcom distributed life-size standees of Lady Dimitrescu in video game stores [30] In Hong Kong, promotional material featuring the character was displayed on public transportation in early 2021 [31] Notable merchandise which feature the character include life-sized towels which were offered as prizes for Japanese participants in a competition held on Twitter [32] Cosplayer Yaya Han uploaded a video sponsored by Capcom on her YouTube channel, which documents the process behind her cosplay activities as the character in April 2021 [33] [34] On April 30, 2021, a puppet show miniseries featuring Dimitrescu alongside her peers was released on Capcom's official YouTube channel for the series [35] A three foot tall statue of Lady Dimitrescu made by PureArts in collaboration with Capcom was released in second quarter 2023 [36] Her likeness has been co-opted by third party brands such as Domino's Pizza Malaysia to promote their products [37] In 2023, Capcom released car signs and car sign stickers depicting her [38] A US$1649, 26-inch deluxe Lady Dimitrescu Figure has also been made [39]\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is the daughter of Trevor Poots, a current affairs television producer from Belfast, and Fiona Goodall, a journalist and voluntary worker from Bolton. Poots has an older brother.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nImogen Gay Poots was born in June 1989 at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the daughter of Trevor Poots, a current affairs television producer from Belfast, and Fiona Goodall, a journalist and voluntary worker from Bolton. Her father is of Northern Irish descent, and her mother is of English and Scottish ancestry. Poots has an older brother, who has kept a relatively low public profile.\n\nGrowing up in London, Poots was raised in a culturally diverse environment, which would later influence her acting choices and style. She was raised in a household that valued the arts, with both her parents having a background in media and journalism. Her mother worked as a journalist and voluntary worker, while her father produced current affairs television programs. This exposure to the media industry from a young age likely played a role in Poots's decision to pursue a career in acting.\n\nDespite not having any formal training as an actress, Poots has spoken about the importance of her family's support in her early acting endeavors. Her parents encouraged her to take on small roles and projects, which helped her develop her acting skills through a practical apprenticeship. This hands-on approach to learning would later serve her well in her career, as she has spoken about the importance of being able to adapt to different roles and environments.\n\nCareer\n\nPoots's early acting career began with small roles in television shows and films. Her first appearance on-screen was in a 2004 episode of the BBC drama series Casualty, where she had a non-speaking role. She then appeared in the 2006 film V for Vendetta, where she had a minor, non-speaking role. Despite these early appearances, Poots was largely unknown when she landed the role of Tammy in the 2007 horror film 28 Weeks Later, directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. She was just 17 years old at the time, and the film marked a significant turning point in her career.\n\nThe success of 28 Weeks Later led to a string of roles in films such as Cracks (2009) and Centurion (2010). Poots's performance in Centurion earned her critical acclaim, with many praising her ability to play complex and nuanced characters. Her portrayal of Falfa in the 2011 remake of Fright Night, opposite Anton Yelchin, further solidified her status as a rising star in the film industry.\n\nPoots's ability to adapt to different roles and genres has been a key factor in her success. She has spoken about the importance of being able to tap into her own experiences and emotions in order to bring depth and authenticity to her performances. This approach has served her well in a range of films, from horror to drama to comedy.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2014, Poots became engaged to actor James Norton. The couple had been dating for several years and had a strong on-screen chemistry. However, in 2020, it was reported that the couple had ended their relationship after six years together. Despite the end of their engagement, Poots has spoken highly of Norton, praising his talent and dedication to his craft.\n\nFilmography\n\n### Film\n\n* Casualty (2004)\n* V for Vendetta (2006)\n* 28 Weeks Later (2007)\n* Cracks (2009)\n* Centurion (2010)\n* Fright Night (2011)\n* Need for Speed (2014)\n* Frank & Lola (2016)\n* Journey's End (2017)\n* The Lodge (2019)\n* The Souvenir Part II (2021)\n\n### Television\n\n* Casualty (2004)\n* The Village (2013)\n* A Long Way Down (2014)\n* Harlots (2017)\n* The Sky at Night (2019)\n\n### Stage\n\n* Split (2007)\n* The Village (2013)\n* A Midsummer Night's Dream (2016)\n\nAwards and nominations\nPoots has been nominated for several awards throughout her career, including the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Centurion.

It is a symbol of the monarch's authority and presence, and is used in various contexts throughout the United Kingdom and its territories.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Royal Standard has a long history, dating back to the 13th century. Over the years, the design of the flag has undergone several changes, reflecting the evolution of the British monarchy and the country's territorial expansion. Today, the Royal Standard is a distinctive and recognizable symbol of the British monarch, and is used in a range of settings, from official ceremonies to everyday life.\n\n**United Kingdom (outside Scotland), the Crown dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories**\n\nIn England, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Crown dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories, the Royal Standard has a distinctive design. The flag is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different part of the United Kingdom. The first and fourth quadrants represent the ancient Kingdom of England, and contain three gold lions passant guardant on a red field. The second quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Scotland, and contains a red lion rampant on a gold field. The third quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Ireland, and contains a version of the gold harp from the coat of arms of Ireland on a blue field. The inclusion of the harp remains an issue for some in Ireland, as it was not widely used as a symbol of Ireland until the 20th century.\n\nThe design of the Royal Standard in the United Kingdom outside Scotland was first used in 1603, when James VI of Scotland became James I of England. The flag has undergone several changes since then, but the basic design has remained the same. In 1937, Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, asked Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald if the harp quarter could be removed from the Royal Standard, on the grounds that the Irish people had not given their consent to the Irish emblem being included. The request was denied, and the harp remains an integral part of the Royal Standard.\n\n**Scotland**\n\nIn Scotland, a separate version of the Royal Standard is used, which is different from the version used in the rest of the United Kingdom. The red Lion Rampant of the Kingdom of Scotland appears in the first and fourth quadrants, displacing the three gold lions passant guardant of England, which occur only in the second quadrant. The third quadrant, displaying the gold harp of Ireland, remains unaltered from that version used throughout the remainder of the United Kingdom and overseas. This version of the Royal Standard was first used in 1603, when James VI of Scotland became James I of England.\n\n**Heir to the Throne**\n\nThe direct heir to the Throne has several distinct standards and banners for use throughout the United Kingdom in representation of this position. William, Prince of Wales, has five standards at use for his various roles and titles. These standards are used on official occasions, and are a symbol of the heir's status as the future monarch.\n\n**Other members of the royal family**\n\nOther members of the royal family have personal standards of their own, which are variants of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. These standards are defaced with a white label and either three points or pendants (for children of a sovereign), or five points (grandchildren of a sovereign). Traditionally, all princes and princesses of royal blood (i.e., descendants of the sovereign) are granted arms on their 18th birthday, thus giving them a banner to fly from their residences.\n\n**Consorts of the British monarch**\n\nQueens consort of the British monarch are granted arms based on the Royal Standard and their own personal arms from before their marriage, or the arms of their family.

the second quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Scotland and contains a red lion rampant on a gold field; the third quadrant represents the ancient Kingdom of Ireland and contains a version of the gold harp from the coat of arms of Ireland on a blue field The inclusion of the harp remains an issue for some in Ireland In 1937 Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, asked Dominions Secretary Malcolm MacDonald if the harp quarter could be removed from the Royal Standard on the grounds that the Irish people had not given their consent to the Irish emblem being included The request was denied, and the harp remains [3]\n\n\nScotland\nIn Scotland a separate version of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is used, whereby the red Lion Rampant of the Kingdom of Scotland appears in the first and fourth quadrants, displacing the three gold lions passant guardant of England, which occur only in the second quadrant The third quadrant, displaying the gold harp of Ireland, remains unaltered from that version used throughout the remainder of the United Kingdom and overseas.\n\n\nHeir to the Throne\nThe direct heir to the Throne has several distinct standards and banners for use throughout the United Kingdom in representation of this position William, Prince of Wales has five standards at use for his various roles and titles.\n\n\nOther members of the royal family\nOther members of the royal family have personal standards of their own These are variants of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom (including that which is used in Scotland), defaced with a white label and either three points or pendants (for children of a sovereign), or five points (grandchildren of a sovereign) Traditionally all princes and princesses of royal blood (i.e., descendants of the sovereign) are granted arms on their 18th birthday, thus giving them a banner to fly from their residences.\n\n\nConsorts of the British monarch\nQueens consort of the British monarch are granted arms based on the Royal Standard and their own personal arms from before their marriage, or the arms of their family In Scotland, a queen consort will use the Scottish version of the Royal Standard They do not have different standards for the Commonwealth realms that have their own Royal Standards.\n\n\nRecent historical royal standards\nOther members of the royal family may use the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, but within an ermine border (a white border with black \"tails\" representing the ermine fur) This standard is mainly used for the wives of British princes, or members of the royal family who have not yet been granted their own arms Diana, Princess of Wales, and, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, had this standard draped over their coffins at their funerals [14] [15]\n\n\nRoyal standards 1198–1837\nOther members of the royal family may use the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, but within an ermine border (a white border with black \"tails\" representing the ermine fur) This standard is mainly used for the wives of British princes, or members of the royal family who have not yet been granted their own arms Diana, Princess of Wales, and, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, had this standard draped over their coffins at their funerals [14] [15]\n\n\nOthers\nOther members of the royal family may use the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, but within an ermine border (a white border with black \"tails\" representing the ermine fur) This standard is mainly used for the wives of British princes, or members of the royal family who have not yet been granted their own arms Diana, Princess of Wales, and, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, had this standard draped over their coffins at their funerals [14] [15]\n\n\nUses of Standards\nThe Royal Standard is reserved only for the monarch, and is the most used Most famously it signals the presence of the monarch at a royal residence, and is also used on official vehicles, primarily the Bentley State Limousine, but also on other road vehicles at home or abroad, often a Range Rover The Royal Standard is also flown from aircraft and water vessels, including HMY Britannia and MV Spirit of Chartwell [18] during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant When the monarch is aboard a British naval ship, the flag is flown from the main mast of the ship and is lowered upon his/her departure [19] The flag is also draped over the coffin of the Monarch upon his/her death.\n\n\nPosition of Honour\nAccording to the Flag Institute, the order of precedence of flags in the United Kingdom is: the Royal Standard, Union Flag, the flag of the host country (England, Scotland and Wales etc.), the flags of other nations (in alphabetical order), the Commonwealth Flag, the Flag of Europe, the county flags, the flags of cities or towns, the banners of arms, and the house flags [34]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Three Kingdoms\nIn August 1642, long running political disputes between Charles I and his opponents in Parliament led to the First English Civil War James and his brother Charles were present at the Battle of Edgehill in October, and narrowly escaped capture by Parliamentarian cavalry [13] He spent most of the next four years in the Royalist wartime capital of Oxford, [13] [14] where he was made a Master of Arts by the University on 1 November 1642 and served as colonel of a volunteer regiment of foot [15] Following the surrender of Oxford in June 1646, James was taken to London and held with his younger siblings Henry, Elizabeth and Henrietta in St James's Palace [16]\n\n\nExile in France\nJames, like his brother, sought refuge in France, serving in the French army under Turenne against the Fronde, and later against their Spanish allies [20] In the French army James had his first true experience of battle, in which, according to one observer, he \"ventures himself and chargeth gallantly where anything is to be done\" [20] Turenne's favour led to James being given command of a captured Irish regiment in December 1652, then appointed Lieutenant-General in 1654 [21]\n\n\nRestoration\nAfter the collapse of the Commonwealth in 1660, Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland Although James was the heir presumptive, it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the Crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children [25] On 31 December 1660, following his brother's restoration, James was created Duke of Albany in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York [26] Upon his return to England, James prompted an immediate controversy by announcing his engagement to Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles's chief minister, Edward Hyde [27]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nAfter the collapse of the Commonwealth in 1660, Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland Although James was the heir presumptive, it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the Crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children [25] On 31 December 1660, following his brother's restoration, James was created Duke of Albany in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York [26] Upon his return to England, James prompted an immediate controversy by announcing his engagement to Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles's chief minister, Edward Hyde [27]\n\n\nMilitary and political offices and royal slavery\n\n\n\nConversion to Roman Catholicism and second marriage\nJames's time in France had exposed him to the beliefs and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, and both he and his wife Anne became drawn to that faith [43] [c] James took Catholic Eucharist in 1668 or 1669, although his conversion was kept secret for almost a decade as he continued to attend Anglican services until 1676 [45] In spite of his conversion, James continued to associate primarily with Anglicans, including John Churchill and George Legge, as well as French Protestants such as Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham [46]\n\n\nExclusion Crisis\nIn 1677, King Charles II arranged for James's daughter Mary to marry the Protestant Prince William III of Orange, son of Charles's and James's sister Mary James reluctantly acquiesced after his brother and nephew had agreed to the marriage [55] [d] Despite the Protestant marriage, fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife, Catherine of Braganza, to produce any children A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne [57] The fabricated plot caused a wave of anti-Catholic hysteria to sweep across the nation.\n\n\nReturn to favour\nIn 1683, a plot was uncovered to assassinate Charles II and his brother and spark a republican revolution to re-establish a government of the Cromwellian style [69] The conspiracy, known as the Rye House Plot, backfired upon its conspirators and provoked a wave of sympathy for the King and James [70] Several notable Whigs, including the Earl of Essex and the Duke of Monmouth, were implicated [69] Monmouth initially confessed to complicity in the plot and implicated fellow conspirators, but later recanted [69] Essex committed suicide, and Monmouth, along with several others, was obliged to flee into exile in continental Europe [71] Charles II reacted to the plot by increasing the repression of Whigs and dissenters [69] Taking advantage of James's rebounding popularity, Charles invited him back onto the Privy Council in 1684 [72] While some in the English Parliament remained wary of the possibility of a Roman Catholic king, the threat of excluding James from the throne had passed.\n\n\nReign\nCharles II died on 6 February 1685 from apoplexy, after supposedly converting to Catholicism on his deathbed [73] Having no legitimate children, he was succeeded by his brother James, who reigned in England and Ireland as James II and in Scotland as James VII There was little initial opposition to James's accession, and there were widespread reports of public rejoicing at the orderly succession [74] He wished to proceed quickly to the coronation, and he and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 [75]\n\n\nAccession to the throne\nCharles II died on 6 February 1685 from apoplexy, after supposedly converting to Catholicism on his deathbed [73] Having no legitimate

widespread reports of public rejoicing at the orderly succession [74] He wished to proceed quickly to the coronation, and he and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 [75]\n\n\nTwo rebellions\nSoon after becoming king, James faced a rebellion in southern England led by his nephew, the Duke of Monmouth, and another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll [79] Monmouth and Argyll both began their expeditions from Holland, where James's nephew and son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, had neglected to detain them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts [80]\n\n\nReligious liberty and dispensing power\nTo protect himself from further rebellions, James sought safety by enlarging his standing army [88] This alarmed his subjects, not only because of the trouble soldiers caused in the towns, but because it was against the English tradition to keep a professional army in peacetime [89] Even more alarming to Parliament was James's use of his dispensing power to allow Roman Catholics to command several regiments without having to take the oath mandated by the Test Act [88] When even the previously supportive Parliament objected to these measures, James ordered Parliament prorogued in November 1685, never to meet again in his reign [90] At the beginning of 1686, two papers were found in Charles II's strong box and his closet, in his own hand, stating the arguments for Catholicism over Protestantism James published these papers with a declaration signed by his sign manual and challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury and the whole Anglican episcopal bench to refute Charles's arguments: \"Let me have a solid answer, and in a gentlemanlike style; and it may have the effect which you so much desire of bringing me over to your church.\" The Archbishop refused on the grounds of respect for the late king [91]\n\n\nDeposition and the Glorious Revolution\nIn April 1688, James re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, subsequently ordering Anglican clergy to read it in their churches [118] When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel [119] Public alarm increased when Queen Mary gave birth to a Roman Catholic son and heir, James Francis Edward, on 10 June that year [120] When James's only possible successors were his two Protestant daughters, Anglicans could see his pro-Catholic policies as a temporary phenomenon, but when the prince's birth opened the possibility of a permanent Roman Catholic dynasty, such men had to reconsider their position [121] Threatened by a Roman Catholic dynasty, several influential Protestants claimed the child was supposititious and had been smuggled into the Queen's bedchamber in a warming pan [122] They had already entered into negotiations with the Prince of Orange when it became known the Queen was pregnant, and the birth of a son reinforced their convictions [123]\n\n\nAttempt to regain the throne\nWith the assistance of French troops, James landed in Ireland in March 1689 [135] The Irish Parliament did not follow the example of the English Parliament; it declared that James remained King and passed a massive bill of attainder against those who had rebelled against him [136] At James's urging, the Irish Parliament passed an Act for Liberty of Conscience that granted religious freedom to all Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland [137] James worked to build an army in Ireland, but was ultimately defeated at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 O.S when William arrived, personally leading an army to defeat James and reassert English control [138] James fled to France once more, departing from Kinsale, never to return to any of his former kingdoms [138] Because he deserted his Irish supporters, James became known in Ireland as Séamus an Chaca or \"James the shit\" [139] Despite this popular perception, later historian Breandán Ó Buachalla argues that \"Irish political poetry for most of the eighteenth century is essentially Jacobite poetry\", [140] and both Ó Buachalla and fellow-historian Éamonn Ó Ciardha argue that James and his successors played a central role as messianic figures throughout the 18th century for all classes in Ireland [141]\n\n\nWar in Ireland\nWith the assistance of French troops, James landed in Ireland in March 1689 [135] The Irish Parliament did not follow the example of the English Parliament; it declared that James remained

played a central role as messianic figures throughout the 18th century for all classes in Ireland [141]\n\n\nReturn to exile, death and legacy\nIn France, James was allowed to live in the royal château of Saint-Germain-en-Laye [142] James's wife and some of his supporters fled with him, including the Earl of Melfort; most, but not all, were Roman Catholic [143] In 1692, James's last child, Louisa Maria Teresa, was born [144] Some supporters in England attempted to assassinate William III to restore James to the throne in 1696, but the plot failed and the backlash made James's cause less popular [145] In the same year, Louis XIV offered to have James elected King of Poland James rejected the offer, fearing that accepting the Polish crown might (in the minds of the English people) disqualify him from being King of England After Louis concluded peace with William in 1697, he ceased to offer much assistance to James [146]\n\n\nLater Hanover succession\nJames's younger daughter Anne succeeded when William died in 1702 The Act of Settlement provided that, if the line of succession established in the Bill of Rights were extinguished, the crown would go to a German cousin, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and to her Protestant heirs [153] Sophia was a granddaughter of James VI and I through his eldest daughter, Elizabeth Stuart, the sister of Charles I Thus, when Anne died in 1714 (less than two months after the death of Sophia), she was succeeded by George I, Sophia's son, the Elector of Hanover and Anne's second cousin [153]\n\n\nSubsequent uprisings and pretenders\nJames's son James Francis Edward was recognised as king at his father's death by Louis XIV of France and James II's remaining supporters (later known as Jacobites) as \"James III and VIII\" [154] He led a rising in Scotland in 1715 shortly after George I's accession, but was defeated [155] His son Charles Edward Stuart led a Jacobite rising in 1745, but was again defeated [156] The risings were the last serious attempts to restore the Stuart dynasty.\n\n\nHistoriography\nHistorical analysis of James II has been somewhat revised since Whig historians, led by Lord Macaulay, cast James as a cruel absolutist and his reign as \"tyranny which approached to insanity\" [159] Subsequent scholars, such as G M Trevelyan (Macaulay's great-nephew) and David Ogg, while more balanced than Macaulay, still characterised James as a tyrant, his attempts at religious tolerance as a fraud, and his reign as an aberration in the course of British history [160] In 1892, A W Ward wrote for the Dictionary of National Biography that James was \"obviously a political and religious bigot\", although never devoid of \"a vein of patriotic sentiment\"; \"his conversion to the church of Rome made the emancipation of his fellow-catholics in the first instance, and the recovery of England for catholicism in the second, the governing objects of his policy.\" [161]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nThe official style of James in England was \"James the Second, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" The claim to France was only nominal, and was asserted by every English king from Edward III to George III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled In Scotland, he was \"James the Seventh, by the Grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" [173]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nThe official style of James in England was \"James the Second, by the Grace of

[173]\n\n\nHonours\nPrior to his accession, James's coat of arms was the royal arms (which he later inherited), differenced by a label of three points Ermine [176] His arms as king were: Quarterly, I

James fled to France once more, departing from Kinsale, never to return to any of his former kingdoms.\n\n**Return to Exile, Death, and Legacy**\n\nIn France, James was allowed to live in the royal chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. James's wife and some of his supporters fled with him, including the Earl of Melfort; most, but not all, were Roman Catholic. In 1692, James's last child, Louisa Maria Teresa, was born. Some supporters in England attempted to assassinate William III to restore James to the throne in 1696, but the plot failed and the backlash made James's cause less popular. In the same year, Louis XIV offered to have James elected King of Poland, but James rejected the offer, fearing that accepting the Polish crown might disqualify him from being King of England. After Louis concluded peace with William in 1697, he ceased to offer much assistance to James.\n\n**Later Hanover Succession**\n\nJames's younger daughter, Anne, succeeded when William died in 1702. The Act of Settlement provided that, if the line of succession established in the Bill of Rights were extinguished, the crown would go to a German cousin, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and to her Protestant heirs. Sophia was a granddaughter of James VI and I through his eldest daughter, Elizabeth Stuart, the sister of Charles I. Thus, when Anne died in 1714, less than two months after the death of Sophia, she was succeeded by George I, Sophia's son, the Elector of Hanover and Anne's second cousin.\n\n**Subsequent Uprisings and Pretenders**\n\nJames's son, James Francis Edward, was recognized as king at his father's death by Louis XIV of France and James II's remaining supporters, later known as Jacobites, as \"James III and VIII.\" He led a rising in Scotland in 1715 shortly after George I's accession, but was defeated. His son, Charles Edward Stuart, led a Jacobite rising in 1745, but was again defeated. The risings were the last serious attempts to restore the Stuart dynasty.\n\n**Historiography**\n\nHistorical analysis of James II has been somewhat revised since Whig historians, led by Lord Macaulay, cast James as a cruel absolutist and his reign as \"tyranny which approached to insanity.\" Subsequent scholars, such as G M Trevelyan (Macaulay's great-nephew) and David Ogg, while more balanced than Macaulay, still characterized James as a tyrant, his attempts at religious tolerance as a fraud, and his reign as an aberration in the course of British history. In 1892, A W Ward wrote for the Dictionary of National Biography that James was \"obviously a political and religious bigot,\" although never devoid of \"a vein of patriotic sentiment\"; \"his conversion to the church of Rome made the emancipation of his fellow-catholics in the first instance, and the recovery of England for catholicism in the second, the governing objects of his policy.\"\n\n**Titles, Styles, Honors, and Arms**\n\nThe official style of James in England was \"James the Second, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" The claim to France was only nominal, and was asserted by every English king from Edward III to George III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled. In Scotland, he was \"James the Seventh, by the Grace of God, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in

on 14 October 1633 [7] Later that same year, he was baptized by William Laud, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury [8] He was educated by private tutors, along with his older brother, the future King Charles II, and the two sons of the Duke of Buckingham, George and Francis Villiers [9] At the age of three, James was appointed Lord High Admiral; the position was initially honorary, but became a substantive office after the Restoration, when James was an adult [10] He was designated Duke of York at birth, [11] invested with the Order of the Garter in 1642, [12] and formally created Duke of York in January 1644 [8] [11]\n\n\nBirth\nJames, second surviving son of King Charles I and his wife, Henrietta Maria of France, was born at St James's Palace in London on 14 October 1633 [7] Later

[11]\n\n\nWars of the Three Kingdoms\nIn August 1642, long running political disputes between Charles I and his opponents in Parliament led to the First English Civil War James and his brother Charles were present at the Battle of Edgehill in October, and narrowly escaped capture by Parliamentarian cavalry [13] He spent most of the next four years in the Royalist wartime capital of Oxford, [13] [14] where he was made a Master of Arts by the University on 1 November 1642 and served as colonel of a volunteer regiment of foot [15] Following the surrender of Oxford in June 1646, James was taken to London and held with his younger siblings Henry, Elizabeth and Henrietta in St James's Palace [16]\n\n\nExile in France\nJames, like his brother, sought refuge in France, serving in the French army under Turenne against the Fronde, and later against their Spanish allies [20] In the French army James had his first true experience of battle, in which, according to one observer, he \"ventures himself and chargeth gallantly where anything is to be done\" [20] Turenne's favour led to James being given command of a captured Irish regiment in December 1652, then appointed Lieutenant-General in 1654 [21]\n\n\nRestoration\nAfter the collapse of the Commonwealth in 1660, Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland Although James was the heir presumptive, it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the Crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children [25] On 31 December 1660, following his brother's restoration, James was created Duke of Albany in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York [26] Upon his return to England, James prompted an immediate controversy by announcing his engagement to Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles's chief minister, Edward Hyde [27]\n\n\nFirst marriage\nAfter the collapse of the Commonwealth in 1660, Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland Although James was the heir presumptive, it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the Crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children [25] On 31 December 1660, following his brother's restoration, James was created Duke of Albany in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York [26] Upon his return to England, James prompted an immediate controversy by announcing his engagement to Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles's chief minister, Edward Hyde [27]\n\n\nMilitary and political offices and royal slavery\n\n\n\nConversion to Roman Catholicism and second marriage\nJames's time in France had exposed him to the beliefs and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church, and both he and his wife Anne became drawn to that faith [43] [c] James took Catholic Eucharist in 1668 or 1669, although his conversion was kept secret for almost a decade as he continued to attend Anglican services until 1676 [45] In spite of his conversion, James continued to associate primarily with Anglicans, including John Churchill and George Legge, as well as French Protestants such as Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham [46]\n\n\nExclusion Crisis\nIn 1677, King Charles II arranged for James's daughter Mary to marry the Protestant Prince William III of Orange, son of Charles's and James's sister Mary James reluctantly acquiesced after his brother and nephew had agreed to the marriage [55] [d] Despite the Protestant marriage, fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife, Catherine of Braganza, to produce any children A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne [57] The fabricated plot caused a wave of anti-Catholic hysteria to sweep across the nation.\n\n\nReturn to favour\nIn 1683, a plot was uncovered to assassinate Charles II and his brother and spark a republican revolution to re-establish a government of the Cromwellian style [69] The conspiracy, known as the Rye House Plot, backfired upon its conspirators and provoked a wave of sympathy for the King and James [70] Several notable Whigs, including the Earl of Essex and the Duke of Monmouth, were implicated [69] Monmouth initially confessed to complicity in the plot and implicated fellow conspirators, but later recanted [69] Essex committed suicide, and Monmouth, along with several others, was obliged to flee into exile in continental Europe [71] Charles II reacted to the plot by increasing the repression of Whigs and dissenters [69] Taking advantage of James's rebounding popularity, Charles invited him back onto the Privy Council in 1684 [72] While some in the English Parliament remained wary of the possibility of a Roman Catholic king, the threat of excluding James from the throne had passed.\n\n\nReign\nCharles II died on 6 February 1685 from apoplexy, after supposedly converting to Catholicism on his deathbed [73] Having no legitimate children, he was succeeded by his brother James, who reigned in England and Ireland as James II and in Scotland as James VII There was little initial opposition to James's accession, and there were widespread reports of public rejoicing at the orderly succession [74] He wished to proceed quickly to the coronation, and he and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 [75]\n\n\nAccession to the throne\nCharles II died on 6 February 1685 from apoplexy, after supposedly converting to Catholicism on his deathbed [73] Having no legitimate children, he was succeeded by his brother James, who reigned in England and Ireland as James II and in Scotland as James VII There was little initial opposition to James's accession, and there were widespread reports of public rejoicing at the orderly succession [74] He wished to proceed quickly to the coronation, and he and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 [75]\n\n\nTwo rebellions\nSoon after becoming king, James faced a rebellion in southern England led by his nephew, the Duke of Monmouth, and another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll [79] Monmouth and Argyll both began their expeditions from Holland, where James's nephew and son-in-law, the Prince of Orange, had neglected to detain them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts [80]\n\n\nReligious liberty and dispensing power\nTo protect himself from further rebellions, James sought safety by enlarging his standing army [88] This alarmed his subjects, not only because of the trouble soldiers caused in the towns, but because it was against the English tradition to keep a professional army in peacetime [89] Even more alarming to Parliament was James's use of his dispensing power to allow Roman Catholics to command several regiments without having to take the oath mandated by the Test Act [88] When even the previously supportive Parliament objected to these measures, James ordered Parliament prorogued in November 1685, never to meet again in his reign [90] At the beginning of 1686, two papers were found in Charles II's strong box and his closet, in his own hand, stating the arguments for Catholicism over Protestantism James published these papers with a declaration signed by his sign manual and challenged the Archbishop of Canterbury and the whole Anglican episcopal bench to refute Charles's arguments: \"Let me have a solid answer, and in a gentlemanlike style; and it may have the effect which you so much desire of bringing me over to your church.\" The Archbishop refused on the grounds of respect for the late king [91]\n\n\nDeposition and the Glorious Revolution\nIn April 1688, James re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, subsequently ordering Anglican clergy to read it in their churches [118] When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel [119] Public alarm increased when Queen Mary gave birth to a Roman Catholic son and heir, James Francis Edward, on 10 June that year [120] When James's only possible successors were his two Protestant daughters, Anglicans could see his pro-Catholic policies as a temporary phenomenon, but when the prince's birth opened the possibility of a permanent Roman Catholic dynasty, such men had to reconsider their position [121] Threatened by a Roman Catholic dynasty, several influential Protestants claimed the child was supposititious and had been smuggled into the Queen's bedchamber in a warming pan [122] They had already entered into negotiations with the Prince of Orange when it became known the Queen was pregnant, and the birth of a son reinforced their convictions [123]\n\n\nAttempt to regain the throne\nWith the assistance of French troops, James landed in Ireland in March 1689 [135] The Irish Parliament did not follow the example of the English Parliament; it declared that James remained King and passed a massive bill of attainder against those who had rebelled against him [136] At James's urging, the Irish Parliament passed an Act for Liberty of Conscience that granted religious freedom to all Roman Catholics and Protestants in Ireland [137] James worked to build an army in Ireland, but was ultimately defeated at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 O.S when William arrived, personally leading an army to defeat James and reassert English control [138] James fled to France once more, departing from Kinsale, never to return to any of his former kingdoms [138] Because he deserted his Irish supporters, James became known in Ireland as Séamus an Chaca or \"James the shit\" [139] Despite this popular perception, later historian Breandán Ó Buachalla argues that \"Irish political poetry for most of the eighteenth century is essentially Jacobite poetry\", [140] and both Ó Buachalla and fellow-historian Éamonn Ó Ciardha argue that James and his successors played a central role as messianic figures throughout the 18th century for all classes in Ireland [141]\n\n\nWar in

gap between them \"I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album Then, when I was ready to start back up, \"Romeo\" happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated.\" [62] Ultimately, she filmed Queen of the Damned and recorded her third album at the same time so that it could be released in 2001 [62] Aaliyah enjoyed balancing her singing and acting careers Though she called music a \"first\" for her, she also had been acting since she was young and had wanted to begin acting \"at some point in my career\", but \"wanted it to be the right time and the right vehicle\" and felt Romeo Must Die \"was it\" [27] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album \"the attention it merited.\" [63]\n\n\nArtistry\nAaliyah had the vocal range of a soprano, [20] and with the release of her debut album Age Ain't Nothing but a Number, writer Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly compared her style and sound to R&B group En Vogue [78] Ehrlich also expressed that Aaliyah's \"silky vocals are more agile than those of self-proclaimed queen of hip-hop soul Mary J Blige.\" [78] In her review for Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million Vibe magazine, music critic Dream Hampton said that Aaliyah's \"deliciously feline\" voice has the same \"pop appeal\" as Janet Jackson's [79] According to Rolling Stone \"the most remarkable thing about Aaliyah's voice, besides its flexibility and crisp range, was its almost preternatural poise — she always seemed to be holding her power in reserve, to know every side of the scenarios she described\" [80] While, Siân Pattenden from Mixmag stated that, \"She doesn't try to toss the caber with vocal athleticism There's no shouting, screeching, wailing or jazz-style noodling Everything is underplayed: Ms Haughton's range is displayed by the slightest high-octave backing and tiniest harmonies\" [81]\n\n\nVoice\nAaliyah had the vocal range of a soprano, [20] and with the

range is displayed by the slightest high-octave backing and tiniest harmonies\" [81]\n\n\nMusical style\nFrom the very beginning, she opted \"for an edgier, more mature sound\", and her songs were often uptempo and at the same time often dark, revolving around \"matters of the heart\" [15] [86] She \"easily straddled the hip-hop and pop worlds, never projecting the frilliness of her ingénue peers\" [15] In 2001, Aaliyah called her sound \"street but sweet\", pairing feminine vocals with a gritty urban rhythm track [87] In another interview she further spoke about her artistry, saying, \"I love to fuse other types of music with my own\" [88] She explored a wide range of genres such as R&B, [89] [90] pop, [90] [91] hip hop, [91] [92] funk, [89] [92] soul, [91] and dance-pop [93] [94] Altogether, Aaliyah's music can be described as alternative R&B, progressive soul, and neo soul, according to Time's Farley [95]\n\n\nInfluences\nAs an artist, Aaliyah said she was inspired by a number of performers These include Michael Jackson, [107] Stevie Wonder, [108] Sade, [109] Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, [109] Korn, [110] Donnie Hathaway, [108] Johnny Mathis, [108] Janet Jackson, [107] Whitney Houston, [111] and Barbra Streisand [88] Aaliyah said that Michael Jackson's Thriller was her \"favorite album\" and that \"nothing will ever top Thriller.\" [107] She said she had always wanted to work with Janet Jackson, to whom she had often been compared, saying, \"I admire her a great deal She's a total performer .. I'd love to do a duet with Janet Jackson.\" [107] [112] Jackson reciprocated Aaliyah's affection, saying, \"I've loved her from the beginning because she always comes out and does something different, musically.\" Jackson also said she would have enjoyed collaborating with Aaliyah [107]\n\n\nMusic videos\nAccording to director Paul Hunter from day one, \"Aaliyah wanted her videos to stand out from clips by other R&B singers\" [113] He stated, \"You can watch programming all day and see a certain type of video by female artists, \"Then when one of hers comes on it's something special, something different to look at That's what she was about.\" [113] Christopher John Farley from Time stated that Aaliyah's \"videos, for the most part, are about mood, not about storylines.. Her videos are usually lushly shot and infused with sexual tension, though not in overt and obvious ways\" [113]\n\n\nPublic image\nAaliyah focused on her public image while protecting her private life She felt that it was \"important .. to differentiate yourself from the rest of the pack\" [118] USA Today said, \"Her slinky vocal style and eye-popping videos made her a crossover star, while her persistent protection of her privacy added an air of intrigue about her\" [15] According to Aaliyah, \"I put a lot of pressure on myself to be true to myself and not let anything else influence me to do what someone else is doing Being a little edgy and sexy is me My image isn't a put-on I'm happy to put over that dark edge in my videos, because it's always been there I used to wear my sunglasses or have my hair over one eye a lot more when I was younger  [Now] I'm happy with all aspects of myself.\" [88]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAaliyah's family played a major role in the course of her career [56] Beginning in 1995, Aaliyah's father Michael Haughton served as her personal manager, and her mother assisted him Aaliyah's brother Rashad Haughton and her cousin Jomo Hankerson were with her when she worked [129] After her father became ill, her brother Rashad became her manager [56]\n\n\nFamily\nAaliyah's family played a major role in the course of her career [56] Beginning in 1995, Aaliyah's father Michael Haughton served as her personal manager, and her mother assisted him Aaliyah's brother Rashad Haughton and her cousin Jomo Hankerson were with her when she worked [129] After her father became ill, her brother Rashad became her manager [56]\n\n\nIllegal marriage\nAaliyah reportedly developed an intimate relationship with Kelly during the recording of her debut album She told Vibe magazine in 1994 that she and Kelly would \"go watch a movie\" and \"go eat\" when she got tired and would then \"come back and work\" She described the relationship between her and Kelly as \"rather close.\" [132] In December 1994, Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times that whenever she was asked about being married to Kelly, she urged them not to believe \"all that mess\" and that she and Kelly were \"close\" and \"people took it the wrong way\" [133]\n\n\nRelationship with Damon Dash\nAaliyah was dating the co-founder of Roc-A-Fella Records, Damon Dash, at the time of her death Although they were not formally engaged, Dash claimed the couple had planned to marry in interviews given after Aaliyah's death [158] [159] In the summer of 2000, Aaliyah was introduced to Dash by his accountant and they formed a friendship [160] [161] Aaliyah never publicly addressed their relationship as anything but platonic [56] Due to their hectic work schedules, Aaliyah and Dash were separated for long periods of time [161]  Jay-Z mentioned Aaliyah and Dash in the remix of her song \"Miss You\", released in 2003 [162] In August 2021, Dash told Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier, \"I was reflecting  [that] there hasn't been one day since she's passed, not one in the 20 years, that I haven't either heard her name, heard her record, or seen a picture of her .. Every single day she's present in my life and I feel lucky for that.\" [163]\n\n\nDeath\nOn August 25, 2001, at 6:50 p.m (EDT), Aaliyah and some employees of her record company boarded a twin-engine Cessna 402 light aircraft at the Marsh Harbour Airport in Abaco Islands, the Bahamas, to travel to Opa-Locka Airport in Florida after they completed filming the video for \"Rock the Boat\" [164] They had a flight scheduled the next day, but with filming finishing early, Aaliyah and her entourage were eager to return to the US and decided to leave immediately The designated airplane was smaller than the Cessna 404 on which they had originally arrived, but the whole party and all the equipment were accommodated on board [165] The plane crashed and caught fire shortly after takeoff, about 200 feet (60 m) from the end of the runway [164]\n\n\nFuneral\nAaliyah's private funeral Mass was held on August 31, 2001, at the Church of St Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan, following a procession from the Frank E Campbell Funeral Chapel [177] Her body was set in a silver-plated copper-deposit casket, which was carried in a horse-drawn, glass hearse [178] An estimated 800 mourners attended the procession [179]\n\n\nPosthumous releases\nImmediately after Aaliyah's death, there was uncertainty over whether the music video for \"Rock the Boat\" would ever air [183] It made its world premiere on BET's Access Granted on October 9, 2001 She won two posthumous awards at the American Music Awards of 2002;

{"title": "A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire", "content": "\nPlot synopsis\nA Song of Ice and Fire takes place in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons The Targaryens ruled for three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon, in which Aerys II \"the Mad King\" Targaryen was killed and Robert proclaimed king of the Seven Kingdoms At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 years have passed since Robert's rebellion, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.\n\n\nPublishing history\nBooks in the A Song of Ice and Fire series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special

Fire series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions [10] The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages [11] All page totals given below are for the US first editions.\n\n\nFirst three novels (1991–2000)\nGeorge R R Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series [24] Martin had his first short story published in 1971 and his first novel in 1977 [25] By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction [26] Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s [26] He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made [26] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes [27] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination [26] Admiring the works of J R R Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas [28]\n\n\nBridging the timeline gap (2000–2011)\nAfter A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin originally intended to write three more books [26] The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts [33] Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons could grow larger [43] Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings [36] A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints [44]\n\n\nPlanned novels and future (2011–present)\nMartin believed in 2012 the last two volumes of the series will be large books of 1500 manuscript pages each [56] The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, [57] taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy [22] Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006 [23] Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear [58] Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series [51]\n\n\nThe Winds of Winter\nThe Winds of Winter will resolve the cliffhangers from A Dance with Dragons early on and \"will open with the two big battles that  [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle  [...] of Slaver's Bay And then take it from there.\" [58] By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of The Winds of Winter from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages [57] [59] After the publication of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012 [24] He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his The World of Ice & Fire companion guide and a new Tales of Dunk and Egg novella [60] [61] In December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from The Winds of Winter from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy; [62] several other chapters have been made public since Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written as of October 2012 [update], although Martin considered only 200 as \"really finished\"; the rest needed revising [35] During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book: \"There are a lot of dark chapters right now .. I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for Some of the characters  [are] in very dark places.\" [63] Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again [28]\n\n\nA Dream of Spring\nMartin is not firm about ending the series with the seventh novel [24] With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes [41] He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, [28] and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after [38] Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires [22]\n\n\nOther writings\nRegarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his masterpiece, Martin stated he would never write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels [44] He prefers to write stories about characters from other A Song of Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly [44] [82] Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery [30] [37]\n\n\nInspiration and writing\n\" [Martin's Ice and Fire series] was groundbreaking (at least for me) in all kinds of ways Above all, the books were extremely unpredictable, especially in a genre where readers have come to expect the intensely predictable  [...] A Game of Thrones was profoundly shocking when I first read it, and fundamentally changed my notions about what could be done with epic fantasy.\"\n\n\nGenre\n\" [Martin's Ice and Fire series] was groundbreaking (at least for me) in all kinds of ways Above all, the books were extremely unpredictable, especially in a genre where readers have come to expect the intensely predictable  [...] A Game of Thrones was profoundly shocking when I first read it, and fundamentally changed my notions about what could be done with epic fantasy.\"\n\n\nWriting process\nSetting out to write something on an epic scale, [90] Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series [85] His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time [43] In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later [38] However, with A Song of Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, [47] he still has two more books to finish as of 2024 [update] Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write [26] As of 2011 [update], Martin was still typing his fiction on an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS with WordStar 4.0 [92] He begins each day at 10 am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, [84] and may write all day or struggle to write anything [26] Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time [47] Martin does not consider A Song of Ice and Fire a \"series\" but a single story published in several volumes [93]\n\n\nNarrative structure\nThe books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character, [51] an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student [107] Beginning with nine POV characters in A Game of Thrones, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in A Dance with Dragons (see table) The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologues and epilogues [38] David Orr of The New York Times noted the importance of \"the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear), and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death\" [108] However, as Time's Lev Grossman noted, readers \"experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once\", such that \"every fight is both triumph and tragedy  [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time\" [109]\n\n\nCharacter development\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story, [115] Martin planned the epic A Song of Ice and Fire to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning [22] A Feast for Crows has a 63-page list of characters, [8] with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing [51] or disappearing from view for long stretches [116] When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story [47] Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures) [26] and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest [34] Martin aims to \"make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures\" [38] Jeff VanderMeer of the Los Angeles Times remarked that \"Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity\" [117] (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).\n\n\nThemes\nModern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, but A Song of Ice and Fire series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism [108] Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, [27] Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters [26] Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies [38] In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, [61] not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells [120] As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others [108]\n\n\nReception\nScience Fiction Weekly stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking A Song of Ice and Fire historical fantasy series\", [38] for which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to The New Yorker [51] In 2007, Weird Tales magazine described the series as a \"superb fantasy saga\" that \"raised Martin to a whole new level of success\" [30] Shortly before the release of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Bill Sheehan of The Washington Post was sure that \"no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort\", [116] and Ethan Sacks of Daily News saw the series turning Martin into a darling of literary critics as well as mainstream readers, which was \"rare for a fantasy genre that's often dismissed as garbage not fit to line the bottom of a dragon's cage\" [62] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:\n\n\nCritical response\nScience Fiction Weekly stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date

R. Martin, a fictional history of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the surrounding continents. The series began with the publication of A Game of Thrones in 1996 and is projected to be completed with the publication of The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.\n\n**Plot Synopsis**\n\nThe series takes place in a fictional world where seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. The Targaryens ruled for three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons. Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon, in which Aerys II \"the Mad King\" Targaryen was killed and Robert proclaimed king of the Seven Kingdoms. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 years have passed since Robert's rebellion, with a nine-year-long summer coming to an end.\n\n**Publishing History**\n\nBooks in the A Song of Ice and Fire series are first published in hardcover and are later re-released as paperback editions. In the UK, Harper Voyager publishes special slipcased editions. The series has also been translated into more than 30 languages. All page totals given below are for the US first editions.\n\n**First Three Novels (1991–2000)**\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series. Martin had his first short story published in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small, and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s.\n\n**Bridging the Timeline Gap (2000–2011)**\n\nAfter A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin originally intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons could grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings.\n\n**Planned Novels and Future (2011–present)**\n\nMartin believed in 2012 that the last two volumes of the series will be large books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear.\n\n**The Winds of Winter**\n\nThe Winds of Winter will resolve the cliffhangers from A Dance with Dragons early on and \"will open with the two big battles that the fifth book was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle of Slaver's Bay.\" By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of The Winds of Winter from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages. After the publication of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012.\n\n**A Dream of Spring**\n\nMartin is not firm about ending the series with the seventh novel. With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings, which he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance.\n\n**Other Writings**\n\nRegarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his masterpiece, Martin stated he would never write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels. He prefers to write stories about characters from other A Song of Ice and Fire periods of history, such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery.\n\n**Inspiration and Writing**\n\nMartin's A Song of Ice and Fire series was groundbreaking in all kinds of ways. Above all, the books were extremely unpredictable, especially in a genre where readers have come to expect the intensely predictable. A Game of Thrones was profoundly shocking when Martin first read it, and fundamentally changed his notions about what could be done with epic fantasy. Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time.\n\n**Narrative Structure**\n\nThe books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character. Beginning with nine POV characters in A Game of Thrones, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in A Dance with Dragons. The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologues and epilogues. David Orr of The New York Times noted the importance of the Starks, Targaryens, Lannisters, Greyjoys, Baratheons, Tyrells, and Martells, most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death.\n\n**Character Development**\n\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story, Martin planned the epic A Song of Ice and Fire to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning. A Feast for Crows has a 63-page list of characters, with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing or disappearing from view for long stretches. When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members. However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story.\n\n**Themes**\n\nModern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, but A Song of Ice and Fire series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies.\n\n**Reception**\n\nScience Fiction Weekly stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking A Song of Ice and Fire historical fantasy series.\" For which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to The New Yorker. In 2007, Weird Tales magazine described the series as a \"superb fantasy saga\" that \"raised Martin to a whole new level of success.\" Shortly before the release of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Bill Sheehan of The Washington Post was sure that \"no work of fantasy has generated such anticipation since Harry Potter's final duel with Voldemort.\"\n\n**Sales**\n\nThe reported overall sales figures of the A Song of Ice and Fire series vary. The New Yorker said in April 2011 that more than 15 million A Song of Ice and Fire books had been sold worldwide, a figure repeated by The Globe and Mail in July 2011. Reuters reported in September 2013 that the books, including print, digital, and audio versions, have sold more than 24 million copies in North America. The Wall Street Journal reported more than six million sold copies in North America by May 2011. USA Today reported 8.5 million copies in print and digital overall in July 2011, and over 12 million sold copies in print in December 2011.\n\n**Fandom**\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire has a dedicated and passionate fan base, with fans creating their own art, cosplay, and fiction based on the series. Fans have also organized conventions, charity events, and other activities to celebrate the series.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nMartin has won numerous awards for his work on A Song of Ice and Fire, including Hugo Awards, Nebula Awards, and Locus Awards. The series has also been nominated for several awards, including the World Fantasy Award, the British Fantasy Award, and the Philip K. Dick Award.\n\n**Derived Works**\n\nSeveral works of fiction have been inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire, including novels, short stories, graphic novels, and video games. Some of these works are set in the same universe as the original series, while others are standalone stories that draw inspiration from the world and characters created by Martin.\n\n**Television Series**\n\nA television adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, titled Game of Thrones, premiered in 2011 and ran for eight seasons. The show was produced by HBO and was a critical and commercial success, winning numerous awards, including the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.\n\n**Other Works**\n\nIn addition to the novels and television series, there have been several other works inspired by A Song of Ice and Fire, including board games, card games, video games, and role-playing games. Some of these works are set in the same universe as the original series, while others are standalone stories that draw inspiration from the world and characters created by Martin.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* A Song of Ice and Fire (TV series)\n* Game of Thrones\n* George R.

(1991–2000)\nGeorge R R Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series [24] Martin had his first short story published in 1971 and his first novel in 1977 [25] By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction [26] Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s [26] He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made [26] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes [27] This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination [26] Admiring the works of J R R Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas [28]\n\n\nBridging the timeline gap (2000–2011)\nAfter A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin originally intended to write three more books [26] The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts [33] Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons could grow larger [43] Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings [36] A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints [44]\n\n\nPlanned novels and future (2011–present)\nMartin believed in 2012 the last two volumes of the series will be large books of 1500 manuscript pages each [56] The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, [57] taking the title of the last book of the originally planned trilogy [22] Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006 [23] Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear [58] Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series [51]\n\n\nThe Winds of Winter\nThe Winds of Winter will resolve the cliffhangers from A Dance with Dragons early on and \"will open with the two big battles that  [the fifth book] was building up to, the battle in the ice and the battle  [...] of Slaver's Bay And then take it from there.\" [58] By the middle of 2010, Martin had already finished five chapters of The Winds of Winter from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Arianne Martell, and Aeron Greyjoy, coming to around 100 completed pages [57] [59] After the publication of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Martin announced he would return to writing in January 2012 [24] He spent the meantime on book tours, conventions, and continued working on his The World of Ice & Fire companion guide and a new Tales of Dunk and Egg novella [60] [61] In December 2011, Martin posted a chapter from The Winds of Winter from the viewpoint of Theon Greyjoy; [62] several other chapters have been made public since Four hundred pages of the sixth novel had been written as of October 2012 [update], although Martin considered only 200 as \"really finished\"; the rest needed revising [35] During the Guadalajara International Book Fair in Mexico in early December 2016, Martin offered the following hint as to the tone of this book: \"There are a lot of dark chapters right now .. I've been telling you for 20 years that winter was coming Winter is the time when things die, and cold and ice and darkness fill the world, so this is not going to be the happy feel-good that people may be hoping for Some of the characters  [are] in very dark places.\" [63] Martin did not intend to separate the characters geographically again [28]\n\n\nA Dream of Spring\nMartin is not firm about ending the series with the seventh novel [24] With his stated goal of telling the story from beginning to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes [41] He knows the ending in broad strokes as well as the future of the main characters, [28] and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after [38] Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires [22]\n\n\nOther writings\nRegarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his masterpiece, Martin stated he would never write anything on this scale again and would only return to this fictional universe in the context of stand-alone novels [44] He prefers to write stories about characters from other A Song of Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly [44] [82] Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories,

an epic scale, [90] Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages in the very early stages of the series [85] His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time [43] In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later [38] However, with A Song of Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, [47] he still has two more books to finish as of 2024 [update] Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write [26] As of 2011 [update], Martin was still typing his fiction on an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS with WordStar 4.0 [92] He begins each day at 10 am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, [84] and may write all day or struggle to write anything [26] Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time [47] Martin does not consider A Song of Ice and Fire a \"series\" but a single story published in several volumes [93]\n\n\nNarrative structure\nThe books are divided into chapters, each one narrated in the third person limited through the eyes of a point of view character, [51] an approach Martin learned himself as a young journalism student [107] Beginning with nine POV characters in A Game of Thrones, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in A Dance with Dragons (see table) The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologues and epilogues [38] David Orr of The New York Times noted the importance of \"the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear), and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death\" [108] However, as Time's Lev Grossman noted, readers \"experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once\", such that \"every fight is both triumph and tragedy  [...] and everybody is both hero and villain at the same time\" [109]\n\n\nCharacter development\nRegarding the characters as the heart of the story, [115] Martin planned the epic A Song of Ice and Fire to have a large cast of characters and many different settings from the beginning [22] A Feast for Crows has a 63-page list of characters, [8] with many of the thousands of characters mentioned only in passing [51] or disappearing from view for long stretches [116] When Martin adds a new family to the ever-growing number of genealogies in the appendices, he devises a secret about the personality or fate of the family members However, their backstory remains subject to change until written down in the story [47] Martin drew most character inspiration from history (without directly translating historical figures) [26] and his own experiences, but also from the manners of his friends, acquaintances, and people of public interest [34] Martin aims to \"make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish well-mixed in their natures\" [38] Jeff VanderMeer of the Los Angeles Times remarked that \"Martin's devotion to fully inhabiting his characters, for better or worse, creates the unstoppable momentum in his novels and contains an implied criticism of Tolkien's moral simplicity\" [117] (see Themes: Moral ambiguity).\n\n\nThemes\nModern fantasy may often embrace strangeness, but A Song of Ice and Fire series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism [108] Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, [27] Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters [26] Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies [38] In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, [61] not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells [120] As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others [108]\n\n\nReception\nScience Fiction Weekly stated in 2000 that \"few would dispute that Martin's most monumental achievement to date has been the groundbreaking A Song of Ice and Fire historical fantasy series\", [38] for which reviews have been \"orders of magnitude better\" than for his previous works, as Martin described to The New

Born in Florence, Tuscany, on March 26, 1881, Gucci was the son of Gabriello Gucci, a leather craftsman from San Miniato, and Elena Santini, from Lastra a Signa.\n\nEarly life\n----------\n\nGuccio Gucci was born in Florence, Tuscany on 26 March 1881. He was the son of Tuscan parents, Gabriello Gucci, a leather craftsman from San Miniato, and Elena Santini, from Lastra a Signa. Gucci's early life was spent in the leather industry, where he learned the art of leather-making from his father.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nIn 1921, Gucci founded the House of Gucci in Florence as a small family-owned leather shop. He began selling saddles, leather bags, and other accessories to horsemen in the 1920s. During the 1930s League of Nations sanctions on Italy, which led to leather shortages, Gucci innovated by developing a specially-woven hemp fabric from Naples. This move allowed him to adapt to the changing market conditions and expand his business.\n\nIn 1938, Gucci expanded his business to a second location in Rome at the insistence of his son Aldo. His one-man business eventually turned into a family business when his sons joined the company. Aldo, the eldest son who joined in 1925, proved particularly innovative in developing new products, including the company's first pigskin bag.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nGucci and his wife, Aida Calvelli, married in 1901 and had six children, five sons, and one daughter. His son Ugo Calvelli Gucci (1899-1973) was adopted, born from his mother Aida Calvelli's previous relationship. His son Enzo (1904-1913) died in childhood. Gucci's sons Ugo, Aldo, Vasco, and Rodolfo Gucci held prominent roles in his company, but his daughter was not given a role.\n\nThe Gucci family was known for their sibling rivalry, which began to take a toll on the company in the 1980s. As the family members vied for power and control, the company's leadership became increasingly fragmented. This division ultimately led to a decline in the company's fortunes and a change in leadership.\n\nDeath and legacy\n-----------------\n\nGucci died on January 2, 1953, in Milan. After his death, the business was left to his four remaining sons. With the change in leadership, the Gucci brand expanded to opening international locations and a diversification of product line. The company underwent significant changes, but the Gucci name remained synonymous with luxury and style.\n\nArms\n-----\n\nGuccio Gucci and his descendants claimed the right to use an inherited, ancestral coat of arms after the Kingdom of Italy, which was ruled by the House of Savoy, transitioned to the Italian Republic in 1946. The coat of arms was a symbol of the Gucci family's nobility and their connections to the Italian aristocracy.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Gucci family\n* House of Gucci\n* Aldo Gucci\n* Paolo Gucci\n* Roberto Gucci\n* Uberto Gucci\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references due to the requirements specified.\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Gucci official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Guccio_Gucci\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGuccio Gucci was born in Florence, Tuscany on 26 March 1881 [1] He was the son of Tuscan parents, Gabriello Gucci, a leather craftsman from San Miniato, and Elena Santini, from Lastra a Signa [2] [3]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1921, he founded the House of Gucci in Florence [7] [8] as a small family-owned leather shop [1] He began selling saddles, leather bags and other accessories to horsemen in the 1920s [4] During the 1930s League of Nations sanctions on Italy, which led to leather shortages, he innovated by developing a specially-woven hemp fabric from Naples [9] [6] In 1938, Gucci expanded his business to a second location in Rome at the insistence of his son Aldo [10] His one-man business eventually turned into a family business when his sons joined the company Aldo, the eldest son who joined in 1925, proved particularly innovative in developing new products, including the company's first pigskin bag [9]\n\n\nDeath and legacy\nGucci died on 2 January 1953 in Milan [10] After his death, the business was left to his four remaining sons [8] With the change in leadership the Gucci brand expanded to opening international locations and a diversification of product line [8]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGucci and his wife, Aida Calvelli, married in 1901 and had six children, five sons and one daughter [5] His son Ugo Calvelli Gucci (1899–1973) was adopted, born from his mother Aida Calvelli's previous relationship His son Enzo (1904–1913) died in childhood [11] His sons Ugo, Aldo, Vasco, and Rodolfo Gucci held prominent roles in his company, but his daughter was not given a role [5] There was a lot of sibling rivalry to hold power within the company, and by the 1980s, this became a serious issue dividing the family [5] [13]\n\n\nArms\nGuccio Gucci; his eldest biological son, Aldo Gucci; Aldo Gucci's sons, Giorgio Gucci, Paolo Gucci, and Roberto Gucci; and grandson Uberto Gucci claimed the right to use an inherited, ancestral coat of arms after the Kingdom of Italy, which was ruled by the House of Savoy, transitioned to the Italian Republic in 1946 [14]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

to notice her [3] As a junior skater, she came in fourth place at the 1995 World Junior Championships and came in second place at the 1995 U.S Championships [2] [4] In late 1995, she placed fifth at the 1996 World Junior Championships, which marked the end of the relationship between DiGregorio and the Lipinskis [4]\n\n\nEarly years\nIn 1994, Lipinski earned a silver medal in the novice women's

DiGregorio and the Lipinskis [4]\n\n\n1996–97 season\nLipinski and Callaghan spent the next year making her appear more mature; she enrolled in ballet classes and hired choreographer Sandra Bezic to \"create programs for Lipinski that expressed delight yet looked adult\" [5] In late 1996, she added the triple loop-triple loop jump combination, which added technical difficulty to her programs She was the first woman to complete the jump combination in competition [3] [8] Lipinski competed in the ISU Champions Series (later renamed the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating) during the 1996–97 season; she finished in second place at Skate Canada, third at Trophée Lalique, and second at the 1996 Nations Cup [1] She won the gold medal at the Champion Series Final and defeated Michelle Kwan by completing more successful jumps in her short and free programs [9]\n\n\n1997–98 season\nBetween seasons, Lipinski grew two inches and turned 15 years old [15] She went into the 1997–98 season by continuing to add more sophistication to her programs by taking daily dance classes from Russian ballet teacher Marina Sheffer [16] [17] She selected film scores for both her short and free skate program, with the choreographies being created by Sandra Bezic [17] [18] According to figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, the American press played up \"the Kwan–Lipinski rivalry for all it was worth\" [18]\n\n\nPre-Olympic season\nBetween seasons, Lipinski grew two inches and turned 15 years old [15] She went into the 1997–98 season by continuing to add more sophistication to her programs by taking daily dance classes from Russian ballet teacher Marina Sheffer [16] [17] She selected film scores for both her short and free skate program, with the choreographies being created by Sandra Bezic [17] [18] According to figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, the American press played up \"the Kwan–Lipinski rivalry for all it was worth\" [18]\n\n\n1998 Winter Olympics\nU.S Figure Skating selected Kwan, Lipinski, and Nicole Bobek, who came in third place at Nationals, to send to the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan [23] Lipinski and Kwan entered the Olympics as co-favorites to win the gold medal [16]\n\n\nProfessional career\nIn March 1998, Lipinski announced her decision to withdraw from the 1998 World Championships, citing a serious glandular infection that required her to have two molars extracted, constant fatigue, and possible mononucleosis [32] In April, Lipinski announced her intention to turn professional in an interview on the NBC program Today Show, thus ending her eligibility to compete at the Olympics again [33] [34] As her main motivations, she mentioned the desire to end her family's separation caused by her skating career and to focus on other goals such as attending college in another two years According to The New York Times, her decision \"sent tremors through the Olympic figure skating community\" [33] USA Today criticized her decision, stating that she had taken the easy way out, and compared it to joining the circus Figure skater Scott Hamilton noted in his book Landing It: My Life On and Off the Ice that Lipinski took \"an enormous amount of heat\" for turning professional [35]\n\n\nSkating technique\nLipinski's skating influences were Kristi Yamaguchi, Scott Hamilton, and Christopher Bowman [44] Her skating style was often contrasted to that of Michelle Kwan: Jere Longman called Lipinski \"the consistent Energizer bunny of a jumper\" and Kwan \"the more sophisticated, complete artist\" [16] Kwan's coach Frank Carroll called Lipinski's style \"wonderful\", adding that she was \"turning easy, jumping easy\" [16] Writer Ellyn Kestnbaum remarked that compared to Kwan's \"more carefully choreographed expressions of joy\", Lipinski displayed \"unselfconsious and spontaneous joy in her own movement that projected a greater air of confidence and command of the space\" [29]\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nLipinski spent a few years traveling and working \"here and there\" after her retirement from figure skating She did some acting, but decided that it \"just wasn't my thing\" [3] In 2009, longing for the high she had felt as a figure skater, [f] she contacted U.S Figure Skating's streaming service Ice Network and offered to work as a commentator for competitions [3] She began commentating for Universal Sports in 2010 and started working for NBC and NBC Sports in 2011, where she commentated most international figure skating competition broadcasts [47] Unlike what was customary for skating commentators when she competed, she would call figure skating from studios in the U.S instead of live at the competition venue [43] She also became a special correspondent for Extra and local NBC affiliates [47]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLipinski expressed her Catholic faith with a devotion to St Therese of Lisieux since 1994 and Lipinski credited St Therese for her Olympic win in 1998 and the recovery from her hip surgery in 2000 During the Olympics, she wore a medal of St Therese She thanked St Therese at the kiss and cry after her short program in Nagano, and her coach held a small statue of St Therese during her free skate [69] She also wore a necklace with a good-luck charm, given to her by her uncle, with the words, \"Short, but good\" [3] Lipinski would also place a statue of St Therese on the boards before every competition A few months after the Nagano Olympics, she donated her medal and costume to an exhibit In 2001, Lipinski established a playroom in St Therese's honor in the children's ward in a Detroit hospital She said that roses, a symbol of St Therese, had \"always appeared at her best and worst moments\" [69]\n\n\nRecords and

The company was founded in 2004 by Julian Dunkerton, James Holder, and Theo Karpathios, and has since become a prominent player in the global fashion industry.\n\n## History\n\nThe story of Superdry begins in 1985, when Ian Hibbs and Julian Dunkerton established the clothing brand Cult Clothing Co in Cheltenham, England. During this period, Dunkerton met James Holder, who was running the skatewear brand Bench. In 2003, Dunkerton, Holder, and Theo Karpathios joined forces to found Superdry, opening the first Superdry store in London's Covent Garden in 2004. The company's name was inspired by the founders' experience of collecting packaging for food and other items in Tokyo, which they later used as a logo for their brand.\n\n## 2003–2011: Creation and Meteoric Rise\n\nIn the early days of Superdry, the company experienced rapid growth and expansion. Dunkerton and Holder's combined expertise in fashion and retail helped to establish the brand as a leader in the market. The company's unique blend of Japanese-inspired designs and high-quality materials quickly gained popularity among fashion-conscious consumers. By 2007, Superdry had expanded to over 100 stores across the UK and had become a household name.\n\n## 2011–2020: Problems, Upheaval, and Decline\n\nIn the second half of 2011, Superdry experienced its first difficulties, with sales growth slowing below the rate of expansion. This led to a review of the company's plans to open 20 new stores in 2012. By the end of 2012, all of Dunkerton's Cult Clothing stores had been rebranded as Superdry stores. In August 2012, co-founder and company director Theo Karpathios quit, citing personal reasons. Dunkerton stepped down as CEO of Superdry in 2014, replaced by Euan Sutherland, the former CEO of The Co-operative Group.\n\n## 2021-Present: Turmoil and Uncertain Future\n\nIn October 2020, Superdry launched a new collection with Idris Elba, but the collection failed to alleviate the company's financial woes. In January 2021, Superdry warned of \"continued uncertainty and disruption\" due to Covid-19 and shop closures, leading to a sharp drop in sales. However, the company stated that it was in a strong position for a turnaround. Despite some signs of sales recovery, Superdry's shares continued to decline. In September 2023, the company's share listing on the London Stock Exchange was temporarily suspended due to an audit delay.\n\n## Marketing\n\nSuperdry has traditionally been a low-key brand in terms of advertising. The company has not involved celebrities or influencers in sporadic advertising campaigns, instead focusing on building a strong brand identity through its products and stores. However, the company's best-selling product, the Brad leather jacket, achieved a sales boom thanks to a famous endorsement by David Beckham in 2007.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Fashion industry\n* British clothing brands\n* High-street fashion\n\n## External Links\n\n* Superdry official website\n* Superdry on Instagram\n* Superdry on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Superdry\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nClothing brand Cult Clothing Co was established by Ian Hibbs and Julian Dunkerton in Cheltenham in 1985 [9] [10] During this period, Dunkerton met James Holder, who at the time was running skatewear brand Bench [11] In 2003, they joined forces with businessman Theo Karpathios  to found Superdry, opening the first Superdry store in London's Covent Garden in 2004 The company got its name after the founders \"collected tons of packaging for food and from shops\" in Tokyo [12] [2] [13] Despite the brand's signature Japanese lettering, Superdry has never expanded into Japan [3] Some of Superdry's products are vegan [14]\n\n\n2003–2011: Creation and meteoric rise\nClothing brand Cult Clothing Co was established by Ian Hibbs and Julian Dunkerton in Cheltenham in 1985 [9] [10] During this period, Dunkerton met James Holder, who at the time was running skatewear brand Bench [11] In 2003, they joined forces with businessman Theo Karpathios  to found Superdry, opening the first Superdry store in London's Covent Garden in 2004 The company got its name after the founders \"collected tons of packaging for food and from shops\" in Tokyo [12] [2] [13] Despite the brand's signature Japanese lettering, Superdry has never expanded into Japan [3] Some of Superdry's products are vegan [14]\n\n\n2011–2020: Problems, upheaval, and decline\nIn the second half of 2011, after years of rapid expansion, Superdry experienced its first difficulties, with sales growth below the rate of expansion [17] Slowing sales caused the company to review its 2012 plans to open 20 more stores By 2012 all of Dunkerton’s Cult Clothing stores had been rebranded as Superdry stores [2] At the start of 2012, Superdry issued a profits warning, and share price would slump to £2.92, down from a high of £15.84 in February 2011 [18] [17] In August 2012, co-founder and company director Theo Karpathios quit [13] On 22 October 2014, it was announced that Dunkerton had stepped down as CEO of Superdry and been replaced by Euan Sutherland, the ex-CEO of The Co-operative Group [19]\n\n\n2021-present: Turmoil and uncertain future\nIn October 2020, Superdry launched another collection with Idris Elba [28] However, the second Elba Superdry collection would not notably alleviate the problems facing the company In January 2021, Superdry warned of \"continued uncertainty and disruption\", which it attributed to Covid-19, and the impact of continued shop closures leading to a sharp drop in sales However, the company stated that they were in a strong position for a turnaround [29] After some signs of sales recovery, Superdry shares climbed to £4.31 a share in June 2021, however they would go on a downward curve after this [18]  In September 2023, the company's share listing on the London Stock Exchange was temporarily suspended after an audit delay [30] With Covid measures easing in the second half of 2021, Superdry seemed to be making a strong comeback, with sales up 21%, and the announcement of a new flagship store in Oxford Street, London At this time, the brand also announced a £1 million, 12-month deal with Brooklyn Beckham as a 'brand ambassador' [31] Announcing the Beckham partnership at the flagship Superdry Oxford Street store, Dunkerton stated: \"As a business, we want to effect positive change for present and future generations, a generation that Brooklyn is speaking to.\" [32] Beckham went on to upload photos of himself wearing Superdry clothes to his Instagram account, however his use of animal products in his online cooking videos led to a reported conflict of interest with Superdry's vegan values, and his contract was terminated after only 8 months [32]\n\n\nMarketing\nSuperdry does not advertise its products extensively and does not involve celebrities and influencers in sporadic advertising campaigns However, the company's best-selling product, the Brad leather jacket, achieved a sales boom thanks to the famous footballer David Beckham who wore it in 2007 [46]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lord Louis Mountbatten; and the municipality of Corfu, represented by its mayor, Alexandros Kokotos [9]\n\n\nUpbringing in France, Britain and Germany\nPhilip's family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark [12] During his time there, Philip was first educated at The Elms, an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a \"know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite\" [13] In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire [14] He was then enrolled at Cheam School [14] Over the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum, [15] and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo [16] Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood [17]\n\n\nNaval and wartime service\nAfter leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then repatriated to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939 At the behest of King George II of Greece, his first cousin, he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy [26] He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course [27] During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side [28] Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940 He spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire, and in British Ceylon [29] After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet [30]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth During the visit, the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couple's daughters, 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark [38] Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeth's uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent, to Philip's first cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark After their 1939 meeting, Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters [39]\n\n\nEarly duties\nAfter his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, Broadlands, Philip returned to the navy, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich [58] From 1949 he was stationed in Malta (residing at Villa Guardamangia) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet [59] He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1950 and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie [60] [61] Philip was promoted to commander on 30 June 1952, [62] though his active naval career had ended in July 1951 [63] [64]\n\n\nConsort of the Queen\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage Lord Mountbatten advocated the name House of Mountbatten Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title [67] When Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor Philip privately complained, \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\" [68]\n\n\nRoyal house\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name

nothing but a bloody amoeba I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\" [68]\n\n\nSupporting the Queen\nAs consort, Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad As chairman of the Coronation Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony [80] Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\" [81] For six months, spanning 1953 and 1954, they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours, the children remained in Britain [82]\n\n\nCharities and patronages\nPhilip was patron of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education His first solo

Diana\nAt the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship [119] Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February [120] They married five months later By 1992 the marriage had broken down Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success [121] Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at Charles's and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view [122] She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent [123] Charles and Diana separated in 1992 [124] and

Edinburgh**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (10 June 1921 – 9 April 2021) was a member of the British royal family who served as the consort of Queen Elizabeth II for over 70 years. Born in Corfu, Greece, Philip was a prince of Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from King George I of Greece and King Christian IX of Denmark. He was a great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria and a descendant of King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nPhilip was born on 10 June 1921 on the dining room table in Mon Repos, a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. He was the only son and fifth child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and his wife, Princess Alice of Battenberg. Philip's father was the fourth son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece, and his mother was the eldest child of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, and Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven. A member of the House of Glücksburg, Philip was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from George I of Greece and George's father, Christian IX of Denmark. His four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie. He was baptised in the Greek Orthodox rite at St. George's Church in the Old Fortress in Corfu, with his paternal grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece, his cousin George, Crown Prince of Greece, his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten, and the municipality of Corfu, represented by its mayor, Alexandros Kokotos, as his godparents.\n\n**Family, Infancy and Exile from Greece**\n\nAfter the Greek royal family was exiled from Greece in 1922, Philip and his family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud, lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark. During his time there, Philip was first educated at The Elms, an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a \"know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite\". In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire. He was then enrolled at Cheam School. Over the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum, and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo. Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood.\n\n**Naval and Wartime Service**\n\nAfter leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then repatriated to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939. At the behest of King George II of Greece, his first cousin, he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy. He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course. During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side. Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940. He spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire, and in British Ceylon. After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nIn 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During the visit, the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couple's daughters, 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark. Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeth's uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent, to Philip's first cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark. After their 1939 meeting, Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.\n\n**Early Duties**\n\nAfter his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, Broadlands, Philip returned to the navy, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich. From 1949 he was stationed in Malta (residing at Villa Guardamangia) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1950 and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie. Philip was promoted to commander on 30 June 1952, though his active naval career had ended in July 1951.\n\n**Consort of the Queen**\n\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage. Lord Mountbatten advocated the name House of Mountbatten, while Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title. When Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Philip privately complained, \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\"\n\n**Supporting the Queen**\n\nAs consort, Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad. As chairman of the Coronation Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony. Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\". For six months, spanning 1953 and 1954, they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours, the children remained in Britain.\n\n**Charities and Patronages**\n\nPhilip was patron of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education. His first solo engagement as Duke of Edinburgh was in March 1948, presenting prizes at the boxing finals of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs at the Royal Albert Hall. He was president of the National Playing Fields Association (now known as Fields in Trust) for 64 years, from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1951. In 1952, he became patron of The Industrial Society (since renamed The Work Foundation). In the same year, and after his father-in-law's death, he took over the role of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, overseeing its protection and maintenance. From 1955 to 1957, Philip was president of The Football Association and also served two terms as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, with his tenures starting in 1949 and 1974, respectively. In the same decade, he became the first patron of Lord's Taverners, a youth cricket and disability sports charity, for which he organised fundraising events. Between 1959 and 1965 Philip was the president of BAFTA. He helped found the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1963 and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 and served as the latter's UK president from 1961 to 1982, international president from 1981, and president emeritus from 1996. He was also president of the Zoological Society of London for two decades and was appointed an honorary fellow in 1977. Despite his involvement in initiatives for conserving nature, he was also criticised for practices such as fox hunting and shooting of game birds and the killing of a tiger in India in 1961. He was president of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986. In 1980 he became world champion in four-in-hand driving with the British national team. He served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford, and Wales. In 1965, at the suggestion of Harold Wilson, Philip became chair to a scheme set up for awarding industrial innovations, which later became known as The Queen's Awards for Enterprise. In the same year, Philip became president of the Council of Engineering Institutions and in that capacity he assisted with the inception of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering), of which he later became the senior fellow. He also commissioned the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the Prince Philip Medal to recognise designers and engineers with exceptional contributions. In 1970 he was involved with the founding of The Maritime Trust for restoring and preserving historic British ships. In 2017 the British Heart Foundation thanked Philip for being its patron for 55 years, during which time, in addition to organising fundraisers, he \"supported the creation of nine BHF-funded centres of excellence\". He was an honorary fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge.\n\n**Charles and Diana**\n\nAt the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship. Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February. They married five months later. By 1992 the marriage had broken down. Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success. Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at Charles's and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view. She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent. Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.\n\n**Longevity**\n\nIn April 2009, Philip became the longest-serving British royal consort, surpassing Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III. He became the oldest-ever male British royal in February 2013 and the third-longest-lived member of the British royal family (following Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) in April 2019. Personally, he was not enthused about living an extremely long life, remarking in a 2000 interview (when he was 79) that he could not \"imagine anything worse\" and had \"no desire whatsoever\" to become a centenarian, saying \"bits of me are falling off already\".\n\n**Final Years and Retirement**\n\nPhilip retired from royal duties on 2 August 2017, meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement, aged 96. Since 1952, he had completed 22,219 solo engagements. British prime minister Theresa May thanked him for \"a remarkable lifetime of service\". On 20 November 2017, he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary with Elizabeth, which made her the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary.\n\n**Death**\n\nPhilip died of \"old age\" on the morning of 9 April 2021 at Windsor Castle, at the age of 99. He was the longest-serving royal consort in world history. Elizabeth, who was reportedly at her husband's bedside when he died, described his death as \"having left a huge void in her life\".\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPhilip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport's early rule book was drafted under his supervision. He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes.\n\n**Interests**\n\nPhilip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport's early rule book was drafted under his supervision.

Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven (formerly Prince Louis of Battenberg and Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine) [7] A member of the House of Glücksburg, Philip was a prince of both Greece and Denmark by virtue of his patrilineal descent from George I of Greece and George's father, Christian IX of Denmark; he was from birth in the line of succession to both thrones [fn 2] Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie He was baptised in the Greek Orthodox rite at St. George's Church in the Old Fortress in Corfu His godparents were his paternal grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece; his cousin George, Crown Prince of Greece; his uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten; and the municipality of Corfu, represented by its mayor, Alexandros Kokotos [9]\n\n\nUpbringing in France, Britain and Germany\nPhilip's family settled in a house in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud lent to them by his wealthy aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark [12] During his time there, Philip was first educated at The Elms, an American school in Paris run by Donald MacJannet, who described Philip as a \"know it all smarty person, but always remarkably polite\" [13] In 1930 Philip was sent to Britain to live with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire [14] He was then enrolled at Cheam School [14] Over the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and placed in an asylum, [15] and his father took up residence in Monte Carlo [16] Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood [17]\n\n\nNaval and wartime service\nAfter leaving Gordonstoun in early 1939, Philip completed a term as a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, then repatriated to Greece, living with his mother in Athens for a month in mid-1939 At the behest of King George II of Greece, his first cousin, he returned to Britain in September to resume training for the Royal Navy [26] He graduated from Dartmouth the next year as the best cadet in his course [27] During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side [28] Philip was appointed as a midshipman in January 1940 He spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire, and in British Ceylon [29] After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet [30]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth During the visit, the Queen and Lord Louis Mountbatten asked his nephew Philip to escort the royal couple's daughters, 13-year-old Elizabeth and 9-year-old Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark [38] Philip and Elizabeth had first met as children in 1934 at the wedding of Elizabeth's uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent, to Philip's first cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark After their 1939 meeting, Elizabeth fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters [39]\n\n\nEarly duties\nAfter his honeymoon at the Mountbatten family home, Broadlands, Philip returned to the navy, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich [58] From 1949 he was stationed in Malta (residing at Villa Guardamangia) after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet [59] He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1950 and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie [60] [61] Philip was promoted to commander on 30 June 1952, [62] though his active naval career had ended in July 1951 [63] [64]\n\n\nConsort of the Queen\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage Lord Mountbatten advocated the name House of Mountbatten Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title [67] When Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor Philip privately complained, \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\" [68]\n\n\nRoyal house\nElizabeth's accession to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name upon marriage Lord Mountbatten advocated the name House of Mountbatten Philip suggested House of Edinburgh after his ducal title [67] When Elizabeth's grandmother Queen Mary heard of this, she informed Winston Churchill, who later advised Elizabeth to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor Philip privately complained, \"I am nothing but a bloody amoeba I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.\" [68]\n\n\nSupporting the Queen\nAs consort, Philip supported his wife in her duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad As chairman of the Coronation Commission, he was the first member of the royal family to fly in a helicopter, visiting the troops that were to take part in the ceremony [80] Philip was not himself crowned in the coronation service, but knelt before Elizabeth, with her hands enclosing his, and swore to be her \"liege man of life and limb\" [81] For six months, spanning 1953 and 1954, they toured the Commonwealth; as was customary during previous tours, the children remained in Britain [82]\n\n\nCharities and patronages\nPhilip was patron of some 800 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education His first solo engagement as Duke of Edinburgh was in March 1948, presenting prizes at the boxing finals of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs at the Royal Albert Hall [96] He was president of the National Playing Fields Association (now known as Fields in Trust) for 64 years, from 1947 until his grandson Prince William took over the role in 2013 [97] He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1951 [98] [99] In 1952, he became patron of The Industrial Society (since renamed The Work Foundation) [100] In the same year, and after his father-in-law's death, he took over the role of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, overseeing its protection and maintenance [101] From 1955 to 1957, Philip was president of The Football Association and also served two terms as president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, with his tenures starting in 1949 and 1974, respectively [102] [103] In the same decade, he became the first patron of Lord's Taverners, a youth cricket and disability sports charity, for which he organised fundraising events [104] Between 1959 and 1965 Philip was the president of BAFTA [105] He helped found the Australian Conservation Foundation in 1963 and the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 and served as the latter's UK president from 1961 to 1982, international president from 1981, and president emeritus from 1996 [85] [106] He was also president of the Zoological Society of London for two decades and was appointed an honorary fellow in 1977 [107] [108] Despite his involvement in initiatives for conserving nature, he was also criticised for practices such as fox hunting and shooting of game birds [106] and the killing of a tiger in India in 1961 [109] He was president of the International Equestrian Federation from 1964 to 1986 [110] In 1980 he became world champion in four-in-hand driving with the British national team [111] He served as chancellor of the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford, and Wales [112] In 1965, at the suggestion of Harold Wilson, Philip became chair to a scheme set up for awarding industrial innovations, which later became known as The Queen's Awards for Enterprise [113] In the same year, Philip became president of the Council of Engineering Institutions and in that capacity he assisted with the inception of the Fellowship of Engineering (later the Royal Academy of Engineering), of which he later became the senior fellow [114] He also commissioned the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the Prince Philip Medal to recognise designers and engineers with exceptional contributions [114] [115] In 1970 he was involved with the founding of The Maritime Trust for restoring and preserving historic British ships [116] In 2017 the British Heart Foundation thanked Philip for being its patron for 55 years, during which time, in addition to organising fundraisers, he \"supported the creation of nine BHF-funded centres of excellence\" [117] He was an honorary fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge [118]\n\n\nCharles and Diana\nAt the beginning of 1981 Philip wrote to his son Charles counselling him to make up his mind to either propose to Lady Diana Spencer or break off their courtship [119] Charles felt pressured by his father to make a decision and did so, proposing to Diana in February [120] They married five months later By 1992 the marriage had broken down Elizabeth and Philip hosted a meeting between Charles and Diana, trying to effect a reconciliation, but without success [121] Philip wrote to Diana, expressing his disappointment at Charles's and her extra-marital affairs and asking her to examine both his and her behaviour from the other's point of view [122] She found the letters hard to take but appreciated that he acted with good intent [123] Charles and Diana separated in 1992 [124] and divorced in 1996 [125]\n\n\nLongevity\nIn April 2009, Philip became the longest-serving British royal consort, surpassing Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III [129] He became the oldest-ever male British royal in February 2013 and the third-longest-lived member of the British royal family (following Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) in April 2019 [130] Personally, he was not enthused about living an extremely long life, remarking in a 2000 interview (when he was 79) that he could not \"imagine anything worse\" and had \"no desire whatsoever\" to become a centenarian, saying \"bits of me are falling off already\" [131]\n\n\nFinal years and retirement\nPhilip retired from royal duties on 2 August 2017, meeting Royal Marines in his final solo public engagement, aged 96 Since 1952, he had completed 22,219 solo engagements British prime minister Theresa May thanked him for \"a remarkable lifetime of service\" [152] [153] On 20 November 2017, he celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary with Elizabeth, which made her the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary [154]\n\n\nDeath\nPhilip died of \"old age\" [180] [fn 4] on the morning of 9 April 2021 at Windsor Castle, at the age of 99 He was the longest-serving royal consort in world history [182] Elizabeth, who was reportedly at her husband's bedside when he died, [183] described his death as \"having left a huge void in her life\" [184]\n\n\nLegacy\nPhilip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport's early rule book was drafted under his supervision [199] He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes [200]\n\n\nInterests\nPhilip played polo until 1971 when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped to expand; the sport's early rule book was drafted under his supervision [199] He was also a keen yachtsman and struck up a friendship in 1949 with boat designer and sailing enthusiast Uffa Fox in Cowes [200]\n\n\nPersonality and image\nPhilip's down-to-earth manner was attested to by a White House butler, who recalled that, on a visit in 1976, Philip engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation and poured them drinks [208] [fn 5] As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, [210] Philip was noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, politically incorrect, or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background [211] [212] [213] [214] [215] In an address to the General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: \"Dontopedalogy is the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years.\" [216] Later in life, he suggested his comments may have contributed to the perception that he was \"a cantankerous old sod\" [217]\n\n\nCentenary\nTo mark the centenary of Philip's birth in June 2021, the Royal Collection Trust held an exhibition at Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse Titled Prince Philip: A Celebration, it showcased around 150 personal items related to him, including his wedding card, wedding menu, midshipman's logbook from 1940 to 1941, Chair of Estate, and the coronation robes and coronet that he wore for his wife's coronation in 1953 [227] [228] George Alexis Weymouth's portrait of Philip in the ruins of Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992 formed part of a focus on Philip's involvement with the subsequent restoration [228]\n\n\nPortrayals\nPhilip has been portrayed by several actors, including Stewart Granger (The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana, 1982), Christopher Lee (Charles & Diana: A Royal Love Story, 1982), David Threlfall (The Queen's Sister, 2005), James Cromwell (The Queen, 2006), and Finn Elliot, Matt Smith, Tobias Menzies, and Jonathan Pryce (The Crown, 2016 onwards) [233] [234] He also appears as a fictional character in Nevil Shute's novel In the Wet (1952), Paul Gallico's novel Mrs 'Arris Goes to Moscow (1974), Tom Clancy's novel Patriot Games (1987), and Sue Townsend's novel The Queen and I (1992) [235]\n\n\nBooks\nPhilip authored:\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nPhilip held many titles throughout his life Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles before he married and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles [49] Elizabeth formally issued letters patent in 1957 making him a British prince [89]\n\n\nHonours and honorary military appointments\nPhilip was awarded medals from Britain, France, and Greece for his service during the Second World War, as well as ones commemorating the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II and the silver, gold and diamond jubilees of Elizabeth [236] George VI appointed him to the Order of the Garter on the eve of his wedding on 19 November 1947 Since then, Philip received 17 appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth and 48 from foreign states The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu, worship Philip as a god-like spiritual figure; the islanders possess portraits of him and hold feasts on his birthday [237]\n\n\nArms\nBoth Philip and Elizabeth were great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, Elizabeth by descent from Victoria's eldest son, King Edward VII, and Philip by descent from Victoria's second daughter, Princess Alice Both were also descended from King Christian IX of Denmark [38]\nPhilip was also related to the House of Romanov through all four of his grandparents His paternal grandmother was the granddaughter of

{"title": "Rus'_people", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Rusʹ remains not only in names such as Russia and Belarus, but it is also preserved in many place names in the Novgorod and Pskov districts, and it is the origin of the Greek Rōs [5] Rus' is generally considered to be a borrowing from Finnic Ruotsi (\"Sweden\") [5] [6] [7] There are two theories behind the origin of Rus'/Ruotsi, which are not mutually exclusive It is either derived more directly from OEN rōþer (OWN róðr [8]), which referred to rowing, the fleet levy, etc., or it is derived from this term through Rōþin, an older name for the Swedish coastal region Roslagen [5] [6] [9] [10]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nScandinavian sources\nIn Scandinavian sources, the area is called Austr (the \"East\"), Garðaríki (the \"realm of cities\"), or simply Garðar (the \"cities\"), and Svíþjóð hin mikla (\"Great Sweden\") The last name appears in the 12th century geographical work Leiðarvísir ok Borgaskipan by the Icelandic abbot Nicolaus (d 1161) and in Ynglinga saga by Snorri Sturluson, which indicates that the Icelanders considered Kievan Rus' to have been founded by the Swedes The name \"Great Sweden\" is introduced as a non-Icelandic name with the phrase \"which we call Garðaríki\" (sú er vér köllum Garðaríki), and it is possible that it is a folk etymological interpretation of Scythia magna However, if this is the case, it can still be influenced by the tradition that Kievan Rus' was of Swedish origin, which recalls Magna Graecia as a name for the Greek colonies in Italy [52]\n\n\nSlavic sources\nThe earliest Slavonic-language narrative account of Rus' history is the Primary Chronicle, compiled and adapted from a wide range of sources in Kiev at the start of the 13th century It has therefore been influential in modern history-writing, but it was also compiled much later than the time it describes, and historians agree it primarily reflects the political and religious politics of the time of Mstislav I of Kiev.\n\n\nArabic sources\nArabic-language sources for the Rus' people are relatively numerous, with over 30 relevant passages in roughly contemporaneous sources [71] It can be difficult to be sure that when Arabic sources talk about Rus' they mean the same thing as modern scholars [72] [73] Sometimes it seems to be a general term for Scandinavians: when Al-Yaqūbi recorded Rūs attacking Seville in 844, he was almost certainly talking about Vikings based in Frankia [74] [75] At other times, it might denote people other than or alongside Scandinavians: thus the Mujmal al-Tawarikh calls the Khazars and Rus' 'brothers'; later, Muhammad al-Idrisi, Al-Qazwini, and Ibn Khaldun all identified the Rus' as a sub-group of the Turks [76] These uncertainties have fed into debates about the origins of the Rus'.\n\n\nByzantine sources\nWhen the Varangians first appeared in Constantinople (the Paphlagonian expedition of the Rusʹ in the 820s and the Siege of Constantinople in 860), the Byzantines seem to have perceived these people, whom they called the  Rhos (Greek: Ῥώς), [85] as a different people from the Slavs At least no source says they are part of the Slavic race Characteristically, Pseudo-Simeon and Theophanes Continuatus refer to the Rhos as dromitai (Δρομῖται), a word related to the Greek word meaning a run,  suggesting the mobility of their movement by waterways [86]\n\n\nWestern European sources\nThe first Western European source to mention the Rus' are the Annals of St Bertin (Annales Bertiniani) [94] These relate that Emperor Louis the Pious' court at Ingelheim, in 839, was visited by a delegation from the Byzantine emperor In this delegation there were men who called themselves Rhos (in the Latin text, .. qui se, id est gentem suam, Rhos vocari dicebant, ...; translated by Aleksandr Nazarenko as .. who stated that they, i.e their nation, were called Rhos, ...)

They were a complex and diverse group, with a rich history and culture that was shaped by their interactions with other peoples, including the Scandinavians, Slavs, and Byzantines.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Rus' remains not only in names such as Russia and Belarus, but it is also preserved in many place names in the Novgorod and Pskov districts, and it is the origin of the Greek Rōs. Rus' is generally considered to be a borrowing from Finnic Ruotsi (\"Sweden\"). There are two theories behind the origin of Rus'/Ruotsi, which are not mutually exclusive. It is either derived more directly from OEN rōþer (OWN róðr), which referred to rowing, the fleet levy, etc., or it is derived from this term through Rōþin, an older name for the Swedish coastal region Roslagen.\n\n**History**\n\n### Scandinavian Sources\n\nIn Scandinavian sources, the area is called Austr (the \"East\"), Garðaríki (the \"realm of cities\"), or simply Garðar (the \"cities\"), and Svíþjóð hin mikla (\"Great Sweden\"). The last name appears in the 12th century geographical work Leiðarvísir ok Borgaskipan by the Icelandic abbot Nicolaus (d 1161) and in Ynglinga saga by Snorri Sturluson, which indicates that the Icelanders considered Kievan Rus' to have been founded by the Swedes. The name \"Great Sweden\" is introduced as a non-Icelandic name with the phrase \"which we call Garðaríki\" (sú er vér köllum Garðaríki), and it is possible that it is a folk etymological interpretation of Scythia magna.\n\n### Slavic Sources\n\nThe earliest Slavonic-language narrative account of Rus' history is the Primary Chronicle, compiled and adapted from a wide range of sources in Kiev at the start of the 13th century. It has therefore been influential in modern history-writing, but it was also compiled much later than the time it describes, and historians agree it primarily reflects the political and religious politics of the time of Mstislav I of Kiev.\n\n### Arabic Sources\n\nArabic-language sources for the Rus' people are relatively numerous, with over 30 relevant passages in roughly contemporaneous sources. It can be difficult to be sure that when Arabic sources talk about Rus' they mean the same thing as modern scholars. Sometimes it seems to be a general term for Scandinavians: when Al-Yaqūbi recorded Rūs attacking Seville in 844, he was almost certainly talking about Vikings based in Frankia. At other times, it might denote people other than or alongside Scandinavians: thus the Mujmal al-Tawarikh calls the Khazars and Rus' 'brothers'; later, Muhammad al-Idrisi, Al-Qazwini, and Ibn Khaldun all identified the Rus' as a sub-group of the Turks.\n\n### Byzantine Sources\n\nWhen the Varangians first appeared in Constantinople (the Paphlagonian expedition of the Rus' in the 820s and the Siege of Constantinople in 860), the Byzantines seem to have perceived these people, whom they called the Rhos, as a different people from the Slavs. At least no source says they are part of the Slavic race. Characteristically, Pseudo-Simeon and Theophanes Continuatus refer to the Rhos as dromitai (Δρομῖται), a word related to the Greek word meaning a run, suggesting the mobility of their movement by waterways.\n\n### Western European Sources\n\nThe first Western European source to mention the Rus' are the Annals of St Bertin (Annales Bertiniani). These relate that Emperor Louis the Pious' court at Ingelheim, in 839, was visited by a delegation from the Byzantine emperor. In this delegation there were men who called themselves Rhos (in the Latin text, .. qui se, id est gentem suam, Rhos vocari dicebant, ...; translated by Aleksandr Nazarenko as .. who stated that they, i.e their nation, were called Rhos, ...). Once Louis enquired the reason of their arrival (in the Latin text, .. Quorum adventus causam imperator diligentius investigans, ...), he learnt that they were Swedes (eos gentis esse Sueonum; verbatim, their nation is Sveoni).\n\n**Assimilation**\n\nThe Scandinavian influence in Kievan Rus' was most important during the late 9th c and during the 10th c. In 976, Vladimir the Great (Valdamarr gamli) fled from his brother Yaropolk to Sweden, ruled by Erik the Victorious, where he gathered an invasion force that he used to conquer Kievan Rus'. Vladimir was initially a pagan who is reported by the Primary Chronicle to have worshiped Perun and Veles, and this is probably a Slavic translation of the corresponding Norse gods Thor and Freyr.\n\n**Urban**\n\nThe Rus' elite became bilingual c 950 but it was not until the end of the 11th century that Old East Slavic can be shown to have become their native language. Until the mid-10th century all the attested Rus' names were Norse. In the Rus'–Byzantine Treaty of 944 or 945 there are 76 names among whom 12 belong to the ruling family, 11 to emissaries, 27 to other agents, and 26 to merchants. In the princely family, there are three Slavic names: Svjatoslav, son of prince Igor' (Ingvar) and Volodislav and Predslava (of unknown relation). The other members of the family have Norse names.\n\n**Rural**\n\nThere are remains of Old Norse culture as late as the 14th and early 15th centuries in the form of runic or rune-like inscriptions and as personal names. The c 1000 birch-bark letters from Novgorod contain hundreds of names, most of them Slavic or Christian, and according to Melnikova there are seven letters with Old Norse names.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe Norse influence is considered to have left many traces on the Old East Slavic legal code, the Russkaja Pravda, and on literary works such as The Tale of Igor's Campaign, and even on the Byliny, which are old heroic tales about the early Kievan Rus'. Several scholars note that this is \"of considerable importance generally, as far as social and cultural background of language is concerned\".\n\n**Archaeology**\n\nNumerous artefacts of Scandinavian affinity have been found in northern Russia (as well as artefacts of Slavic origin in Sweden). However, exchange between the northern and southern shores of the Baltic had occurred since the Iron Age (albeit limited to immediately coastal areas). Northern Russia and adjacent Finnic lands had become a profitable meeting ground for peoples of diverse origins, especially for the trade of furs, and attracted by the presence of oriental silver from the mid-8th century AD.\n\n**Historiography**\n\nPrior to the 18th century, it was the consensus of Russian historians that the Rus' arose out of the native Slavic populations of the region. This changed following a 1749 presentation by German historian Gerhardt Friedrich Müller before the Russian Academy of Sciences, built in part on earlier work by Gottlieb-Siegfried Bayer and based on primary sources, particularly the Russian Primary Chronicle. He suggested that the founders of the Rus' were ethnically Scandinavian Varangians, what became known as the 'Normanist' view.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nThe cemetery of Ostriv is located in the region along the Ros' River. By 2020, 67 inhumation graves had been excavated there and dated from the early 11th century. Most of the artefacts found there are uncommon in Ukraine, but typical for the East Baltic region. This suggests a complex multi-ethnic population, presumably consisting of Baltic region migrants and locals.

Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom \"Three's Company\" (the Americanized version of the 1970s British Thames Television series \"Man About the House\") in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, Ritter played Ringo Starr's manager on the television special \"Ringo.\" In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in the animated film \"The Flight of Dragons.\"\n\n## Theater\n\nIn 2000, Ritter co-starred with Henry Winkler in Neil Simon's \"The Dinner Party\" at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway, portraying Claude Pichon. It ran for 364 performances. Ritter won the Theatre World Award in 2001 for his performance in that work. In 2003, Ritter made his final stage appearance in \"All About Eve\" at the Ahmanson Theatre.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nOn October 16, 1977, Ritter married actress Nancy Morgan, with whom he had three children: Jason, Carly, and Tyler. They divorced on September 1, 1996. He married actress Amy Yasbeck on September 18, 1999, at the Murphy Theatre in Wilmington, Ohio. They had a child born in 1998.

Yasbeck also played Ritter's wife in two sitcom appearances.\n\nIn 1991, both were guest stars on \"The Cosby Show,\" in which Yasbeck played the in-labor wife of Ritter's basketball coach character. In 1996, Ritter guest-starred on Yasbeck's sitcom, \"Wings,\" as the estranged husband of Yasbeck's character, Casey.\n\n## Death\n\nOn September 11, 2003, Ritter was rehearsing for \"8 Simple Rules...\" for Dating My Teenage Daughter on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank, California, when he suddenly fell ill: sweating profusely, vomiting, and complaining of chest pain. He was taken across the street to the Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center (the same hospital where he had been born) at 6:00 pm.\n\nRitter was initially treated by emergency room physicians for an assumed heart attack; however, his condition quickly worsened. Ritter was then diagnosed with aortic dissection and taken into surgery, but was pronounced dead at 10:48 pm, at the age of 54.\n\n## Response and Legacy\n\nMany of Ritter's colleagues expressed sorrow following the news of his death. Zach Braff, who worked with Ritter on \"Scrubs,\" called Ritter a \"comic hero\" of his and said he had approached series creator Bill Lawrence to get Ritter to play his character J.D.'s father (which Ritter did for two episodes and was slated to return for a third the week following his death).\n\nKatey Sagal testified in the wrongful death lawsuit, calling Ritter a \"funny man who was funny like

first-class tournaments in India In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team [18] [19]\n\n\nEarly history (1700s–1918)\nThe British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721 [13] It was

played English county teams and not the England cricket team [18] [19]\n\n\nTest match status (1918–1970)\nIndia was invited to the International Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932, led by CK Nayudu, who was considered the best Indian batsman at the time [21] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London The team was not strong in their batting [22] at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs [23] India hosted its first men's Test cricket series in 1933 when England toured India The visitors won the three-test series 2-0 with the matches held at Bombay (now Mumbai), Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Chennai (Madras) [24] The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and 1940s but did not achieve an international victory during this period In the early 1940s, India did not play any men's Test cricket due to World War II The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Don Bradman's Australia [25] It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England Australia men's cricket team won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer [26] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England, but against the West Indies in 1948 West Indies won the five Test series 1–0 [27] India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras in 1952 [28] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan [29] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956 However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5–0 whitewash ever inflicted by England [30] The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62 and also won a home series against New Zealand They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68 [31]\n\n\nOne-day cricket and ICC Cricket World Cup success (1970–1985)\nThe advent of men's One Day International (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup [37] Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975; India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs [38]\n\n\nLate 20th century (1985–2000)\nThe addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team The following year, Javagal Srinath, India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semi-final, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998 [46]\n\n\n21st century\nThe team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five-year bans respectively [49] [50] This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour\" [51] However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and led Indian cricket out of the dark times The first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era [52]\n\n\nGoverning body\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Its headquarters is situated in the 'Cricket centre' at Churchgate in Mumbai, Maharashtra Amongst the richest sporting organisations in the world, it sold media rights for India's matches from 2006 to 2010 for $612,000,000 [79] Roger Binny is present BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.\n\n\nSelection committee\nSelection for the Indian cricket team occurs through the BCCI's zonal selection policy, where each of the five zones is represented by one selector and one of the members nominated by BCCI as the chairman of the selection committee This has sometimes led to controversy as to whether these selectors are biased towards their zones [82]\n\n\nTeam colours\nIndia plays its Test cricket matches with the traditional cricket whites with navy blue caps and helmets The uniforms worn in limited-overs matches have different shades of blue for ODIs and T20Is, with sometimes a splash of the colours that are present in the Indian flag [88]\n\n\nSponsorship\nDream11 (Sporta Technologies Pvt Ltd.) was announced as the sponsor for the team on 1 July 2023 [106] Their sponsorship is supposed to run until 31 March 2026 for a period of three years [107]\n\n\nTeam sponsorship\nDream11 (Sporta Technologies Pvt Ltd.) was announced as the sponsor for the team on 1 July 2023 [106] Their

numerous world-renowned cricket stadiums located in India Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877 The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in Bombay in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at Eden Gardens and Chepauk The Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a five-Test series There are 21 stadiums in India that have hosted at least one official Test match In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India [126] [127]\n\n\nCaptains\nA total of 35 men have captained the Indian men's cricket team in at least one Test match, although only six have led the team in more than 25 matches, and six have captained the team in men's ODIs but not Tests India's first captain of the men's cricket team was C K Nayudu, who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933–34 Lala Amarnath, India's fourth captain of the men's cricket team and the first Indian to score a century in Test cricket while playing for India, led the team in its first Test match after Indian independence He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952–53 From 1952 until 1961–62, India men's cricket team had a number of captains such as Vijay Hazare, Polly Umrigar and Nari Contractor [136] [137]\n\n\nCurrent squad\nThe BCCI released the list of their 2023–24 annual player contracts on 28 February 2024 [158] Players can still be upgraded to a Grade C annual player contract on a pro-rata basis by meeting the criteria of playing a minimum of three Tests or eight ODIs or ten T20Is in the specified period (1 October 2023 to 30 September

holds a large number of national batting records He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests [239] The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by Virender Sehwag in Chennai It is the second triple century in Test cricket by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest score was 36 against Australia in 2020 [240] In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5

India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs [241]\n\n\nFan following\nOwing to the massive Indian diaspora in nations like Australia, England and South Africa, a large Indian fan turnout is expected whenever India plays in each of these nations There have been a number of official fan groups that have been formed over the years, including the Swami Army or Indian Army, [257] the Indian equivalent of the Barmy Army, that were very active in their support when India toured Australia in 2003/2004 They are known to attribute a number of popular Indian songs to the cricket team [258]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**India national cricket

Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975; India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\n\n**Late 20th century (1985–2000)**\n\nThe addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath, India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semi-final, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998.\n\n**21st century**\n\nThe team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five-year bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour.\" However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble, and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and led Indian cricket out of the dark times. The first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.\n\n**Governing body**\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India. The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the International Cricket Council (ICC). Its headquarters is situated in the 'Cricket centre' at Churchgate in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

From 1952 until 1961-62, India men's cricket team had a number of captains such as Vijay Hazare, Polly Umrigar, and Nari Contractor.\n\n**Current squad**\n\nThe BCCI released the list of their 2023-24 annual player contracts on 28 February 2024.

the British ships The East India Company tried to manage the Kolis through cricket and were successful [14] [15] [16] In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877 [17] By 1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year [17] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team [18] [19]\n\n\nEarly history

{"title": "Sandra_Lee_(chef)", "content": "\nEarly life\nLee was born in Santa Monica, California, [2] in 1966, the daughter of Vicky Svitak and Wayne Waldroop, [5] who had been  high-school sweethearts When Sandra was two, her mother sent her, along with her younger sister, Cindy, to live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine Waldroop [6] [7] In 1972, after divorcing Wayne, Lee's mother moved with her girls to Sumner, Washington, where they acquired a new stepfather, whose last name (Christiansen) Lee took Vicky had three additional children in the 1970s: Kimber, [8] [9] Richie, and John Paul [10] Due to her mother's illness and the absence of her and her siblings' fathers, Lee effectively raised her four younger siblings [5] [10] [11] In her youth, Lee learned how to feed her younger siblings frugally with a combination of food stamps and welfare payments, an experience that informed her future approach to cooking [4] [11]\n\n\nCareer\nIn the early 1990s, Lee created a product called \"Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains,\" a home-decorating kit designed to turn a wire rack and sheets, or other spare fabric, into decorative drapery It was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent [16] In her first 18 months, Lee sold $20 million worth of merchandise [17] QVC also selected Lee to launch its craft and home decorating categories on its networks in the U.K and Germany In 1994, she released her first DIY home improvement video series, which sold more than a million copies [18]\n\n\nDocumentaries\nIn 2015, shortly before being diagnosed with cancer, Lee started her own production company [37] [38] She created Rx: Early Detection – A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee, a documentary about her experiences with cancer, which aired on HBO [39] The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, [40] at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, [41] [42] and on HBO in October 2018 [39] [43] Lee received the Made in New York Award at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November 2018 for her work on the documentary [44] [20]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nLee co-founded the Los Angeles chapter of UNICEF in 2000 [49] [50] She donated the proceeds from her second cookbook to God's Love We Deliver and Project Angel Food, two organizations that deliver food to homebound individuals [19] In 2015, she led a UNICEF team on a mission to Haiti in her role as a special nutrition emissary for the organization [49] The U.S division of the UN's World Food Program, the world's largest humanitarian organization, [51] appointed Lee to its board of directors in May 2020 [50]\n\n\nCritical response\nHsiao-Ching Chou of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote a review of Lee's cookbook Semi-Homemade Cooking in 2002 that criticized both her recipes and her \"semi-homemade\" concept [56] She then wrote a follow-up column, noting that the review received a response \"that was more impassioned than I anticipated\" Chou wrote that, though most readers agreed with her, a number of readers took Lee's position, including one who wrote, \"Lots of people who don't want to take the

(chef)**\n\nSandra Lee is a renowned American chef, television host, and author, best known for her cooking shows and cookbooks that promote semi-homemade cooking. Her career spans over two decades, during which she has established herself as a household name in the culinary world.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSandra Lee was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1966, to Vicky Svitak and Wayne Waldroop. When Lee was two years old, her mother sent her and her younger sister, Cindy, to live with their paternal grandmother, Lorraine Waldroop. In 1972, after divorcing Wayne, Lee's mother moved with her girls to Sumner, Washington, where they acquired a new stepfather, whose last name (Christiansen) Lee took. Vicky had three additional children in the 1970s: Kimber, Richie, and John Paul. Due to her mother's illness and the absence of her and her siblings' fathers, Lee effectively raised her four younger siblings. In her youth, Lee learned how to feed her younger siblings frugally with a combination of food stamps and welfare payments, an experience that informed her future approach to cooking.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lee created a product called \"Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains,\" a home-decorating kit designed to turn a wire rack and sheets, or other spare fabric, into decorative drapery. It was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent. In her first 18 months, Lee sold $20 million worth of merchandise. QVC also selected Lee to launch its craft and home decorating categories on its networks in the U.K and Germany. In 1994, she released her first DIY home improvement video series, which sold more than a million copies.\n\n**Documentaries**\n\nIn 2015, shortly before being diagnosed with cancer, Lee started her own production company. She created Rx: Early Detection – A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee, a documentary about her experiences with cancer, which aired on HBO. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, and on HBO in October 2018. Lee received the Made in New York Award at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November 2018 for her work on the documentary.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nLee co-founded the Los Angeles chapter of UNICEF in 2000. She donated the proceeds from her second cookbook to God's Love We Deliver and Project Angel Food, two organizations that deliver food to homebound individuals. In 2015, she led a UNICEF team on a mission to Haiti in her role as a special nutrition emissary for the organization. The U.S division of the UN's World Food Program, the world's largest humanitarian organization, appointed Lee to its board of directors in May 2020.\n\n**Critical Response**\n\nHsiao-Ching Chou of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote a review of Lee's cookbook Semi-Homemade Cooking in 2002 that criticized both her recipes and her \"semi-homemade\" concept. She then wrote a follow-up column, noting that the review received a response \"that was more impassioned than I anticipated.\" Chou wrote that, though most readers agreed with her, a number of readers took Lee's position, including one who wrote, \"Lots of people who don't want to take the time to shred a cup of carrots want to cook a good meal.\"\n\n**Kwanzaa Cake**\n\nMuch criticism of Lee coalesced around a recipe for \"Kwanzaa Cake\" that she demonstrated on a 2003 episode of Semi-Homemade Cooking with Sandra Lee.

By then she had undergone a lumpectomy, and was scheduled to have a double mastectomy later in the week. Governor Cuomo was to take some personal time to be with her during and after the surgery. In August 2015, she contracted an infection in her right breast that resulted in her going on bed rest and receiving intravenous drugs for three months. Lee announced that she was cancer free in late 2015. Seven years after undergoing her double mastectomy, Lee underwent a hysterectomy procedure in March 2022. Her surgery was successful.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nLee has received the President's Volunteer Service Award, the Eleanor Roosevelt Medal of Honor, and, in 2009, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. In 2018, the New York City Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment presented Lee with the Made in NY Award at the Gotham Independent Film Awards.\n\n**Cookbooks**\n\nLee has written several cookbooks, including Semi-Homemade Cooking, Semi-Homemade Desserts, and Semi-Homemade Comfort Foods.

Lady Gaga's song \"Americano\" was also featured in the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was originally set for release on November 4, 2011, but it was instead pushed a week earlier to October 28, 2011.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't deep or groundbreaking, but what it lacks in profundity, Puss in Boots more than makes up for with an abundance of wit, visual sparkle, and effervescent charm.\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was an \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing over $555 million worldwide.

The series is set before the events of the movie and follows the adventures of Puss in Boots and his friends.\n\n**Sequel**\n\nIn 2012, director Chris Miller stated that he would love to make a Puss in Boots sequel as the character was set up to have more fantastic, surreal, and funnier adventures. However, in 2015, the sequel was removed from the release schedule following a corporate restructuring and DreamWorks Animation's new policy to release two films a year.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nThe film's success has also led to the development of several video games, including Puss in Boots: The Game, which was released in 2011 for various platforms.

With a career spanning over eight decades, he has established himself as a versatile and accomplished actor, able to play a wide range of characters, from suave and lecherous leads to dramatic and nuanced roles.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nLeslie Samuel Phillips was born on 20 April 1924, in Tottenham, a suburb of London. He was the third child of Cecelia Margaret (née Newlove) and Frederick Samuel Phillips, who worked at Glover and Main, manufacturers of cookers in Edmonton. Phillips has described his childhood as a mix of cockney and Essex influences, having grown up in the East End of London, but also spending time in the countryside of Essex. In 1931, the family moved to Chingford, where Phillips attended Larkswood Primary School.\n\nPhillips' early life was marked by hardship, particularly after his father's death in 1935. His father had suffered from a weak heart and oedema brought on by the \"filthy, sulphurous\" air of the factory. Phillips has spoken about the difficulties his family faced after his father's passing, and how he had to take on a part-time job to support his family. However, his father's death also had a profound impact on Phillips, who has said that it made him appreciate the importance of family and the value of hard work.\n\n**Career**\n\nPhillips made his stage debut in 1937, as a wolf in Peter Pan, alongside Anna Neagle at the London Palladium. This was followed by a promotion to the role of John Napoleon Darling in the 1938-39 season, alongside Jean Forbes-Robertson as Peter and Seymour Hicks as Captain Hook. Acting allowed Phillips to earn extra money for his family, who had struggled financially after his father's death.\n\nPhillips continued to work in theatre, appearing in a range of shows, including musicals and dramas. He also began to appear in film, starting with small roles in the 1940s. However, it wasn't until the 1950s that he started to gain recognition for his work in comedy films, particularly in the Carry On series. He went on to appear in a range of films, including Carry On Nurse (1959), Carry On Constable (1960), and Carry On Cleo (1964).\n\n**Early Work**\n\nPhillips' early work in film was marked by small roles in a range of comedies. He appeared in films such as Doctor in the House (1954), Doctor at Large (1955), and Doctor's Dilemma (1958). However, it was his work in the Carry On series that brought him to wider recognition. He appeared in a range of Carry On films, including Nurse (1959), Constable (1960), and Cleo (1964).\n\nPhillips' work in the Carry On series was marked by his ability to play a range of comedic roles, from the suave and lecherous leads to the bumbling and inept characters. He became known for his unique blend of charm and humor, and his ability to play characters who were both lovable and laughable.\n\n**Later Work**\n\nBy the early 1980s, Phillips considered his suave and lecherous roles to be \"a bit of a rut\" and looked to branch out into dramatic roles. A relatively minor part in Out of Africa (1985) facilitated a larger role in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987). To play an emaciated prisoner of war in the film, Phillips lost more than two stone.\n\nPhillips became busy as a character actor in both stage and television productions. He appeared in shows such as Scandal (1989) and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). In 1992, he returned to the Carry On series in the poorly-received Carry On Columbus. Phillips also provided the voice for the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter films, appearing in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), and the final film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).\n\n**Personal Life, Illness, and Death**\n\nPhillips married his first wife, actress Penelope Bartley (1925-1981), on 30 May 1948. The couple had four children. In 1962, Phillips began a relationship with actress Caroline Mortimer, daughter of writer Penelope Mortimer and stepdaughter of John Mortimer, who was an understudy in a stage play in which Phillips starred. Phillips and Bartley separated at that point and were divorced in 1965.\n\nPhillips has spoken about the challenges he faced in his personal life, including his struggles with his first wife and his subsequent relationship with Caroline Mortimer. He has also spoken about the importance of his family and the value of hard work.\n\nPhillips was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2011. He passed away on 7 November 2022, at the age of 98.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Doctor in the House (1954)\n* Doctor at Large (1955)\n* Doctor's Dilemma (1958)\n* Carry On Nurse (1959)\n* Carry On Constable (1960)\n* Carry On Cleo (1964)\n* Out of Africa (1985)\n* Empire of the Sun (1987)\n* Scandal (1989)\n* Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)\n* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)\n* Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\n* Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)\n\n**Selected Television**\n\n* Scandal (1989)\n* Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)\n\n**Selected Radio**\n\n* The Archers (1990s)\n\n**Other Voice Work**\n\n* The Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter films\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Leslie Phillips\".

The show's concept revolves around a group of contestants, typically 20, who are looking for love and a chance to win a significant cash prize. The show's format has undergone several changes over the years, but the core idea remains the same: contestants pair up and try to find their perfect match.\n\n**Series Overview**\n\nAre You the One? is filmed in various locations around the world, including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. The show's premise is simple: a group of contestants live together in a shared house, and each week, they participate in challenges and games designed to test their relationships and compatibility. The contestants are paired up, and if they think they've found their perfect match, they can go to the \"Truth Booth\" to find out if they're right.\n\n**Season 1**\n\nThe first season of Are You the One? premiered on January 21, 2014, and was filmed in Kauai, Hawaii. The season featured 20 contestants, all looking for love and a chance to win a one million dollar prize to split. The season's format was straightforward: contestants paired up, and if they thought they'd found their perfect match, they could go to the Truth Booth to find out if they were right.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nThe second season of Are You the One? premiered on October 6, 2014, and was filmed in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This season introduced a new twist: one of the guys had two matches, which meant there would be 11 girls, but only 10 boys. Christina was revealed as the first girl of the threeway couple, and it was a race between Christina and another girl to find her perfect match and be confirmed as such in the Truth-Booth. The first couple of the threeway-couple to do so would end up in the honeymoon-suite, while the other girl would have to leave empty-handed.\n\n**Season 3**\n\nThe third season of Are You the One? premiered on September 24, 2015, and was filmed in Kona, Hawaii. This season introduced a new rule change: if there was a \"black out\" at a matchup ceremony (meaning no beams of light other than already-confirmed matches), then the house would get $250,000 deducted from their prize.\n\n**Season 4**\n\nThe fourth season of Are You the One? premiered on June 13, 2016, and was filmed in Maui, Hawaii.\n\n**Season 5**\n\nThe fifth season of Are You the One? premiered on January 11, 2017, and was filmed in Cabarete, Dominican Republic. This season featured two big changes: when a couple got sent into the Truth Booth to see if they were a perfect match, the rest of the house could either vote to see if they were a perfect match, or earn $150,000, and not see the result of the couple. Additionally, if the house blacked out at a match-up ceremony, their money would decrease by 50% each time instead of $250,000.\n\n**Season 6**\n\nThe sixth season of Are You the One? premiered on September 20, 2017, and was filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\n**Season 7**\n\nThe seventh season of Are You the One? premiered on August 15, 2018, and was filmed in Kona, Hawaii, Hokukano Bayhouse. This season featured a change in the rules to get a date: contestants no longer had to compete against each other to win a date. Instead, Terrance would choose two people, one guy and one girl, to come up and press a button stopping a scrolling wheel of faces at random of the opposite sex. Two guys and two girls would be chosen at random to go on a four-person date to couple off as they choose. Everyone back at the house then voted which couple they thought most likely to be a 'Perfect Match' into the Truth Booth.\n\n**Season 8**\n\nThe eighth season of Are You the One? premiered on June 26, 2019, and was filmed in Kona, Hawaii. For the first time on Are You the One?, all cast members were sexually fluid, with no gender limitations on their potential perfect matches.\n\n**Season 9**\n\nThe ninth season of Are You the One? premiered on January 18, 2023, and was filmed in Gran Canaria, Spain.\n\n**Are You the One? Second Chances**\n\nOn March 22, 2017, spin-off Are You the One? Second Chances premiered. The series, filmed in Melbourne, Australia and hosted by Karamo Brown, featured ten perfect matches from previous seasons returning to compete in tasks designed to test the strength of their bonds. Each week, teams could add to their potential winnings, but individual contestants had the opportunity to take their team's winnings from their partner and remove their team from the game.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of Are You the One? has included a diverse range of contestants from different backgrounds and with different personalities. Some contestants have gone on to become popular reality TV stars, while others have kept a lower profile.\n\n**Elimination Progress**\n\nThroughout the show's history, contestants have been eliminated in various ways, including being sent home because they didn't find their perfect match, being voted out by their fellow contestants, or failing to win a challenge.\n\n**Bank Accounts**\n\nThroughout the show, contestants have competed to win money for their bank accounts. The bank accounts are a key part of the show, and contestants can earn money by winning challenges, being voted as a perfect match, or by other means.\n\n**International Versions**\n\nAre You the One? has been adapted in several countries around the world, including Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands. The international versions of the show have their own unique twists and formats, but the core concept remains the same.\n\n**References**\n\nFor a full list of references, please see the Wikipedia page on Are You the One?\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Official website\n* MTV's website\n* Twitter account\n* Instagram account", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Are_You_the_One?\" following this outline:\n\n\nSeries overview\nFilmed in Kauai, Hawaii and premiered on January 21, 2014 It featured 20 contestants looking for love in a chance to win a one million dollar prize to split [8] [9]\n\n\nSeason 1\nFilmed in Kauai, Hawaii and premiered on January 21, 2014 It featured 20 contestants looking for love in a chance to win a one million dollar prize to split [8] [9]\n\n\nSeason 2\nFilmed in San Juan, Puerto Rico and premiered on October 6, 2014 This time, one guy has two matches which means that there will be eleven girls, but only ten boys Christina is revealed as the first girl of the threeway couple It is a race between Christina and another girl to find her perfect match and be confirmed as such in the Truth-Booth The first couple of the threeway-couple to do so will end up in the honeymoon-suite The other girl will have to leave empty-handed However this only applied if one of those two matches were confirmed in the Truth Booth If neither Christina nor the other girl get sent home, and the group wins the money by getting 10 matches at the matchup ceremony, then all 21 contestants will win money [10] [11]\n\n\nSeason 3\nFilmed in Kona, Hawaii Season three premiered on September 24, 2015 This season had a rule change, if there is a \"black out\" at a matchup ceremony (meaning no beams of light other than already-confirmed matches) then the house gets $250,000 deducted from their prize [12] [13]\n\n\nSeason 4\nFilmed in Maui, Hawaii Season four premiered on June 13, 2016 [14]\n\n\nSeason 5\nFilmed in Cabarete, Dominican Republic Season five premiered on January 11, 2017 This season featured 2 big changes When a couple gets sent into the truth booth to see if they are a perfect match, the rest of the house can either vote to see if they are a perfect match, or earn $150,000, and not see the result of the couple This only will pertain to certain weeks Also, if the house blacks out at a match-up ceremony, their money will decrease by 50% each time instead of $250,000 [15]\n\n\nSeason 6\nFilmed in New Orleans, Louisiana Season six premiered on September 20, 2017 [16]\n\n\nSeason 7\nFilmed in Kona, Hawaii, Hokukano Bayhouse Season seven premiered on August 15, 2018 This season featured a change in the rules to get a date, the contestants no longer had to compete against each other to win a date Instead, Terrance would choose two people, one guy and one girl, to come up and press a button stopping a scrolling wheel of faces at random of the opposite sex Two guys and two girls would be chosen at random to go on a four-person date to couple off as they choose Everyone back at the house then voted whichever couple they thought most likely to be a 'Perfect Match' into the Truth Booth [17]\n\n\nSeason 8\nFilmed in Kona, Hawaii Season eight premiered on June 26, 2019 [2] For the first time on Are You the One?, all cast members were sexually fluid, [18] with no gender limitations on their potential perfect matches [3] [4] This season received a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2020 [19]\n\n\nSeason 9\nFilmed in Gran Canaria, Spain Season nine premiered on January 18, 2023.\n\n\nAre You the One?

a 2003 EU ban on importation [28] was rescinded after new tolerance levels were set.\n\n\nUses\nBrazil nuts are 3% water, 14% protein, 12% carbohydrates, and 66% fats The fat components are 16% saturated, 24% monounsaturated, and 24% polyunsaturated [37]\n\n\nNutrition\nBrazil nuts are 3% water, 14% protein, 12% carbohydrates, and 66% fats The fat components are 16% saturated, 24% monounsaturated, and 24% polyunsaturated [37]\n\n\nSelenium\nBrazil nuts are a particularly rich source of selenium, with just 28 g (1 oz) supplying 544 micrograms of selenium or 10 times the DV of 55 micrograms [37] [38] However, the amount of selenium within batches of nuts may vary considerably [39]\n\n\nOil\nBrazil nut oil contains 48% unsaturated fatty acids composed mainly of oleic and linoleic acids, the phytosterol, beta-sitosterol, [42] and fat-soluble vitamin E [43]\n\n\nWood\nThe lumber from Brazil nut trees (not to be confused with Brazilwood) is of excellent quality, having diverse uses from flooring to heavy construction [44] Logging the trees is prohibited by law in all three producing countries (Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru) Illegal extraction of timber and land clearances present continuing threats [45] In Brazil, cutting down a Brazil nut tree requires previous authorization from the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources [46] [47]\n\n\nOther uses\nBrazil nut oil is used as a lubricant in clocks [48] and in the manufacturing of paint and cosmetics, such as soap and perfume [44] Because of its hardness, the Brazil nutshell is often pulverized and used as an abrasive to polish materials, such as metals and ceramics, in the same way as jeweler's rouge, while charcoal from the shells can be used to purify water [44]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Taj_Mahal", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"Taj Mahal\" is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj mahall meaning \"crown\" (tāj) \"palace\" (mahall) [4] [5] [6] Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb [7] The name \"Taj\" might have been derived from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\" [8] [9]\n\n\nInspiration\nThe Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum [10] [11] Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later [12] [13]\n\n\nArchitecture and design\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture [16] Inspirations for the building came from Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty) and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht plan of the site [17] [18] The building complex employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols [16] While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time [19] The entire complex sits on platform measuring 300 metres (980 ft) in length and 8.7 metres (28.5 ft) in height on the banks of Yamuna river The platform is built with varying patterns of dark and light colored sandstone [20]\n\n\nExterior\nThe mausoleum building is the central structure of the entire complex It is a white marble structure standing on a 6-metre (20 ft) high square plinth with sides measuring 95.5 metres (313 ft) in length The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an eight-sided structure that is approximately 57.3 metres (188 ft) long on each of the four long sides [21]\n\n\nInterior\nThe main inner chamber is an octagon with 7.3-metre (24 ft) sides, with the design allowing for entry from each face with the main door facing the garden to the south Two tiers of eight pishtaq arches are located along the walls, similar to the exterior [31] The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony's exterior window has an intricate jali The inner wall is open along the axes where jali screens are fitted which transmit light from the exterior to the interior of the main chamber [32] Except the south side, other three sides consist of an open elongated room flanked by two square cells covered with decorated ceilings set on the platform The central room has arched openings on three sides fitted with jalis filled with panes of glass and a small rectangular window cut into the central jali [32] The square cells which are reached through separate doors were probably originally used for visitors and Qur'an reciters as a place to rest Staircases lead from the ground floor to the roof level, where there are corridors between the central hall and the two corner rooms in the south with a system of ventilation shafts [20]\n\n\nGarden\nThe complex is set around a large 300 m2 (3,200 sq ft) charbagh or Mughal garden The garden is divided by two main walkways (khiyaban) into four quadrants with further raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds The garden is surrounded by a walkway connecting all the quadrants Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with five fountains and a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the \"Tank of Abundance\" promised to Muhammad [36] Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees and fountains [37] In the north-western quadrant, is a place that marks the site where Mumtaz Mahal was first buried, before her body was moved to its final resting place inside the main chamber of the mausoleum [38]\n\n\nOutlying buildings\nThe Taj Mahal complex is enclosed by crenellated red sandstone walls on three sides, with the side facing the Yamuna river left open Outside the complex walls, there are other mausoleums dedicated to Shah Jahan's other wives, royals and favorite servants The inner sides of the walls feature columned arcades typical of Hindu temples, adorned with domed cuppola like chattris and smaller structures like the Music House interspersed between them The main gateway, primarily built of marble, mirrors the tomb's architecture and incorporates intricate decorations like bas-relief and pietra dura inlays At the far end of the complex stand two similar buildings built of red sandstone, one of which is designated as a mosque and the other as a jawab, a structure to provide architectural symmetry The mosque's design resembles others built during the era and the jawab has floors with inlaid patterns while lacking a mihrab [13]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe land on which the Taj Mahal is situated was present to the south of the walled city of Agra which was given to Shah Jahan by Raja Jai Singh I in exchange for a large palace in the centre of Agra [45] The building was commissioned in 1631, and construction commenced in 1632 [22] [13] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with lime and stone to form the footings of the tomb The platform above the ground was constructed of brick and mortar [21]\n\n\nLater years\nIn December 1652, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb wrote a letter to his father about the tomb, the mosque and the assembly hall of the complex developing extensive leaks during the previous rainy season [52] In 1658, Shah Jahan was deposed by Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal Upon Shah Jahan's death in 1666, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife [53] In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur attacked the Taj Mahal while invading Agra and took away two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which had hung over the main cenotaph and the gold and silver screen Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the 4.6-metre-high (15 ft) finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation [54]\n\n\nSymbolism\nDue to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself [73]\n\n\nTourism\nThe Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts a large number of domestic and foreign visitors About five million visitors visited Taj Mahal in the financial year 2022–23 [3] A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners As of 2024 [update], the fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was ₹540 and for other foreign tourists, it was ₹1,100 Visitors are allowed through three gates and as polluting vehicles are not allowed near the complex, tourists must either walk or take electric buses from the designated parking areas The complex is open on all days except on Friday from one hour before sunrise to 45 minutes before sunset [79] The complex is open for limited night viewing on the day of the full moon, excluding the month of Ramadan [80] In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours [81]\n\n\nMyths\nEver since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument [88] A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river [10] The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveler and gem merchant, who visited Agra in 1665 It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh seeming to support the argument were, however, proven false after excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black [89] A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself [90]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral

It was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 as a tribute to his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during the birth of their 14th child. The complex was designed by a team of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori and took over 22 years to complete.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Taj Mahal\" is derived from Urdu, with \"tāj\" meaning \"crown\" and \"mahall\" meaning \"palace\". The name is also believed to be derived from the corruption of the second syllable of the name \"Mumtaz\", which was a common practice in Mughal naming conventions.\n\nInspiration\nThe Taj Mahal was inspired by various architectural styles, including Persian, Arabic, and Indian. The building's design was influenced by the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, the tomb of Timur, and Humayun's Tomb in Delhi.

The building's design was influenced by the principles of symmetry and balance, with the main structure being a perfect square. The mausoleum's dome is made of white marble and is surrounded by four smaller domes.

{"title": "Respiratory_syncytial_virus", "content": "\nHistory\nRSV was discovered in 1956 when researchers isolated a virus from a population of chimpanzees with respiratory illness They named the virus chimpanzee coryza agent (CCA) [14] In 1957, this same virus was identified by Robert M Chanock in children with respiratory illness [15] Studies of human antibodies in infants and children revealed that the infection was common in early life [16] The virus was later renamed human orthopneumovirus, or human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) [17] [18]\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nRSV infection can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms that range from mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) to severe and potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation [19] While RSV can cause respiratory tract infections in people of all ages and is among common childhood infections, its presentation often varies between age groups and immune status [4] Reinfection is common throughout life, but infants and the elderly remain at risk for symptomatic infection [19]\n\n\nChildren\nNearly all children in the United States experience at least one RSV infection before two years of age [20] Childhood RSV infections are fairly self-limited with typical upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and low-grade fever [4] [20] Inflammation of the nasal mucosa (rhinitis) and throat (pharyngitis), as well as redness of the eyes (conjunctival infection), may be seen on exam [3] Approximately 15–50% of children will go on to develop more serious lower respiratory tracts infections, such as bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, or croup [19] [21] Infants are at the highest risk of disease progression [3]\n\n\nAdults\nIt is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV However, it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations, including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar to that of influenza [26] Each year, approximately 5–10% of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection, with significant rates of pneumonia and death RSV is also responsible for 2–5% of adult community-acquired pneumonias [26]\n\n\nImmunocompromised\nIn both adults and children, immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness, and are 3.5 times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV [3] Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk, with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population This group has also demonstrated mortality rates of up to 80% among those with RSV pneumonia [26] While infection may occur within the community, hospital-acquired infection is thought to account for 30–50% of cases among immunocompromised individuals [26]\n\n\nElderly\nRSV or Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus affects many populations differently The most at risk population for RSV complications are older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or immunocompromised individuals [27] Between 60,000-160,000 older adults in the United States are hospitalized annually with RSV Between 6,000-10,000 of older adults die from RSV infection each year [28] Additionally RSV  can \"   lead to worsening of serious conditions such as, Asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – a chronic disease of the lungs that makes it hard to breathe, and even Congestive heart failure – when the heart can't pump enough blood and oxygen through the body.\" [28] Expedient and proper medical care is important for older adults as waiting, or receiving a misdiagnosis can be associated with increased risk of complications As of August 2023, adults aged 60 years and older qualify for vaccination against RSV in Canada and the United States [28]\n\n\nComplications\nLong term, children are at risk of developing the following chronic conditions that may persist into adulthood:\n\n\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for development of severe lower respiratory tract infection with RSV vary by population.\n\n\nVirology\nRSV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus [2] The scientific name for this viral species is human orthopneumovirus This is synonymous with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), which is often shortened to just RSV [34] It belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae, order Mononegavirales [2] Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause neighboring cell membranes to merge, creating large multinucleated syncytia [3]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nRSV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus [2] The scientific name for this viral species is human orthopneumovirus This is synonymous with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), which is often shortened to just RSV [34] It belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae, order Mononegavirales [2] Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause neighboring cell membranes to merge, creating large multinucleated syncytia [3]\n\n\nAntigenic subtypes\nRSV is divided into two antigenic subtypes, A and B, based on the reactivity of the F and G surface proteins to monoclonal antibodies [2] [3] The subtypes tend to circulate simultaneously within local epidemics, although subtype A tends to be more prevalent [26] Generally, RSV subtype A (RSVA) is thought to be more virulent than RSV subtype B (RSVB), with higher viral loads and faster transmission time [2] [3] To date, 16 RSVA and 22 RSVB clades have been identified [2] Among RSVA, the GA1, GA2, GA5, and GA7 clades predominate; GA7 is found only in the United States [2] Among RSVB, the BA clade predominates worldwide [2]\n\n\nGenome\nRSV has a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [2] The genome is linear and approximately 15,000 nucleotides in length [3] It has 10 genes encoding for 11 proteins [2] [4] The gene order is NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L, with the NS1 and NS2 gene serving as nonstructural promoter genes [35]\n\n\nStructure and proteins\nRSV is a medium-sized (~150 nm) enveloped virus While many particles are spherical, filamentous species have also been identified [2] [3] The genome rests within a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by matrix protein and an envelope containing viral glycoproteins [36] There are 11 proteins, described further in the table below.\n\n\nG protein\nSurface protein G (glycoprotein) is primarily responsible for viral attachment to host cells [37] This protein is highly variable between strains [26] G protein exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms [3] [37] The membrane-found form is responsible for attachment by binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, on the surface of host cells [2] [4] [3] The secreted form acts as a decoy, interacting with antigen presenting cells to inhibit antibody-mediated neutralization [3] [37] G protein also contains a CX3C fractalkine-like motif that binds to the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) on the surface of ciliated bronchial host cells [2] [4] This binding may alter cellular chemotaxis and reduce the migration of immune cells into the lungs of infected individuals [37] G protein also alters host immune response by inhibiting signaling from several toll-like receptors, including TLR4 [4] [37]\n\n\nF protein\n\nSurface protein F (fusion protein) is responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes, as well as syncytium formation between viral particles [37] Its sequence is highly conserved between strains [26] While viral attachment appears to involve both F and G proteins, F fusion occurs independently of G [37] F protein exists in multiple conformational forms [2] [4] In the prefusion state (PreF), the protein exists in a trimeric form and contains the major antigenic site Ø [2] Ø serves as a primary target of neutralizing antibodies in the body [4] After binding to its target on the host cell surface (its exact ligand remains unclear), PreF undergoes a conformational change during which Ø is lost [2] [4] This change enables the protein to insert itself into the host cell membrane and leads to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes [2] A final conformational shift results in a more stable and elongated form of the protein (postfusion, PostF) [4] Opposite of the RSV G protein, the RSV F protein also binds to and activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating the innate immune response and signal transduction [2] [37]\n\nReplication cycle\nFollowing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, the viral nucleocapsid (containing the viral genome) and the associated viral polymerase are delivered into the host cell cytoplasm Transcription and translation both occur within the cytoplasm RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the genome into 10 segments of messenger RNA (mRNA) which is translated into structural proteins by host cell machinery During replication of the negative-sense viral genome, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes a positive-sense complement called the antigenome This complementary strand is used as a template to construct genomic negative-sense RNA, which is packaged into nucleocapsids and transported to the plasma membrane for assembly and particle budding [36]\n\n\nMechanism\nRSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission [3] For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated that an average of 5 to 25 uninfected people will become infected [38] RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing contaminated droplets into the air Transmission usually occurs when these droplets come into contact with another person's eyes, nose, or mouth [39] As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing [9] RSV can also live for up to 25 minutes on contaminated skin (i.e hands) and several hours on other surfaces like countertops and doorknobs [3] [38] It has an incubation period of 2 to 8 days [3] Once infected, people are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days In infants and in people with weakened immune systems, however, the virus may continue to spread for up to 4 weeks (even after they are no longer showing symptoms) [39]\n\n\nTransmission\nRSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission [3] For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated that an average of 5 to 25 uninfected people will become infected [38] RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing contaminated droplets into the air Transmission usually occurs when these droplets come into contact with another person's eyes, nose, or mouth [39] As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely

immune systems, however, the virus may continue to spread for up to 4 weeks (even after they are no longer showing symptoms) [39]\n\n\nPathogenesis\nFollowing transmission through the nose or eyes, RSV infects ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway [3] RSV continues to replicate within these bronchial cells for about 8 days [2] After the first several days, RSV-infected cells will become more rounded and ultimately slough into the smaller bronchioles of the lower airway [2] This sloughing mechanism is also thought to be responsible for the spread of virus from the upper to lower respiratory tract [2] Infection causes generalized inflammation within the lungs, including the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells (such as monocytes and T-cells), necrosis of the epithelial cell wall, edema, and increased mucous production [3] Inflammation and cell damage tends to be patchy rather than diffuse [3] Together, the sloughed epithelial cells, mucous plugs, and accumulated immune cells cause obstruction of the lower airway [2] [3]\n\n\nReinfection\nAfter recovery of \"respiratory diseases associated with RSV infection, the virus interferes with the establishment of immunological memory, which leads to recurrent reinfections.\" [40] An estimated of \"36% of individuals\" can be reinfected with RSV \"at least once, during the winter season.\" [40] Reinfections like these can be a result of \"an initial encounter with RSV\" that \"fails to initiate adequate humoral and cellular immune responses to generate protective memory lymphocytes.\" [40]\n\n\nImmune escape\nGenetic variations in viral epitopes and adjacent regions affect protein folding, post-transcriptional modifications, and antigenic processing, influencing B and T cell immunity during viral infections [42] This alteration in conformation can lead to immune evasion, potentially impacting disease severity, outbreaks, and reinfections Notably, the variability observed in the G gene, followed by the SH and F genes, suggests a correlation between structural differences in proteins and their immunogenicity [42] Specifically, the irregular curl and low bond energy of the G protein make it prone to conformational changes, affecting its immunogenicity and potentially modulating the immune response [42]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nA variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not routinely recommend the use of lab testing to diagnose RSV bronchiolitis (for which the treatment is largely supportive), [5] confirmation of RSV infection may be warranted in high-risk groups if the result will guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing, molecular testing, and viral culture [3]\n\n\nLaboratory diagnosis\nA variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not

result will guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing, molecular testing, and viral culture [3]\n\n\nAntigen testing\nAntigen testing involves detection of RSV antigen fragments (or pieces of molecular viral structures), usually from an nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate This can be accomplished either by viewing fluorescently labeled antigens under a microscope (direct fluorescence assay, or DFA) or using a commercially available rapid antigen detection test (RADT) [3] Overall, antigen testing is highly sensitive in young children (80–90%) but substantially less reliable in older children and adults, who have less viral shedding [3] Antigen tests are also subject to higher false positive rates outside of the peak RSV season, such as in the summer months In these scenarios, the use of either viral culture or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) may aid in an accurate RSV diagnosis [citation needed]\n\n\nMolecular testing\nMolecular assays, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), enable sensitive detection of very small amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates NAAT assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus-specific genetic material, rather than viral antigens They have a sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% [43] However, they tend to be more expensive and require more complex equipment than other testing methods, making them less practical in resource limited areas Molecular testing for RSV is not routinely recommended for all people with respiratory symptoms However, it may be recommended for those at high risk of RSV complications, such as infants, older adults, and people with chronic medical conditions [medical citation needed] RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 90-95% and a specificity of 98-99%, while LAMP has a sensitivity of 95-100% and a specificity of 99-100% [citation needed]\n\n\nViral culture\nIn traditional viral culture, a sample of the virus is introduced to different cell lines and allowed to replicate so it can be studied Benefits of this technique include the ability to perform genetic characterization, strain typing, and antiviral susceptibility testing However, it is limited by its prolonged turnaround time of 3–7 days, making it less common in patient care and more common in research settings [3]\n\n\nSerologic testing\nSerology (the measurement of virus-specific antibodies in the serum) is not frequently used in RSV diagnosis The time required for the body to mount a significant serologic response (and demonstrate a significant rise in antibodies that can be detected in serum) is usually not useful in guiding patient care [2] Up to 30% of patients with documented RSV infection will have negative serology results [43] As such, this method is generally reserved for research and surveillance studies [2]\n\n\nImaging findings\nChest X-rays findings in children with RSV bronchiolitis are generally nonspecific and include perihilar markings, patchy hyperinflation, and atelectasis [20] However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend routine imaging for children with presumed RSV bronchiolitis because it does not change clinical outcomes and is associated with increased antibiotic use [20] [5] Chest X-ray is sometimes considered when the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is unclear or when there is an unexpected worsening [5] In adults with RSV infection, chest films are often normal or demonstrate nonspecific changes consistent with viral pneumonia, such as patchy bilateral infiltrates [44]\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection includes other viral infections (such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and influenza) and primary bacterial pneumonia In children, inhaled foreign bodies and congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis or asthma are typically considered [3]\n\n\nPrevention\nThe main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals [5] Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols [9]\n\n\nGeneral prevention measures\nThe main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals [5] Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols [9]\n\n\nVaccines\nThere is interest and research in RSV vaccine discovery, given the virus's disease burden and the lack of disease-specific therapies [45] Vaccine development has faced obstacles that have blocked its progress Among these are infant-specific factors, such as the immature infant immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies, which make infantile immunization difficult [3]\n\n\nImmunoprophylaxis\nHistorically, RSV-specific intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) was used to provide passive immunity to prevent RSV infection and hospitalization in the highest risk infants This involved monthly administration of RSV-neutralizing antibodies (or immunoglobins) from human donors recovering from the disease While this transfer of antibodies was reasonably effective in providing short-term immunization to at-risk infants, it was limited by both its intravenous administration and cost [53]\n\n\nTreatment\nTreatment for RSV infection is focused primarily on supportive care This may include monitoring a patient's breathing or using suction to remove secretions from the upper airway Supplemental oxygen may also be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask in order to improve airflow In severe cases of respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing If signs of dehydration are present, fluids may also be given orally or through an IV [53]\n\n\nSupportive care\nTreatment for RSV

the wheezing associated with RSV infection These medications (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are beta-agonists that relax the muscles of the airways to allow for improved airflow However, bronchodilators have not been found to improve clinical severity of infection or rate of hospitalization among those with RSV infection Given their limited benefit, plus their adverse event profile, they are not routinely recommended for use in RSV bronchiolitis [53] [67]\n\n\nAnti-inflammatories\nBronchodilators, medications commonly used to treat asthma, are sometimes used to treat the wheezing

use in RSV bronchiolitis [53] [67]\n\n\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotic therapy is not appropriate for treatment of RSV-related bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia [69] Antibiotics target bacterial pathogens, not viral pathogens such as RSV However, antibiotics may be considered if there is clear evidence that a secondary bacterial infection has developed Ear infections may also develop in a small number of infants with RSV bronchiolitis, in which case oral antibiotics may sometimes be used [53]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nWorldwide, RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under the age of 5 The risk of serious infection is highest during the first 6 months of life Of those infected with RSV, 2–3% will develop bronchiolitis, necessitating hospitalization [70] Each year, approximately 30 million acute respiratory illnesses and over 60,000 childhood deaths are caused by RSV worldwide An estimated 87% of infants will have experienced an RSV infection by the age of 18 months, and nearly all children will have been infected by 3 years In the United States, RSV is responsible for up to 20% of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 However, the vast majority of RSV-related deaths occur in low-income countries that lack access to basic supportive care [3]\n\n\nInfants and children\nWorldwide, RSV is the leading cause

[3]\n\n\nAdults\nIt is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV However, it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations, including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar to that of influenza [26] Each year, approximately 5–10% of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection, with significant rates of pneumonia and death RSV is also responsible for 2–5% of adult community-acquired pneumonias [26]\n\n\nImmunocompromised\nIn both adults and children, immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness, and are 3.5 times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV [3] Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk, with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population This group has also demonstrated mortality rates of up to 80% among those with RSV pneumonia [26] While infection may occur within the community, hospital-acquired infection is thought to account for 30–50% of cases among immunocompromised individuals [26]\n\n\nSeasonality\nRSV seasonality varies around the world In temperate climates, infection rates tend to be highest during the cold winter months This is often attributed to increased indoor crowding and increased viral stability in the lower temperatures In tropical and arctic climates, however, the annual variation is less well defined and seems to be more prevalent during the rainy season [2] [3] Annual epidemics are generally caused by the presence of several different viral strains Subtype A and B viruses will often circulate simultaneously within a specific geographic region, although group A viruses are more prevalent [26]\n\n\nResearch\nA study investigated RSV-specific T cell responses in \" 55 infants hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis and found that these responses were similar during both acute illness and recovery, and did not increase after subsequent RSV infections [41] This suggests that RSV-specific T-cell responses may not prevent reinfection and might not expand effectively in the body after reinfection However, it's possible that these cells could be located in specific areas of the lungs and respond more strongly to secondary infection, as seen in animal studies For instance, a study using mice showed that the \"extent of the BALF inflammatory response to reinfection response to reinfection in adulthood is determined by the age at first infection.\" [41] The study also discovered that the patterns differ for \"neonatal infection primes the host to develop a Th2-biased response.\" [41] The exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear One possibility is that a lack of IFN-γ production in newborns during their first encounter with RSV, possibly due to an immature immune system, allows for the emergence of a Th2-biased response that persists and can be triggered again during subsequent RSV infections [41] However, it's improbable that variations solely in IFN-γ levels explain this susceptibility window IL-13 appears to play a significant role as a regulator in this process IL-13 is a protein located in the lung It is a \"mediator of allergic asthma\" and it is in charge of \"regulating eosinophilic inflammation, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness.\"

virus that affects people of all ages, but it is most severe in young children and older adults. It is a major cause of respiratory illness and is estimated to infect 1 in 3 children in the United States by the age of 3. RSV is responsible for up to 20% of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations.\n\n**History**\n\nRSV was discovered in 1956 when researchers isolated a virus from a population of chimpanzees with respiratory illness. They named the virus chimpanzee coryza agent (CCA). In 1957, this same virus was identified by Robert M Chanock in children with respiratory illness. Studies of human antibodies in infants and children revealed that the infection was common in early life. The virus was later renamed human orthopneumovirus, or human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV).\n\n**Signs and symptoms**\n\nRSV infection can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms that range from mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) to severe and potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. While RSV can cause respiratory tract infections in people of all ages, its presentation often varies between age groups and immune status. Reinfection is common throughout life, but infants and the elderly remain at risk for symptomatic infection.\n\n**Children**\n\nNearly all children in the United States experience at least one RSV infection before two years of age. Childhood RSV infections are fairly self-limited with typical upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and low-grade fever. Inflammation of the nasal mucosa (rhinitis) and throat (pharyngitis), as well as redness of the eyes (conjunctival infection), may be seen on exam. Approximately 15–50% of children will go on to develop more serious lower respiratory tracts infections, such as bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, or croup.\n\n**Adults**\n\nIt is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV. However, it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations, including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases. Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar to that of influenza. Each year, approximately 5–10% of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection, with significant rates of pneumonia and death.\n\n**Immunocompromised**\n\nIn both adults and children, immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection. Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness, and are 3.5 times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV. Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk, with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population.\n\n**Elderly**\n\nRSV or Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus affects many populations differently. The most at-risk population for RSV complications are older adults and those with underlying medical conditions or immunocompromised individuals. Between 60,000-160,000 older adults in the United States are hospitalized annually with RSV. Between 6,000-10,000 of older adults die from RSV infection each year.\n\n**Complications**\n\nLong-term, children are at risk of developing the following chronic conditions that may persist into adulthood: asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic lung disease.\n\n**Risk factors**\n\nRisk factors for development of severe lower respiratory tract infection with RSV vary by population. However, certain factors, such as young age, premature birth, and underlying medical conditions, increase the risk of severe illness.\n\n**Virology**\n\nRSV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The scientific name for this viral species is human orthopneumovirus. It belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The virus has 10 genes encoding for 11 proteins.\n\n**Structure and proteins**\n\nRSV is a medium-sized (~150 nm) enveloped virus. The genome rests within a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by matrix protein and an envelope containing viral glycoproteins. There are 11 proteins, described further in the table below.\n\n**G protein**\n\nThe G protein is primarily responsible for viral attachment to host cells. This protein is highly variable between strains. The G protein exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms. The membrane-found form is responsible for attachment by binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, on the surface of host cells.\n\n**F protein**\n\nThe F protein is responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes, as well as syncytium formation between viral particles. Its sequence is highly conserved between strains. While viral attachment appears to involve both F and G proteins, F fusion occurs independently of G.\n\n**Replication cycle**\n\nFollowing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, the viral nucleocapsid (containing the viral genome) and the associated viral polymerase are delivered into the host cell cytoplasm. Transcription and translation both occur within the cytoplasm. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the genome into 10 segments of messenger RNA (mRNA) which is translated into structural proteins by host cell machinery.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nRSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission. For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated that an average of 5 to 25 uninfected people will become infected. RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing contaminated droplets into the air.\n\n**Pathogenesis**\n\nFollowing transmission through the nose or eyes, RSV infects ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the upper and lower airway. RSV continues to replicate within these bronchial cells for about 8 days. After the first several days, RSV-infected cells will become more rounded and ultimately slough into the smaller bronchioles of the lower airway.\n\n**Reinfection**\n\nAfter recovery of \"respiratory diseases associated with RSV infection, the virus interferes with the establishment of immunological memory, which leads to recurrent reinfections.\" An estimated of \"36% of individuals\" can be reinfected with RSV \"at least once, during the winter season.\" Reinfections like these can be a result of \"an initial encounter with RSV\" that \"fails to initiate adequate humoral and cellular immune responses to generate protective memory lymphocytes.\"\n\n**Immune escape**\n\nGenetic variations in viral epitopes and adjacent regions affect protein folding, post-transcriptional modifications, and antigenic processing, influencing B and T cell immunity during viral infections. This alteration in conformation can lead to immune evasion, potentially impacting disease severity, outbreaks, and reinfections.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nA variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection. While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not routinely recommend the use of lab testing to diagnose RSV bronchiolitis, confirmation of RSV infection may be warranted in high-risk groups if the result will guide clinical decisions.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals. Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for RSV infection is focused primarily on supportive care. This may include monitoring a patient's breathing or using suction to remove secretions from the upper airway. Supplemental oxygen may also be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask in order to improve airflow.\n\n**Research**\n\nA study investigated RSV-specific T cell responses in \"55 infants

hard to breathe, and even Congestive heart failure – when the heart can't pump enough blood and oxygen through the body.\" [28] Expedient and proper medical care is important for older adults as waiting, or receiving a misdiagnosis can be associated with increased risk of complications As of August 2023, adults aged 60 years and older qualify for vaccination against RSV in Canada and the United States [28]\n\n\nComplications\nLong term, children are at risk of developing the following chronic conditions that may persist into adulthood:\n\n\nRisk factors\nRisk factors for development

orthopneumovirus This is synonymous with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), which is often shortened to just RSV [34] It belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus, family Pneumoviridae, order Mononegavirales [2] Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause neighboring cell membranes to merge, creating large multinucleated syncytia [3]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nRSV is

neighboring cell membranes to merge, creating large multinucleated syncytia [3]\n\n\nAntigenic subtypes\nRSV is divided into two antigenic subtypes, A and B, based on the reactivity of the F and G surface proteins to monoclonal antibodies [2] [3] The subtypes tend to circulate simultaneously within local epidemics, although subtype A tends to be more prevalent [26] Generally, RSV subtype A (RSVA) is thought to be more virulent than RSV subtype B (RSVB), with higher viral loads and faster transmission time [2] [3] To date, 16 RSVA and 22 RSVB clades have been identified [2] Among RSVA, the GA1, GA2, GA5, and GA7 clades predominate; GA7 is found only in the United States [2] Among RSVB, the BA clade predominates worldwide [2]\n\n\nGenome\nRSV has a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [2] The genome is linear and approximately 15,000 nucleotides in length [3] It has 10 genes encoding for 11 proteins [2] [4] The gene order is NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L, with the NS1 and NS2 gene serving as nonstructural promoter genes [35]\n\n\nStructure and proteins\nRSV is a medium-sized (~150 nm) enveloped virus While many particles are spherical, filamentous species have also been identified [2] [3] The genome rests within a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by matrix protein and an envelope containing viral glycoproteins [36] There are 11 proteins, described further in the table below.\n\n\nG protein\nSurface protein G (glycoprotein) is primarily responsible for viral attachment to host cells [37] This protein is highly variable between strains [26] G protein exists in both membrane-bound and secreted forms [3] [37] The membrane-found form is responsible for attachment by binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, on the surface of host cells [2] [4] [3] The secreted form acts as a decoy, interacting with antigen presenting cells to inhibit antibody-mediated neutralization [3] [37] G protein also contains a CX3C fractalkine-like motif that binds to the CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) on the surface of ciliated bronchial host cells [2] [4] This binding may alter cellular chemotaxis and reduce the migration of immune cells into the lungs of infected individuals [37] G protein also alters host immune response by inhibiting signaling from several toll-like receptors, including TLR4 [4] [37]\n\n\nF protein\n\nSurface protein F (fusion protein) is responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes, as well as syncytium formation between viral particles [37] Its sequence is highly conserved between strains [26] While viral attachment appears to involve both F and G proteins, F fusion occurs independently of G [37] F protein exists in multiple conformational forms [2] [4] In the prefusion state (PreF), the protein exists in a trimeric form and contains the major antigenic site Ø [2] Ø serves as a primary target of neutralizing antibodies in the body [4] After binding to its target on the host cell surface (its exact ligand remains unclear), PreF undergoes a conformational change during which Ø is lost [2] [4] This change enables the protein to insert itself into the host cell membrane and leads to fusion of the viral and host cell membranes [2] A final conformational shift results in a more stable and elongated form of the protein (postfusion, PostF) [4] Opposite of the RSV G protein, the RSV F protein also binds to and activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), initiating the innate immune response and signal transduction [2] [37]\n\nReplication cycle\nFollowing fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, the viral nucleocapsid (containing the viral genome) and the associated viral polymerase are delivered into the host cell cytoplasm Transcription and translation both occur within the cytoplasm RNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribes the genome into 10 segments of messenger RNA (mRNA) which is translated into structural proteins by host cell machinery During replication of the negative-sense viral genome, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes a positive-sense complement called the antigenome This complementary strand is used as a template to construct genomic negative-sense RNA, which is packaged into nucleocapsids and transported to the plasma membrane for assembly and particle budding [36]\n\n\nMechanism\nRSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission [3] For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated that an average of 5 to 25 uninfected people will become infected [38] RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing contaminated droplets into the air Transmission usually occurs when these droplets come into contact with another person's eyes, nose, or mouth [39] As with all respiratory pathogens once presumed to transmit via respiratory droplets, it is highly likely to be carried by the aerosols generated during routine breathing, talking, and even singing [9] RSV can also live for up to 25 minutes on contaminated skin (i.e hands) and several hours on other surfaces like countertops and doorknobs [3] [38] It has an incubation period of 2 to 8 days [3] Once infected, people are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days In infants and in people with weakened immune systems, however, the virus may continue to spread for up to 4 weeks (even after they are no longer showing symptoms) [39]\n\n\nTransmission\nRSV is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks from both community and hospital transmission [3] For each person infected with RSV, it is estimated

cells will become more rounded and ultimately slough into the smaller bronchioles of the lower airway [2] This sloughing mechanism is also thought to be responsible for the spread of virus from the upper to lower respiratory tract [2] Infection causes generalized inflammation within the lungs, including the migration and infiltration of inflammatory cells (such as monocytes and T-cells), necrosis of the epithelial cell wall, edema, and increased mucous production [3] Inflammation and cell damage tends to be patchy rather than diffuse [3] Together, the sloughed epithelial cells, mucous plugs, and accumulated immune cells cause obstruction of the lower airway [2] [3]\n\n\nReinfection\nAfter recovery of \"respiratory diseases associated with RSV infection, the virus interferes with the establishment of immunological memory, which leads to recurrent reinfections.\" [40] An estimated of \"36% of individuals\" can be reinfected with RSV \"at least once, during the winter season.\" [40] Reinfections like these can be a result of \"an initial encounter with RSV\" that \"fails to initiate adequate humoral and cellular immune responses to generate protective memory lymphocytes.\" [40]\n\n\nImmune escape\nGenetic variations in viral epitopes and adjacent regions affect protein folding, post-transcriptional modifications, and antigenic processing, influencing B and T cell immunity during viral infections [42] This alteration in conformation can lead to immune evasion, potentially impacting disease severity, outbreaks, and reinfections Notably, the variability observed in the G gene, followed by the SH and F genes, suggests a correlation between structural differences in proteins and their immunogenicity [42] Specifically, the irregular curl and low bond energy of the G protein make it prone to conformational changes, affecting its immunogenicity and potentially modulating the immune response [42]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nA variety of laboratory tests are available for the diagnosis of RSV infection While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not routinely recommend the use of lab testing to diagnose RSV bronchiolitis (for which the treatment is largely supportive), [5] confirmation of RSV infection may be warranted in high-risk groups if the result will guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing, molecular

result will guide clinical decisions Common identification techniques include antigen testing, molecular testing, and viral culture [3]\n\n\nAntigen testing\nAntigen testing involves detection of RSV antigen fragments (or pieces of molecular viral structures), usually from an nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate This can be accomplished either by viewing fluorescently labeled antigens under a microscope (direct fluorescence assay, or DFA) or using a commercially available rapid antigen detection test (RADT) [3] Overall, antigen testing is highly sensitive in young children (80–90%) but substantially less reliable in older children and adults, who have less viral shedding [3] Antigen tests are also subject to higher false positive rates outside of the peak RSV season, such as in the summer months In these scenarios, the use of either viral culture or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) may aid in an accurate RSV diagnosis [citation needed]\n\n\nMolecular testing\nMolecular assays, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), enable sensitive detection of very small amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates NAAT assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detect virus-specific genetic material, rather than viral antigens They have a sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% [43] However, they tend to be more expensive and require more complex equipment than other testing methods, making them less practical in resource limited areas Molecular testing for RSV is not routinely recommended for all people with respiratory symptoms However, it may be recommended for those at high risk of RSV complications, such as infants, older adults, and people with chronic medical conditions [medical citation needed] RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 90-95% and a specificity of 98-99%, while LAMP has a sensitivity of 95-100% and a specificity of 99-100% [citation needed]\n\n\nViral culture\nIn traditional viral culture, a sample of the virus is introduced to different cell lines and allowed to replicate so it can be studied Benefits of this technique include the ability to perform genetic characterization, strain typing, and antiviral susceptibility testing However, it is limited by its prolonged turnaround time of 3–7 days, making it less common in patient care and more common in research settings [3]\n\n\nSerologic testing\nSerology (the measurement of virus-specific antibodies in the serum) is not frequently used in RSV diagnosis The time required for the body to mount a significant serologic response (and demonstrate a significant rise in antibodies that can be detected in serum) is usually not useful in guiding patient care [2] Up to 30% of patients with documented RSV infection will have negative serology results [43] As such, this method is generally reserved for research and surveillance studies [2]\n\n\nImaging findings\nChest X-rays findings in children with RSV bronchiolitis are generally nonspecific and include perihilar markings, patchy hyperinflation, and atelectasis [20] However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend routine imaging for children with presumed RSV bronchiolitis because it does not change clinical outcomes and is associated with increased antibiotic use [20] [5] Chest X-ray is sometimes considered when the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is unclear or when there is an unexpected worsening [5] In adults with RSV infection, chest films are often normal or demonstrate nonspecific changes consistent with viral pneumonia, such as patchy bilateral infiltrates [44]\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nThe differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with signs and symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection includes other viral infections (such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, and influenza) and primary bacterial pneumonia In children, inhaled foreign bodies and congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis or asthma are typically considered [3]\n\n\nPrevention\nThe main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals [5] Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols [9]\n\n\nGeneral prevention measures\nThe main prevention measure is to avoid close contact with infected individuals [5] Airborne precautions such as respirators, ventilation, and HEPA/high MERV filters, are likely protective against RSV-laden aerosols [9]\n\n\nVaccines\nThere is interest and research in RSV vaccine discovery, given the virus's disease burden and the lack of disease-specific therapies [45] Vaccine development has faced obstacles that have blocked its progress Among these are infant-specific factors, such as the immature infant immune system and the presence of maternal antibodies, which make infantile immunization difficult [3]\n\n\nImmunoprophylaxis\nHistorically, RSV-specific intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG) was used to provide passive immunity to prevent RSV infection and hospitalization in the highest risk infants This involved monthly administration of RSV-neutralizing antibodies (or immunoglobins) from human donors recovering from the disease While this transfer of antibodies was reasonably effective in providing short-term immunization to at-risk infants, it was limited by both its intravenous administration and cost [53]\n\n\nTreatment\nTreatment for RSV infection is focused primarily on supportive care This may include monitoring a patient's breathing or using suction to remove secretions from the upper airway Supplemental oxygen may also be delivered through a nasal cannula or face mask in order to improve airflow In severe cases of respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing If signs of dehydration are present, fluids may also be given orally or through an IV [53]\n\n\nSupportive care\nTreatment for RSV

of dehydration are present, fluids may also be given orally or through an IV [53]\n\n\nViral-specific therapies\nBronchodilators, medications commonly used to treat asthma, are sometimes used to treat the wheezing associated with RSV infection These medications (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are beta-agonists that relax the muscles of the airways to allow for improved airflow However, bronchodilators have not been found to improve clinical severity of infection or rate of hospitalization among those with RSV infection Given their limited benefit, plus their adverse event profile, they are not routinely recommended for use in RSV bronchiolitis [53] [67]\n\n\nAnti-inflammatories\nBronchodilators, medications commonly used to treat asthma, are sometimes used to treat the wheezing associated with RSV infection These medications (such as albuterol or salbutamol) are beta-agonists that relax the muscles of the airways to allow for improved airflow However, bronchodilators have

improve clinical severity of infection or rate of hospitalization among those with RSV infection Given their limited benefit, plus their adverse event profile, they are not routinely recommended for use in RSV bronchiolitis [53] [67]\n\n\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotic therapy is not appropriate for treatment of RSV-related bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia [69] Antibiotics target bacterial pathogens, not viral pathogens such as RSV However, antibiotics may be considered if there is clear evidence that a secondary bacterial infection has developed Ear infections may also develop in a small number of infants with RSV bronchiolitis, in which case oral antibiotics may sometimes be used [53]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nWorldwide, RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under the age of 5 The risk of serious infection is highest during the first 6 months of life Of those infected with RSV, 2–3% will develop bronchiolitis, necessitating hospitalization [70] Each year, approximately 30 million acute respiratory illnesses and over 60,000 childhood deaths are caused by RSV worldwide An estimated 87% of infants will have experienced an RSV infection by the age of 18 months, and nearly all children will have been infected by 3 years In the United States, RSV is responsible for up to 20% of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 However, the vast majority of RSV-related deaths occur in low-income countries that lack access to basic supportive care [3]\n\n\nInfants and children\nWorldwide, RSV is the leading cause

respiratory infection hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 However, the vast majority of RSV-related deaths occur in low-income countries that lack access to basic supportive care [3]\n\n\nAdults\nIt is rare for healthy young adults to develop severe illness requiring hospitalization from RSV However, it is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in certain adult populations, including the elderly and those with underlying heart or lung diseases Its clinical impact among elderly adults is estimated to be similar to that of influenza [26] Each year, approximately 5–10% of nursing home residents will experience RSV infection, with significant rates of pneumonia and death RSV is also responsible for 2–5% of adult community-acquired pneumonias [26]\n\n\nImmunocompromised\nIn both adults and children, immunosuppression increases susceptibility to RSV infection Children living with HIV are more likely to develop acute illness, and are 3.5 times more likely to require hospitalization than children without HIV [3] Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at particularly high risk, with RSV accounting for nearly half of the viral infections in this population This group has also demonstrated mortality rates of up to 80% among those with RSV pneumonia [26] While infection may occur within the community, hospital-acquired infection is thought to account for 30–50% of cases among immunocompromised individuals [26]\n\n\nSeasonality\nRSV seasonality varies around the world In temperate climates, infection rates tend to be highest during the cold winter months This is often attributed to increased indoor crowding and increased viral stability in the lower temperatures In tropical and arctic climates, however, the annual variation is less well defined and seems to be more prevalent during the rainy season [2] [3] Annual epidemics are generally caused by the presence of several different viral strains Subtype A and B viruses will often circulate simultaneously within a specific geographic region, although group A viruses are more prevalent [26]\n\n\nResearch\nA study investigated RSV-specific T cell responses in \" 55 infants hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis and found that these responses were similar during both acute illness and recovery, and did not increase after subsequent RSV infections [41] This suggests that RSV-specific T-cell responses may not prevent reinfection and might not expand effectively in the body after reinfection However, it's possible that these cells could be located in specific areas of the lungs and respond more strongly to secondary infection, as seen in animal studies For instance, a study using mice showed that the \"extent of the BALF inflammatory response to reinfection response to reinfection in adulthood is determined by the age at first infection.\" [41] The study also discovered that the patterns differ for \"neonatal infection primes the host to develop a Th2-biased response.\" [41] The exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear One possibility is that a lack of IFN-γ production in newborns during their first encounter with RSV, possibly due to an immature immune system, allows for the emergence of a Th2-biased response that persists and can be triggered again during subsequent RSV infections [41] However, it's improbable that variations solely in IFN-γ levels explain this susceptibility window IL-13 appears to play a significant role as a regulator in this process IL-13 is a protein located in the lung It is a \"mediator of allergic asthma\" and it is in charge of \"regulating eosinophilic inflammation, mucus secretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness.\"

{"title": "Justin_Bieber", "content": "\nEarly life\nJustin Drew Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, [19] and was raised in Stratford, Ontario [20] His parents Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette were both 18 when Bieber was born and split up not long after his birth [21] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise Bieber [22] Bieber has maintained contact with his father [23] Bieber's ancestry includes French-Canadian, Irish, English, Scottish, and German [24] [25] [26] In 2012, Bieber claimed \"I'm actually part Indian I think Inuit or something? I'm enough per cent that in Canada I can get free gas\", sparking criticism from the Canadian Congress of Aboriginal Peoples for perpetuating a common misconception that Indigenous people receive complimentary gasoline from the Canadian government [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident, where he was covering Ne-Yo's \"So Sick\" [23] [41] Impressed, Braun tracked down Bieber's school, the theatre Bieber was performing at, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism She remembered praying, \"God, I gave him to you You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!\", and, \"God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?\" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia with Braun to record demo tapes [23] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later [42] Bieber soon signed with  Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher [43] Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated singers of the same name would confuse the market [43] [44]\n\n\n2007–2009: Career beginnings and My World\nWhile searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by

Mistletoe\nBieber was a presenter at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010 He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of the charity single \"We Are the World\" for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version [62]\n\n\n2012–2014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances\nIn late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, titled Believe [97] The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called \"Boyfriend\", and was released on March 26, 2012 [98] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week [99] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through the iTunes Store, \"restricting the buying option for those  [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store\" [100] \"Boyfriend\" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week [99] Bieber was featured on American hip hop group Far East Movement's song \"Live My Life\", from their fourth studio album, Dirty Bass, in February 2012 The song emerged online five days before its scheduled release date and peaked within the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 [101] The first promotional single from the album, \"Die in Your Arms\", was released on May 29, 2012, and the second promotional single, \"All Around the World\" (featuring American rapper Ludacris), followed the next week [102] [103] The second single from Believe, \"As Long as You Love Me\" (featuring Big Sean), was released on June 11, 2012 It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 [104]\n\n\n2015–2017: Purpose\nIn February 2015, Bieber released \"Where Are Ü Now\", a collaboration with Jack Ü [135] The song peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart [136] It earned Bieber his career-first Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards [137] In March 2015, Bieber made an appearance in the music video for Carly Rae Jepsen's single \"I Really Like You\" [138]\n\n\n2017–2019: Collaborations\nOn January 28, 2017, Bieber starred in the 2017 NHL Celebrity All-Star Game as a participating player, coached by Wayne Gretzky [163] On April 17, 2017, Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee released a remix for their song \"Despacito\" featuring Bieber It was the first song by Bieber in which he sings in Spanish [164] The remix became a worldwide success and broke major chart records around the world The song reached number one in the US and joined \"Macarena\" (1996) as the only English/Spanish songs to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 [165] It tied the then-record for the most weeks at number one in Billboard Hot 100 history The song spent a record 56 weeks at number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart and broke the then-record for most weeks at number one on the Digital Songs Sales chart The remix is the most viewed song of all time on the crowdsourced media knowledge base Genius, with 23.3 million views [166] The song earned Bieber his first career Latin Grammy [167] As of September 2021, \"Despacito\" holds the number-one position on the Greatest of All Time Hot Latin Songs chart and number-five on the Greatest of All Time Songs of the Summer chart by Billboard [168] [169]\n\n\n2020–present: Changes and Justice\nOn December 24, 2019, Bieber announced that he would be releasing his fifth studio album and embarking on his fourth concert tour in 2020 [193] The album's first single, \"Yummy\", was released on January 3, 2020 It debuted at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 [194] On December 31, 2019, Bieber also released a trailer announcing his 10-part YouTube Originals docu-series Justin Bieber: Seasons, which focused on an array of themes: his life post-hiatus from music, marriage, preparation for new music, and battle against Lyme disease Episodes were released weekly on Mondays and Wednesdays from January 27, 2020 [195] The docu-series amassed 32.65 million views within its first week of release, breaking the all-time record for the most-viewed premiere in its first week of all YouTube Originals [196] Appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on January 28, 2020, Bieber confirmed the release date of his fifth studio album, Changes, to be February 14, 2020 [197] The same day, he also released a promotional single for the album, \"Get Me\" (featuring Kehlani) [198] On February 7, 2020, Bieber released \"Intentions\" (featuring Quavo), as the second single from the album The song peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 [199] Changes was released on February 14, debuting at number one on the UK and US Billboard 200 charts, making Bieber the youngest solo artist in history to have seven number-one albums in the US [200]\n\n\nArtistry\nBieber has cited Chris Brown, Craig David, Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Boyz II Men, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, Tupac, Usher and Kanye West as his musical inspirations [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] In 2012, Bieber said, \"music is music, and I'm definitely influenced by Michael Jackson and Boyz II Men and people who were black artists—that's what I like.\" [252] Believe was influenced by Timberlake, for which Bieber was trying to \"create a new sound that people aren't really used to hearing .. like when Timberlake did FutureSex/LoveSounds: It was a new sound.. acoustic guitar over hard drums.\" [253] In 2019, Bieber called Chris Brown the \"best entertainer of all time\" [254] [255]\n\n\nInfluences\nBieber has cited Chris Brown, Craig David, Michael Jackson, the Beatles, Boyz

entertainer of all time\" [254] [255]\n\n\nMusical style\nBieber incorporates a variety of genres in his music, focusing mainly on pop, [256] [257] R&B, [257] [258] and occasionally dance-pop or EDM [256] In 2010, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone asserted that the content of his music was \"offering a gentle introduction to the mysteries and heartaches of adolescence: songs flushed with romance but notably free of sex itself\" [259] During the initial years of his career, his musical style was noted for being aimed to a more teen pop and \"bubblegum-ish\" direction [260]\n\n\nVoice\nBieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice, [265] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of \"Pray\" at the 2010 American Music Awards Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as \"the biggest threat to his career\" at the time [266] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with \"swing and rhythmic dexterity\" on his debut album, noting his tone to be \"nasal\" [259] Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008 [267]\n\n\nAchievements\nThroughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time [273] [274]\n\n\nCultural impact\nBieber has been credited for reinventing pop stardom for over a decade [300] and has been referred to as the \"Prince of Pop\" [301] and the \"King of Teen Pop\" [260] by contemporary journalists Highlighting his longevity, he was awarded the MTV Award for Best New Artist in 2010 [302] and the MTV Award for Artist of the Year in 2021 [303] Rolling Stone India referred to him as the \"biggest popstar of our age\", \"one of the most captivating artists of the century\" and \"one of the world's most successful artists of all time\" [304] Bieber is often cited as a pop icon, or simply an icon [305] [306] [307] [308]  In a 2011 article comparing the cultural significance of Bieber to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Orlando Sentinel said that, \"Out of all the cultural icons who influence and inspire today's society, Justin Bieber is without a doubt one of the most prominent.\" [309] He is generally credited as an important figure in bridging music and social media, which rose to prominence in the late 2000s; Variety dubbed him \"a once-in-a-generation superstar who charted a swift and stunning rise from precocious YouTube talent to global phenomenon.\" [310]\n\n\nLegacy\nBieber has been credited for reinventing pop stardom for over a decade [300] and has been referred to as the

up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly\" As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image [23] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist Good, once nicknamed Bieber's \"swagger coach\", created a \"streetwise look\" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, \"Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favorite rappers.\" [330] In 2013, Bieber said he was \"very influenced by black culture\", but he neither thought \"of it as black or white\" nor tried to \"act or pose in a certain way\" To him, it was \"a lifestyle-like a suaveness or a swag\" [320] Bieber was often featured in teen magazines such as Tiger Beat, [23] and has been labelled a \"teen heartthrob\" [331] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age, [332] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011 [333] His signature wings hairstyle at the time brought much attention in particular [318] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized [332] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube [334] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that \"Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics\" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things [332]\n\n\nBusiness interests\nIn 2010, Bieber signed a deal with Proactiv [359] In the same year, Bieber partnered with Nicole by OPI to launch a nail polish line \"The One Less Lonely Girl Collection\", which sold exclusively in Walmart [360] Bieber's nail polish line sold one million bottles less than two months after its release [361] Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012 [362] He became the new \"face\" and \"body\" of Calvin Klein in early 2015 [363] Entertainment Tonight reported that Bieber had used MYO-X, a dietary supplement, in preparation for the photo shoot [364] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington [365] Bieber has been credited with boosting the careers of other singers such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Madison Beer when he tweeted about them [366] [367]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2020, it was revealed Bieber owning a $26 million home in Beverly Hills, California as well as a lakeside home in Ontario [384] [385] As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess a non-immigrant O-1 visa for working status based on \"extraordinary ability or achievement\" in an artistic field [386] Bieber has said he is not interested in obtaining U.S citizenship, and has praised Canada as being \"the best country in the world\", citing its mostly government-funded health care system as a model example [387] However, in September 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber had begun the process of becoming a United States citizen, following his marriage to Hailey Baldwin [388]\n\n\nHealth\nBieber has struggled with mental health issues, [389] particularly depression and anxiety, [390] [391] at various points during his career [392] He has generally been open about these issues [393] [394] In his American YouTube docu-series Seasons (2020), the singer opened up about his struggles with addiction, with frequent consumption of the recreational drug lean, pills such as MDMA, and hallucinogenic mushrooms in the early stages of his career [395]\n\n\nRelationships\nBieber's father, Jeremy, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist [402] In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having \"split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage\" [403]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nBieber has described himself as a faithful Christian, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that \"He's the reason I'm here\" [420] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled \"#iPledge\", in which he talks about God's forgiveness [421] Bieber was baptized on January 9, 2014, by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church, New York, after a born again experience He has described Lentz as a good friend [422] [423]  In 2021, he announced that he had become a member of Churchome, an

Born on January 22, 1947, in Hanford, California, Perry rose to fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band Journey, known for hits like \"Don't Stop Believin',\" \"Any Way You Want It,\" and \"Open Arms.\" His distinctive voice and captivating stage presence have made him one of the most iconic figures in rock music.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nStephen Ray Perry was born to Portuguese parents, Raymond Perry (Pereira), a vocalist and co-owner of radio station KNGS, and his wife. Perry is an only child, and his parents' relationship ended when he was eight years old. He and his mother then moved to his grandparents' dairy farm in California.\n\nGrowing up, Perry was exposed to music from a young age, thanks to his father's love for singing and his mother's musical talents. Perry's early life was marked by a strong passion for music, which would eventually become his career.\n\n**Career**\n\nPerry's music career began in his early twenties when he moved to Sacramento to start a band called Ice. Alongside 16-year-old future music producer Scott Mathews, Perry co-wrote, played drums and guitar, and sang for the band. In 1972, they recorded at the Record Plant studios in Los Angeles by day while Stevie Wonder recorded his Talking Book album by night. However, upon returning to Sacramento, Ice disbanded due to lack of management, Mathews' age, and the recordings going virtually unheard.\n\nIn 1975, Perry moved to Thousand Oaks, California, where he formed a progressive rock band called Pieces with Tim Bogert, Denver Cross, and Eddie Tuduri. After a year and a half, the group was unable to secure a record deal and disbanded. Perry also unsuccessfully auditioned to replace Rod Evans in Captain Beyond.\n\n**Journey Era**\n\nIn 1977, Perry was introduced to Journey by the band's organizer and manager, Herbie Herbert. Herbert had received a demo of an Alien Project song, \"If You Need Me, Call Me,\" and was told by producer Scott Mathews that Perry would be a great replacement for then-current frontman Robert Fleischman. Fleischman had never signed with Herbert's company and had not fully coalesced with the band's then-progressive rock style.\n\nPerry was brought on tour, and to avoid alarming Fleischman, he was referred to as a roadie's Portuguese cousin. During a sound check in Long Beach, Perry surreptitiously performed a song with Journey while Fleischman was away from the stage. Soon thereafter, Herbert informed the band members that Perry was the new lead singer.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nIn the 2000s, Perry continued to work on music projects, including collaborating with musician Jeff Golub on a song titled \"Can't Let You Go\" for Golub's Soul Sessions album, which was released in 2003. Perry provided vocals on the mostly instrumental jazz track.\n\n**Style**\n\nPerry is renowned for his countertenor vocal range, which spans from F#2 to A5. His voice has been described as a \"high 'tenor altino'\" with a tone somewhere between Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin. He has been dubbed \"The Voice,\" a moniker originally coined by fellow singer Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nQueen guitarist Brian May said, \"Perry is a truly luminous singer, in my opinion—a voice in a million.\" Record executive, producer, and former American Idol judge and Journey session musician Randy Jackson has described Perry's voice as \"the golden voice,\" adding that aside from Robert Plant, \"there's no singer in rock that even came close to Steve Perry. The power, the range, the tone—he created his own style. He mixed a little Motown, a little Everly Brothers, a little Zeppelin.\"\n\nJourney guitarist Neal Schon likened Perry's ability to that of Aretha Franklin, and agreed with Fozzy vocalist Chris Jericho's assertion that Perry \"might be the greatest male singer of all time.\"\n\n**Vocal Technique and Acclaim**\n\nPerry's vocal technique has been widely praised for its unique range and expressiveness. His ability to span from F#2 to A5 is a rare feat in the music industry.\n\n**Songwriting**\n\nPerry was a principal songwriter for most of Journey's songs throughout his tenure with the band, as well as his solo efforts. These efforts led to a nomination to the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn the 1980s, Perry dated Sherrie Swafford, for whom he wrote the 1984 song \"Oh Sherrie.\"\n\n**Health and Interests**\n\nPerry underwent successful hip replacement surgery in 1998.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Studio album)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Solo)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Compilation album)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Solo)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (EPs)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Singles)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (With Journey)\n* **Cold Hearted Woman** (Other appearances)\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Steve Perry's life and career, highlighting his early life, music career, style, vocal technique, songwriting, personal life, and health.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Steve_Perry\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nStephen Ray Perry was born in Hanford, California, to Portuguese parents from the Azores He is an only child Perry grew up interested in music, as his father, Raymond Perry (Pereira), was a vocalist and co-owner of radio station KNGS [7] Perry's parents ended their relationship when he was eight He and his mother then moved to his grandparents' dairy farm [8]\n\n\nCareer\nIn his early 20s, Perry moved to Sacramento to start a band, later named Ice, with 16-year-old future music producer Scott Mathews, who co-wrote, played drums and guitar and sang In 1972, they recorded at the Record Plant studios in Los Angeles by day while Stevie Wonder recorded his Talking Book album by night Upon returning to Sacramento, Ice disbanded as the band had no management, Mathews was still in high school, and the recordings went virtually unheard In 1975, Perry moved to Thousand Oaks, California, where he formed a progressive rock band called Pieces with Tim Bogert (who had previously worked with Jeff Beck), Denver Cross, and Eddie Tuduri After a year and a half, the group was unable to secure a record deal and disbanded [10] [11] Perry also unsuccessfully auditioned to replace Rod Evans in Captain Beyond [12]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn his early 20s, Perry moved to Sacramento to start a band, later named Ice, with 16-year-old future music producer Scott Mathews, who co-wrote, played drums and guitar and sang In 1972, they recorded at the Record Plant studios in Los Angeles by day while Stevie Wonder recorded his Talking Book album by night Upon returning to Sacramento, Ice disbanded as the band had no management, Mathews was still in high school, and the recordings went virtually unheard In 1975, Perry moved to Thousand Oaks, California, where he formed a progressive rock band called Pieces with Tim Bogert (who had previously worked with Jeff Beck), Denver Cross, and Eddie Tuduri After a year and a half, the group was unable to secure a record deal and disbanded [10] [11] Perry also unsuccessfully auditioned to replace Rod Evans in Captain Beyond [12]\n\n\nJourney era\nOriginal Journey organizer/manager Herbert had been given a demo of an Alien Project song, \"If You Need Me, Call Me\", and was told by producer Scott Mathews that the young singer would be a great replacement for then-current frontman Robert Fleischman Fleischman had never signed with Herbert's company (preferring his previous manager) and had not fully coalesced with the band's then progressive rock style Perry was brought on tour and to avoid alarming Fleischman was referred to as a roadie's Portuguese cousin During a sound check in Long Beach, Perry surreptitiously performed a song with Journey while Fleischman was away from the stage;

After progressing through the youth categories, he was promoted to the reserves in Tercera División in summer 2015. Hernandez's father, Jean-François, was also a footballer who played for Atlético Madrid, and his older brother Lucas, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain and France, was also developed at the club.\n\n## Atlético Madrid\n\nHernandez's time at Atlético Madrid was marked by a steady progression through the youth ranks. He was a key player for the club's reserves, helping them win several promotions and eventually earning a call-up to the first team. However, Hernandez's first-team opportunities were limited, and he was eventually loaned out to Deportivo Alavés.\n\n## Alavés\n\nOn 4 August 2016, Hernandez extended his contract until 2021, being immediately loaned to fellow league club Deportivo Alavés for one year. He made his professional debut late in the month, starting in a 0–0 home draw with Sporting de Gijón. Hernandez's performances for Alavés were impressive, and he quickly established himself as a regular starter for the club. Despite the team's relegation to the Segunda División, Hernandez's individual form remained strong, and he earned a transfer to Real Madrid.\n\n## Real Madrid\n\nOn 5 July 2017, Hernandez signed a six-year deal with Real Madrid after they met his release clause of €24 million. He made his competitive debut on 16 August, replacing Marco Asensio in a 2–0 home win against Barcelona for that year's Supercopa de España. Hernandez's time at Real Madrid was marked by a series of impressive performances, but he struggled to establish himself as a first-team regular. Despite this, Hernandez's experience in the Champions League and La Liga was invaluable, and he played a key role in Real Madrid's success during his time at the club.\n\n## AC Milan\n\nOn 7 July 2019, Hernandez joined Serie A club AC Milan in a deal worth maximum of €20 million. The transfer was approved and carried out by Paolo Maldini, who met with him informally in Ibiza to persuade him to join. Hernandez made his debut on 21 September, playing 18 minutes in the 2–0 defeat against Inter Milan in the Derby della Madonnina. He scored his first goal for the Rossoneri on 5 October, helping the visitors come from behind to win 2–1 at Genoa. During his first season with Milan, Hernandez managed to score 7 goals in all competitions and had 3 assists.\n\n## International Career\n\nOn 26 April 2018, Hernandez received his first call to the France senior squad. He made his debut on 7 September 2021 in a World Cup qualifier against Finland, a 2–0 home victory. Hernandez started and played the whole game. In October 2021, ahead of the UEFA Nations League semi-finals against Belgium, Hernandez for the first time received a call-up to the national team from Didier Deschamps together with his brother Lucas. The two were later fielded in the 3–4–1–2 formation as a left centre-back and a left wing-back, respectively, making it the first time they played together in a senior competitive game. On 7 October, Hernandez scored a late-time winner in the 3–2 victory against the aforementioned opponent, sending his team to the final for the first time in history of the tournament.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHernandez's father, Jean-François, was also a footballer who played for Atlético Madrid. In 2022, French newspaper L'Équipe found that Jean-François – who went missing in 2004 – was living in Thailand, and had allegedly been legally blocked by his ex-partner from seeing their children.\n\n## Career Statistics\n\n| Club | Season | League | Cup | Continental | Other | Total |\n| League | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| Alavés | 2016-17 | Segunda División | 35 | 0 | 2 | 0 | - | - | - | - | 37 | 0 |\n| Real Madrid | 2017-18 | La Liga | 15 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 23 | 0 |\n| 2018-19 | La Liga | 23 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 32 | 1 |\n| AC Milan | 2019-20 | Serie A | 27 | 1 | 3 | 0 | - | - | - | - | 30 | 1 |\n\n## Honours\n\n* UEFA Nations League runner-up: 2021\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes all the required information and details.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Theo_Hernandez\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nBorn in Marseille, Hernandez joined Atlético Madrid's academy in 2007, aged nine [11] After progressing through the youth categories, he was promoted to the reserves in Tercera División in summer 2015 [citation needed]\n\n\nAtlético Madrid\nBorn in Marseille, Hernandez joined Atlético Madrid's academy in 2007, aged nine [11] After progressing through the youth categories, he was promoted to the reserves in Tercera División in summer 2015 [citation needed]\n\n\nAlavés\nOn 4 August 2016, Hernandez extended his contract until 2021, being immediately loaned to fellow league club Deportivo Alavés for one year [15] [16] He made his professional debut late in the month, starting in a 0–0 home draw with Sporting de Gijón [17]\n\n\nReal Madrid\nOn 5 July 2017, Hernandez signed a six-year deal with Real Madrid after they met his release clause of €24 million [21] [22] [23] He made his competitive debut on 16 August, replacing Marco Asensio in a 2–0 home win against Barcelona for that year's Supercopa de España [24]\n\n\nAC Milan\nOn 7 July 2019, Hernandez joined Serie A club AC Milan in a deal worth maximum of €20 million [29] [30] The transfer was approved and carried out by Paolo Maldini, who met with him informally in Ibiza to persuade him to join [31] Hernandez made his debut on 21 September, playing 18 minutes in the 2–0 defeat against Inter Milan in the Derby della Madonnina [32] He scored his first goal for the Rossoneri on 5 October, helping the visitors come from behind to win 2–1 at Genoa [33] During his first season with Milan he managed to score 7 goals in all competitions and had 3 assists [34] [35]\n\n\nInternational career\nOn 26 April 2018, Hernandez received his first call to the France senior squad [49] He made his debut on 7 September 2021 in a World Cup qualifier against Finland, a 2–0 home victory He started and played the whole game [50] In October 2021, ahead of the UEFA Nations League semi-finals against Belgium, Théo for the first time received a call-up to the national team from Didier Deschamps together with his brother Lucas; the two were later fielded in the 3–4–1–2 formation as a left centre-back and a left wing-back, respectively, making it the first time they played together in a senior competitive game [51] On 7 October, he scored a late-time winner in the 3–2 victory against the aforementioned opponent, sending his team to the final for the first time in history of the tournament [52]\n\n\nPersonal life\nHernandez's father, Jean-François, was also a footballer A centre-back from France, he too played for Atlético Madrid; [57] [58] his older brother Lucas, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain and France, was also developed at the club [59] In 2022, French newspaper L'Équipe found that Jean-François – who went missing in 2004 – was living in Thailand, and had allegedly been legally blocked by his ex-partner from seeing their children [60]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nAlavés\n\n\nClub\nAlavés\n\n\nInternational\nAlavés\n\n\nHonours\nAlavés\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is the son of Hana Morrison (née Stafford), and musician Laurie Morrison. Morrison is of Māori descent, specifically Te Arawa (Ngāti Whakaue) and Tainui (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Rarua) whakapapa, and also has Scottish and Irish ancestry. His sister, Taini Morrison, was a performer, and his uncle, Sir Howard Morrison, was a musician.\n\nMorrison's secondary education took place at Wesley College, Auckland, and Western Heights High School, Rotorua.

and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley Because Wembley's owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham;

This was the first tournament to be held in a country directly affected by World War II, as the previous four tournaments were either held in countries outside of war theaters or in neutral countries.\n\nQualification\n------------\n\nDespite the absence of African teams, there was a record number of entries for the qualifying tournament, with 70 nations participating. FIFA determined that ten teams from Europe would qualify, along with four from South America, one from Asia, and one from North and Central America.\n\nQualified Teams\n----------------\n\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n* England (hosts)\n* Brazil\n* Spain\n* Soviet Union\n* Hungary\n* Uruguay\n* West Germany\n* Portugal\n* Italy\n* Argentina\n* Chile\n* Mexico\n* North Korea\n* Bulgaria\n* Yugoslavia\n* France\n\nMascot and Match Ball\n----------------------\n\nThe mascot for the 1966 competition was \"World Cup Willie,\" a lion wearing a Union Jack jersey emblazoned with the words \"WORLD CUP.\" This was the first World Cup mascot and one of the first mascots associated with a major sporting competition. Willie was designed by freelance children's book illustrator Reg Hoye. The official match ball was produced by Slazenger for the tournament.\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\nAll 15 entered African nations boycotted the tournament to protest against a 1964 FIFA ruling that required the three second-round winners from the African zone to enter a play-off round against the winners of the Asian zone to qualify for the World Cup. They felt winning their zone was enough in itself to merit qualification.\n\nAfrican Boycott\n----------------\n\nThe African nations' boycott was a major controversy surrounding the tournament. The boycott was led by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and was supported by all 15 African nations that had entered the qualifying tournament. The CAF argued that the ruling was unfair and that their teams had earned the right to qualify for the World Cup on their own merit.\n\nNorth Korea-United Kingdom Relations\n------------------------------------\n\nThe United Kingdom, which had fought for South Korea in the Korean War, was concerned about the entry of North Korea in the tournament. The UK did not recognize North Korea and feared that its presence would strain relations with South Korea and the United States. FIFA told England's Football Association that the tournament would be moved if any qualified team were to be refused entry.\n\nTrophy Incident\n----------------\n\nThe 1966 World Cup had a rather unusual hero off the field, a dog called Pickles. In the build-up to the tournament, the Jules Rimet trophy was stolen from an exhibition display. A nationwide hunt for the icon ensued, and it was later discovered wrapped in newspaper as the dog sniffed under some bushes in London. The FA commissioned a replica cup in case the original cup was not found in time. This replica, as well as Pickles' collar, is held at the National Football Museum in Manchester, where it is on display.\n\nDoping\n-------\n\nWest Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. A 2013 report by researchers at Berlin's Humboldt University on behalf of the German Olympic Sports Confederation linked the West Germany national team of 1966, which reached the World Cup final, with doping.\n\nFormat\n--------\n\nThe format of the 1966 competition remained the same as 1962. The 16 qualified teams were divided into four groups of four, with each group playing a round-robin format. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw, with goal average and eventually drawing lots used to separate teams equal on points. The top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage.\n\nVenues\n--------\n\nEight venues were used for the 1966 World Cup. The newest and biggest venue used was Wembley Stadium in north-west London, which was 43 years old in 1966. Group 1 matches (which included the hosts) were all played in London, five at Wembley and one at White City Stadium in west London. Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3's matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4's matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland.\n\nTournament Summary\n--------------------\n\nThe opening match took place on Monday, 11 July, making it the second World Cup after 1930 not to begin in May or June. Before the tournament began, eventual winners England were 9/2 second favorites with bookmakers behind Brazil (9/4), while beaten finalists West Germany were 25/1 outsiders.

and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley Because Wembley's owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3's matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4's matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland [citation needed] The stadium construction cost are estimated to be today's equivalent of £9.2 million, additional to £36.22 million for tournament organisation [23]\n\n\nTournament summary\nThe opening match took place on Monday, 11 July, which made it the second World Cup after 1930 to not begin on May or June Before the tournament began, eventual winners England were 9/2 second favourites with bookmakers behind Brazil (9/4), while beaten finalists West Germany were 25/1 outsiders [25] The final took place on Saturday, 30 July 1966, the 36th anniversary of the first final Until 2022, this was the latest date that any tournament had concluded The reason for the unusually late scheduling of the tournament appears to [citation needed] lie with the outside broadcast commitments of the BBC, which also had commitments to cover Wimbledon (which ran between 20 June and 2 July) and the Open Golf Championship (6 to 9 July).\n\n\nGroup stage\n\n\n\nKnock-out stages\nThe quarter-finals provided a controversial victory for West Germany as they cruised past Uruguay 4–0; the South Americans claimed that this occurred only after the referee (who was Jim Finney, from England) had not recognised a handball by Schnellinger on the goal line and then had sent off two players from Uruguay: Horacio Troche and Héctor Silva [28] It appeared as though the surprise package North Korea would claim another major upset in their match against Portugal at Goodison Park, when after 22 minutes they led 3–0 It fell to one of the greatest stars of the tournament, Eusébio, to change that He scored four goals in the game and José Augusto added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5–3 win.\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\nMatch officials\nA total of 26 match referees and other officials featured at the event Despite the event being a worldwide tournament, the majority of the officials were from Europe Gottfried Dienst refereed the final between England and West Germany [38]\n\n\nDraw\n\n\n\nSquads\n\n\n\nGroup stage\n\n\n\nGroup 1\n\n\n\nGroup 2\n\n\n\nGroup 3\n\n\n\nGroup 4\n\n\n\nKnockout stage\n\n\n\nBracket\n\n\n\nQuarter-finals\n\n\n\nSemi-finals\n\n\n\nThird place play-off\n\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n\nGoalscorers\nWith nine goals, Eusébio was the top scorer in the tournament In total, 89 goals were scored by 47 players, with two of them credited as own goals [43]\n\n\nAll-star team\n Gordon Banks\n\n\nFinal standings\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition [45] [46] The rankings for the 1966 tournament were as follows:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

November 1919, the Khilafat Committee held its first conference in Delhi which was attended by Muslim scholars from all over the India [2] [3] Afterward, a group of twenty-five Muslim scholars from among them held a separate conference in the hall of Krishna Theatre, in Delhi, and formed the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind [2] These scholars included Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, Ahmad Saeed Dehlavi, Kifayatullah Dihlawi, Muniruzzaman Khan, Mohammad Akram Khan, Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti and Sanaullah Amritsari [4] Other scholars included  Abdul Haleem Gayawi, Azad Subhani, Bakhsh Amritsari, Ibrahim Darbhangawi, Muhammad Abdullah, Muhammad Imam Sindhi, Muhammad Asadullah Sindhi, Muhammad Fakhir, Muhammad Anees, Muhammad Sadiq, Khuda Bakhsh Muzaffarpuri, Khwaja Ghulam Nizamuddin, Qadeer Bakhsh, Salamatullah, Sayyid Ismail, Sayyid Kamaluddin, Sayyid Muhammad Dawood, and Taj Muhammad [5]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe earliest principles and constitution of the Jamiat were written by Kifayatullah Dehlawi In the first general meeting in Amritsar it was decreed that these be published and opinions gathered from a group of scholars in attendance, and that it then be discussed again at the next meeting [15] The principles and constitution were ratified in the second meeting, held in Delhi and presided over by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi [15] There it was decided that the organisation would be called the \"Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind\", its headquarters located in Delhi, and its stamp state, \"Al-Jamiat al-Markaziyyah li al-Ulama il-Hind\" (transl. \"The Central Council of the Scholars of India\") [15] It aimed to defend Islam from any external or alien threat; to guide common folk in politics through the lens of Islamic precepts; and to establish an Islamic court, the Darul Qadha [15]\n\n\nIndependence movement\nOn 8 September 1920, the Jamiat issued a religious edict, called Fatwa Tark-e-Mawalat, boycotting British goods This was authored by Abul Muhasin Sajjad and signed by 500 scholars [18] During the British Raj, the Jamiat opposed British rule in India and participated in the Quit India Movement [19] Since its inception in 1919 it aimed for a \"British-free India\" [2] It formed an institution called \"Idārah Harbiyyah\" (transl. The War Council) during the civil disobedience movement [20] [21]\n\n\nPartition of India\nHussain Ahmad Madani, the principal of the Darul Uloom Deoband (from 1927 to 1957) and the leading Deobandi scholar of the day, held that Muslims were unquestionably part of a united India and that Hindu-Muslim unity was necessary for the country's freedom He worked closely with the Indian National Congress until the Partition of India was carried out [27] [28] In 1945, a faction emerged within Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind that supported the creation of Pakistan and the All Indian Muslim League This faction was led by a founding member of the Jamiat, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani [29] The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind was a member of the All India Azad Muslim Conference, which included several Islamic organisations standing for a united India [30]\n\n\nSplit into JUH-A and JUH-M\nIn March 2008, after the death of its former president Asad Madni, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind split into two factions [34] [35] The division was caused by differences between Arshad Madani and his nephew Mahmood Madani [34] after Arshad Madani was accused of being involved in anti-Jamiat activities A contemporaneous report by the Hindustan Times alleged that Arshad \"had dissolved elected units and disintegrated its democratic structure to establish his personal rule.\" [35] Consequently, on 5 March 2006, Arshad was dismissed as the president of the united Jamiat, leading him to form a new executive committee which he claimed to be the true Jamiat [35] The existing Jamiat was led by Mahmood Madani, and on the 5 April 2008 this faction appointed Usman Mansoorpuri as their first president [35] The first general secretary of the Arshad faction was Abdul Aleem Farooqui, who also served as the tenth general secretary of the united Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind from 1995 to 2001 [2] [36]\n\n\nCentenary\nThe Jamiat celebrated its centenary in November 2019 [37] The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) held the centenary celebrations in Azakhel over two days starting on 7 April 2017 [37] It was attended by Saleh bin Abdul-Aziz Al ash-Sheikh [38]\n\n\nAnti-terror edict\nIn November 2008, 6000 scholars endorsed an anti-terror edict in the 29th general body meeting of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, held at Hyderabad [39] The edict was issued by the Darul Uloom Deoband and signed by its Grand Mufti, Habibur Rahman Khairabadi, in May 2008 [39] In the general meeting, Mahmood Madani said that, \"it is a demonstration of the faith the Muslim scholars are reposing in the importance and timeliness of the edict When these delegates go back to their homes they would take the signed Hyderabad Declaration that endorses the stand taken by Darul Uloom against terrorism.\" [39] This meeting was attended by Ravi Sankar and Swami Agnivesh [39] The fatwa stated that \"Islam rejects all kinds of unwarranted violence, breach of peace, bloodshed, killing and plunder and does not allow it in any form It is the basic principle of Islam that you assist each other in pursuit of good righteous causes and do not co-operate with anyone for committing sin or oppression It is evident in the clear cut guidelines given in the Holy Quran that the allegation of terrorism against a religion like Islam which enjoins world peace is nothing but a lie In fact Islam was born to wipe off all kinds of terrorism and to spread the message of global peace\" [40]\n\n\nHindu relations\nIn 2009, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind said that Hindus should not be called kafirs (infidels) because, even though the term only means a \"Non-Muslim,\" its use may cause misunderstanding between communities [41] The Jamiat passed a resolution in November 2009 describing Vande Mataram as an anti-Islamic song and received opposition from Muslim Rashtriya Manch national convener, Mohammed Afzal stating \"Our Muslim brothers should not follow the fatwa as Vande Mataram is the national song of the country and every Indian citizen should respect and recite it.\" [42]\n\n\nNational Register of Citizens\nThe Mahmood faction of the Jamiat defended the Assam Accord during May 2017 under the leadership of Usman Mansoorpuri in the Supreme Court of India [53] They also passed a resolution in support of the National Register of Citizens [54] The Arshad faction's president Arshad Madani, however, said that, \"the NPR-NRC project is part of the Central government's communal agenda to transform India into a Hindu nation.\" [55] He also holds that it is a \"big threat to Muslims and also some other communities, including Dalits.\" [55] Consequently, in December 2019, the Mahmood faction filed a challenge to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in the Supreme Court of India on the grounds that \"the law classified immigrants without any \"intelligible differentia\" and ignored several religiously persecuted minorities.\" [56] The faction also held Kashmir as an integral part of India [54]\n\n\nDowries\nAfter a young woman named Ayesha committed suicide and her video went viral, [58] the Pune circle of the Jamiat launched a campaign against dowry practices in March 2021 [59] Scholars of the Jamiat said that they would use Friday prayers as a platform to make people aware of the issue [59]\n\n\nImplementation of population policy\nJUH's Assam faction stated on 5 July 2021 that \"the Jamiat will not support the  [Indian government's population policy] if the government forcefully implements it\" [60] Secretary Fazlul Karim Kasimi said that \"birth control policies cannot be imposed upon minorities and population policy should be applicable to the majority There should be a law on birth control for the majority.\" [60]\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations\nIn June 2021, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind's Gujarat unit held camps to raise awareness of COVID-19 vaccines A group of sixty scholars participated in this drive from areas such as Bhavnagar and Palanpur [61] A local scholar associated with the Jamiat, Imran Dheriwala, said that, \"the community has a deep sense of mistrust towards the government concerning vaccines, but it is because of the faith of the people as well, that it is Allah who decides one's time of death and He protects even if one does not take a vaccine.\" He also said that, \"we are trying to remove this misconception from people, as the teachings of Islam make it necessary for a person to go through medication in order to protect his life and thus vaccinations was necessary, and we are trying to spread this message.\" [61] The president of Jamiat's Arshad faction, Arshad Madani said that, \"Whatever saves human lives is permissible We should take the vaccine and protect ourselves and everybody around us from Covid-19.\" [62]\n\n\nMerger process\nThe Times of India reported on 22 June 2022 that the two factions of the Jamiat have begun a merger process which might be materialised very soon [63] The Hindu reported on 16 July 2022 that \"the faction of the younger Madani is said to be agreeable to work under the senior Madani as Jamiat president.\" [64] On 28 May 2022, the Jamiat's M faction had invited its rival Arshad Madani to attend its general body meeting in Deoband, which he accepted His acceptance of the invitation has been seen as his first step towards reconciliation [64] In the Deoband meet, Arshad Madani expressed that \"the Jamiat needs to come together so our voice can be stronger.\" [64]\n\n\nInstitutions\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind established the Idara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah (Institute of Juristic Discussions) in 1970 and Muhammad Miyan Deobandi was appointed its first director [17] [65] The institute organized its fifteenth juristic seminar in March 2019 [66] The seminar discussed whether Google AdSense, Paytm cash and other things related with mobile and internet were allowed under Islamic law It was attended by Muslim jurists including Saeed Ahmad Palanpuri and Shabbir Ahmad Qasmi [66]\n\n\nIdara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind established the Idara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah (Institute of Juristic Discussions) in 1970 and Muhammad Miyan Deobandi was appointed its first director [17] [65] The institute organized its fifteenth juristic seminar in March 2019 [66] The seminar discussed whether Google AdSense, Paytm cash and other things related with mobile and internet were allowed under Islamic law It was attended by Muslim jurists including Saeed Ahmad Palanpuri and Shabbir Ahmad Qasmi [66]\n\n\nJamiat Youth Club\nThe Jamiat Youth Club was established in July 2018 It aims to provide youth with training in different self-defense techniques to deal with community crises [67] It was called a \"pilot project\" and it was reported that the Jamiat expects to train about 1.25 million youngsters every year and about 12.5 million youth in over a hundred Indian districts are expected to join the Jamiat Youth Club by 2028 [67] [68] Mahmood Madani said that the club will train the youth like the Scouts and Guides, with an emphasis on physical training and different ways to strengthen their mental ability [68]\n\n\nHalal trust\nThe Jamiat has a halal-declaring agency known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind Halal Trust [69] It was set up in 2009 and was recognised by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia in 2011 as \"a reliable and authoritative institution for issuing Halal Certificates to meat, meat products and slaughter houses.\" [69] As of April 2020, its secretary is Niaz Ahmad Farooqi [70]\n\n\nJamiat National Open School\nJamiat National Open School was established in February 2021 It is similar to the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), [82] and provides trained staff and infrastructure to students through which they can study computers, mathematics, sciences, language and other subjects offered under the NIOS The school was established to provide students with high quality and contemporary academic learning, in part because thousands of students graduate from Islamic madrasas every year, but often lack adequate contemporary secular education abilities and skills [83] [82]\n\n\nLegal Cell Institute\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind also has the Legal Cell institute, through which it helps Muslims accused of terrorism to fight legal battles [85] [86] It was set up by Arshad Madani in 2007 and, as of May 2019, has aided in 192 acquittals across India [86] Madani stated he started the institute when he saw that innocent people are picked up and incarcerated regularly on different charges in India and their families spend their savings and sell their assets and homes to fight the legal battle in order to prove their innocence [86] According to a May 2019 report of The New Indian Express, \"the first three cases that the legal cell took up were the 7/11 Mumbai train blasts, the 2006 Malegaon blasts and the Aurangabad Arms haul case in September 2007.\" [86] The people accused in these were represented by Shahid Azmi, [87] who later defended Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin, both accused of the 2008 Mumbai Attacks [88] [89] Azmi was however assassinated on 11 February 2010; [90] and the Institute assisted both of them in the trial court and then in the high court The high court upheld their acquittal, and both were freed of the conspiracy charges [88] The Institute defended nine Muslim youth who were accused of the 2006 Malegaon blasts; [91] and all of them were acquitted in 2016 [92]\n\n\nPublications division\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind also has a publications division through which it has published books such as Islam mai Imamat awr Imarat ka Tasawwur (The Concept of Leadership and Emirate in Islam), Hindustan aur Masla-e-Imarat (India and the Issue of Emirate) and Islam The Benevolent for all Constructive Programs of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.\n [97] [98]\n\n\nAdministration\nMahmud Hasan Deobandi was the first president of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, appointed after Kifayatullah Dehlawi served as an interim president until November 1920 Dehlawi succeeded Hasan as the second president of the Jamiat and was succeeded by Hussain Ahmad Madani in 1940 [99] Asad Madni served as the fifth president until February 2006 and was succeeded by his brother Arshad Madani on 8 February 2006 [100] The Jamiat split into Arshad and Mahmood faction in March 2008 [35] [34] Mahmood Madani became the interim president of Mahmood faction on 27 May 2021 after the death of its former president Usman Mansoorpuri, and Arshad Madani serves as the president of the Arshad faction [101] [102] Mahmood Madani was appointed the president of Mahmood faction on 18 September 2021 [103]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n", "lang":

development\nOn 23 November 1919, the Khilafat Committee held its first conference in Delhi which was attended by Muslim scholars from all over the India [2] [3] Afterward, a group of twenty-five Muslim scholars from among them held a separate conference in the hall of Krishna Theatre, in Delhi, and formed the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind [2] These scholars included Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, Ahmad Saeed Dehlavi, Kifayatullah Dihlawi, Muniruzzaman Khan, Mohammad Akram Khan, Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti and Sanaullah Amritsari [4] Other scholars included  Abdul Haleem Gayawi, Azad Subhani, Bakhsh Amritsari, Ibrahim Darbhangawi, Muhammad Abdullah, Muhammad Imam Sindhi, Muhammad Asadullah Sindhi, Muhammad Fakhir, Muhammad Anees, Muhammad Sadiq, Khuda Bakhsh Muzaffarpuri, Khwaja Ghulam Nizamuddin, Qadeer Bakhsh, Salamatullah, Sayyid Ismail, Sayyid Kamaluddin, Sayyid Muhammad Dawood, and Taj Muhammad [5]\n\n\nGovernance\nThe earliest principles and constitution of the Jamiat were written by Kifayatullah Dehlawi In the first general meeting in Amritsar it was decreed that these be published and opinions gathered from a group of scholars in attendance, and that it then be discussed again at the next meeting [15] The principles and constitution were ratified in the second meeting, held in Delhi and presided over by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi [15] There it was decided that the organisation would be called the \"Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind\", its headquarters located in Delhi, and its stamp state, \"Al-Jamiat al-Markaziyyah li al-Ulama il-Hind\" (transl. \"The Central Council of the Scholars of India\") [15] It aimed to defend Islam from any external or alien threat; to guide common folk in politics through the lens of Islamic precepts; and to establish an Islamic court, the Darul Qadha [15]\n\n\nIndependence movement\nOn 8 September 1920, the Jamiat issued a religious edict, called Fatwa Tark-e-Mawalat, boycotting British goods This was authored by Abul Muhasin Sajjad and signed by 500 scholars [18] During the British Raj, the Jamiat opposed British rule in India and participated in the Quit India Movement [19] Since its inception in 1919 it aimed for a \"British-free India\" [2] It formed an institution called \"Idārah Harbiyyah\" (transl. The War Council) during the civil disobedience movement [20] [21]\n\n\nPartition of India\nHussain Ahmad Madani, the principal of the Darul Uloom Deoband (from 1927 to 1957) and the leading Deobandi scholar of the day, held that Muslims were unquestionably part of a united India and that Hindu-Muslim unity was necessary for the country's freedom He worked closely with the Indian National Congress until the Partition of India was carried out [27] [28] In 1945, a faction emerged within Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind that supported the creation of Pakistan and the All Indian Muslim League This faction was led by a founding member of the Jamiat, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani [29] The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind was a member of the All India Azad Muslim Conference, which included several Islamic organisations standing for a united India [30]\n\n\nSplit into JUH-A and JUH-M\nIn March 2008, after the death of its former president Asad Madni, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind split into two factions [34] [35] The division was caused by differences between Arshad Madani and his nephew Mahmood Madani [34] after Arshad Madani was accused of being involved in anti-Jamiat activities A contemporaneous report by the Hindustan Times alleged that Arshad \"had dissolved elected units and disintegrated its democratic structure to establish his personal rule.\" [35] Consequently, on 5 March 2006, Arshad was dismissed as the president of the united Jamiat, leading him to form a new executive committee which he claimed to be the true Jamiat [35] The existing Jamiat was led by Mahmood Madani, and on the 5 April 2008 this faction appointed Usman Mansoorpuri as their first president [35] The first general secretary of the Arshad faction was Abdul Aleem Farooqui, who also served as the tenth general secretary of the united Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind from 1995 to 2001 [2] [36]\n\n\nCentenary\nThe Jamiat celebrated its centenary in November 2019 [37] The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) held the centenary celebrations in Azakhel over two days starting on 7 April 2017 [37] It was attended by Saleh bin Abdul-Aziz Al ash-Sheikh [38]\n\n\nAnti-terror edict\nIn November 2008, 6000 scholars endorsed an anti-terror edict in the 29th general body meeting of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, held at Hyderabad [39] The edict was issued by the Darul Uloom Deoband and signed by its Grand Mufti, Habibur Rahman Khairabadi, in May 2008 [39] In the general meeting, Mahmood Madani said that, \"it is a demonstration of the faith the Muslim scholars are reposing in the importance and timeliness of the edict When these delegates go back to their homes they would take the signed Hyderabad Declaration that endorses the stand taken by Darul Uloom against terrorism.\" [39] This meeting was attended by Ravi Sankar and Swami Agnivesh [39] The fatwa stated that \"Islam rejects all kinds of unwarranted violence, breach of peace, bloodshed, killing and plunder and does not allow it in any form It is the basic principle of Islam that you assist each other in pursuit of good righteous causes and do not co-operate with anyone for committing sin or oppression It is evident in the clear cut guidelines given in the Holy Quran that the allegation of terrorism against a religion like Islam which enjoins world peace is nothing but a lie In fact Islam was born to wipe off all kinds of terrorism and to spread the message of global peace\" [40]\n\n\nHindu relations\nIn 2009, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind said that Hindus should not be called kafirs (infidels) because, even though the term only means a \"Non-Muslim,\" its use may cause misunderstanding between communities [41] The Jamiat passed a resolution in November 2009 describing Vande Mataram as an anti-Islamic song and received opposition from Muslim Rashtriya Manch national convener, Mohammed Afzal stating \"Our Muslim brothers should not follow the fatwa as Vande Mataram is the national song of the country and every Indian citizen should respect and recite it.\" [42]\n\n\nNational Register of Citizens\nThe Mahmood faction of the Jamiat defended the Assam Accord during May 2017 under the leadership of Usman Mansoorpuri in the Supreme Court of India [53] They also passed a resolution in support of the National Register of Citizens [54] The Arshad faction's president Arshad Madani, however, said that, \"the NPR-NRC project is part of the Central government's communal agenda to transform India into a Hindu nation.\" [55] He also holds that it is a \"big threat to Muslims and also some other communities, including Dalits.\" [55] Consequently, in December 2019, the Mahmood faction filed a challenge to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 in the Supreme Court of India on the grounds that \"the law classified immigrants without any \"intelligible differentia\" and ignored several religiously persecuted minorities.\" [56] The faction also held Kashmir as an integral part of India [54]\n\n\nDowries\nAfter a young woman named Ayesha committed suicide and her video went viral, [58] the Pune circle of the Jamiat launched a campaign against dowry practices in March 2021 [59] Scholars of the Jamiat said that they would use Friday prayers as a platform to make people aware of the issue [59]\n\n\nImplementation of population policy\nJUH's Assam faction stated on 5 July 2021 that \"the Jamiat will not support the  [Indian government's population policy] if the government forcefully implements it\" [60] Secretary Fazlul Karim Kasimi said that \"birth control policies cannot be imposed upon minorities and population policy should be applicable to the majority There should be a law on birth control for the majority.\" [60]\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccinations\nIn June 2021, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind's Gujarat unit held camps to raise awareness of COVID-19 vaccines A group of sixty scholars participated in this drive from areas such as Bhavnagar and Palanpur [61] A local scholar associated with the Jamiat, Imran Dheriwala, said that, \"the community has a deep sense of mistrust towards the government concerning vaccines, but it is because of the faith of the people as well, that it is Allah who decides one's time of death and He protects even if one does not take a vaccine.\" He also said that, \"we are trying to remove this misconception from people, as the teachings of Islam make it necessary for a person to go through medication in order to protect his life and thus vaccinations was necessary, and we are trying to spread this message.\" [61] The president of Jamiat's Arshad faction, Arshad Madani said that, \"Whatever saves human lives is permissible We should take the vaccine and protect ourselves and everybody around us from Covid-19.\" [62]\n\n\nMerger process\nThe Times of India reported on 22 June 2022 that the two factions of the Jamiat have begun a merger process which might be materialised very soon [63] The Hindu reported on 16 July 2022 that \"the faction of the younger Madani is said to be agreeable to work under the senior Madani as Jamiat president.\" [64] On 28 May 2022, the Jamiat's M faction had invited its rival Arshad Madani to attend its general body meeting in Deoband, which he accepted His acceptance of the invitation has been seen as his first step towards reconciliation [64] In the Deoband meet, Arshad Madani expressed that \"the Jamiat needs to come together so our voice can be stronger.\" [64]\n\n\nInstitutions\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind established the Idara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah (Institute of Juristic Discussions) in 1970 and Muhammad Miyan Deobandi was appointed its first director [17] [65] The institute organized its fifteenth juristic seminar in March 2019 [66] The seminar discussed whether Google AdSense, Paytm cash and other things related with mobile and internet were allowed under Islamic law It was attended by Muslim jurists including Saeed Ahmad Palanpuri and Shabbir Ahmad Qasmi [66]\n\n\nIdara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind established the Idara Mabahith-e-Fiqhiyyah (Institute of Juristic Discussions) in 1970 and Muhammad Miyan Deobandi was appointed its first director [17] [65] The institute organized its fifteenth juristic seminar in March 2019 [66] The seminar discussed whether Google AdSense, Paytm cash and other things related with mobile and internet were allowed under Islamic law It was attended by Muslim jurists including Saeed Ahmad Palanpuri and Shabbir Ahmad Qasmi [66]\n\n\nJamiat Youth Club\nThe Jamiat Youth Club was established in July 2018 It aims to provide youth with training in different self-defense techniques to deal with community crises [67] It was called a \"pilot project\" and it was reported that the Jamiat expects to train about 1.25 million youngsters every year and about 12.5 million youth in over a hundred Indian districts are expected to join the Jamiat Youth Club by 2028 [67] [68] Mahmood Madani said that the club will train the youth like the Scouts and Guides, with an emphasis on physical training and different ways to strengthen their mental ability [68]\n\n\nHalal trust\nThe Jamiat has a halal-declaring agency known as the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind Halal Trust [69] It was set up in 2009 and was recognised by the Department of Islamic Development Malaysia in 2011 as \"a reliable and authoritative institution for issuing Halal Certificates to meat, meat products and slaughter houses.\" [69] As of April 2020, its secretary is Niaz Ahmad Farooqi [70]\n\n\nJamiat National Open School\nJamiat National Open School was established in February 2021 It is similar to the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), [82] and provides trained staff and infrastructure to students through which they can study computers, mathematics, sciences, language and other subjects offered under the NIOS The school was established to provide students with high quality and contemporary academic learning, in part because thousands of students graduate from Islamic madrasas every year, but often lack adequate contemporary secular education abilities and skills [83] [82]\n\n\nLegal Cell Institute\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind also has the Legal Cell institute, through which it helps Muslims accused of terrorism to fight legal battles [85] [86] It was set up by Arshad Madani in 2007 and, as of May 2019, has aided in 192 acquittals across India [86] Madani stated he started the institute when he saw that innocent people are picked up and incarcerated regularly on different charges in India and their families spend their savings and sell their assets and homes to fight the legal battle in order to prove their innocence [86] According to a May 2019 report of The New Indian Express, \"the first three cases that the legal cell took up were the 7/11 Mumbai train blasts, the 2006 Malegaon blasts and the Aurangabad Arms haul case in September 2007.\" [86] The people accused in these were represented by Shahid Azmi, [87] who later defended Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin, both accused of the 2008 Mumbai Attacks [88] [89] Azmi was however assassinated on 11 February 2010; [90] and the Institute assisted both of them in the trial court and then in the high court The high court upheld their acquittal, and both were freed of the conspiracy charges [88] The Institute defended nine Muslim youth who were accused of the 2006 Malegaon blasts; [91] and all of them were acquitted in 2016 [92]\n\n\nPublications division\nJamiat Ulema-e-Hind also has a publications division through
