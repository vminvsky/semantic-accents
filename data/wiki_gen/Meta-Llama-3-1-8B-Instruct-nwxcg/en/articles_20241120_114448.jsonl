The law was enacted in 1958 to provide a comprehensive package of benefits to former Presidents, replacing the ad hoc arrangements that had existed previously.\n\n**History**\n\nBefore 1958, the U.S. federal government provided no pension or other retirement benefits to former United States Presidents. The first proposal for a presidential pension was made by Andrew Carnegie in 1912, who offered to endow a $25,000 annual pension for former chief executives. However, Congressmen questioned the propriety of such a private pension, leading to the introduction of legislation to provide benefits to former Presidents. Although legislation was first introduced in 1912 to provide any such benefits, it was not enacted.\n\nIn the decades that followed, various proposals were made to provide benefits to former Presidents, but it was not until the mid-20th century that a comprehensive package of benefits was finally enacted into law. The Former Presidents Act of 1958 provided for a pension, staff, office expenses, medical care, and Secret Service protection for former Presidents, and has been amended several times since its enactment to improve and expand the benefits.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nBy law, former Presidents are entitled to a pension, staff, office expenses, medical care, health insurance, and Secret Service protection. These benefits are designed to provide a comprehensive package of support to former Presidents, enabling them to maintain a dignified standard of living and to continue to serve the public interest.\n\n**Pension**\n\nThe pension provided to former Presidents is designed to provide a stable source of income to support their living expenses. The pension is paid by the Secretary of the Treasury and is taxable. As of 2020, the pension was $219,200 per year, and has been increased to $226,300 per year since January 2022. The pension begins immediately after a President's departure from office and is paid for life.\n\nA former President's spouse may also be paid a lifetime annual pension of $20,000 if they relinquish any other statutory pension. This provision is designed to provide financial support to the spouse of a former President, enabling them to maintain a stable standard of living.\n\n**Transition**\n\nTransition funding is available for seven months to cover the expenses of leaving office. This funding is designed to support the administrative tasks associated with the transition, including office space, staff compensation, communications services, and printing and postage. The transition period is a critical time for a President, and the funding provided by the Former Presidents Act helps to ensure a smooth and efficient transition.\n\n**Staff and Office**\n\nPrivate office staff and related funding is provided by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. People employed under this subsection are selected by and responsible only to the former President for the performance of their duties. Each former President fixes basic rates of compensation for persons employed for them, not exceeding an annualized total of $150,000 for the first 30 months and $96,000 thereafter. This provision is designed to enable former Presidents to maintain a staff to support their activities and to provide a stable source of income for their employees.\n\n**Medical Insurance**\n\nFormer Presidents are entitled to medical treatment in military hospitals, and pay for this at rates set by the Office of Management and Budget. Two-term Presidents may buy health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. This provision is designed to provide access to quality medical care for former Presidents and their families.\n\n**Secret Service Protection**\n\nFrom 1965 to 1996, former Presidents were entitled to lifetime Secret Service protection, for themselves, spouses, and children under 16. However, in 1994, a statute was enacted that limited post-presidential protection to ten years for Presidents inaugurated after January 1, 1997. Under this statute, Bill Clinton would still be entitled to lifetime protection, and all subsequent Presidents would have been entitled to ten years of protection.\n\nHowever, on January 10, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012, reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for his predecessor George W. Bush, himself, and all subsequent Presidents. This provision is designed to provide a high level of security for former Presidents and their families, recognizing the significant risks associated with their public presence.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Former Presidents of the United States\n* Presidential transition\n* Secret Service\n* Federal Employees Health Benefits Program\n\n**References**\n\nThis article incorporates public domain material from the United States Government documents and websites.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Former_Presidents_Act\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBefore 1958, the U.S federal government provided no pension or other retirement benefits to former United States presidents Andrew Carnegie offered to endow a US$25,000 (equal to $789,310 today) annual pension for former chief executives in 1912, but congressmen questioned the propriety of such a private pension That prompted legislation to provide benefits to former presidents  Although legislation was first introduced later that year to provide any such benefits, that legislation was not enacted [2]\n\n\nBenefits\nBy law, former presidents are entitled to a pension, staff, office expenses, medical care, health insurance, and Secret Service protection \n\n\nPension\nThe secretary of the treasury pays a taxable pension to the president Former presidents receive a pension equal to the salary of a Cabinet secretary (Executive Level I); as of 2020 [update], it was $219,200 per year [5] and since January 2022, $226,300 The pension begins immediately after a president's departure from office [6] A former president's spouse may also be paid a lifetime annual pension of $20,000 if they relinquish any other statutory pension [2]\n\n\nTransition\nTransition funding for the expenses of leaving office is available for seven months It covers office space, staff compensation, communications services, and printing and postage associated with the transition [2]\n\n\nStaff and office\nPrivate office staff and related funding is provided by the administrator of the General Services Administration People employed under this subsection are selected by and responsible only to the former president for the performance of their duties Each former president fixes basic rates of compensation for persons employed for them, not exceeding an annualized total of $150,000 for the first 30 months and $96,000 thereafter [2] [7]\n\n\nMedical insurance\nFormer presidents are entitled to medical treatment in military hospitals; they pay for this at rates set by the Office of Management and Budget Two-term presidents may buy health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program [2] [failed verification]\n\n\nSecret Service protection\nFrom 1965 to 1996, former presidents were entitled to lifetime Secret Service protection, for themselves, spouses, and children under 16 A 1994 statute, Pub L. 103–329, limited post-presidential protection to ten years for presidents inaugurated after January 1, 1997 [8] Under this statute, Bill Clinton would still be entitled to lifetime protection, and all subsequent presidents would have been entitled to ten years of protection [9] On January 10, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012, reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for his predecessor George W Bush, himself, and all subsequent presidents [10]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[He] was the true voice of the American spirit I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple\" [43] In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott [44]\n\n\nRelocation to New York and record deal\nIn May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie [41] at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital [42] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances He wrote of Guthrie's impact: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them..  [He] was the true voice of the American spirit I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple\" [43] In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott [44]\n\n\nProtest and Another Side\nIn May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear [72]\n\n\nGoing electric\n Dylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap, [86] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance [87] The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business\"; [88] its free-association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop [89] The song was provided with an early music video, which opened D A Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 British tour, Dont Look Back [90] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words on the ground Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements [91]\n\n\nHighway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde\nIn July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the US chart In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one on \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" [11] [105] Bruce Springsteen recalled first hearing the song: \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\" [106] The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans [107] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs \"Desolation Row\", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass, [108] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \"an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters\" [109] Poet Philip Larkin, who also reviewed jazz for The Daily Telegraph, wrote \"I'm afraid I poached Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited (CBS) out of curiosity and found myself well rewarded.\" [110]\n\n\nMotorcycle accident and reclusion\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a Triumph Tiger 100, near his home in Woodstock, New York Dylan said he broke several vertebrae in his neck [125] The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized [125] [126] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him [125] [127] Dylan concurred: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\" [128] He made very few public appearances, and did not tour again for almost eight years [126] [129]\n\n\n1970s\nIn the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" upon first hearing Self Portrait, released in June 1970 [144] [145] It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received [146] In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form [147] The title track was from Dylan's ill-fated collaboration with MacLeish, [142] and \"Day of the Locusts\" was his account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970 [148] In November 1968, Dylan co-wrote \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with George Harrison; [149] Harrison recorded that song and Dylan's \"If Not for You\" for his album All Things Must Pass Olivia Newton-John covered \"If Not For You\" on her debut album and \"The Man in Me\" was prominently featured in the film The Big Lebowski (1998).\n\n\nReturn to touring\nDylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired [162] His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour [163] The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs [164] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\", [165] and Dylan said \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental\" [37] Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label [166]\n\n\nChristian period\nIn the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity, [193] [194] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches [195] [196] He released three albums of contemporary gospel music Slow Train Coming (1979) featured Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording He replied: \"Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist Let's just make an album.\" [197] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:\n\n\n1980s\nIn late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective\", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire His second Christian album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior\" [202] His third Christian album was Shot of Love (1981) [203] The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs The lyrics of \"Every Grain of Sand\" recall William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence.\" [204] Elvis Costello wrote that \"Shot of Love may not be your favorite Bob Dylan record, but it might contain his best song: 'Every Grain of Sand'.\" [205]\n\n\n1990s\nDylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy It contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle\" The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four [229] Musicians on the album included George Harrison, Slash, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John The record received negative reviews and sold poorly [230] In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily, impairing his performances on stage [231] [232] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music:

Born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, Dylan rose to fame in the early 1960s as a key figure in the American folk music revival. With his unique voice, poetic lyrics, and eclectic style, Dylan has become one of the most influential and iconic musicians of all time, widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters in the history of popular music.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in St Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. His paternal grandparents, Anna Kirghiz and Zigman Zimmerman, emigrated from Odessa in the Russian Empire (now Odesa, Ukraine) to the United States, following the pogroms against Jews of 1905. His maternal grandparents, Florence and Ben Stone, were Lithuanian Jews who had arrived in the United States in 1902. Dylan wrote that his paternal grandmother's family was originally from the Kağızman district of Kars Province in northeastern Turkey.\n\n**1941–1959: Origins and Musical Beginnings**\n\nBob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in St Mary's Hospital on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. He began writing songs at the age of 15 and began performing at local clubs in Minneapolis and New York City. In 1958, he adopted the stage name Bob Dylan, reportedly inspired by the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Dylan's early music was heavily influenced by folk, country, and blues, and he was known for his poetic and often cryptic lyrics.\n\n**1960s**\n\nIn May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year and traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott and began to develop his unique style, blending folk, rock, and roll, and poetry. In 1962, he released his debut album, which was met with critical acclaim but moderate commercial success.\n\n**Relocation to New York and Record Deal**\n\nIn January 1961, Dylan traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie. Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott and began to develop his unique style, blending folk, rock, and roll, and poetry. In 1962, he signed with Columbia Records and released his debut album, which was met with critical acclaim but moderate commercial success.\n\n**Protest and Another Side**\n\nIn May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear. This marked the beginning of Dylan's reputation as a rebellious and outspoken artist.\n\n**Going Electric**\n\nDylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap, featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance. The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business.\" The song was provided with an early music video, which opened D A Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 British tour, Dont Look Back.\n\n**Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde**\n\nIn July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the US chart. In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one on \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\" Bruce Springsteen recalled first hearing the song: \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\" The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans.\n\n**Motorcycle Accident and Reclusion**\n\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a Triumph Tiger 100, near his home in Woodstock, New York. Dylan said he broke several vertebrae in his neck. The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan concurred: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\"\n\n**1970s**\n\nIn the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable. Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" upon first hearing Self Portrait, released in June 1970. It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received. In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form. The title track was from Dylan's ill-fated collaboration with MacLeish, and \"Day of the Locusts\" was his account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970.\n\n**Return to Touring**\n\nDylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired. His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour. The album included two versions of \"Forever Young,\" which became one of his most popular songs.\n\n**Christian Period**\n\nIn the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity, undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches. He released three albums of contemporary gospel music, Slow Train Coming, which featured Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler.\n\n**1980s**\n\nIn late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective,\" restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. His second Christian album, Saved, received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior.\" His third Christian album was Shot of Love, which featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs.\n\n**1990s**\n\nDylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky, an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy. It contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle.\" The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo,\" a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.\n\n**2000s**\n\nIn 2001, Dylan won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Things Have Changed,\" written for the film Wonder Boys. \"Love and Theft\" was released on September 11, 2001, recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album under the alias Jack Frost. Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz, and lounge music.\n\n**Modern Times**\n\nDylan's career as a radio presenter began on May 3, 2006, with his weekly program, Theme Time Radio Hour, on XM Satellite Radio. He played songs with a common theme, such as \"Weather,\" \"Weddings,\" \"Dance,\" and \"Dreams.\" Dylan's records ranged from Muddy Waters to Prince, L.L Cool J to the Streets.\n\n**Together Through Life and Christmas in the Heart**\n\nDylan released Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, Dylan explained it originated when French director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his movie My Own Love Song. He initially intended to record a single track, \"Life Is Hard,\" but \"the record sort of took its own direction.\" Nine of the album's ten songs are credited as co-written by Dylan and Robert Hunter.\n\n**2010s**\n\nThe Never Ending Tour commenced on June 7, 1988. Dylan has played roughly 100 dates a year since, a heavier schedule than most performers who started in the 1960s. By April 2019, Dylan and his band had played more than 3,000 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDylan's high school girlfriend was Echo Helstrom. The couple listened together to rhythm-and-blues on the radio, and her family exposed him to singers such as Jimmie Rodgers on 78 RPM records, and a plethora of folk music magazines, sheet music, and manuscripts. Helstrom is believed by some to be the inspiration for Dylan's song \"Girl from the North Country,\" though this is disputed.\n\n**Romantic Relationships**\n\nDylan's first serious relationship was with artist Suze Rotolo, a daughter of Communist Party USA radicals. When Joan Baez met Dylan in April 1961, she had already released her first album and was acclaimed as the \"Queen of Folk.\" On hearing Dylan perform his song \"With God on Our Side,\" Baez later said, \"I never thought anything so powerful could come out of that little toad.\" By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, their romantic relationship had begun to fizzle out, as captured in D A Pennebaker's documentary film Dont Look Back.\n\n**Home**\n\nWhen not touring, Dylan is believed to live primarily in Point Dume, a promontory on the coast of Malibu, California, though he owns property around the world.\n\n**Religious Beliefs**\n\nDylan has been described as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century, musically and culturally. He was included in the Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century, where he was called \"master poet, caustic social critic and intrepid, guiding spirit of the counterculture generation.\"\n\n**Archives and Honors**\n\nThe sale of Dylan's archive of about 6,000 items of memorabilia to the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the University of Tulsa was announced on March 2, 2016. It was reported the sale price was \"an estimated $15 million to $20 million.\" The archive comprises notebooks, drafts of Dylan lyrics, recordings, and correspondence.\n\n**Visual Art**\n\nDylan's visual art was first seen by the public via a painting he contributed for the cover of The Band's Music from Big Pink album in 1968.

[He] was the true voice of the American spirit I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple\" [43] In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott [44]\n\n\nRelocation to New York and record deal\nIn May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol Woody Guthrie [41] at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital [42] Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances He wrote of Guthrie's impact: \"The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them..  [He] was the true voice of the American spirit I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie's greatest disciple\" [43] In addition to visiting Guthrie, Dylan befriended his protégé Ramblin' Jack Elliott [44]\n\n\nProtest and Another Side\nIn May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\" was potentially libelous to the John Birch Society Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear [72]\n\n\nGoing electric\n Dylan's late March 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home was another leap, [86] featuring his first recordings with electric instruments, under producer Tom Wilson's guidance [87] The first single, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", owed much to Chuck Berry's \"Too Much Monkey Business\"; [88] its free-association lyrics described as harking back to the energy of beat poetry and as a forerunner of rap and hip-hop [89] The song was provided with an early music video, which opened D A Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 British tour, Dont Look Back [90] Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words on the ground Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan's idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements [91]\n\n\nHighway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde\nIn July 1965, Dylan's six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" peaked at number two in the US chart In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one on \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" [11] [105] Bruce Springsteen recalled first hearing the song: \"that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind.\" [106] The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans [107] The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs \"Desolation Row\", backed by acoustic guitar and understated bass, [108] offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as \"an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters\" [109] Poet Philip Larkin, who also reviewed jazz for The Daily Telegraph, wrote \"I'm afraid I poached Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited (CBS) out of curiosity and found myself well rewarded.\" [110]\n\n\nMotorcycle accident and reclusion\nOn July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his motorcycle, a Triumph Tiger 100, near his home in Woodstock, New York Dylan said he broke several vertebrae in his neck [125] The circumstances of the accident are unclear since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized [125] [126] Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered him the chance to escape the pressures around him [125] [127] Dylan concurred: \"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\" [128] He made very few public appearances, and did not tour again for almost eight years [126] [129]\n\n\n1970s\nIn the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan's output was varied and unpredictable Greil Marcus asked \"What is this shit?\" upon first hearing Self Portrait, released in June 1970 [144] [145] It was a double LP including few original songs and was poorly received [146] In October 1970, Dylan released New Morning, considered a return to form [147] The title track was from Dylan's ill-fated collaboration with MacLeish, [142] and \"Day of the Locusts\" was his account of receiving an honorary degree from Princeton University on June 9, 1970 [148] In November 1968, Dylan co-wrote \"I'd Have You Anytime\" with George Harrison; [149] Harrison recorded that song and Dylan's \"If Not for You\" for his album All Things Must Pass Olivia Newton-John covered \"If Not For You\" on her debut album and \"The Man in Me\" was prominently featured in the film The Big Lebowski (1998).\n\n\nReturn to touring\nDylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records, when his contract with Columbia Records expired [162] His next album, Planet Waves, was recorded in the fall of 1973, using the Band as his backing group as they rehearsed for a major tour [163] The album included two versions of \"Forever Young\", which became one of his most popular songs [164] As one critic described it, the song projected \"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\", [165] and Dylan said \"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental\" [37] Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes, widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label [166]\n\n\nChristian period\nIn the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Evangelical Christianity, [193] [194] undertaking a three-month discipleship course run by the Association of Vineyard Churches [195] [196] He released three albums of contemporary gospel music Slow Train Coming (1979) featured Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler and was produced by veteran R&B producer Jerry Wexler Wexler said that Dylan had tried to evangelize him during the recording He replied: \"Bob, you're dealing with a 62-year-old Jewish atheist Let's just make an album.\" [197] Dylan won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song \"Gotta Serve Somebody\" When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:\n\n\n1980s\nIn late 1980, Dylan briefly played concerts billed as \"A Musical Retrospective\", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire His second Christian album, Saved (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as \"the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, Slow Train Coming II and inferior\" [202] His third Christian album was Shot of Love (1981) [203] The album featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs The lyrics of \"Every Grain of Sand\" recall William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence.\" [204] Elvis Costello wrote that \"Shot of Love may not be your favorite Bob Dylan record, but it might contain his best song: 'Every Grain of Sand'.\" [205]\n\n\n1990s\nDylan's 1990s began with Under the Red Sky (1990), an about-face from the serious Oh Mercy It contained several apparently simple songs, including \"Under the Red Sky\" and \"Wiggle Wiggle\" The album was dedicated to \"Gabby Goo Goo\", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and Carolyn Dennis, Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four [229] Musicians on the album included George Harrison, Slash, David Crosby, Bruce Hornsby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Elton John The record received negative reviews and sold poorly [230] In 1990 and 1991 Dylan was described by his biographers as drinking heavily, impairing his performances on stage [231] [232] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Dylan dismissed allegations that drinking was interfering with his music: \"That's completely inaccurate I can drink or not drink I don't know why people would associate drinking with anything I do, really\" [233]\n\n\n2000s\nIn 2001, Dylan won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Things Have Changed\", written for the film Wonder Boys [251] \"Love and Theft\" was released on September 11, 2001 Recorded with his touring band, Dylan produced the album under the alias Jack Frost [252] Critics noted that Dylan was widening his musical palette to include rockabilly, Western swing, jazz and lounge music [253] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album [254] Controversy ensued when The Wall Street Journal pointed out similarities between the album's lyrics and Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza Saga was not familiar with Dylan's work, but said he was flattered Upon hearing the album, Saga said of Dylan: \"His lines flow from one image to the next and don't always make sense But they have a great atmosphere.\" [255] [256]\n\n\nModern Times\nDylan's career as a radio presenter began on May 3, 2006, with his weekly program, Theme Time Radio Hour, on XM Satellite Radio He played songs with a common theme, such as \"Weather\", \"Weddings\", \"Dance\" and \"Dreams\" [271] [272] Dylan's records ranged from Muddy Waters to Prince, L.L Cool J to the Streets Dylan's show was praised for the breadth of his musical selections [273] and for his jokes, stories and eclectic references [274] [275] In April 2009, Dylan broadcast the 100th show in his radio series; the theme was \"Goodbye\" and he signed off with Woody Guthrie's \"So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh\" [276]\n\n\nTogether Through Life and Christmas in the Heart\nDylan released Together Through Life on April 28, 2009 In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, Dylan explained it originated when French director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his movie My Own Love Song He initially intended to record a single track, \"Life Is Hard\", but \"the record sort of took its own direction\" [295] Nine of the album's ten songs are credited as co-written by Dylan and Robert Hunter [296] The album received largely favorable reviews, [297] although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon [298] In its first week of release, the album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, making Dylan, at 67 years of age, the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart [299]\n\n\n2010s\nVolume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg Series, The Witmark Demos, was issued in October 18, 2010 It comprised 47 demo recordings of songs taped between 1962 and 1964 for Dylan's earliest music publishers: Leeds Music in 1962, and Witmark Music from 1962 to 1964 One reviewer described the set as \"a

acclaim\" [306] In the same week, Sony Legacy released Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings, a box set that presented Dylan's eight earliest albums, from Bob Dylan (1962) to John Wesley Harding (1967), in their original mono mix in the CD format for the first time The set was accompanied by a booklet featuring an essay by Greil Marcus [307] [308]\n\n\nTempest\nVolume 9 of Dylan's Bootleg

have been described as part of the Great American Songbook [333] All of the songs had been recorded by Frank Sinatra, but both critics and Dylan himself cautioned against seeing the record as a collection of \"Sinatra covers\" [331] [334] Dylan explained: \"I don't see myself as covering these songs in any way They've been covered enough Buried, as a matter a fact What me and my band are basically doing is uncovering them Lifting them out of the grave and bringing them into the light of day\" [335] Critics praised the restrained instrumental backings and the quality of Dylan's singing [333] [336] The album debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release [337] The Bootleg Series Vol 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966, consisting of previously unreleased

[16] as it was deemed too large to fit on the regular Grammys ceremony [17] The Recording Academy then established the Latin Recording Academy in 1997, and the separate Latin Grammy Awards were first held in 2000 The Latin Grammys honor works recorded in Spanish or Portuguese from anywhere around the world that has been released either in Ibero-America, the Iberian Peninsula, or the United States [18]\n\n\nCOVID-19 impact (2021–2022)\nThe 63rd Annual Grammy Awards were postponed from its original January 31, 2021, date to March 14, 2021, due to the music industry impact of COVID-19 pandemic [19] [20]\n\n\nGramophone trophy\nThe gold-plated trophies, each depicting a gilded gramophone, are made and assembled by hand by Billings Artworks in Ridgway, Colorado In 1990, the original Grammy design was reworked, changing the traditional soft lead for a stronger alloy less prone to damage, making the trophy bigger and grander [23] Billings developed Grammium, a zinc alloy which they trademarked [24] Trophies engraved with each recipient's name are not available until after the award announcements, so \"stunt\" trophies are re-used each year for the ceremony broadcast [25] [26]\n\n\nCeremonies\nThe \"General Field\" are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.\n\n\nCategories\nThe \"General Field\" are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.\n\n\n2012 category restructuring\nOn April 6, 2011, the Recording Academy announced a significant overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012 [45] The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78 The most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, rhythm and blues  [R&B], country, and rap) Additionally, several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued; recordings in these categories now fall under general categories for best solo performances.\n\n\nSince 2012\nSince 2012, small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields The number of categories has risen from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 2017 [51] In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, several urban, rap, and Latin music categories were renamed [52] In 2022, the number of awards was increased from 86 to 91 [53] Performance categories were added for the Americana and alternative music genres alongside new categories for video game score and spoken word poetry albums A songwriter category (non-classical) and a song for social change category were also added and several categories were adjusted slightly [54] [55]\n\n\nEntry process and selection of nominees\nMembers of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), both media companies and individuals, may nominate recordings for consideration Entries are made and submitted online When a work is entered, review sessions are held that involve over 150 recording industry experts, to determine that the work has been entered in the correct category.\n\n\nFinal voting\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general field and cast ten votes in various genre categories spread to three of the eleven fields Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise Ballots are tabulated secretly by the independent accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [58] After vote tabulation, winners are announced at the Grammy Awards The recording with the most votes in a category wins, and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two  [or more] nominees who tie are considered winners) Winners are presented with a Grammy Award; those who do not win receive a medal for their nomination [citation needed]\n\n\nCertificates\nIn many categories, certificates are presented to those ineligible for a Grammy Award but who did contribute to a winning recording These certificates are known as Participation Certificates or Winners Certificates Those eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks after the Grammy ceremony [citation needed]\n\n\nSpecial honors\nA special Grammy Award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\" [59] It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies  As of 2018, [update] fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n\nGrammy Legend\nA special Grammy Award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\" [59] It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies  As of 2018, [update] fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n\nSalute to Industry Icons Award\nThe Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovative contributions to the music industry [60] [61] [62] Recipients include:\n\n\nVenue\nBefore 1971, Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day Originally New York City and Los Angeles were the host cities Chicago joined as a host city in 1962 and Nashville became a fourth location in 1965.\n\n\nLeading winners\nWith 32 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé is the artist with the most Grammy wins [64] [65] U2, with 22 Grammy Awards, holds the record for most awards won by a group [66]\n\n\nCriticism\nWhen Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage, \"I don't know what this means I don't think it means anything.\" [67] In 2008, Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music \"that's fully industry based\" He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards [68] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band's awards, explaining that: [69]\n\n\nCommercialism\nWhen Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage, \"I don't know what this means I don't think it means anything.\" [67] In 2008, Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music \"that's fully industry based\" He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards [68] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band's awards, explaining that: [69]\n\n\nReactions to nominations and awards\nThe Grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists The organization's awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by voting members of the Recording Academy and that voting members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process, such as performers, songwriters, producers, and engineers [75]\n\n\nFormatting\nThe Grammys' eligibility period runs from October 1 of one year until September 30 of the next year [89] Records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time) This is despite the quarter falling during the Christmas and holiday season, when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving, and when Christmas music is at its natural peak.\n\n\nAccusations of racial bias\nThe Grammys have also been accused of a racist bias against black recording artists In a 2017 interview Canadian artist Drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage He criticized the snubbing of \"One Dance\" for the Record of the Year award and the nomination of \"Hotline Bling\" for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, despite it not being a rap song [92] The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\" [93] Drake did not attend the 2017 awards ceremony where he was nominated He had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the ceremony Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album Blonde for award consideration as a protest [94]\n\n\nIssues with women\nThe Grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically Notably at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018, New Zealand singer Lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony She suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to Tom Petty but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the Album of the Year award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance Lorde's mother Sonja Yelich also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article that only nine percent of the nominees at the previous six Grammy ceremonies were women [102] After the 60th ceremony, several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist SZA who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories, and to the Best Pop Solo Performance category which included four female nominees but was won by Ed Sheeran [103] Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, sparked controversy after stating in an interview that female artists needed to \"step up\" in order to win awards Portnow's comments were criticized by many female musicians including Pink, Katy Perry, Vanessa Carlton, Sheryl Crow, Iggy Azalea, Halsey, and Charli XCX [104] They also caused the hashtag #GrammysSoMale to trend on social media [105]\n\n\nTV broadcasts and ratings\nBefore the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on ABC, a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called The Best on Record was broadcast on NBC The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series NBC Sunday Showcase, which normally was devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two venues Television producer Pierre Cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast [123] CBS bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to Nashville, Tennessee; the American Music Awards were created for ABC by the late Dick Clark as a result.\n\n\nViewership by year\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

[26]\n\n\nCeremonies\nThe \"General Field\" are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.\n\n\nCategories\nThe \"General Field\" are four awards which are not restricted by music genre.\n\n\n2012 category restructuring\nOn April 6, 2011, the Recording Academy announced a significant overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012 [45] The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78 The most substantial change was eliminating the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, rhythm and blues  [R&B], country, and rap) Additionally, several instrumental soloist categories were discontinued; recordings in these categories now fall under general categories for best solo performances.\n\n\nSince 2012\nSince 2012, small adjustments have been made to lists of categories and genre fields The number of categories has risen from 78 in 2012 to 84 since 2017 [51] In 2020, amid the George Floyd protests, several urban, rap, and Latin music categories were renamed [52] In 2022, the number of awards was increased from 86 to 91 [53] Performance categories were added for the Americana and alternative music genres alongside new categories for video game score and spoken word poetry albums A songwriter category (non-classical) and a song for social change category were also added and several categories were adjusted slightly [54] [55]\n\n\nEntry process and selection of nominees\nMembers of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), both media companies and individuals, may nominate recordings for consideration Entries are made and submitted online When a work is entered, review sessions are held that involve over 150 recording industry experts, to determine that the work has been entered in the correct category.\n\n\nFinal voting\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general field and cast ten votes in various genre categories spread to three of the eleven fields Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise Ballots are tabulated secretly by the independent accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu [58] After vote tabulation, winners are announced at the Grammy Awards The recording with the most votes in a category wins, and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two  [or more] nominees who tie are considered winners) Winners are presented with a Grammy Award; those who do not win receive a medal for their nomination [citation needed]\n\n\nCertificates\nIn many categories, certificates are presented to those ineligible for a Grammy Award but who did contribute to a winning recording These certificates are known as Participation Certificates or Winners Certificates Those eligible for a certificate can apply for one in the weeks after the Grammy ceremony [citation needed]\n\n\nSpecial honors\nA special Grammy Award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\" [59] It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies  As of 2018, [update] fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n\nGrammy Legend\nA special Grammy Award of merit is occasionally awarded to recognize \"ongoing contributions and influence in the recording field\" [59] It has come to be known as the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Living Legend Award at different ceremonies  As of 2018, [update] fourteen solo musicians and one band have received this award.\n\n\nSalute to Industry Icons Award\nThe Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award honors those who have made innovative contributions to the music industry [60] [61] [62] Recipients include:\n\n\nVenue\nBefore 1971, Grammy Award ceremonies were held in different locations on the same day Originally New York City and Los Angeles were the host cities Chicago joined as a host city in 1962 and Nashville became a fourth location in 1965.\n\n\nLeading winners\nWith 32 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé is the artist with the most Grammy wins [64] [65] U2, with 22 Grammy Awards, holds the record for most awards won by a group [66]\n\n\nCriticism\nWhen Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage, \"I don't know what this means I don't think it means anything.\" [67] In 2008, Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music \"that's fully industry based\" He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards [68] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band's awards, explaining that: [69]\n\n\nCommercialism\nWhen Pearl Jam won a Grammy for the Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, the band's lead singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage, \"I don't know what this means I don't think it means anything.\" [67] In 2008, Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music \"that's fully industry based\" He said he was not particularly interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two awards [68] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of progressive rock band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of the band's awards, explaining that: [69]\n\n\nReactions to nominations and awards\nThe Grammys also have been criticized for snubbing awards to some nominated artists The organization's awards journey states that nominees and winners are determined solely by voting members of the Recording Academy and that voting members are active creative professionals involved in the recording process, such as performers, songwriters, producers, and engineers [75]\n\n\nFormatting\nThe Grammys' eligibility period runs from October 1 of one year until September 30 of the next year [89] Records released in the fourth quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards (the submissions and first round ballots are underway at that time) This is despite the quarter falling during the Christmas and holiday season, when many physical albums have been traditionally released and are heavily purchased for holiday gift giving, and when Christmas music is at its natural peak.\n\n\nAccusations of racial bias\nThe Grammys have also been accused of a racist bias against black recording artists In a 2017 interview Canadian artist Drake accused the awards of seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist due to his previous work and heritage He criticized the snubbing of \"One Dance\" for the Record of the Year award and the nomination of \"Hotline Bling\" for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance, despite it not being a rap song [92] The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\" [93] Drake did not attend the 2017 awards ceremony where he was nominated He had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the ceremony Frank Ocean was vocal about boycotting the same Grammy Awards and did not submit his album Blonde for award consideration as a protest [94]\n\n\nIssues with women\nThe Grammys have also been criticized for their treatment of female artists specifically Notably at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018, New Zealand singer Lorde made headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony She suggested that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to Tom Petty but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the Album of the Year award and stated that each male nominee was allowed a solo performance Lorde's mother Sonja Yelich also criticized the Grammys, pointing out an article that only nine percent of the nominees at the previous six Grammy ceremonies were women [102] After the 60th ceremony, several media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the most nominated female artist SZA who failed to win in any of her five nominated categories, and to the Best Pop Solo Performance category which included four female nominees but was won by Ed Sheeran [103] Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, sparked controversy after stating in an interview that female artists needed to \"step up\" in order to win awards Portnow's comments were criticized by many female musicians including Pink, Katy Perry, Vanessa Carlton, Sheryl Crow, Iggy Azalea, Halsey, and Charli XCX [104] They also caused the hashtag #GrammysSoMale to trend on social media [105]\n\n\nTV broadcasts and ratings\nBefore the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on ABC, a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called The Best on Record was broadcast on NBC The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series NBC Sunday Showcase, which normally was devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two venues Television producer Pierre Cossette bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast [123] CBS bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to Nashville, Tennessee; the American Music Awards were created for ABC by the late Dick Clark as a result.\n\n\nViewership by year\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

His instructors included Charles Louis Hinton, Francis Coates Jones, George W Maynard, and Edgar Melville Ward [34] [35] [36] His first career job was with the New-York Tribune, 1905 [37] He succeeded the Tribune's Stephen H Horgan as art manager, 1906–12 [38] [39] [40] Martin continued to live at home during those years The family moved from Upper Manhattan to rural Maplewood, New Jersey, 1908 [41] [42] [43] Their new church was located just two blocks away [44] They lived near a train station, which allowed them to commute into Manhattan He joined the local tennis club and started competing in sanctioned events, 1909 [45] [46] His first two tournaments were held at the Nyack and Morristown clubs, Aug–Sep 1909 [47] He played in both with Ralph, an older brother by 12 years [48] Ralph was related through marriage to Charles Yardley Turner [49]\n\n\nCollier's\nGeneral-interest magazines flourished before the advent of television [89] One of them was the historically significant Collier's, which had a revival under editor William L Chenery in 1925 [90] [91] Martin drew twenty covers for the magazine between 1923 and 27 This included Christmas issues for 1924 and 26 [92] Some artists created a niche for themselves by drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women, or simple pleasures [93] He also relied on a recurring theme It showed a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities or situations This included eighteen appearances on the covers of Collier's Their descriptions follow: [94] bobbing for apples, loading up on desserts (pictured below), shooting marbles, playing the flute, [95] decked out in a straw hat, shoveling snow, winding up a spinning top, carrying schoolbooks, eating holiday turkey, catching a baseball, playing football (pictured), going down a water slide, [96] sleigh riding, happily swimming, saying grace, getting hair shaved, working as a messenger, and daydreaming about fishing [97] He rarely veered from that subject matter The most striking departure was for a self-portrait He portrayed himself as a well-dressed, vocal spectator at the horse races [98]\n\n\nCommercial artist\nMartin designed \"Wrigley Gum's\" light bulb spectacular, which showcased six acrobatic \"spearmen\" on a Broadway billboard in 1917 [38] It was the world's largest display panel, at 200 feet by 50 feet [104] It covered an entire city block in Times Square, between 43rd and 44th Sts [105] [106] [107] [108] This panoramic light show was a major tourist attraction for seven years [109] [110] The Wrigley name was synonymous with big-time advertising [111] He created a poster for the war effort titled \"Serve Your Country\" (double meaning), which depicted a fashionable young woman serving in tennis [112] It was for the War Camp Community Service in 1918 Women were encouraged to entertain off-duty soldiers by joining them in various activities (dancing, dining, sightseeing, socializing, theater, etc.) [113] This poster was silkscreened (pictured below) It has been displayed at the International Tennis Hall of Fame since 1965 [11]\n\n\nFisk tire boy\nThe Fisk Rubber Company was making tires for automobiles, bicycles, and carriages by 1901 [159] Its factory was located along the riverfront in Chicopee Falls, Mass The plant pumped out some 230,000 tires in August 1921 [160] Fisk struggled financially before and during the Great Depression [161] It was acquired by U.S Rubber (makers of the U.S Royal brand) in 1940 [162] Its worldwide subsidiaries (under various names) received the unifying name of Uniroyal (1966) [163] This mega-company merged with another to form Uniroyal Goodrich (1986) Its tire division was sold to Michelin (1990) [164] Affiliated dealers of Fisk tires included Kmart (1962–78) [165] and Discount Tire (1996–2014) [166] Dormant years: 1981–95 [167]\n\n\nMagazine cover illustrator\nArtist signed However, four are imprinted with the words \"Cover by Paul Martin.\" His signature remained fairly consistent—with a curved P & M, slanted t-crossbar, and underline mark Also, the first name was written above the last name.\n\n\nBook illustrator\nHis

tennis players in the New York metropolitan area, 1920–25, 28 (top twenty, 1923–24) [238] [239] [240] He was known for making accurate shots [241] Martin won numerous trophies (or awards) in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles (with Lauretta) between 1919 & 1931 [242] [243] [244] One of those trophies was for winning Sunningdale Country Club's first-ever singles championship, 1920 [245] [246] Others were for capturing the Lake George [247] and Lake Mohonk [248] championships of 1924 Martin's opponents included future Hall of Famers Fred Alexander, [249] Jean Borotra, [250] Francis Hunter,

His work appeared in numerous magazines, including Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Scribner's Magazine. Martin was known for his distinctive style and his ability to capture the spirit of the times in his illustrations. He was also a talented tennis player, competing in various tournaments and winning several championships.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe golden age of illustration began in the 1880s, marked by significant advancements in printing techniques. The halftone process made it possible to print images for commercial purposes more economically, feasibly, and realistically. This led to the rise of illustration as a popular art form, with artists like Howard Pyle, Charles Dana Gibson, J.C. Leyendecker, Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell, and N.C. Wyeth becoming household names. However, most illustrators received little recognition for their work, as it was often seen as commercially driven rather than creatively inspired.\n\n**Life**\n\nPaul Martin was born on June 6, 1883, in New York City to Hannah A. (née Morrow) and Robert C. Martin, a brick merchant. He was the second youngest of nine children, with three of his siblings not reaching adulthood. The Martin family moved several times during Paul's childhood, first to Central Harlem in 1890 and then to the Upper East Side in 1898. Paul's father was the superintendent of their Sunday schools, and the family was a devout Christian household.\n\nPaul showed a keen interest in drawing from an early age and attended the National Academy of Design, where he studied commercial art from 1902 to 1906. His instructors included Charles Louis Hinton, Francis Coates Jones, George W. Maynard, and Edgar Melville Ward. After completing his studies, Martin worked as a brokerage clerk at the age of 16 and later joined the New-York Tribune as a staff artist in 1905.\n\n**Collier's**\n\nIn 1923, Paul Martin began working with Collier's magazine, creating covers and illustrations for various issues. His most popular theme was a recurring one, featuring a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities or situations. This theme appeared on the covers of Collier's 18 times between 1923 and 1927, with descriptions including bobbing for apples, loading up on desserts, shooting marbles, playing the flute, and more. Martin's work for Collier's showcased his ability to capture the spirit of the times and appeal to a wide audience.\n\n**Commercial Artist**\n\nIn addition to his work with Collier's, Paul Martin was a successful commercial artist. He designed the \"Wrigley Gum's\" light bulb spectacular, a 200-foot by 50-foot display panel in Times Square that attracted tourists for seven years. Martin also created a poster for the war effort titled \"Serve Your Country,\" which depicted a fashionable young woman serving in tennis. The poster was silkscreened and has been displayed at the International Tennis Hall of Fame since 1965.\n\n**Fisk Tire Boy**\n\nThe Fisk Rubber Company, which made tires for automobiles, bicycles, and carriages, was acquired by U.S. Rubber in 1940 and later became part of the Uniroyal company. Paul Martin's work with Fisk included designing advertisements and promotional materials. The company's affiliated dealers included Kmart and Discount Tire.\n\n**Magazine Cover Illustrator**\n\nPaul Martin's signature remained fairly consistent throughout his career, with a curved P and M, slanted t-crossbar, and underline mark. His signature was often accompanied by the words \"Cover by Paul Martin.\" Martin's work appeared in numerous magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, and Scribner's Magazine.\n\n**Book Illustrator**\n\nIn addition to his work on magazine covers, Paul Martin also illustrated short stories and novels. His contributions included \"Short Turns and Encores\" by Dorothy Parker and others, \"The Blanket\" by Floyd Dell, \"The Unfairway\" by Burford Lorimer, and \"Tragedy\" by Eve Bernstein.\n\n**Tennis**\n\nPaul Martin was a talented tennis player, competing in various tournaments and winning several championships. He was ranked among the top thirty tennis players in the New York metropolitan area from 1920 to 1925 and 1928. Martin won numerous trophies in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, including the Sunningdale Country Club's first-ever singles championship in 1920 and the Lake George and Lake Mohonk championships in 1924.\n\n**Grand Slams (Majors)**\n\nPaul Martin's appearances in major tournaments included the National singles, where he lasted until the second round in 1924. He also competed in the National Veterans' singles, winning the fourth round in 1928 and 1929.\n\n**University Heights TC**\n\nPaul Martin was a longtime committee and playing member of the University Heights Tennis Club. He competed in the club's annual North Side tournaments from 1913 to 1929, reaching the semifinals in 1913, 1924, and 1928.\n\n**Memberships**\n\nPaul Martin played on the circuit for 23 consecutive years, from 1909 to 1931. His older brother, Ralph, joined him in the circuit in 1909, 1911, and 1921-1922.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Paul_Martin_(illustrator)\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe golden age of illustration began in the 1880s [12] Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place This included breakthroughs in the halftone process It made the printing of images for commercial purposes more economical, feasible and realistic The singular process of wood engraving (strenuous and time-consuming) was replaced by photo engraving (higher accu­ra­cy level) [13] Howard Pyle was an artist, writer, teacher and innovator Pyle is often regarded as the \"Father of American Illustration.\" [14] Its luminaries included Charles Dana Gibson, J C Leyendecker, Maxfield Parrish, Norman Rockwell, and N C Wyeth However, most illustrators received little recognition Their artwork was perceived as commercially (not creatively) inspired [15] This was in direct contrast to the fine artists Nevertheless, these illustrators communicated and documented the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, ideals, labor, morals and social interests [16]\n\n\nLife\nHe was born to Hannah A (née Morrow) and Robert C Martin (a brick merchant) in New York City on June 6, 1883 [19] [20] He was the second youngest of nine children Three of them did not reach adulthood [21] The family home was located on 31st St in Manhattan, between 8th and 9th Aves., throughout the 1880s [22] The Martin clan moved way up to Central Harlem on Edgecombe Ave in 1890 [23] Young Paul lost two sisters between 1891 & 1893 [24] The family relocated within Central Harlem to 129th and 5th, 1898 [25] [26] They belonged to the Twenty-fourth Street M E Church (till 1890) [27] [28] and Calvary M E Church (till 1908) [29] His father was the superintendent of their Sunday schools [30] [31] Martin immensely enjoyed drawing as a boy [32] His first regular job was as a brokerage clerk at age 16 [33] He studied commercial art at the National Academy of Design from 1902 to 1906 (Only summer session '06.)

However, the hip-hop community has also faced numerous challenges and tragedies, including the senseless loss of life due to violence and murder. This article aims to provide a comprehensive list of hip-hop musicians who have been murdered, highlighting the impact of their deaths on the music industry and the broader cultural landscape.\n\n**Early Victims (1970s-1980s)**\n\n## The Birth of Hip-Hop in New York City\n\nThe early days of hip-hop in New York City were marked by a vibrant and energetic scene, with pioneers such as DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa laying the foundations for the genre. However, this period was also marred by violence and gang activity, which would ultimately claim the lives of several young hip-hop artists.\n\n* **Scott La Rock** (1962-1987): A DJ and rapper from the Cold Crush Brothers, Scott La Rock was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in the Bronx.

His death was a tragic loss to the hip-hop community, and his legacy is still remembered by fans today.\n\n**Violence and Gang Activity in the 1990s**\n\nThe 1990s saw a significant rise in violence and gang activity within the hip-hop community, with several high-profile murders and violent incidents involving rappers and their affiliates. This period was marked by a sense of fear and uncertainty, as the hip-hop world struggled to come to terms with the senseless loss of life.\n\n* **Tupac Shakur** (1971-1996): One of the most influential and iconic rappers of all time, Tupac Shakur was shot and killed in Las Vegas after attending a boxing match. His death was a devastating blow to the hip-hop community, and his legacy continues to be celebrated through his music and activism.\n* **The Notorious B.I.G.** (1972-1997): A rising star in the hip-hop world, The Notorious B.I.G. was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles.

His death was a tragic loss to the hip-hop community, and his legacy is still remembered by fans today.\n\n**The Murder of Local Rappers**\n\nIn addition to the high-profile murders of well-known rappers, the hip-hop community has also been plagued by the senseless loss of life of local rappers and up-and-coming artists. These deaths often go unreported and are a reminder of the harsh realities of violence and gang activity within the hip-hop world.\n\n* **Lil' Cease** (1976-1997) was not killed, so I will list another artist instead: **Freaky Tah** (1976-1999): A rapper from The Ruff Ryders, Freaky Tah was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting.

His death was a tragic loss to the hip-hop community, and his legacy is still remembered by fans today.\n\n**The Continued Impact of Violence and Gang Activity**\n\nDespite efforts to address the root causes of violence and gang activity within the hip-hop community, the senseless loss of life continues to be a major issue. Many rappers and their families have spoken out about the need for greater support and resources to help prevent violence and promote peace within the community.\n\n* **Tupac Shakur** (1971-1996): His legacy continues to be celebrated through his music and activism, with many rappers and community leaders drawing inspiration from his life and work.\n* **Notorious B.I.G.** (1972-1997): His legacy continues to be celebrated through his music and the numerous tributes and memorials that have been erected in his honor.\n* **Big L** (1974-1999): His legacy continues to be celebrated through his music and the numerous tributes and memorials that have been erected in his honor.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe list of murdered hip-hop musicians is a sobering reminder of the harsh realities of violence and gang activity within the hip-hop community. Despite the many challenges and tragedies that have been faced, the hip-hop community continues to thrive and evolve, with many rappers and community leaders working to promote peace and understanding within the community. As we continue to mourn the loss of these talented individuals, we must also celebrate their legacies and the impact that they had on the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"List_of_murdered_hip_hop_musicians\" following this outline:\n\n\nList\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "G20", "content": "\nHistory\nThe G20 is the latest in a series of post–World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such as the \"Bretton Woods twins\", the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and what is now the World Trade Organization [16]\n\n\nEarly topics\nThe G20's primary focus has been governance of the global economy Summit themes have varied from year to year The theme of the 2006 G20 ministerial meeting was \"Building and Sustaining Prosperity\" The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth\", global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes.\n\n\nSummits\nThe Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, who prepare the leaders' summit and implement their decisions, was created as a response both to the 2007–2008 financial crisis and to a growing recognition that key emerging powers were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance Additionally, G20 summits of heads of state or government were held.\n\n\nChair rotation\nTo decide which member nation gets to chair the G20 leaders' meeting for a given year, all country members are assigned to one of five different groupings, with all but one group having four members, the other having three States from the same region are placed in the same group, except Group 1 and Group 2 All countries within a group are eligible to take over the G20 Presidency when it is their group's turn Therefore, the states within the relevant group need to negotiate among themselves to select the next G20 President Each year, a different G20 member country assumes the presidency starting from 1 December until 30 November This system has been in place since 2010, when South Korea, which is in Group 5, held the G20 chair The table below lists the nations' groupings: [47] [48]\n\n\nOrganization\nThe G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff The group's chair (the presidency) rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings Together with the previous and following presidency a so-called troika is formed, to provide a smooth transition of secretariat functions [50]\n\n\nProposed permanent secretariat\nIn 2010, President of France Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the establishment of a permanent G20 secretariat, similar to the United Nations Seoul and Paris were suggested as possible locations for its headquarters [53] Brazil and China supported the establishment of a secretariat, while Italy and Japan expressed opposition to the proposal [53] South Korea proposed a \"cyber secretariat\" as an alternative [53]\n\n\nMembers\nAs of 2023 [update], there are 21 members in the group: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and the African Union Guest invitees include, amongst others, Spain, the United Nations, the World Bank and ASEAN [54] [55]\n\n\nLeaders\nIn addition to these 21 members, the chief executive officers of several other international forums and institutions participate in meetings of the G20 [57] These include the managing director and Chairman of the International Monetary Fund, the President of the World Bank, the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee.\n\n\nMember country data\nIn addition to these 21 members, the chief executive officers of several other international forums and institutions participate in meetings of the G20 [57] These include the managing director and Chairman of the International Monetary Fund, the President of the World Bank, the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee.\n\n\nRole of Asian countries\nA 2011 report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted that large Asian economies such as China and India would play a more important role in global economic governance in the future The report claimed that the rise of emerging market economies heralded a new world order, in which the G20 would become the global economic steering committee [73] The ADB furthermore noted that Asian countries had led the global recovery following the late-2000s recession It predicted that the region would have a greater presence on the global stage, shaping the G20's agenda for balanced and sustainable growth through strengthening intraregional trade and stimulating domestic demand [73]\n\n\nInvitees\nTypically, several participants that are not full members of the G20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits Permanent guest invitees are: the government of Spain; the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development are invited in their capacities as leaders of their organisations and as heads of government of their home states In addition, the leaders of the Financial Stability Board, the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization are invited and participate in pre-summit planning within the policy purview of their respective organisation [74] [56] [75]\n\n\nPermanent guest invitees\nThe initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian and German policymakers, was very much focused on the sustainability of sovereign debt and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest developing economies as equal partners During a summit in November 2008, the leaders of the group pledged to contribute trillions to international financial organizations, including the World Bank and IMF, mainly for re-establishing the global financial system [76] [77]\n\n\nAgenda\nThe initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian and German policymakers, was very much focused on the sustainability of sovereign debt and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest developing economies as equal partners During a summit in November 2008, the leaders of the group pledged to contribute trillions to international financial organizations, including the World Bank and IMF, mainly for re-establishing the global financial system [76] [77]\n\n\nFinancial focus\nThe initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian and German policymakers, was very much focused on the sustainability of sovereign debt and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest developing economies as equal partners During a summit in November 2008, the leaders of the group pledged to contribute trillions to international financial organizations, including the World Bank and IMF, mainly for re-establishing the global financial system [76] [77]\n\n\nGrowth and sustainability\nThe G20 countries account for almost 75% of global carbon emissions [80] After the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, more \"issues of global significance\" [78] [81] were added to the G20 agenda: migration, digitisation, employment, healthcare, the economic empowerment of women, development aid [82] and stopping climate change [83]\n\n\nInterrelated themes\nWolfgang Schäuble, German Federal Minister of Finance, had insisted on the interconnected nature of the issues facing G20 countries, be they purely financial or developmental, and the need to reach effective, cross-cutting policy measures: \"Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, but there is also a growing rise in frustration in some quarters  […] development,  [national] security and migration are all interlinked\" [81]\n\n\nG20 engagement groups\nThe G20 engagement groups and pre-conferences are independent collectives that are led by organisations of the host country They represent a diverse group of stakeholders and work collectively to develop non-binding policy recommendations formally submitted to the G20 leaders for consideration.\n\n\nInfluence and accountability\nThe G20's prominent membership gives it a strong input on global policy despite lacking any formal ability to enforce rules There are disputes over the legitimacy of the G20, [86] and criticisms of its organisation and the efficacy of its declarations [87]\n\n\nViews on the G20's exclusivity of membership\nAlthough the G20 has stated that the group's \"economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system\", [91] its legitimacy has been challenged A 2011 report for the Danish Institute for International Studies criticised the G20's exclusivity, particularly highlighting its underrepresentation of African countries and its practice of inviting observers from non-member states as a mere \"concession at the margins\", which does not grant the organisation representational legitimacy [92] Concerning the membership issue, US President Barack Obama noted the difficulty of pleasing everyone: \"Everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G-21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out.\" [93] Others stated in 2011 that the exclusivity is not an insurmountable problem and proposed mechanisms by which it could become more inclusive [94]\n\n\nNorwegian perspective\nIn line with Norway's emphasis on inclusive international processes, the United Nations, and the UN system, in a 2010 interview with Der Spiegel, the current prime minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre called the G20 \"one of the greatest setbacks since World War II\" [12] as 173 states who are all members of the UN are not among the G20 This includes Norway, a major developed economy and the seventh-largest contributor to UN international development programs, [95] which is not a member state of the EU, and thus is not represented in the G20 even indirectly [12] Norway, like other such states, has little or no voice within the group Støre argued that the G20 undermines the legitimacy of international organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as the IMF, World Bank and United Nations:\n\n\nSpanish position on membership\nSpain is the world's fifteenth largest economy by nominal GDP (the sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity), the fourth in the European Union, the second among Spanish-speaking countries, and the third in Iberoamerica In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, and Spain is an important foreign investor worldwide Its numbers [clarification needed] exceed the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa This has led to what Henley et al consider to be a de facto position as a member of the G20 However, Spain, a permanent guest, does not plan to request official membership [56]\n\n\nPolish aspirations\nIn contrast with the Spanish position, the Polish government has repeatedly asked to join the G20.\n\n\nGlobal Governance Group (3G) response\nIn June 2010, Singapore's representative to the United Nations warned the G20 that its decisions would affect \"all countries, big and small\", and asserted that prominent non-G20 members should be included in financial reform discussions [106] Singapore thereafter took a leading role in organizing the Global Governance Group (3G), an informal grouping of 30 non-G20 countries (including several microstates and many Third World countries) to collectively channel their views into the G20 process more effectively [107] [108] [109] Singapore's chairing of the 3G was cited as a rationale for inviting Singapore to the November 2010 G20 summit in South Korea, [110] as well as 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 summits [citation needed]\n\n\nForeign Policy critiques\nThe American magazine Foreign Policy has published articles condemning the G20, in terms of its principal function as an alternative to the supposedly exclusive G8 It questions the actions of some of the G20 members and advances the notion that some states should not have membership in the first place Furthermore, with the effects of the Great Recession still ongoing, the magazine has criticized the G20's efforts to implement reforms of the world's financial institutions, branding such efforts as failures [111]\n\n\nCalls for removal of Russia\nIn March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S President Joe Biden called for the removal of Russia from the group Alternatively, he suggested that Ukraine be allowed to attend the G20 2022 summit, despite its lack of membership [112] Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said the group should \"re-evaluate\" Russia's participation [113] Russia claims it would not be a significant issue, as most G20 members are already fighting Russia economically due to the war [114] China suggested that expelling Russia would be counterproductive [112] In November 2022, Indonesia and Russia stated that Vladimir Putin would not attend the G20 summit in person, but may attend virtually [115] During the 2022 summit, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in a video statement and repeatedly addressed the assembly as the 'G19' as a means of indicating his viewpoint that Russia should be removed from the group [116]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "G20\n\nThe G20 (Group of Twenty) is an international forum that brings together the world's leading economies to discuss and address global economic issues. The group was established in 1999 as a response to the growing importance of emerging markets and the need for a more inclusive and representative global economic governance system.\n\n## History\n\nThe G20 is the latest in a series of post-World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy. The Bretton Woods twins, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, were established in the 1940s to promote economic cooperation and stability among the world's leading economies. The G20's primary focus has been on governance of the global economy, with summit themes varying from year to year.\n\n## Early topics\n\nThe theme of the 2006 G20 ministerial meeting was \"Building and Sustaining Prosperity.\" The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth,\" global energy and resource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact of demographic changes.\n\n## Summits\n\nThe Summit of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors was created as a response both to the 2007-2008 financial crisis and to a growing recognition that key emerging powers were not adequately included in the core of global economic discussion and governance. Additionally, G20 summits of heads of state or government were held.\n\n## Chair rotation\n\nTo decide which member nation gets to chair the G20 leaders' meeting for a given year, all country members are assigned to one of five different groupings, with all but one group having four members, the other having three. States from the same region are placed in the same group, except Group 1 and Group 2. All countries within a group are eligible to take over the G20 Presidency when it is their group's turn. Each year, a different G20 member country assumes the presidency starting from 1 December until 30 November.\n\n## Organization\n\nThe G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or staff. The group's chair (the presidency) rotates annually among the members and is selected from a different regional grouping of countries. The incumbent chair establishes a temporary secretariat for the duration of its term, which coordinates the group's work and organizes its meetings.\n\n## Proposed permanent secretariat\n\nIn 2010, President of France Nicolas Sarkozy proposed the establishment of a permanent G20 secretariat, similar to the United Nations. Seoul and Paris were suggested as possible locations for its headquarters. Brazil and China supported the establishment of a secretariat, while Italy and Japan expressed opposition to the proposal. South Korea proposed a \"cyber secretariat\" as an alternative.\n\n## Members\n\nAs of 2023, there are 21 members in the group: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, and the African Union. Guest invitees include Spain, the United Nations, the World Bank, and ASEAN.\n\n## Leaders\n\nIn addition to these 21 members, the chief executive officers of several other international forums and institutions participate in meetings of the G20. These include the managing director and Chairman of the International Monetary Fund, the President of the World Bank, the International Monetary and Financial Committee, and the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee.\n\n## Role of Asian countries\n\nA 2011 report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted that large Asian economies such as China and India would play a more important role in global economic governance in the future. The report claimed that the rise of emerging market economies heralded a new world order, in which the G20 would become the global economic steering committee. The ADB also noted that Asian countries had led the global recovery following the late-2000s recession.\n\n## Invitees\n\nTypically, several participants that are not full members of the G20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits. Permanent guest invitees include the government of Spain, the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and a representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. In addition, the leaders of the Financial Stability Board, the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the World Bank Group, and the World Trade Organization are invited and participate in pre-summit planning within the policy purview of their respective organization.\n\n## Agenda\n\nThe initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian, and German policymakers, was very much focused on the sustainability of sovereign debt and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest developing economies as equal partners. During a summit in November 2008, the leaders of the group pledged to contribute trillions to international financial organizations, including the World Bank and IMF, mainly for re-establishing the global financial system.\n\n## Financial focus\n\nThe initial G20 agenda, as conceived by US, Canadian, and German policymakers, was very much focused on the sustainability of sovereign debt and global financial stability, in an inclusive format that would bring in the largest developing economies as equal partners.\n\n## Growth and sustainability\n\nThe G20 countries account for almost 75% of global carbon emissions. After the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, more \"issues of global significance\" were added to the G20 agenda, including migration, digitization, employment, healthcare, the economic empowerment of women, development aid, and stopping climate change.\n\n## Interrelated themes\n\nWolfgang Schäuble, German Federal Minister of Finance, had insisted on the interconnected nature of the issues facing G20 countries, be they purely financial or developmental, and the need to reach effective, cross-cutting policy measures. \"Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, but there is also a growing rise in frustration in some quarters. Development, national security, and migration are all interlinked.\"\n\n## G20 engagement groups\n\nThe G20 engagement groups and pre-conferences are independent collectives that are led by organizations of the host country. They represent a diverse group of stakeholders and work collectively to develop non-binding policy recommendations formally submitted to the G20 leaders for consideration.\n\n## Influence and accountability\n\nThe G20's prominent membership gives it a strong input on global policy despite lacking any formal ability to enforce rules. There are disputes over the legitimacy of the G20, and criticisms of its organization and the efficacy of its declarations.\n\n## Views on the G20's exclusivity of membership\n\nAlthough the G20 has stated that the group's \"economic weight and broad membership gives it a high degree of legitimacy and influence over the management of the global economy and financial system,\" its legitimacy has been challenged. A 2011 report for the Danish Institute for International Studies criticized the G20's exclusivity, particularly highlighting its underrepresentation of African countries and its practice of inviting observers from non-member states as a mere \"concession at the margins,\" which does not grant the organization representational legitimacy.\n\n## Norwegian perspective\n\nIn line with Norway's emphasis on inclusive international processes, the United Nations, and the UN system, in a 2010 interview with Der Spiegel, the current prime minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre called the G20 \"one of the greatest setbacks since World War II\" as 173 states who are all members of the UN are not among the G20. This includes Norway, a major developed economy and the seventh-largest contributor to UN international development programs, which is not a member state of the EU and thus is not represented in the G20 even indirectly.\n\n## Spanish position on membership\n\nSpain is the world's fifteenth largest economy by nominal GDP (the sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity), the fourth in the European Union, the second among Spanish-speaking countries, and the third in Iberoamerica. In addition, since the 1990s several Spanish companies have gained multinational status, and Spain is an important foreign investor worldwide. Its numbers exceed the numbers of several current members of the G20 such as Argentina or South Africa. This has led to what Henley et al consider to be a de facto position as a member of the G20. However, Spain, a permanent guest, does not plan to request official membership.\n\n## Polish aspirations\n\nIn contrast with the Spanish position, the Polish government has repeatedly asked to join the G20.\n\n## Global Governance Group (3G) response\n\nIn June 2010, Singapore's representative to the United Nations warned the G20 that its decisions would affect \"all countries, big and small,\" and asserted that prominent non-G20 members should be included in financial reform discussions. Singapore thereafter took a leading role in organizing the Global Governance Group (3G), an informal grouping of 30 non-G20 countries (including several microstates and many Third World countries) to collectively channel their views into the G20 process more effectively.\n\n## Foreign Policy critiques\n\nThe American magazine Foreign Policy has published articles condemning the G20, in terms of its principal function as an alternative to the supposedly exclusive G8. It questions the actions of some of the G20 members and advances the notion that some states should not have membership in the first place. Furthermore, with the effects of the Great Recession still ongoing, the magazine has criticized the G20's efforts to implement reforms of the world's financial institutions, branding such efforts as failures.\n\n## Calls for removal of Russia\n\nIn March 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S President Joe Biden called for the removal of Russia from the group. Alternatively, he suggested that Ukraine be allowed to attend the G20 2022 summit, despite its lack of membership. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said the group should \"re-evaluate\" Russia's participation. Russia claims it would not be a significant issue, as most G20 members are already fighting Russia economically due to the war. China suggested that expelling Russia would be counterproductive. In November 2022, Indonesia and Russia stated that Vladimir Putin would not attend the G20 summit in person, but may attend virtually. During the 2022 summit, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in a video statement and repeatedly addressed the assembly as the 'G19' as a means of indicating his viewpoint that Russia should be removed from the group.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"G20\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe G20 is the latest in a series of post–World

predicted that the region would have a greater presence on the global stage, shaping the G20's agenda for balanced and sustainable growth through strengthening intraregional trade and stimulating domestic demand [73]\n\n\nInvitees\nTypically, several participants that are not full members of the G20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits Permanent guest invitees are: the government of Spain; the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and a representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development are invited in their capacities as leaders of their

underrepresentation of African countries and its practice of inviting observers from non-member states as a mere \"concession at the margins\", which does not grant the organisation representational legitimacy [92] Concerning the membership issue, US President Barack Obama noted the difficulty of pleasing everyone: \"Everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G-21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out.\" [93] Others stated in 2011 that the exclusivity is not an insurmountable problem and proposed mechanisms by which it could become more inclusive [94]\n\n\nNorwegian perspective\nIn line with Norway's emphasis on inclusive international processes, the United Nations, and the UN system, in a 2010 interview with Der Spiegel, the current prime minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre called the G20 \"one of the greatest setbacks since World War II\" [12] as 173 states who are all members of

Singapore to the November 2010 G20 summit in South Korea, [110] as well as 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 summits [citation needed]\n\n\nForeign Policy critiques\nThe American magazine Foreign

her father, Ross Ardern, worked as a police officer, [23] and her mother, Laurell Ardern (née Bottomley), worked as a school catering assistant [24] [25] She has an older sister named Louise [26] Ardern was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and her uncle, Ian S Ardern, is a general authority in the church [27] [28] In 1994, she began studying at Morrinsville College, [29] and later she was the student representative on the school's board of trustees [30] Whilst still at school, she found her first job, working at a local fish-and-chip shop [31]\n\n\nEarly political career\nOn 30 January 2008, at 27, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) at their world congress in the Dominican Republic for a two-year term until 2010 [43] [44] The role saw her spend time in several countries, including Hungary, Jordan, Israel, Algeria and China [34] It was mid-way through her presidency term that Ardern became a list MP for the Labour Party She then continued to manage both roles for the next 15 months.\n\n\nPresident of International Union of Socialist Youth\nOn 30 January 2008, at 27, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) at their world congress in the Dominican Republic for a two-year term until 2010 [43] [44] The role saw her spend time in several countries, including Hungary, Jordan, Israel, Algeria and China [34] It was mid-way through her presidency term that Ardern became a list MP for the Labour Party She then continued to manage both roles for the next 15 months.\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nAhead of the 2008 election, Ardern was ranked 20th on Labour's party list This was a very high placement for someone who was not already a sitting MP, and virtually assured her of a seat in Parliament Accordingly, Ardern returned from London to campaign full-time [45] She also became Labour's candidate for the safe National electorate of Waikato Ardern was unsuccessful in the electorate vote, but her high placement on Labour's party list allowed her to enter Parliament as a list MP [46] Upon election, she became the youngest sitting MP in Parliament, succeeding fellow Labour MP Darren Hughes, and remained the youngest MP until the election of Gareth Hughes on 11 February 2010 [47]\n\n\nMount Albert by-election\nArdern put forward her name for the Labour nomination for the Mount Albert by-election to be held in February 2017 [56] following the resignation of David Shearer on 8 December 2016 When nominations for the Labour Party

2017, just seven weeks before the 2017 general election, Ardern assumed the position of leader of the Labour Party, and consequently became leader of the Opposition, following the resignation of Andrew Little Little stood down due to the party's historically low polling [64] Ardern was unanimously confirmed in an election to choose a new leader at a caucus meeting the same day [65] At 37, Ardern became the youngest leader of the Labour Party in its history [66] She is also the second female leader of the party after Helen Clark [67] According to Ardern, Little had previously approached her on 26 July and said he thought she should take over as Labour leader then, as he was of the opinion he could not turn things around for the party, although Ardern declined and told him to \"stick it out\" [68]\n\n\n2017 general election\nDuring the general election held on 23 September 2017, Ardern retained her Mount Albert electorate seat by a margin of 15,264 votes [79] [80] [81] Labour increased its vote share to 36.89 per cent while National dropped back to 44.45 Labour gained 14 seats, increasing its parliamentary representation to 46 seats, the best result for the party since losing power in 2008 [82]\n\n\nPrime minister (2017–2023)\nOn 19 October 2017, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters agreed to form a coalition with Labour, [6] making Ardern the next prime minister [85] [86] This coalition received confidence and supply from the Green Party [87] Ardern named Peters as deputy prime minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs She also gave New Zealand First five posts in her government, with Peters and three other ministers serving in Cabinet [88] [89] The next day, Ardern confirmed that she would hold the ministerial portfolios of National Security and Intelligence; Arts, Culture and Heritage; and Vulnerable Children; reflecting the shadow positions she held as Leader of the Opposition [90] Her position as Minister for Vulnerable Children was later replaced with the role of Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, while New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin took on the role of Minister for Children [91] She was officially sworn in by Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy on 26 October, alongside her ministry [92] Upon taking office, Ardern said that her government would be \"focused, empathetic and strong\" [93]\n\n\nFirst term (2017–2020)\nOn 19 October 2017, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters agreed to form a coalition with Labour, [6] making Ardern the next prime minister [85] [86] This coalition received confidence and supply from the

taking office, Ardern said that her government would be \"focused, empathetic and strong\" [93]\n\n\nDomestic affairs\nOn 2 December 2020, Ardern declared a climate change emergency in New Zealand and pledged that the Government would be carbon neutral by 2025 in a parliamentary motion As part of this commitment towards carbon neutrality, the public sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20 per cent, and all 200 coal-fired boilers in public service buildings will be phased out This motion was supported by the Labour, Green, and Māori parties but was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties [190] [191] However, climate activist Greta Thunberg said about Ardern: \"It's funny that people believe Jacinda Ardern and people like that are climate leaders That just tells you how little people know about the climate crisis .. the emissions haven't fallen.\" [192]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn early December 2020, Ardern expressed support for Australia during a dispute between Canberra and Beijing over Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhao Lijian's Twitter post alleging that Australia had committed war crimes against Afghans She described the image as not being factual and incorrect, adding that the New Zealand Government would raise its concerns with the Chinese Government [218] [219]\n\n\nChristchurch mosque shootings\nOn 15 March 2019, 51 people were fatally shot and 49 injured in two mosques in Christchurch In a statement broadcast on television, Ardern offered condolences and stated that the shootings had been carried out by suspects with \"extremist views\" that have no place in New Zealand, or anywhere else in the world [152] She also described it as a well-planned terrorist attack [153]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nOn 14 March 2020, Ardern announced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand that the government would be requiring anyone entering the country from midnight 15

since 2017. She is the leader of the Labour Party and has been a member of the New Zealand Parliament since 2008.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nArdern was born on 26 July 1980 in Hamilton, New Zealand. She grew up in Morrinsville and Murupara, where her father, Ross Ardern, worked as a police officer, and her mother, Laurell Ardern (née Bottomley), worked as a school catering assistant. Ardern has an older sister named Louise. She was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and her uncle, Ian S Ardern, is a general authority in the church. In 1994, she began studying at Morrinsville College, and later she was the student representative on the school's board of trustees. Whilst still at school, she found her first job, working at a local fish-and-chip shop.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nOn 30 January 2008, at 27, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) at their world congress in the Dominican Republic for a two-year term until 2010. The role saw her spend time in several countries, including Hungary, Jordan, Israel, Algeria, and China. It was mid-way through her presidency term that Ardern became a list MP for the Labour Party. She then continued to manage both roles for the next 15 months.\n\n**Member of Parliament**\n\nAhead of the 2008 election, Ardern was ranked 20th on Labour's party list. This was a very high placement for someone who was not already a sitting MP, and virtually assured her of a seat in Parliament. Accordingly, Ardern returned from London to campaign full-time. She also became Labour's candidate for the safe National electorate of Waikato. Ardern was unsuccessful in the electorate vote, but her high placement on Labour's party list allowed her to enter Parliament as a list MP. Upon election, she became the youngest sitting MP in Parliament, succeeding fellow Labour MP Darren Hughes, and remained the youngest MP until the election of Gareth Hughes on 11 February 2010.\n\n**Mount Albert by-election**\n\nArdern put forward her name for the Labour nomination for the Mount Albert by-election to be held in February 2017. Following the resignation of David Shearer on 8 December 2016, Ardern participated in the 2017 Women's March, a worldwide protest in opposition to Donald Trump, the newly inaugurated president of the United States. She was confirmed as Labour's candidate at a meeting on 22 January. Ardern won a landslide victory, gaining 77 per cent of votes cast in the preliminary results.\n\n**Deputy Leader of the Labour Party**\n\nFollowing her win in the by-election, Ardern was unanimously elected as deputy leader of the Labour Party on 7 March 2017, following the resignation of Annette King, who was intending to retire at the next election. Ardern's vacant list seat was taken by Raymond Huo.\n\n**Leader of the Opposition**\n\nOn 1 August 2017, just seven weeks before the 2017 general election, Ardern assumed the position of leader of the Labour Party, and consequently became leader of the Opposition, following the resignation of Andrew Little. Ardern was unanimously confirmed in an election to choose a new leader at a caucus meeting the same day. At 37, Ardern became the youngest leader of the Labour Party in its history. She is also the second female leader of the party after Helen Clark.\n\n**2017 General Election**\n\nDuring the general election held on 23 September 2017, Ardern retained her Mount Albert electorate seat by a margin of 15,264 votes.

She also gave New Zealand First five posts in her government, with Peters and three other ministers serving in Cabinet.

Her position as Minister for Vulnerable Children was later replaced with the role of Minister for Child Poverty Reduction, while New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin took on the role of Minister for Children.\n\n**Domestic Affairs**\n\nOn 2 December 2020, Ardern declared a climate change emergency in New Zealand and pledged that the Government would be carbon neutral by 2025 in a parliamentary motion.

She said the new rules will mean New Zealand has the \"widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world.\" On 19 March, Ardern stated that New Zealand's borders would be closed to all non-citizens and non-permanent residents, after 11:59 pm on 20 March (NZDT).

He has gained recognition for his versatile performances in various film and television projects, showcasing his range as an actor.\n\n**Early Life**\nLaKeith Lee Stanfield was born in San Bernardino, California, on August 12, 1991. He grew up in Riverside and Victorville, where he experienced a difficult childhood. Stanfield has spoken about his upbringing, stating that he \"grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides.\" This challenging environment had a profound impact on his life and motivated him to pursue a career in acting at a young age.\n\nAt the age of 14, Stanfield joined his high school's drama club, which marked the beginning of his journey in the entertainment industry. He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, where he was signed by an agency and began auditioning for commercials. This experience helped him develop his skills and build his confidence as a performer.\n\n**Career**\nStanfield's first acting role was in the short film Short Term 12, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton for his thesis project at San Diego State University. The film won the Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, earning Stanfield recognition in the industry. A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010), further solidifying his presence in the world of film.\n\nDespite his growing interest in acting, Stanfield faced rejection and struggled to make a name for himself in the industry. He worked various jobs, including roofing and gardening, as well as positions at AT&T and a legal marijuana dispensary, to make ends meet. However, his dedication to acting never wavered, and he continued to pursue opportunities.\n\nStanfield's breakthrough came when Cretton contacted him to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12, which marked his first feature film role. During production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members to fully immerse himself in his character. He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature versions of the film.\n\nThe feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12 won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, cementing Stanfield's position in the industry. He was also nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male, further acknowledging his talent.\n\nSince then, Stanfield has appeared in a wide range of films, including 12 Years a Slave, Straight Outta Compton, and Sorry to Bother You. He has also made appearances in television shows such as Atlanta, The Chi, and Wu-Tang: An American Saga.\n\n**Personal Life**\nStanfield currently resides in Los Angeles, where he has been involved in various projects and has continued to build his career. In 2017, he welcomed his first child, a daughter, with actress Xosha Roquemore. Two years later, he had a second daughter with artist Tylor Hurd.\n\nIn December 2022, Stanfield announced his engagement to model Kasmere Trice. By July 2023, the couple had privately married and welcomed their first child together.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* Short Term 12 (2013)\n* Short Term 12 (short film, 2009)\n* Gimme Grace (short film, 2010)\n* 12 Years a Slave (2013)\n* Straight Outta Compton (2015)\n* Sorry to Bother You (2018)\n* The Girl in the Spider's Web (2018)\n* The Open House (2018)\n* The Harder They Fall (2021)\n* Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)\n* The French Dispatch (2021)\n* TBA (2023)\n\n### Television\n\n* Atlanta (2016)\n* The Chi (2018)\n* Wu-Tang: An American Saga (2019)\n* The Twilight Zone (2020)\n* TBA (2023)\n\n### Music Videos\n\n* \"The Arrival\" by LaKeith Stanfield (2020)\n\n### Awards and Nominations\n\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male (2014) - Short Term 12\n* Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature (2013) - Short Term 12 (South by Southwest film festival)\n* Jury Award for U.S. Short Filmmaking (2009) - Short Term 12 (Sundance Film Festival)\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* LaKeith Stanfield on IMDb\n* LaKeith Stanfield on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lakeith_Stanfield\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLaKeith Lee Stanfield was born in San Bernardino, California, on August 12, 1991, [1] [2] and grew up in Riverside and Victorville [3] His mother's name is Karen [4] He has said that he \"grew up very poor in a fractured family that was dysfunctional on both sides\" [5] He decided to become an actor when he was 14 after joining his high school's drama club He attended the John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center in Los Angeles, [5] where he was signed by an agency and began auditioning for commercials [3]\n\n\nCareer\nStanfield's first acting role was in the short film Short Term 12, Destin Daniel Cretton's thesis project at San Diego State University, which won the Jury Award for U.S Short Filmmaking at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival [5] A year later, he appeared in the short film Gimme Grace (2010) While continuing to keep his dreams of acting alive, [6] he went on to work a number of different jobs such as roofing and gardening, and jobs at AT&T and a legal marijuana dispensary, before he was contacted by Cretton to reappear in a feature-length adaptation of Short Term 12 It was his first feature film role [7] During production, Stanfield practiced method acting, distancing himself from the other cast members like his character [3] He was the only actor to appear in both the short and feature versions [8] The film won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Narrative Feature at the 2013 South by Southwest film festival, and Stanfield was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male [7]\n\n\nPersonal life\nStanfield lives in Los Angeles [22] Stanfield has a daughter born in 2017 with actress Xosha Roquemore, [4] [23] and a second daughter born in 2022 with artist Tylor Hurd [24] [25] In December 2022, Stanfield and model Kasmere Trice announced their engagement and by July 2023, they had privately married and had their first child together [26]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His work led to the development of a vaccine that has saved countless lives and has had a lasting impact on public health.\n\n**Life**\n\nRudolf Weigl was born in Prerau, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Austrian parents of Austro-Moravian descent. When he was a child, his father died in a bicycle accident, and his mother, Elisabeth Kroesel, later married a Polish secondary-school teacher, Józef Trojnar. Weigl was raised in Jasło, Poland, where he adopted the Polish language and culture.\n\nAlthough Weigl was a native German speaker, he fully immersed himself in the Polish culture and language, which would later shape his work and contributions to the field of microbiology. This unique cultural background would also influence his approach to vaccine development, as he was able to draw upon his knowledge of both German and Polish traditions.\n\n**Vaccine Development**\n\nIn 1930, following Charles Nicolle's 1909 discovery that lice were the vector of epidemic typhus, and following the work done on a vaccine for the closely related Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Weigl took the next step and developed a technique to produce a typhus vaccine by growing infected lice and crushing them into a vaccine paste. He discovered that a vaccine could be developed from lice stomachs infected with Rickettsia prowazeki, the causative agent of typhus in humans.\n\nWeigl developed this first version of the vaccine in 1918 and began experimenting on guinea pigs and even human volunteers. He refined this technique over the years until 1933 when he performed large-scale testing to cultivate bacteria and experiment with the lice using a micro-infection strategy.\n\nThe method comprised four major steps:\n\n1. **Isolation of infected lice**: Weigl would select lice that were infected with Rickettsia prowazeki and isolate them in a controlled environment.\n2. **Crushing of lice**: The infected lice would then be crushed into a fine paste, which would release the bacteria and other cellular components.\n3. **Cultivation of bacteria**: The crushed lice paste would be used to cultivate the bacteria, which would then be harvested and used to produce the vaccine.\n4. **Micro-infection strategy**: Weigl would use a micro-infection strategy to deliver the vaccine to the patient, which involved injecting a small amount of the vaccine into the patient's skin.\n\nThis innovative approach to vaccine development led to the creation of a vaccine that was highly effective in preventing the spread of epidemic typhus. Weigl's work laid the foundation for modern vaccine development and has had a lasting impact on public health.\n\n**Later Years, Death, and Legacy**\n\nFollowing the border changes in the aftermath of World War II, Weigl moved to Kraków in southern Poland. He was appointed chair of the General Microbiology Institute at the Jagiellonian University, and later chair of biology in the medical faculty at the University of Poznań. Weigl retired in 1951, but production of his vaccine continued for several years.\n\nWeigl's contributions to the field of vaccine development and public health have been widely recognized. He was continuously nominated for a Nobel Prize in the years 1930-1934 and 1936-1939, despite never receiving the award. Weigl's legacy extends far beyond his scientific contributions, as he was also a dedicated social worker and advocate for public health.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nWeigl was continuously nominated for a Nobel Prize in the years 1930-1934 and 1936-1939, despite never receiving the award. His work and contributions to the field of vaccine development have been recognized and honored through numerous awards and accolades.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Epidemic Typhus**: A highly infectious and often deadly disease caused by the bacterium Rickettsia prowazeki.\n* **Vaccine Development**: The process of creating a vaccine to prevent the spread of a disease.\n* **Rickettsia prowazeki**: The bacterium that causes epidemic typhus.\n* **Charles Nicolle**: A French doctor who discovered that lice were the vector of epidemic typhus.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Weigl, R.

His story is one of survival, resilience, and the complexities of the human experience. This article will delve into the life of Steven Stayner, from his birth and family to his kidnapping, escape, and later life.\n\n**Birth and Family**\n\nSteven Stayner was the third of five children born to Delbert and Kay Stayner in Merced, California. He had three sisters and an older brother, Cary. Growing up in a loving family, Steven's early life was marked by a sense of normalcy and security.\n\nHowever, the Stayner family was not without its challenges. Cary, Steven's older brother, would later be convicted of the murders of four women near Yosemite National Park in 2002. This tragic event would have a profound impact on the Stayner family and the community.\n\n**Kidnapping**\n\nOn the afternoon of December 4, 1972, Steven was approached on his way home from school by a man named Ervin Edward Murphy. Murphy, a trusting and simple-minded individual, had been enlisted by Parnell to help him abduct a young boy. Parnell, a convicted child molester, had a history of preying on vulnerable children.\n\nMurphy, unaware of Parnell's true intentions, agreed to help him. Together, they approached Steven, and Parnell offered him a ride home. Unbeknownst to Steven, he was being kidnapped and taken to a remote location where he would be held captive for seven years.\n\n**Escape**\n\nAs Steven entered puberty, Parnell began to look for a younger child to kidnap. However, Parnell had used Steven to attempt to kidnap children on prior occasions, but all the attempts were unsuccessful. This caused Parnell to believe that Steven lacked the means to be an accomplice.\n\nSteven, however, had been intentionally sabotaging these failed kidnappings. He revealed later that he had been trying to find a way to escape and return to his family. On February 14, 1980, Parnell and a teenage friend of Steven's, Randall Sean Poorman, kidnapped five-year-old Timothy White in Ukiah. Motivated in part by the young boy's distress, Steven decided to return the boy to his parents.\n\n**Later Life and Death**\n\nAfter returning to his family, Steven had trouble adjusting to a more structured household. He had been allowed to smoke, drink, and do as he pleased when he lived with Parnell. In an interview with Newsweek shortly after his escape, Steven said, \"I returned almost a grown man and yet my parents saw me at first as their 7-year-old. After they stopped trying to teach me the fundamentals all over again, it got better. But why doesn't my dad hug me anymore? [...] Everything has changed. Sometimes I blame myself. I don't know sometimes if I should have come home. Would I have been better off if I didn't?\"\n\nSteven's experience had left him with emotional scars and a deep sense of disconnection from his family. He struggled to rebuild his life and find his place in the world.\n\n**Media Adaptations**\n\nIn early 1989, a two-part television miniseries based on Steven's experience, \"I Know My First Name Is Steven\" (also known as \"The Missing Years\"), was produced. Steven, taking a leave of absence from his job, acted as an advisor for Lorimar-Telepictures and had a non-speaking part, playing one of the two policemen who escort 14-year-old Steven (played by Corin Nemec) through the crowds to his waiting family.\n\nAlthough pleased with the dramatization, Steven did complain that it depicted him as a somewhat \"obnoxious, rude\" person, especially toward his parents, something he refuted while publicizing the miniseries in the spring of 1989.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nTen years after Steven's death, the city of Merced asked its residents to propose names for city parks honoring Merced's notable citizens. Steven's parents proposed that one be named \"Stayner Park.\" However, the idea was eventually rejected, and the honor was instead given to another Merced resident.\n\nThe city officials feared that the name \"Stayner Park\" would be associated with Cary, Steven's brother, who had been convicted of the murders of four women in 1999. This tragic event had left a dark stain on the Stayner family's reputation, and the city officials did not want to be reminded of it.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* **Kidnapping**\n* **Child molestation**\n* **Survival**\n* **Resilience**\n* **Human experience**\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* **\"I Know My First Name Is Steven\" (1989)**\n* **\"The Missing Years\" (1989)**\n* **\"Steven Stayner: A True Story\" (1999)**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* **Steven Stayner's story on Wikipedia**\n* **The Steven Stayner Foundation**\n* **The Kenneth Parnell Foundation**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Steven_Stayner\" following this outline:\n\n\nBirth and family\nSteven Stayner was the third of five children born to Delbert and Kay Stayner in Merced, California [1] He had three sisters and an older brother, Cary [2] In 2002, Cary was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of four women near Yosemite National Park [3]\n\n\nKidnapping\nOn the afternoon of December 4, 1972, Stayner was approached on his way home from school by a man named Ervin Edward Murphy, who had become acquainted with convicted child molester Kenneth Parnell as co-workers at a resort in Yosemite National Park [4] Murphy, described by those who knew him as a trusting, naïve and simple-minded man, [4] had been enlisted by Parnell (who had passed himself off to Murphy as an aspiring minister) [5] [6] into helping him abduct a young boy so that Parnell could \"raise him in a religious-type deal,\" as Murphy later stated [6]\n\n\nEscape\nAs Stayner entered puberty, Parnell began to look for a younger child to kidnap Parnell had used Stayner to attempt to kidnap children on prior occasions, but all the kidnapping attempts were unsuccessful This caused Parnell to believe Stayner lacked the means to be an accomplice Stayner revealed later that he had intentionally sabotaged these failed kidnappings On February 14, 1980, Parnell and a teenage friend of Stayner's named Randall Sean Poorman kidnapped five-year-old Timothy White in Ukiah Motivated in part by the young boy's distress, Stayner decided to return the boy to his parents [17]\n\n\nLater life and death\nAfter returning to his family, Stayner had trouble adjusting to a more structured household as he had been allowed to smoke, drink and do as he pleased when he lived with Parnell [24] In an interview with Newsweek shortly after his escape, Stayner said, \"I returned almost a grown man and yet my parents saw me at first as their 7-year-old After they stopped trying to teach me the fundamentals all over again, it got better But why doesn't my dad hug me anymore?

[24] it included rhythm-and-blues features like horn sections, backing singers, and double-tracked vocals along with strings, recalling Springfield's influences such as the Exciters and the Shirelles [25] In January 1964, the single peaked at no 4 on the UK charts during a lengthy (for the time) 18-week run [26] In December 1963, New York disc jockey \"Dandy\" Dan Daniel of WMCA nominated the single as a \"Sure Shot\" pick of records not yet charted, preceding Beatlemania The single debuted on Billboard's Hot 100 on the chart dated 25 January 1964, a week after the debut of the Beatles' first hit \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and in the same week as the debut of \"She Loves You\", positioning Springfield at the forefront  of the British Invasion \"I Only Want to Be with You\" peaked at no 12 during its ten-week chart run, [27] [28] and ranked 48 in the year-end Top 100 of New York radio station WABC [29] The BBC's 1964–2006 weekly chart-based music programme Top of the Pops debuted on 1 January 1964, with \"I Only Want to Be with You\" as the show's kick-off record [30] The single was certified gold in the UK, [31] and its B-side, \"Once Upon a Time\", was written by Springfield [32] [30]\n\n\n1967–68\nAs with Springfield's chart success in the previous three years, there was minimal agreement in 1967 and 1968 between UK and US releases The closest Springfield got to a transatlantic hit during this period was the spirited \"I'll Try Anything\", which charted in the spring of 1967 (UK no 13/US no 40) The follow-up single, \"Give Me Time\"–the singer's last traditional-sounding sweeping ballad–peaked outside the UK Top 20 (no 24) and stalled at 76 in the United States However, the single's B-side – the smokey-sultry  Bacharach-David song \"The Look of Love\", recorded for the James Bond parody film Casino Royale–emerged as one of Springfield's five defining US 1960s hits [51] [52]\nFor \"one of the slowest-tempo hits\" of the sixties, Bacharach created the \"sultry\" feel by the use of \"minor-seventh and major-seventh chord changes\", while Hal David's lyrics \"epitomised longing and, yes, lust.\" [51] The song was recorded in two versions at the Philips Studios in London The soundtrack version was released on 29 January 1967 The single version charted briefly in July, then re-entered Billboard's Hot 100 in early September, peaking at no 22 However, it reached the Top Ten in several markets across the US, reaching number one in San Francisco (KFRC and KYA) and San Jose, California (KLIV) as well as no 2 in Boston (WBZ), among other cities [53] \"The Look of Love\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song [54]\n\n\n1968–69: Dusty in Memphis\nBy the late 1960s, Carole King–who with Gerry Goffin co-wrote \"Some of Your Lovin'\", \"Goin' Back\" and four songs on the Dusty in Memphis album–had embarked on a solo singing career At the same time, Springfield's relationship with the high-charting Bacharach-David partnership was floundering Her status in the music industry was further complicated by a \"progressive\" music revolution which dictated an uncomfortable dichotomy: underground/\"fashionable\" vs pop/\"unfashionable\" [33] Her performing career was limited to the UK touring circuit of working men's clubs, hotels and cabarets [33] Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, she signed with Atlantic Records, [33] the label of her idol Aretha Franklin (She signed with the label only in the United States; in her native United Kingdom she remained under contract with Philips.)\n\n\n1970s\nBy the beginning of the 1970s, Springfield was a major star, though her record sales were declining Her partner, Norma Tanega, had returned to the US after their relationship had become stressful, [80] and Springfield was spending more time in the US herself [81] In January 1970, her second and final album on Atlantic Records, A Brand New Me (re-titled From Dusty..

Born Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien on April 16, 1939, in West Hampstead, London, she was the second child of Gerard Anthony \"OB\" O'Brien, a tax accountant, and Catherine Anne \"Kay\" O'Brien, a homemaker.\n\n## Early Life\n\nSpringfield's parents were both Irish immigrants who settled in London. Her father grew up in British India and worked as a tax accountant and consultant, while her mother came from an Irish family originally from Tralee, County Kerry, that included a number of journalists. Springfield's elder brother, Dionysius Patrick O'Brien, was later known as Tom Springfield, a songwriter and musician who worked with his sister on many of her recordings.\n\n## Career\n\nAfter leaving school, Springfield sang with Tom, her brother, in local folk clubs. In 1957, the pair worked together at holiday camps. The next year, Springfield responded to an advertisement in The Stage to join The Lana Sisters, an \"established sister act\", with Iris \"Riss\" Long and Lynne Abrams, who were not actually sisters. Dusty adopted the stage name \"Shann Lana\" and \"cut her hair, lost the glasses, experimented with makeup, (and) fashion\" becoming one of the 'sisters'.\n\n### 1958-1963: Career Beginnings\n\nSpringfield's early career was marked by her work with her brother Tom and her time as a member of The Lana Sisters. After leaving school, she sang with Tom, her brother, in local folk clubs. In 1957, the pair worked together at holiday camps. The next year, Springfield responded to an advertisement in The Stage to join The Lana Sisters, an \"established sister act\", with Iris \"Riss\" Long and Lynne Abrams, who were not actually sisters. Dusty adopted the stage name \"Shann Lana\" and \"cut her hair, lost the glasses, experimented with makeup, (and) fashion\" becoming one of the 'sisters'.\n\n### 1963-1966: Early Solo Career\n\nDusty Springfield released her first solo single, \"I Only Want to Be with You\", co-written and arranged by Ivor Raymonde, in November 1963. The record was produced by Johnny Franz in a manner similar to Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\", and included rhythm-and-blues features like horn sections, backing singers, and double-tracked vocals along with strings, recalling Springfield's influences such as the Exciters and the Shirelles.\n\nIn January 1964, the single peaked at no 4 on the UK charts during a lengthy (for the time) 18-week run. In December 1963, New York disc jockey \"Dandy\" Dan Daniel of WMCA nominated the single as a \"Sure Shot\" pick of records not yet charted, preceding Beatlemania. The single debuted on Billboard's Hot 100 on the chart dated 25 January 1964, a week after the debut of the Beatles' first hit \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and in the same week as the debut of \"She Loves You\", positioning Springfield at the forefront of the British Invasion.\n\n### 1967-68\n\nAs with Springfield's chart success in the previous three years, there was minimal agreement in 1967 and 1968 between UK and US releases. The closest Springfield got to a transatlantic hit during this period was the spirited \"I'll Try Anything\", which charted in the spring of 1967 (UK no 13/US no 40). The follow-up single, \"Give Me Time\"–the singer's last traditional-sounding sweeping ballad–peaked outside the UK Top 20 (no 24) and stalled at 76 in the United States.\n\nHowever, the single's B-side – the smokey-sultry Bacharach-David song \"The Look of Love\", recorded for the James Bond parody film Casino Royale–emerged as one of Springfield's five defining US 1960s hits. For \"one of the slowest-tempo hits\" of the sixties, Bacharach created the \"sultry\" feel by the use of \"minor-seventh and major-seventh chord changes\", while Hal David's lyrics \"epitomised longing and, yes, lust.\" The song was recorded in two versions at the Philips Studios in London.\n\n### 1968-69: Dusty in Memphis\n\nBy the late 1960s, Carole King–who with Gerry Goffin co-wrote \"Some of Your Lovin'\", \"Goin' Back\" and four songs on the Dusty in Memphis album–had embarked on a solo singing career. At the same time, Springfield's relationship with the high-charting Bacharach-David partnership was floundering. Her status in the music industry was further complicated by a \"progressive\" music revolution which dictated an uncomfortable dichotomy: underground/\"fashionable\" vs pop/\"unfashionable\".\n\nHer performing career was limited to the UK touring circuit of working men's clubs, hotels and cabarets. Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, she signed with Atlantic Records, the label of her idol Aretha Franklin. She signed with the label only in the United States; in her native United Kingdom she remained under contract with Philips.\n\n## 1970s\n\nBy the beginning of the 1970s, Springfield was a major star, though her record sales were declining. Her partner, Norma Tanega, had returned to the US after their relationship had become stressful, and Springfield was spending more time in the US herself. In January 1970, her second and final album on Atlantic Records, A Brand New Me (re-titled From Dusty.. With Love in the UK), was released; it featured tracks written and produced by Gamble and Huff.\n\nThe album and related singles only sold moderately; Springfield was unhappy with both her management and record company. She sang backing vocals with her friend Madeline Bell on two tracks on Elton John's 1971 hit album Tumbleweed Connection. Springfield recorded some songs with producer Jeff Barry in early 1971, which were intended for an album to be released by Atlantic Records.\n\nHowever, her new manager Alan Bernard negotiated her out of the Atlantic contract; some of the tracks were used on the UK-only album See All Her Faces (November 1972) and the 1999 release Dusty in Memphis-Deluxe Edition. She signed a contract with ABC Dunhill Records in 1972, and Cameo was issued in February 1973 to respectable reviews, though poor sales.\n\n## 1980s\n\nIn 1980, Springfield sang \"Bits and Pieces\", the theme song from the movie The Stunt Man. She signed a US deal with 20th Century Records, which resulted in the single \"It Goes Like It Goes\", a cover of the Oscar-winning song from the film Norma Rae. Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album White Heat, which was influenced by new wave music.\n\nShe tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome Records label. This resulted in the single \"Sometimes Like Butterflies\" and an appearance on Terry Wogan's TV chat show Wogan. None of Springfield's singles from 1971 to 1986 charted on the UK Top 40 or Billboard Hot 100.\n\n## 1990s\n\nSpringfield's 1990 album, Reputation, was her third UK Top 20 studio album. The writing and production credits for half the album, which included the two recent hit singles, went to Pet Shop Boys, while the album's other producers included Dan Hartman. By 1988 Springfield had left California and, other than when recording tracks for Reputation, she returned to the UK to live.\n\nIn 1993, she recorded a duet with her former 1960s professional rival and friend, Cilla Black. In October, \"Heart and Soul\" was released as a single and, in September it had appeared on Black's album, Through the Years. Springfield's next album, provisionally titled Dusty in Nashville, was started in 1993 with producer, Tom Shapiro, but was issued as A Very Fine Love in June 1995.\n\n## Musical Style\n\nInfluenced by US pop music, Dusty Springfield created a distinctive blue-eyed soul sound. Her soulful voice, at once strident and vulnerable, set her apart from her contemporaries. She was equally at home singing Broadway standards, blues, country or even techno-pop.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nSpringfield's parents, Catherine and Gerard, lived in Hove, East Sussex from 1962. Catherine died in a nursing home there in 1974 of lung cancer. In 1979, Gerard died of a heart attack in Rottingdean, East Sussex.\n\n## Death\n\nIn January 1994, while recording her album, A Very Fine Love, in Nashville, Springfield began to feel ill. When she returned to England a few months later, her physicians diagnosed her with breast cancer. She received months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and the cancer was found to be in remission.\n\nIn 1995, in apparent good health, she set about to promote the album, which was released that year. By mid-1996, the cancer had returned, and despite vigorous treatments, Springfield died on 2 March 1999, aged 59, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\n\n## Legacy\n\nShe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two weeks after her death. Her friend Elton John helped induct her into the Hall of Fame, declaring, \"I'm biased but I just think she was the greatest white singer there ever has been... every song she sang, she claimed as her own.\"\n\n## Awards and Tributes\n\nSpringfield is an inductee of the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), the UK Music Hall of Fame (2006), and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame (2023). She was named among the top 25 female artists of all time by readers of Mojo magazine (May 1999), editors of Q magazine (January 2002), and a panel of artists on VH1 TV channel (August 2007).\n\nIn 2008, she appeared at No. 35 on the Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\" In the 1960s she topped a number of popularity polls, including Melody Maker's Best International Vocalist for 1966; in 1965 she was the first British singer to top the New Musical Express readers' polls for Female Singer, topping that poll again in 1966, 1967, and 1969, as well as getting the most votes in the British Singer category from 1964 to 1966.\n\nHer album Dusty in Memphis has been listed among the greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone and in polls by VH1 artists, New Musical Express readers, and the Channel 4 viewers; in 2001 she received the Grammy Hall of Fame award.\n\n## Discography\n\nSpringfield's discography includes the following albums and singles:\n\n* A Girl Called Dusty (1964)\n* Dusty (1964)\n* The Look of Love (1967)\n* Dusty...

[24] it included rhythm-and-blues features like horn sections, backing singers, and double-tracked vocals along with strings, recalling Springfield's influences such as the Exciters and the Shirelles [25] In January 1964, the single peaked at no 4 on the UK charts during a lengthy (for the time) 18-week run [26] In December 1963, New York disc jockey \"Dandy\" Dan Daniel of WMCA nominated the single as a \"Sure Shot\" pick of records not yet charted, preceding Beatlemania The single debuted on Billboard's Hot 100 on the chart dated 25 January 1964, a week after the debut of the Beatles' first hit \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" and in the same week as the debut of \"She Loves You\", positioning Springfield at the forefront  of the British Invasion \"I Only Want to Be with You\" peaked at no 12 during its ten-week chart run, [27] [28] and ranked 48 in the year-end Top 100 of New York radio station WABC [29] The BBC's 1964–2006 weekly chart-based music programme Top of the Pops debuted on 1 January 1964, with \"I Only Want to Be with You\" as the show's kick-off record [30] The single was certified gold in the UK, [31] and its B-side, \"Once Upon a Time\", was written by Springfield [32] [30]\n\n\n1967–68\nAs with Springfield's chart success in the previous three years, there was minimal agreement in 1967 and 1968 between UK and US releases The closest Springfield got to a transatlantic hit during this period was the spirited \"I'll Try Anything\", which charted in the spring of 1967 (UK no 13/US no 40) The follow-up single, \"Give Me Time\"–the singer's last traditional-sounding sweeping ballad–peaked outside the UK Top 20 (no 24) and stalled at 76 in the United States However, the single's B-side – the smokey-sultry  Bacharach-David song \"The Look of Love\", recorded for the James Bond parody film Casino Royale–emerged as one of Springfield's five defining US 1960s hits [51] [52]\nFor \"one of the slowest-tempo hits\" of the sixties, Bacharach created the \"sultry\" feel by the use of \"minor-seventh and major-seventh chord changes\", while Hal David's lyrics \"epitomised longing and, yes, lust.\" [51] The song was recorded in two versions at the Philips Studios in London The soundtrack version was released on 29 January 1967 The single version charted briefly in July, then re-entered Billboard's Hot 100 in early September, peaking at no 22 However, it reached the Top Ten in several markets across the US, reaching number one in San Francisco (KFRC and KYA) and San Jose, California (KLIV) as well as no 2 in Boston (WBZ), among other cities [53] \"The Look of Love\" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song [54]\n\n\n1968–69: Dusty in Memphis\nBy the late 1960s, Carole King–who with Gerry Goffin co-wrote \"Some of Your Lovin'\", \"Goin' Back\" and four songs on the Dusty in Memphis album–had embarked on a solo singing career At the same time, Springfield's relationship with the high-charting Bacharach-David partnership was floundering Her status in the music industry was further complicated by a \"progressive\" music revolution which dictated an uncomfortable dichotomy: underground/\"fashionable\" vs pop/\"unfashionable\" [33] Her performing career was limited to the UK touring circuit of working men's clubs, hotels and cabarets [33] Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, she signed with Atlantic Records, [33] the label of her idol Aretha Franklin (She signed with the label only in the United States; in her native United Kingdom she remained under contract with Philips.)\n\n\n1970s\nBy the beginning of the 1970s, Springfield was a major star, though her record sales were declining Her partner, Norma Tanega, had returned to the US after their relationship had become stressful, [80] and Springfield was spending more time in the US herself [81] In January 1970, her second and final album on Atlantic Records, A Brand New Me (re-titled From Dusty.. With Love in the UK), was released; it featured tracks written and produced by Gamble and Huff [82] The album and related singles only sold moderately; [83] Springfield was unhappy with both her management and record company [84] She sang backing vocals with her friend Madeline Bell on two tracks on Elton John's 1971 hit album Tumbleweed Connection Springfield recorded some songs with producer Jeff Barry in early 1971, which were intended for an album to be released by Atlantic Records [85] However, her new manager Alan Bernard negotiated her out of the Atlantic contract; some of the tracks were used on the UK-only album See All Her Faces (November 1972) and the 1999 release Dusty in Memphis-Deluxe Edition [84] She signed a contract with ABC Dunhill Records in 1972, and Cameo was issued in February 1973 to respectable reviews, though poor sales [86]\n\n\n1980s\nIn 1980, Springfield sang \"Bits and Pieces\", the theme song from the movie The Stunt Man She signed a US deal with 20th Century Records, which resulted in the single \"It Goes Like It Goes\", a cover of the Oscar-winning song from the film Norma Rae Springfield was uncharacteristically proud of her 1982 album White Heat, which was influenced by new wave music [30] She tried to revive her career in 1985 by returning to the UK and signing to Peter Stringfellow's Hippodrome Records label This resulted in the single \"Sometimes Like Butterflies\" and an appearance on Terry Wogan's TV chat show Wogan None of Springfield's singles from 1971 to 1986 charted on the UK Top 40 or Billboard Hot 100 [26] [27]\n\n\n1990s\nSpringfield's 1990 album, Reputation, was her third UK Top 20 studio album [26] The writing and production credits for half the album, which included the two recent hit singles, went to Pet Shop Boys, while the album's other producers included Dan Hartman By 1988 Springfield had left California and other than when recording tracks for Reputation, she returned to the UK to live In 1993, she recorded a duet with her former 1960s professional rival and friend, Cilla Black In October, \"Heart and Soul\" was released as a single and, in September it had appeared on Black's album, Through the Years [95] Springfield's next album, provisionally titled Dusty in Nashville, was started in 1993 with producer, Tom Shapiro, but was issued as A Very Fine Love in June 1995 Though originally intended by Shapiro as a country music album, the track selection by Springfield pushed the album into pop music with an occasional country feel [96]\n\n\nMusical style\n\nInfluenced by US pop music, [79] Dusty Springfield created a distinctive blue-eyed soul sound [44] [69] BBC News noted \" [h]er soulful voice, at once strident and vulnerable, set her apart from her contemporaries.. She was equally at home singing Broadway standards, blues, country or even techno-pop\" [98] Allmusic's Jason Ankeny described her:\n\nPersonal life\nSpringfield's parents, Catherine and Gerard, lived in Hove, East Sussex from 1962 Catherine died in a nursing home there in 1974 of lung cancer [111] In 1979, Gerard died of a heart attack in Rottingdean, East Sussex [111]\n\n\nDeath\nIn January 1994, while recording her album, A Very Fine Love, in Nashville, Springfield began to feel ill When she returned to England a few months later, her physicians diagnosed her with breast cancer [103] She received months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and the cancer was found to be in remission [99] In 1995, in apparent good health, she set about to promote the album, which was released that year [119] By mid-1996, the cancer had returned, and despite vigorous treatments, Springfield died on 2 March 1999, aged 59, in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire [120] [121]\n\n\nLegacy\nShe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two weeks after her death Her friend Elton John helped induct her into the Hall of Fame declaring, \"I'm biased but I just think she was the greatest white singer there ever has been.. every song she sang, she claimed as her own\" [126] [127]\n\n\nAwards and tributes\nSpringfield is an inductee of the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), the UK Music Hall of Fame (2006), and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame (2023) She was named among the top 25 female artists of all time by readers of Mojo magazine (May 1999), [140] editors of Q magazine (January 2002), [141] and a panel of artists on VH1 TV channel (August 2007) [142] In 2008, she appeared at No. 35 on the Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" [143] In the 1960s she topped a number of popularity polls, including Melody Maker's Best International Vocalist for 1966; in 1965 she was the first British singer to top the New Musical Express readers' polls for Female Singer topping that poll again in 1966, 1967, and 1969 as well as getting the most votes in the British Singer category from 1964 to 1966 [135] [19] Her album Dusty in Memphis has been listed among the greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone and in polls by VH1 artists, New Musical Express readers, and the Channel 4 viewers; [71] in 2001 she received the Grammy Hall of Fame award [144]\n\n\nDiscography\nSpringfield was the presenter or host of several TV musical series:\n\n\nFilmography\nSpringfield was the presenter or host of several TV musical series:\n\n\nUK TV Series\nProduced by Stanley Dorfman Musical director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Thursdays on BBC1 at 9:00 pm (Except Episode 4 at 9:05 pm)\n\n\nDusty – Series 1 (1966)\nProduced by Stanley Dorfman Musical director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Thursdays on BBC1 at 9:00 pm (Except Episode 4 at 9:05 pm)\n\n\nDusty – Series 2 (1967)\nProduced by Stanley Dorfman Backing vocals: Madeline Bell, Lesley Duncan and Maggie Stredder Musical director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Tuesdays on BBC1 at 9:05 pm\n\n\nIt Must Be Dusty – Series 1 (1968)\nProduced by ATV Broadcast on ITV Producer Colin Clews.\n\n\nShow of the Week: Dusty at The Talk of the Town\nProduced by Mel Cornish Introduced by Valentine Dyall Dancers: Cassandra Mahon & Peter Newton Choreographer: Ruth Pearson Vocal backing: Kay Garner, Lesley Duncan & Madeline Bell Musical associate: Larry Ashmore Musical Director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Tuesdays on BBC1 at 7:30 pm\n\n\nChristmas Special\nProduced by Mel Cornish Introduced by Valentine Dyall Dancers: Cassandra Mahon & Peter Newton Choreographer: Ruth Pearson Vocal backing: Kay Garner, Lesley Duncan & Madeline Bell Musical associate: Larry Ashmore Musical Director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Tuesdays on BBC1 at 7:30 pm\n\n\nDecidedly Dusty – Series 1 (1969)\nProduced by Mel Cornish Introduced by Valentine Dyall Dancers: Cassandra Mahon & Peter Newton Choreographer: Ruth Pearson Vocal backing: Kay Garner, Lesley Duncan & Madeline Bell Musical associate: Larry Ashmore Musical Director: Johnny Pearson Broadcast Tuesdays on BBC1 at 7:30 pm\n\n\nTV Specials\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSpecific\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

I wanted it to sound like, 'I need to leave, so bye'\" [24] Grande wanted the song to have a sense of self-awareness and accountability, rather than being completely dismissive [25] It is an uptempo dance-pop number with influences of disco and Philadelphia soul [26] [27] The third track, \"Don't Wanna Break Up Again\", is a gloomy, '90s influenced pop and R&B song that discusses conflicting feelings Grande has towards the end of her relationship with her partner [28] While referring to her relationship as a \"situationship\" that she's aware needs to end, the song shows a reluctancy to

Ariana Grande, released on March 8, 2024, through Republic Records. The album marks a significant departure from Grande's previous work, with a more mature and introspective approach to songwriting and production.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn May 12, 2022, Grande clarified that she would not be recording another album until she was done filming Wicked (2024), the film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, in which she portrays the character Glinda. However, in October 2023, she jokingly hinted at a forthcoming album by posting \"ag7: goat mother\" as an Instagram caption, along with a photo of her with Swedish producer and long-time collaborator Max Martin at Jungle City Studios in New York City.\n\n**Conception**\n\nGrande described Eternal Sunshine as \"kind of a concept album\" comprising \"different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience.\" She explained that the record spans from \"really vulnerable\" songs to playful tracks which see her emulating \"what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it.\" Wendy Goldstein, co-president of Republic Records, described the record as an \"elevated version\" of Grande's previous albums, calling it an embodiment of \"Sweetener meets  [...] Thank U, Next.\"\n\n**Recording and production**\n\nIn a video shared to her social media of her previewing some songs of the album to Republic Records personnel, Grande revealed that after the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike forced the filming of Wicked to be paused temporarily, she \"came [to the studio]\" and begun work on the record that September. She further revealed that she worked with Max Martin for a few weeks, and handled production on her own as well. \"Proper\" vocal recordings and orchestrations were arranged in November. Work on the album concluded in late December 2023.\n\n**Music and lyrics**\n\nEternal Sunshine is a pop and R&B album that features elements of dance music, especially synth-pop and house music. Helen Brown of The Independent described it as a \"slow-fizz pop\" album, consisting of mid-tempo synths, strings, and muted guitar. Jem Aswad of Variety felt that Martin and Salmanzadeh imbued the album with a \"very Swedish vibe and structure to the tracks\" inspired by classic pop, a style atypical of Anglo-American musicians. Lyrically, the album is a combination of both \"ultra-confident and entirely self-deprecating\" themes, inspired by Grande's personal relationships. Billboard described it as an introspective record—one in which Grande reflects on herself as she enters her thirties.\n\n**Songs**\n\nEternal Sunshine begins with the opening track, \"Intro (End of the World)\", which primarily includes strings and a morose guitar. The song begins with Grande posing the question, \"How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?\", describing her anxieties with her partner, and the possibility of its end. The second song, \"Bye\", was described by Grande as the hardest song on the album for her to write, saying \"It was hard for the reason that I desperately didn't want it to sound like a 'fuck you.' I wanted it to sound like, 'I need to leave, so bye'.\" It is an uptempo dance-pop number with influences of disco and Philadelphia soul.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the known kingdoms and empires that have existed on the African continent, from the earliest recorded periods to the present day.\n\n**Criteria**\n\nOnly kingdoms and tribal kingdoms as per Elman Service's classifications that were once independent are included, excluding bands, tribes, and most chiefdoms. Dates have been included for the loss of independence and the loss of nominal rule.\n\n**History periods and sources**\n\nOutside of North Africa, most of African political history relating to this time period has been pieced together through archaeological discoveries. There is very little written information about Sub-Saharan Africa at this time, besides that from outsiders such as \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\", dated to the 1st century AD, and the accounts of Claudius Ptolemy, dated to the 2nd century AD, both illuminating the East African coast. The delicate threads of oral tradition generally do not go back this far.\n\n**4th millennium BC – 6th century AD**\n\nDuring this period, the earliest known African kingdoms emerged in the Nile Valley and the Nubian region. The Kingdom of Kush, which flourished in present-day Sudan and southern Egypt from around 2000 BC, is one of the earliest known African empires. Other notable kingdoms from this period include the Kingdom of Shendi in present-day Ethiopia and the Kingdom of Dilmun in present-day Bahrain.\n\n**7th century – 15th century AD**\n\nDuring this period, many African kingdoms and empires rose to prominence, including the Kingdom of Axum in present-day Ethiopia, the Kingdom of Ghana in present-day Mali, and the Kingdom of Mali in present-day Mali. The Kingdom of Kanem-Bornu in present-day Chad and Nigeria was also a major power during this period.\n\n**16th century AD – present**\n\nThis period saw the rise of new African empires, including the Kingdom of Kongo in present-day Angola, the Kingdom of Luba in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Kingdom of Zulu in present-day South Africa. The Ottoman Empire also established control over much of North Africa during this period.\n\n**Comparison between kingdoms**\n\nHistorian Jan Vansina (1962) discusses the classification of Sub-Saharan African Kingdoms, mostly of Central, South and East Africa, with some additional data on West African (Sahelian) Kingdoms distinguishing five types, by decreasing centralization of power:\n\n1. **State**: The state is the most centralized form of government, characterized by a strong monarch and a well-defined bureaucracy.\n2. **Chiefdom**: The chiefdom is a more decentralized form of government, where power is held by a chief or council of elders.\n3. **Tribal kingdom**: The tribal kingdom is a more decentralized form of government, where power is held by a council of elders or a tribal council.\n4. **Segmentary state**: The segmentary state is a decentralized form of government, where power is held by a series of segmentary lines of authority.\n5. **Band**: The band is the least centralized form of government, where power is held by a leader or a council of elders, but with little authority to enforce decisions.\n\n**List of African kingdoms**\n\n### North Africa\n\n* **4th millennium BC – 6th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Kush (present-day Sudan and southern Egypt)\n\t+ Kingdom of Shendi (present-day Ethiopia)\n\t+ Kingdom of Dilmun (present-day Bahrain)\n* **7th century – 15th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Axum (present-day Ethiopia)\n\t+ Kingdom of Ghana (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Mali (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kanem-Bornu (present-day Chad and Nigeria)\n* **16th century AD – present**\n\t+ Ottoman Empire (present-day North Africa)\n\t+ Kingdom of Morocco (present-day Morocco)\n\t+ Kingdom of Tunisia (present-day Tunisia)\n\t+ Kingdom of Libya (present-day Libya)\n\n### East Africa\n\n* **4th millennium BC – 6th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of D'Inca (present-day Ethiopia)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kush (present-day Sudan and southern Egypt)\n* **7th century – 15th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Axum (present-day Ethiopia)\n\t+ Kingdom of Bunyoro (present-day Uganda)\n\t+ Kingdom of Buganda (present-day Uganda)\n* **16th century AD – present**\n\t+ Kingdom of Kongo (present-day Angola)\n\t+ Kingdom of Luba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\t+ Kingdom of Zulu (present-day South Africa)\n\n### West Africa\n\n* **4th millennium BC – 6th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Ghana (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Mali (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kanem-Bornu (present-day Chad and Nigeria)\n* **7th century – 15th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Ghana (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Mali (present-day Mali)\n\t+ Kingdom of Songhai (present-day Mali)\n* **16th century AD – present**\n\t+ Kingdom of Dahomey (present-day Benin)\n\t+ Kingdom of Ashanti (present-day Ghana)\n\t+ Kingdom of Oyo (present-day Nigeria)\n\n### Central Africa\n\n* **4th millennium BC – 6th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Kongo (present-day Angola)\n\t+ Kingdom of Luba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kuba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n* **7th century – 15th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Kanem-Bornu (present-day Chad and Nigeria)\n\t+ Kingdom of Luba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kuba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n* **16th century AD – present**\n\t+ Kingdom of Luba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\t+ Kingdom of Kuba (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\t+ Kingdom of Lunda (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\n### Southern Africa\n\n* **7th century – 15th century AD**\n\t+ Kingdom of Mapungubwe (present-day South Africa)\n\t+ Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe (present-day Zimbabwe)\n* **16th century AD – present**\n\t+ Kingdom of Zulu (present-day South Africa)\n\t+ Kingdom of Mthethwa (present-day South Africa)\n\t+ Kingdom of Ndwandwe (present-day South Africa)\n\n**Unplaced or undated kingdoms/sultanates**\n\n* **Kingdom of Nri** (present-day Nigeria)\n* **Kingdom of Benin** (present-day Benin)\n* **Kingdom of Kano** (present-day Nigeria)\n* **Kingdom of Katsina** (present-day Nigeria)\n* **Kingdom of Sokoto** (present-day Nigeria)\n* **Kingdom of Hausa** (present-day Nigeria)\n* **Kingdom of Yoruba** (present-day Nigeria)\n\n**See also**\n\n* African kingdoms\n* African empires\n* List of African monarchs\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Vansina, Jan (1962). **The Kingdom of Kongo: An Oral History of an African Kingdom**.

{"title": "Mariah_Carey", "content": "\nEarly life\nCarey was born on March 27, 1969, [a] in Huntington, New York [5] [6] Her name is derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon [7] [8] She is the youngest of three children born to Patricia (née Hickey), a former opera singer and vocal coach of Irish descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of both African-American and Afro-Venezuelan lineage The last name \"Carey\" was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York [9] [6] Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car [9] After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother [10] [11]\n\n\nCareer\nIn December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola [19] [20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album [19]\n\n\n1988–1990: Career beginnings and self-titled debut album\nIn December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola [19] [20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album [19]\n\n\n1991–1992: Emotions and MTV Unplugged\nCarey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, Emotions, during 1991 [29] [30] She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory [31] Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways [30] Emotions was released on September 17 that year Its title track served as the album's lead single and became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart's summit [32] Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality [33] While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor [34]\n\n\n1993–1994: Music Box and Merry Christmas\nAfter Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly Music Box was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's Butterfly [44] The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics Carey's songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery In his review of the album, AllMusic's Ron Wynn concluded: \"sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\" [45] In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour [46] Music Box's first and second singles, \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\", became Carey's seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number-one single in Germany, [47] Sweden [48] and the United Kingdom [49] Music Box remains Carey's best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies [50]\n\n\n1995–1996: Daydream and Someone's Ugly Daughter\nCarey's fifth studio album, Daydream, found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia [57] Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola's conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance [58] Daydream featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&B and hip hop [57] Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums and wrote it \"brings R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement .. Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\" [59] Its lead single, \"Fantasy\", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, [60] and the second song overall after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\" [61] \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with R&B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from Daydream and remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time [62] It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey's second track to do so [61] The album's third single, \"Always Be My Baby\", became Carey's eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time [62]\n\n\n1997–2000: New image with Butterfly and Rainbow\nCarey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with Daydream Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&B On Butterfly, she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters [72] Butterfly was released on September 10, 1997, [73] and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of breathy vocals [74] Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity, [75] while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess [76] [77] The music video for the album's lead single, \"Honey\", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image [78] Butterfly became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes In their review of the album, Rolling Stone wrote it was \"not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry .. but the predominant mood of Butterfly is one of coolly erotic reverie.\" [79] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and felt the album \"illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\" [80] \"Honey\" and \"My All\", the album's fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart's history Though a commercial success, Butterfly failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, Music Box and Daydream [81]\n\n\n2001–2004: Personal and professional setbacks, Glitter and Charmbracelet\nCarey received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium, [94] and parted from Columbia Records She signed an unprecedented $80 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001 [95] [96] Glitter was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983 Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project [95] She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended [97]\n\n\n2005–2007: Resurgence with The Emancipation of Mimi\nCarey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey's longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri She described the album as \"very much like a party record .. the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out .. I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that.\" [119] The Emancipation of Mimi topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since Butterfly (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban  [.. some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\" [120] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The  [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\" [121] The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\" [122] song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over [123]\n\n\n2008–2009: E=MC², Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, and Precious\nIn early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC² Although the album was well received by some critics, [142] [143] others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi [144] Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology [145] Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\" [146]\n\n\n2010–2014: Merry Christmas II You and Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse\nFollowing the cancellation of Angels Advocate, it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album [167] It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to Merry Christmas [53] The release date for the album, titled Merry Christmas II You, was November 2, 2010; [168] the track list included new songs as well as a remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" [169] Merry Christmas II You debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, and number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart [170] In February 2011, she recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his Duets II album, titled \"When Do The Bells Ring For Me?\", [171] and re-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, Under the Mistletoe [172] [173] In November that year, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single \"Warning\" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy [174] Later that month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled \"When Christmas Comes\", originally part of Merry Christmas II You [175]\n\n\n2015–2017: #1 to Infinity residency, television and film projects\nOn January 30, 2015, it was announced that Carey had left Universal Music Group's Def Jam Recordings to reunite with L.A Reid and Sony Music via Epic Records [196] [197] [198] Carey also announced her new #1 to Infinity residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas the same month [199] To coincide with the residency, Carey released #1 to Infinity, a greatest hits compilation album containing all of her eighteen Billboard Hot 100 number one

Christmas Melody, in which she also performed as one of the main characters [201] In December 2015, Carey announced The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour which spanned a total of 27-dates beginning in March

reissue\nIn July 2018, Carey embarked on a new Las Vegas residency, The Butterfly Returns, which received critical acclaim [222] [223] Its first 12 shows in 2018 grossed $3.6 million, with dates later

the first time at the American Music Awards of 2018 [231] It became Carey's highest-charting non-holiday song on the US Adult Contemporary chart since \"We Belong Together\" in 2005 This was followed by a second single, \"A No No\" [232] The album, titled Caution, was released on November 16, 2018, and received universal acclaim from critics Though it debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, it became her lowest-selling album to date and ultimately was her final release with Epic Records; she quietly left the label sometime in 2019 [233] By December 2018, the album had been featured on numerous year-end lists by music critics and publications [234]\n\n\n2020–2023: The Rarities and The Meaning of Mariah Carey\nIn January 2020, it was announced that Carey would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame [240] Carey celebrated the 30th anniversary of her debut album through 2020, in a promotional campaign billed \"#MC30\" [241] The first release consisted of the live EP The

unreleased songs that Carey recorded at various stages of her career [244] Its songs included \"Save the Day\" featuring Lauryn Hill [245] and a cover of Irene Cara's \"Out Here on My Own\" [246] At

that new music was being worked on [273] On November 6, 2024, Carey will embark on the \"Mariah Carey's Christmas Time\" tour, set to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Merry Christmas It shall conclude the following December 17 [274]\n\n\nArtistry\nCarey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&B and soul musicians including Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin, and George Michael Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits the Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar, and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years [275] [276] When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told Newsweek, \"People just don't understand I grew up with this music.\" [277] She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as the Sugarhill Gang, Eric B & Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" (1998) Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range [278]\n\n\nInfluences\nCarey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan as well as R&B and soul musicians

whistle register due to her original practice of the range [278]\n\n\nMusical style\nLove is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as loss, sex, race, abuse and spirituality [282] [283] Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies \"the purging of private emotions\" as the main theme of Carey's ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an \"all-purpose feeling\" with mass appeal [284] Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material [285] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\" [286] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\" [287] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote that \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless  [Diane] Warren ballads.\" [288]\n\n\nVoice and timbre\nCarey possesses a five-octave vocal range [303] [304] [305] Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano [306] [307] Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes.\" [308] She once described herself as an alto singer [309] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre on \"Vision of Love\" possesses various colors, stating, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.\" [52] Chan believes that Carey moved through several \"vocal personas\" throughout her discography, like the \"stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and \nhead voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that \npredominated after the turn of the millennium\" [310] In an analysis of Carey's voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey's chest voice could go up \"higher in pitch\" compared to classical singer.\" [311]\n\n\nStage performances and videos\nDespite being called a \"show stopper\" and \"the 1990s pop phenomenon\", [319] Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry [320] One of her earliest performances was at MTV Unplugged, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made [321] [322] Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations [296] Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by Billboard [323] She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\" [324] The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\" [325] Although Carey's performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017 was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to Time, \"effectively redeemed herself\" [326]\n\n\nCultural status\nThroughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon, [341] [342] [343] a gay icon, [344] and a fashion icon [345] She has been labeled a \"diva\" for her stardom and persona [346] Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans [347] [348] Author Lily E Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media's association of the term with her is influenced by gender [349] Carey's style has often been described as \"eccentric\" and \"over the top\" [350] [351] Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the \"Queen of Shade\" title from Elle [352] Carey's reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the originator for various memes including \"I don't know her\" [353]\n\n\nAchievements\nThroughout her career, Carey has earned numerous awards and honors She has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award), [374] nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards, [375] and twenty Billboard Music Awards [376] Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold [377] She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, [240] according to whom she is \"the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history\", [378] and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame [379] Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015, [380] and a Billboard Icon Award in 2019 [381] In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom [382]\n\n\nOther activities\nDeclining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores [383] During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\" [384] She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M\" [385] The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million [386] For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women's Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories [387] She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009) [388] [389] On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances [390] In November 2011, Carey was announced as \"brand ambassador\" for Jenny Craig, Inc which included \"participation in a new company initiative.. public service announcements and community and education programs.\" [391] In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the

grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he emigrated to New York [9] [6] Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man Racial tensions prevented the Carey family from integrating into their community While they lived in Huntington, their neighbors poisoned the family dog and set fire to their car [9] After her parents' divorce, Carey had little contact with Alfred, and Patricia worked several jobs to support the family Carey spent much of her time at home alone and began singing at age three, often imitating her mother's take on Verdi's opera Rigoletto in Italian Her older sister Alison moved in with their father while Mariah and her elder brother Morgan lived with their mother [10] [11]\n\n\nCareer\nIn December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola [19] [20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album [19]\n\n\n1988–1990: Career beginnings and self-titled debut album\nIn December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a music executive's party and handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola [19] [20] After listening to the tape during the ride home, he immediately requested the driver turn around She had already left the event, and Mottola spent two weeks looking for her Another record label expressed interest and a bidding war ensued He signed Carey to Columbia and enlisted producers Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden, and Rhett Lawrence for her first album [19]\n\n\n1991–1992: Emotions and MTV Unplugged\nCarey co-wrote, co-produced, and recorded her second studio effort, Emotions, during 1991 [29] [30] She described it as a homage to Motown soul music and employed the help of Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory [31] Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a songwriting royalties dispute After he filed a lawsuit against Columbia's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, the songwriting duo parted ways [30] Emotions was released on September 17 that year Its title track served as the album's lead single and became Carey's fifth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100, making her the first artist whose first five singles reached the chart's summit [32] Though critics praised the album's content and described it as a more mature effort, the album was criticized as calculated and lacking originality [33] While the album managed sales of eight million copies globally, Emotions failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor [34]\n\n\n1993–1994: Music Box and Merry Christmas\nAfter Emotions failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey's subsequent release was to be marketed as adult contemporary and pop-friendly Music Box was produced by Carey and Afanasieff, and it began a songwriting partnership that would extend until 1997's Butterfly [44] The album was released on August 31, 1993, to mixed reviews from music critics Carey's songwriting was derided as clichéd and her vocal performances were described as less emotive and lazier in their delivery In his review of the album, AllMusic's Ron Wynn concluded: \"sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\" [45] In promotion of the album, Carey embarked on her debut tour, a six-date concert series, the Music Box Tour [46] Music Box's first and second singles, \"Dreamlover\" and \"Hero\", became Carey's seventh and eighth chart-toppers in the United States, while her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number-one single in Germany, [47] Sweden [48] and the United Kingdom [49] Music Box remains Carey's best-seller and one of the best-selling albums, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies [50]\n\n\n1995–1996: Daydream and Someone's Ugly Daughter\nCarey's fifth studio album, Daydream, found her consolidating creative control over her career, leading to tensions with Columbia [57] Songs from her prior two albums had been primarily shaped by Mottola's conceptualization of what Carey should sound like, as innocent and wholesome tracks dominated by her vocal performance [58] Daydream featured a departure from her allegiance to pop and gravitated heavily towards R&B and hip hop [57] Critically, the album was described as Carey's best to date The New York Times named it one of 1995's best albums and wrote it \"brings R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement .. Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\" [59] Its lead single, \"Fantasy\", became the first single by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, [60] and the second song overall after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\" [61] \"One Sweet Day\", a collaboration with R&B group Boyz II Men, served as the second single from Daydream and remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a record-breaking 16 consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number-one song in the history of the charts at the time [62] It also opened at the top spot, becoming Carey's second track to do so [61] The album's third single, \"Always Be My Baby\", became Carey's eleventh chart-topper, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for the most number-one singles among female artists at the time [62]\n\n\n1997–2000: New image with Butterfly and Rainbow\nCarey's subsequent musical releases followed the trend that began with Daydream Her music began relying less on pop and adult contemporary-tinged balladry and instead incorporating heavy elements of hip hop and R&B On Butterfly, she collaborated with a bevy of producers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters [72] Butterfly was released on September 10, 1997, [73] and introduced a more subdued style of singing, with critics noting Carey's incorporation of breathy vocals [74] Some viewed her lack of propensity to use her upper range as a sign of maturity, [75] while others questioned whether it forebode waning vocal prowess [76] [77] The music video for the album's lead single, \"Honey\", her first since separating from Mottola, introduced a more overtly sexual image [78] Butterfly became Carey's best-reviewed album, with attention placed on the album's exploration of more mature lyrical themes In their review of the album, Rolling Stone wrote it was \"not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry .. but the predominant mood of Butterfly is one of coolly erotic reverie.\" [79] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and felt the album \"illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\" [80] \"Honey\" and \"My All\", the album's fifth single, both topped the Hot 100, making Carey a female artist with the most number-one singles in the chart's history Though a commercial success, Butterfly failed to reach the commercial heights of her previous albums, Music Box and Daydream [81]\n\n\n2001–2004: Personal and professional setbacks, Glitter and Charmbracelet\nCarey received Billboard's Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Pop Female Artist of the Millennium, [94] and parted from Columbia Records She signed an unprecedented $80 million five-album recording contract with Virgin Records (EMI Records) in April 2001 [95] [96] Glitter was a musical departure, recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983 Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project [95] She said that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives Carey's three-year relationship with Latin singer Luis Miguel ended [97]\n\n\n2005–2007: Resurgence with The Emancipation of Mimi\nCarey's tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005, was produced with the Neptunes, Kanye West and Carey's longtime collaborator, Jermaine Dupri She described the album as \"very much like a party record .. the process of putting on makeup and getting ready to go out .. I wanted to make a record that was reflective of that.\" [119] The Emancipation of Mimi topped the charts in the United States, becoming her fifth number-one album and first since Butterfly (1997), and was warmly accepted by critics Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian defined it as \"cool, focused and urban  [.. some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\" [120] while USA Today's Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The  [songs] truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\" [121] The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\" [122] song for Carey, after a relatively unsuccessful period and a point when many critics had considered her career over [123]\n\n\n2008–2009: E=MC², Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, and Precious\nIn early 2007, Carey began to work on her eleventh studio album, E=MC² Although the album was well received by some critics, [142] [143] others criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on The Emancipation of Mimi [144] Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology [145] Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the Billboard chart history.\" [146]\n\n\n2010–2014: Merry Christmas II You and Me.

race, abuse and spirituality [282] [283] Andrew Chan of the University of Texas Press identifies \"the purging of private emotions\" as the main theme of Carey's ballads, though he believes several others aim to have an \"all-purpose feeling\" with mass appeal [284] Carey has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but Time magazine's Christopher John Farley wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material [285] Jim Faber of the New York Daily News, made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\" [286] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\" [287] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote that \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless  [Diane] Warren ballads.\" [288]\n\n\nVoice and timbre\nCarey possesses a five-octave vocal range [303] [304] [305] Regarding her type of voice, several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano [306] [307] Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes.\" [308] She once described herself as an alto singer [309] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre on \"Vision of Love\" possesses various colors, stating, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo.\" [52] Chan believes that Carey moved through several \"vocal personas\" throughout her discography, like the \"stentorian, full-throated belting of her first few albums; the fluid mix of chest and \nhead voice deployed to masterful effect in the mid-1990s; and the delicate, foggy tones and manic cadences that \npredominated after the turn of the millennium\" [310] In an analysis of Carey's voice for ClassicFM, singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey's chest voice could go up \"higher in pitch\" compared to classical singer.\" [311]\n\n\nStage performances and videos\nDespite being called a \"show stopper\" and \"the 1990s pop phenomenon\", [319] Carey suffered from stage fright in her early years in the music industry [320] One of her earliest performances was at MTV Unplugged, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made [321] [322] Chan identifies the Milli Vanilli lip syncing controversy as a potential contributor to the initial accusations [296] Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by Billboard [323] She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\" [324] The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\" [325] Although Carey's performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017 was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to Time, \"effectively redeemed herself\" [326]\n\n\nCultural status\nThroughout her career, Carey has been called a pop icon, [341] [342] [343] a gay icon, [344] and a fashion icon [345] She has been labeled a \"diva\" for her stardom and persona [346] Her diva persona has received heavy attention, gaining admiration from her fans [347] [348] Author Lily E Hirsch argues that while Carey has displayed diva behavior during several incidents in her career, the media's association of the term with her is influenced by gender [349] Carey's style has often been described as \"eccentric\" and \"over the top\" [350] [351] Throughout her career, she has also been used in several social media memes, gaining the \"Queen of Shade\" title from Elle [352] Carey's reactions in various interviews have often gone viral, becoming the originator for various memes including \"I don't know her\" [353]\n\n\nAchievements\nThroughout her career, Carey has earned numerous awards and honors She has won six Grammy Awards (including a Grammy Global Impact Award), [374] nineteen World Music Awards, ten American Music Awards, [375] and twenty Billboard Music Awards [376] Carey is one of the best-selling recording artists in history, with more than 220 million records sold [377] She is also an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, [240] according to whom she is \"the all-time most successful female songwriter in chart history\", [378] and The Long Island Music and Entertainment Hall of Fame [379] Carey was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2015, [380] and a Billboard Icon Award in 2019 [381] In 2023, she became one of the first 13 recipients of the BRIT Billion Award, for surpassing the milestone one billion streams in the United Kingdom [382]\n\n\nOther

endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores [383] During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\" [384] She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M\" [385] The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million [386] For the fragrance, Carey won a Basenotes Fragrance Award for Best Celebrity Women's Fragrance as well as being nominated in three other categories [387] She has released a series of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden, including Luscious Pink (2008) and Forever (2009) [388] [389] On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances [390] In November 2011, Carey was announced as \"brand ambassador\" for Jenny Craig, Inc which included \"participation in a new company initiative.. public service announcements and community and education programs.\" [391] In 2018, Carey featured in an advertisement for Hostelworld with the

relationships with God I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray.. I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances It's by the grace of God I'm still here.\" [423]\n\n\nDiscography\n Headlining tours \n\n\nFilmography\n Headlining tours \n\n\nTours and residencies\n Headlining tours \n\n\nWritten works\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nPrint sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "John_Wayne_Gacy", "content": "\nEarly life\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, [1] on March 17, 1942, the second of three children and only son of John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison [2] [3] His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker [4] [5] Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic [6] [7]\n\n\nChildhood\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, [1] on March 17, 1942, the second of three children and only son of John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison [2] [3] His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker [4] [5] Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic [6] [7]\n\n\nCareer origins\nIn 1960, at age 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant precinct captain for a local Democratic Party candidate This led to more criticism from his father, who called him a \"patsy\" [19] The same year, Gacy's father bought him a car He kept the vehicle's title in his own name until Gacy had paid for it, which took several years His father would confiscate the keys if Gacy did not do as he said In April 1962, Gacy purchased an extra set of keys; in response, his father removed the distributor cap, keeping the component for three days [12] Hours after his father replaced the cap, Gacy left home and drove to Las Vegas, Nevada, with $136 to his name in the hope of residing with a cousin [20]\n\n\nWaterloo, Iowa\nGacy and Myers married in September 1964 [13] Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa The couple moved there so Gacy could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' former home [8] [16] The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of about $153,000 as of 2024 [update]), plus a share of the restaurant's profits [12] Gacy opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes, he socialized only with the males Gacy gave many of them alcohol before he made sexual advances; if they rebuffed him, he would claim his advances were jokes or a test of morals [8]\n\n\nKFC

teenagers of both sexes, he socialized only with the males Gacy gave many of them alcohol before he made sexual advances; if they rebuffed him, he would claim his advances were jokes or a test of morals [8]\n\n\nWaterloo Jaycees\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local Jaycees chapter, [26] regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the twelve- and fourteen-hour days he worked managing the restaurants At meetings, Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" [12] He and other Waterloo Jaycees were also deeply involved in drug abuse, pornography, prostitution and wife swapping [8] [24] Although Gacy was considered ambitious and a braggart, the Jaycees held him in high regard for his fundraising work: in 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees [16] and served on the board of directors [27]\n\n\nAssault of Donald Voorhees\nIn August 1967, Gacy sexually assaulted 15-year-old Donald Voorhees Jr., the son of Donald Edwin Voorhees, a local politician and fellow Jaycee Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him heterosexual stag films regularly played at Jaycee events Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol, allowed him to watch a stag movie, then persuaded him to engage in mutual oral sex, adding, \"You have to have sex with a man before you start having sex with women.\" [28] Over the following months Gacy abused several other youths, including one whom he encouraged to have sex with his own wife before blackmailing him into performing oral sex on him Gacy also tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned to conduct homosexual experiments for scientific research, and paid them up to $50 each [8]\n\n\nConviction and imprisonment\nOn November 7, 1968, Gacy pleaded guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths He claimed Voorhees had offered himself to him and that he had acted out of curiosity His story was not believed Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3 and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to be served at the Anamosa State Penitentiary [8] [34] [35] That same day, Gacy's wife petitioned for divorce, requesting she be awarded the couple's home and property, sole custody of their two children, and alimony [36] [37] The court ruled in her favor, and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969 Gacy never saw his first wife or children again [8]\n\n\nReturn to Chicago\nGacy was granted parole with twelve months' probation on June 18, 1970, having served eighteen months of his ten-year sentence [41] [42] Conditions of his probation included a nightly curfew and that Gacy relocate to Chicago to live with his mother [8] [36] On his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane—who picked him up from the prison and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence—that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo However, within twenty-four hours, Gacy had relocated to Chicago [8] He arrived there by bus on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a short-order cook [42]\n\n\n8213 West Summerdale Avenue\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a ranch-style house at 8213 West Summerdale Avenue in unincorporated Norwood Park Township, Illinois, part of metropolitan Chicago [46] He lived there until his arrest in December 1978 and, according to Gacy, committed all his murders there [47]\n\n\nSecond marriage and divorce\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school [8] Carole and her two young daughters from a previous marriage moved into the house soon after [42] They were married on July 1, 1972 [8] Gacy's mother moved out of the house shortly before the wedding [8]\n\n\nPDM Contractors\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (for \"Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance\") [42] With the approval of his probation officer, Gacy worked evenings on his construction contracts while working as a cook during the day Initially, he undertook minor repair work, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, remodeling, and landscaping In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook so he could commit fully to his construction business [43]\n\n\nClown\nThrough his membership in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a \"Jolly Joker\" clown club, whose members regularly performed at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children [53] In late 1975, Gacy joined the clown club and created his own characters \"Pogo the Clown\" and \"Patches the Clown\", devising his own makeup and costumes He described Pogo as a \"happy clown\", whereas Patches was a \"more serious\" character [59]\n\n\nEmployees\nMuch of PDM's workforce consisted of high school students and young men [61] Gacy would often proposition his workers for sex, or insist on sexual favors in return for lending his vehicles, financial assistance or promotions [51] [62] Gacy also claimed to own guns, once telling an employee, \"Do you know how easy it would be to get one of my guns and kill you—and how easy it would be to get rid of the body?\" [63]\n\n\nPolitics\nGacy entered local Democratic Party politics, initially offering use of his employees to clean party headquarters at no charge He was rewarded with an invitation to serve on the Norwood Park Township street lighting committee, subsequently earning the title of precinct captain [42] [45] [56]\n\n\nMurders\nGacy murdered at least thirty-three young men and boys, twenty-six of whom he buried in the crawl space of his house His victims included people he knew and random individuals lured from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, Bughouse Square, or off the streets with the promise of a job with PDM, an offer of drink and/or drugs, or money for sex Some victims were grabbed by force; others were conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff's badge and had spotlights on his black Oldsmobile) was a policeman [47] Gacy usually lured a lone victim to his house, although on more than one occasion Gacy had what he called \"doubles\"—two killed in the same evening [70] [71]\n\n\nMurder of Timothy McCoy\nGacy's first known murder occurred on January 3, 1972 According to Gacy's later account, following a family party the previous evening, he drove to the Civic Center in the Loop in the early morning to view a display of ice sculptures [84] He then lured 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound Bus Terminal into his car McCoy was on his way to his father's home in Omaha, Nebraska, and informed Gacy his bus was not due until noon [85] [86] Gacy took McCoy on a sightseeing tour of Chicago and then drove him to his home with the promise that he could spend the remainder of the night and be driven back to the station in time to catch his bus [87] [k] Prior to McCoy's identification, he was known as the \"Greyhound Bus Boy\" [89]\n\n\nSecond murder\nGacy said he committed murder for the second time around January 1974 [92] [m] This victim remains unidentified; he was strangled and placed in Gacy's closet before burial [94] [95] Gacy later stated that bodily fluids leaked from the victim's mouth and nose, staining his carpet Gacy regularly stuffed rags, the victim's own underwear, or a sock into the mouths of subsequent victims to prevent such a leakage [96]\n\n\nMurder of John Butkovich\nOn July 31, 1975, John Butkovich, an 18-year-old PDM employee, disappeared [97] Butkovich's car was later found abandoned with his jacket and wallet inside and the keys in the ignition [98]\n\n\nCruising years\nIn addition to being the year his business expanded, Gacy freely admitted that 1975 was also when he began to increase the frequency of his excursions for sex with young males [43] He often referred to these jaunts as \"cruising\" [49] Gacy committed most of his murders between 1976 and 1978, as he largely lived alone following his divorce.\n\n\n1976\nOne month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered 18-year-old Darrell Samson He was last seen alive in Chicago on April 6, 1976 [49] Gacy buried him under the dining room, with cloth lodged in his throat [101] On May 14, 15-year-old Randall Reffett disappeared shortly after returning home from a dental appointment [102] Hours after Reffett was last seen by his family, 14-year-old Samuel Stapleton vanished as he walked home from his sister's apartment [54] [103] He and Reffett were close acquaintances; [104] they were buried together in the crawl space, and investigators believe the two were murdered the same evening [105]\n\n\n1977\nOn January 20, 1977, Gacy lured 19-year-old John Szyc to his house on the pretext of buying his Plymouth Satellite [122] He later confessed to strangling Szyc in his spare bedroom, claiming Rossi was asleep in the house the following morning Gacy later sold the car to Rossi for $300 [57]\n\n\n1978\nDonnelly reported the assault, and police questioned Gacy on January 6, 1978 Gacy admitted to having had a \"slave-sex\" relationship with Donnelly, but insisted everything was consensual, adding that he \"didn't pay the kid\" the money he had promised him [131] The police believed him and filed no charges [69] The following month, Gacy killed 19-year-old William Kindred, who disappeared on February 16 after telling his fiancée, who knew Gacy, [132] that he was going to a bar [69] Kindred was the final victim buried in the crawl space [56] [59]\n\n\nMurder of Robert Piest\nOn the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in Des Plaines, to discuss a potential remodeling deal with the store owner, Phil Torf [137] While he was within earshot of 15-year-old part-time employee Robert Piest, Gacy mentioned his firm often hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour—almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy [138]\n\n\nInvestigation\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report with the Des Plaines police Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk to Lieutenant Joseph Kozenczak, whose son attended Maine West High School like Piest, chose to investigate Gacy further [142] A check of Gacy's criminal background revealed that he had an outstanding battery charge in Chicago and had been imprisoned in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy [143]\n\n\nFirst search warrant\nSuspecting Gacy might be holding Piest at his home, Des Plaines police obtained a search warrant on December 13 [144] This search revealed several suspicious items, including several police badges; a starting pistol; a syringe and hypodermic needle; handcuffs; books about homosexuality and pederasty; [145] [146] [147] pornographic and stag films; capsules of amyl nitrite; a dildo; [148] a two-by-four with two holes drilled into each end; bottles of Valium and atropine; several driver's licenses; a blue hooded parka; [144] and underwear too small to fit Gacy [147] They also found a class ring engraved with the initials J.A.S [149] and a Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt in a trash can, alongside a 36-inch (91 cm) section of nylon rope [71]\n\n\nSurveillance\nThe Des Plaines police confiscated Gacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles Surveillance teams (consisting of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz) monitored Gacy as the investigation continued [150] [151] The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river earlier that year [122] [152]\n\n\nSecond search warrant\nThe same evening, Rossi was interviewed a second time This time he was more cooperative He informed detectives that in the summer of 1977, at Gacy's behest, he had spread ten bags of lime in the crawl space of Gacy's house [160]\n\n\nConfession\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in Park Ridge to attend a scheduled meeting, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit Gacy appeared anxious and disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of Seagrams whiskey, [163] and Gacy immediately drank two cupfuls Amirante—by this stage dubious of Gacy's claims of innocence—then asked what he had to discuss with them, placing a copy of the Daily Herald on his desk and stating: \"You said you had something new to tell me! Something important!\" Gacy picked up the newspaper, pointed to the front-page article covering the disappearance of Piest and said, \"This boy is dead He's dead He's in a river.\" [164]\n\n\nArrest\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\" [47] In the early morning hours of December 22, and in the presence of his lawyers, Gacy provided a formal statement in which he confessed to murdering approximately thirty young males—all of whom he claimed had entered his house willingly [47] Some victims were referred to by name, but Gacy claimed not to know or remember most of the names [171] He claimed all were teenage male runaways or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space [47] Gacy claimed to have dug only five of the graves in this location and had his employees (including Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\" [141] When shown a driver's license issued to a Robert Hasten which had been found on his property, Gacy claimed not to know this individual but admitted that this license had been in the possession of one of his victims [172] He also confessed to having planned to further conceal the bodies beneath his property by covering the entire crawl space with concrete in January 1979 [56]\n\n\nTrial\nGacy was brought to trial on February 6, 1980, charged with 33 murders [176] He was tried in Cook County, Illinois, before Judge Louis Garippo; the jury was selected from Rockford because of extensive press coverage in Cook County [177]\n\n\nClosing arguments\nOn March 11, final arguments by both prosecution and defense attorneys began Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan outlined Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing his surviving victims—Voorhees and Donnelly—as \"living dead\" Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\", Sullivan stated, \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes.. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\" [106] [172]\n\n\nDeath row\nOn being sentenced, Gacy was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained on death row for 14 years [198] Isolated in his prison cell, Gacy began to paint He drew inspiration from a wide range of sources for his artwork, depicting subjects as diverse as clowns (including himself as Pogo or Patches), Christ, skulls, his own home, and John Dillinger [199] [200] Gacy's paintings have been displayed at exhibitions [201] [202] and sold at auction [203]\n\n\nExecution\nOn the morning of May 9, 1994, Gacy was transferred to Stateville Correctional Center to be executed That afternoon, he was allowed a private picnic on the prison grounds with his family For his last meal, Gacy ordered a bucket of KFC, french fries, a dozen fried shrimp, fresh strawberries and a Diet Coke [211] [212] That evening, he received the last rites from a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber [213] [214] [215]\nIn the hours leading up to Gacy's execution, a crowd estimated at over 1,000 gathered outside the correctional center; a vocal majority were in favor of the execution, although a small number of anti-death penalty protesters were present [203] [216] [217] Some of those in favor of the execution wore T-shirts hearkening to Gacy's previous community services as a clown and bearing satirical slogans such as \"No tears for the clown\" [218]\n\n\nAmber Alert\nIn 1984, Sam Amirante authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 At the time of the Gacy murders, Illinois police had to wait 72 hours before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent; [227] the Missing Child Recovery Act removed this waiting period Other states subsequently adopted similar procedures As a result, a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed This has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known as an Amber Alert [227]\n\n\nVictims\nOnly 28 of Gacy's victims have been conclusively identified The youngest were Samuel Stapleton and Michael Marino, both 14; the eldest were Francis Alexander and Russell Nelson, both 21.\n\n\nCrawl space\nCook County medical examiner Robert Stein supervised the exhumations of the victims buried on Gacy's property [228] The crawl space was marked in sections and each body was given an identifying number The first body recovered from the crawl space was assigned a marker denoting the victim as Body 1 [116] He was identified as Jon Prestidge on January 6, 1979 [125] No cause of death could be determined.\n\n\nDes Plaines River\nThe victim found 6 miles (9.7 km) downstream from the I-55 bridge on June 30 was not connected initially to Gacy [103] [252] On January 9, 1979, this victim was identified using fingerprint records and a distinctive tattoo as Timothy O'Rourke An autopsy was unable to rule out strangulation as the cause of death [56] [253] This victim was numbered 31 Following Gacy's arrest, investigators discovered he was a further victim.\n\n\nUnidentified victims\nFive victims have never been identified [256] Based on Gacy's confession, the location of the victims buried in the crawl space, and forensic analysis, police determined the most likely dates for when his unidentified victims were killed [257]\n\n\nRecent identification efforts\nIn October 2011, Cook County sheriff Thomas Dart announced that investigators, having obtained DNA profiles from the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify them At a press conference Sheriff Dart stated investigators were seeking DNA samples from across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979 [266]\n\n\nPossible additional victims\nAt the time of Gacy's arrest, he had claimed to investigators that the total number of murder victims could be as high as 45 [75] However, only 33 victims were ever linked to Gacy Investigators excavated the grounds of his property until they had exposed the substratum of clay beneath the foundations, finding 29 bodies [277]\n\n\nPotential accomplices\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had been arrested When questioned whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly\" He later claimed Cram and Rossi were involved in several of the murders [47] Some defense attorneys and investigators researching the possibility Gacy had not acted alone in several of the murders have said there is \"overwhelming evidence Gacy worked with an accomplice\" [296]\n\n\nFilms and media\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited works\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**John Wayne Gacy**\n\n**Introduction**\nJohn Wayne Gacy was an American serial killer and sex offender who committed a series of heinous crimes in the 1970s. Born on March 17, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, Gacy was known as a charismatic and affable individual who held various positions in his community, including as a clown and a politician. However, beneath his seemingly innocent exterior, Gacy led a dark and sinister life, committing a series of murders that would shock the nation.\n\n**Early Life**\nGacy was born at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, the second of three children and only son of John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robison. His father was an auto repair machinist and World War I veteran, and his mother was a homemaker. Gacy was of Polish and Danish ancestry, and his family was Catholic. He was a bright child and began working as a paperboy at the age of six.\n\n**Childhood**\nGacy's childhood was marked by a close relationship with his mother and a strained relationship with his father. His father was often critical and demanding, which led to a deep-seated need for approval and validation in Gacy. This dynamic would later contribute to his troubled adult life.\n\n**Career Origins**\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant precinct captain for a local Democratic Party candidate. This led to more criticism from his father, who called him a \"patsy.\" The same year, Gacy's father bought him a car, but kept the title in his own name until Gacy had paid for it, which took several years.\n\n**Waterloo, Iowa**\nGacy and Myers married in September 1964, and Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurants in Waterloo, Iowa.

meetings, Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" [12] He and other Waterloo Jaycees were also deeply involved in drug abuse, pornography, prostitution and wife swapping [8] [24] Although Gacy was considered ambitious and a braggart, the Jaycees held him in high regard for his fundraising work: in 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees [16] and served on the board of directors [27]\n\n\nAssault of Donald Voorhees\nIn August 1967, Gacy sexually assaulted 15-year-old Donald Voorhees Jr., the son of Donald Edwin Voorhees, a local politician and fellow Jaycee Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him heterosexual stag films regularly played at Jaycee events Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol, allowed him to watch a stag movie, then persuaded him to engage in mutual oral sex, adding, \"You have to have sex with a man before you start having sex with women.\" [28] Over the following months Gacy abused several other youths, including one whom he encouraged to have sex with his own wife before blackmailing him into performing oral sex on him Gacy also tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned to conduct homosexual experiments for scientific research, and paid them up to $50 each [8]\n\n\nConviction and imprisonment\nOn November 7, 1968, Gacy pleaded guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths He claimed Voorhees had offered himself to him and that he had acted out of curiosity His story was not believed Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3 and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, to be served at the Anamosa State Penitentiary [8] [34] [35] That same day, Gacy's wife petitioned for

ten-year sentence [41] [42] Conditions of his probation included a nightly curfew and that Gacy relocate to Chicago to live with his mother [8] [36] On his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane—who picked him up from the prison and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence—that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo However, within twenty-four hours, Gacy had relocated to Chicago [8] He arrived there by bus on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a short-order cook [42]\n\n\n8213 West

to his construction business [43]\n\n\nClown\nThrough his membership in a local Moose Club, Gacy became aware of a \"Jolly Joker\" clown club, whose members regularly performed at fundraising events and parades in addition to voluntarily entertaining hospitalized children [53] In late 1975, Gacy joined the clown club and created his own characters \"Pogo the Clown\" and \"Patches the Clown\", devising his own makeup and costumes He described Pogo as a \"happy clown\", whereas Patches was a \"more serious\" character [59]\n\n\nEmployees\nMuch of PDM's workforce consisted of high school students and young men [61] Gacy would often proposition his workers for sex, or insist on sexual favors in return for lending his vehicles, financial assistance or promotions [51] [62] Gacy also claimed to own guns, once telling an employee, \"Do you know how easy it would be to get one of my guns and kill you—and how easy it would be to get rid of the body?\" [63]\n\n\nPolitics\nGacy entered

space of his house His victims included people he knew and random individuals lured from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, Bughouse Square, or off the streets with the promise of a job with PDM, an offer of drink and/or drugs, or money for sex Some victims were grabbed by force; others were conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff's badge and had spotlights on his black Oldsmobile) was a policeman [47] Gacy usually lured a lone victim to his house, although on more than one occasion Gacy had what he called \"doubles\"—two killed in the same evening [70] [71]\n\n\nMurder of Timothy McCoy\nGacy's first known murder occurred on January 3, 1972 According to Gacy's later account, following a family party the previous evening, he drove to the Civic Center in the Loop in the early morning to view a display of ice sculptures [84] He then lured 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound Bus Terminal into his car McCoy was on his way to his father's home in Omaha, Nebraska, and informed Gacy his bus was not due until noon [85] [86] Gacy took McCoy on a sightseeing tour of Chicago and then drove him to his home with the promise that he could spend the remainder of the night and be driven back to the station in time to catch his bus [87] [k] Prior to McCoy's identification, he was known as the \"Greyhound Bus Boy\" [89]\n\n\nSecond murder\nGacy said he committed murder for the second time around January 1974 [92] [m] This victim remains unidentified; he was strangled and placed in Gacy's closet before burial [94] [95] Gacy later

frequency of his excursions for sex with young males [43] He often referred to these jaunts as \"cruising\" [49] Gacy committed most of his murders between 1976 and 1978, as he largely lived alone following his divorce.\n\n\n1976\nOne month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered 18-year-old Darrell Samson He was last seen alive in Chicago on April 6, 1976 [49] Gacy buried

last seen by his family, 14-year-old Samuel Stapleton vanished as he walked home from his sister's apartment [54] [103] He and Reffett were close acquaintances; [104] they were buried together in the crawl space, and investigators believe the two were murdered the same evening [105]\n\n\n1977\nOn January 20, 1977, Gacy lured 19-year-old John Szyc to his house on the pretext of buying his Plymouth Satellite [122] He later confessed to strangling Szyc in his spare bedroom, claiming Rossi was asleep in the house the following morning Gacy later sold the car to Rossi for $300

I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\" [106] [172]\n\n\nDeath row\nOn being sentenced, Gacy was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained on death row for 14 years [198] Isolated in his prison cell, Gacy began to paint He drew inspiration from a wide range of sources for his artwork, depicting subjects as diverse as clowns (including himself as Pogo or Patches), Christ, skulls, his own home, and John Dillinger [199] [200] Gacy's paintings have been displayed at exhibitions [201] [202] and sold at auction [203]\n\n\nExecution\nOn the morning of May 9, 1994, Gacy was transferred to Stateville Correctional Center to be executed That afternoon, he was allowed a private picnic on the prison grounds with his family For his last meal, Gacy ordered a bucket of KFC, french fries, a dozen fried shrimp, fresh strawberries and a Diet Coke [211] [212] That evening, he received the last rites from a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber [213] [214] [215]\nIn the hours leading up to Gacy's execution, a crowd estimated at over 1,000 gathered outside the correctional center; a vocal majority were in favor of the execution, although a small number of anti-death penalty protesters were present [203] [216] [217] Some of those in favor of the execution wore T-shirts hearkening to Gacy's previous community services as a clown and bearing satirical slogans such as \"No tears for the clown\" [218]\n\n\nAmber Alert\nIn 1984, Sam Amirante authored procedures that were incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly into the Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 At the time of the Gacy murders, Illinois police had to wait 72 hours before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent; [227] the Missing Child Recovery Act removed this waiting period Other states subsequently adopted similar procedures As a result, a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed This has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency—commonly known as an Amber Alert [227]\n\n\nVictims\nOnly 28 of Gacy's victims have been conclusively identified The youngest were Samuel Stapleton and Michael Marino, both 14; the eldest were Francis Alexander and Russell Nelson, both 21.\n\n\nCrawl space\nCook County medical examiner Robert Stein supervised the exhumations of the victims buried on Gacy's property [228] The crawl space was marked in sections and each body was given an identifying number The first body recovered from the crawl space was assigned a marker denoting the victim as Body 1 [116] He was identified as Jon Prestidge on January 6, 1979 [125] No cause of death could be determined.\n\n\nDes Plaines River\nThe victim found 6 miles (9.7 km) downstream from the I-55 bridge on June 30 was not connected initially to Gacy [103] [252] On January 9, 1979, this victim was identified using fingerprint records and a distinctive tattoo as Timothy O'Rourke An autopsy was unable to rule out strangulation as the cause of death [56] [253] This victim was numbered 31 Following Gacy's arrest, investigators discovered he was a further victim.\n\n\nUnidentified victims\nFive victims have never been identified [256] Based on Gacy's confession, the location of the victims buried in the crawl space, and forensic analysis, police determined the most likely dates for when his unidentified victims were killed [257]\n\n\nRecent identification efforts\nIn October 2011, Cook County sheriff Thomas Dart announced that investigators, having obtained DNA profiles from the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify them At a press conference Sheriff Dart stated investigators were seeking DNA samples from across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979 [266]\n\n\nPossible additional victims\nAt the time of Gacy's arrest, he had claimed to investigators that the total number of murder victims could be as high as 45 [75] However, only 33 victims were ever linked to Gacy Investigators excavated the grounds of his property until they had exposed the substratum of clay beneath the foundations, finding 29 bodies [277]\n\n\nPotential accomplices\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had been arrested When questioned whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly\" He later claimed Cram and Rossi were involved in several of the murders [47] Some defense attorneys and investigators researching the possibility Gacy had not acted alone in several of the murders have said there is \"overwhelming evidence Gacy worked with an accomplice\" [296]\n\n\nFilms and media\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited works\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

a goaltender, was selected by the Philadelphia Flyers 126th overall in the 1978 NHL Amateur Draft [10] Although Jerry never played in the NHL, he did play four seasons of professional hockey in various leagues [11] and was for a time the goaltending coach of the Tri-City Americans [12] Price has a younger sister, Kayla, and is second cousins with former professional ice hockey player Shane Doan [13]\n\n\nPlaying career\nPrice made his first appearance in the Western Hockey League (WHL) in a single game for the Tri-City Americans during the 2002–03 season He then made the Tri-City roster the next season, appearing in 28 games as the backup for Colorado Avalanche prospect Tyler Weiman, posting a 2.38 Goals against average (GAA) and .915 save percentage The next season, Price took over as the primary starter of the team and established himself as a top goaltender, playing in a league-high 63 games with a 2.34 GAA and .920 save percentage and eight shutouts, both in the league top ten Ranking as the best North American goaltender by NHL Central Scouting, Price was drafted fifth overall by the Montreal Canadiens This move was considered surprising by many, both because Price was widely projected to be drafted in the middle of the first round, and because the Canadiens' then-current goaltender, José Theodore, had won the Vezina Trophy as the league's best goaltender three years prior [15] [16]\n\n\nTri-City Americans\nPrice made his first appearance in the Western Hockey League (WHL) in a single game for the Tri-City Americans during the 2002–03 season He then made the

goaltender three years prior [15] [16]\n\n\nHamilton Bulldogs\nFollowing Tri-City's early playoff exit, later that spring, Price joined the Montreal Canadiens farm team, the Hamilton Bulldogs, just before the start of the 2007 Calder Cup playoffs In two regular season appearances with the Bulldogs, Price allowed only three goals and won one game Price led the Bulldogs on a remarkable run that spring, defeating the Hershey Bears four games to one in the finals as the team won their first Calder Cup Price became only the third teenage goaltender to win the Jack A Butterfield Trophy as AHL playoff MVP, posting a 2.06 GAA and .936 save percentage.\n\n\nMontreal Canadiens (2007–2022)\nPrice made his highly anticipated Canadiens debut on October 10, 2007, against the Pittsburgh Penguins and recorded 26 saves in a 3–2 win After the first month of the season, he was awarded the Canadiens' Molson Cup for October, given to the player with the most first-star selections Although reassigned to the Hamilton Bulldogs midway through the season in January, he was called back up shortly over a month later With the trading of starting goaltender Cristobal Huet to the Washington Capitals before the trading deadline, Price assumed the starting role for the Canadiens He was subsequently named the NHL Rookie of the Month for March [18] and the NHL First Star of the Week (ending April 6, 2008) [19] as the Canadiens finished first overall in the Eastern Conference and earned their first division title since 1991–92 [18] Price completed the regular season leading all rookie goaltenders in wins (24), save percentage (.920) and shutouts (3) He was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in recognition for his accomplishments in his first year in the NHL Entering the first round of the 2008 playoffs against the eighth-seeded Boston Bruins, Price recorded a 1–0 win on April 15, 2008, becoming the first Canadiens rookie to post a playoff shutout since Patrick Roy in 1986 [20] He would go on to record another shutout in game seven to eliminate the Bruins The Canadiens were then upset in the second round in five games to the sixth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers, with Price losing three of the last four games.\n\n\n2007–2014: Early career, Eastern Conference Final runs\nPrice made his highly anticipated Canadiens debut on October 10, 2007, against the Pittsburgh Penguins and recorded 26 saves in a 3–2 win After the first month of the season, he was awarded the Canadiens' Molson Cup for October, given to the player with the most first-star selections Although

He would go on to record another shutout in game seven to eliminate the Bruins The Canadiens were then upset in the second round in five games to the sixth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers, with Price losing three of the last four games.\n\n\n2014–2021: Hart, Jennings and Vezina Trophies, Stanley Cup Finals appearance\nPrice would have the best season of his career in 2014–15, as he would finish the season as the leader of the three leading categories for goaltenders: GAA (1.96), save percentage (.933), and wins (44), all career highs as he would help the Canadiens win the Atlantic Division [31] He would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player in the regular season, the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender, the Ted Lindsay Award as most valuable player as voted by the NHLPA, and the William M Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (in a tie with Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks with 189 goals allowed) [32] He became only the second player in franchise history to win 4 awards in one season.\n\n\n2021–2023: Later years, Masterton Trophy and health struggles\nWith the arrival of the Seattle Kraken as the NHL's 32nd team, the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft was scheduled As each team was only allowed to protect one goaltender and Price had a contractual guarantee of protection in such situations, it was widely assumed that the Kraken would select Price's backup Jake Allen on the basis of his strong performance in the previous season and economical contract [51] Price proposed to waive his no movement clause so the Canadiens could instead protect Allen, with the team's calculation being that the Kraken would opt not to take Price's contract due to its cap hit and duration [52] Ultimately, the Kraken declined the opportunity to select Price, and selected defenseman Cale Fleury from the Canadiens instead [51] The Athletic remarked afterward that \"now that Seattle has taken a pass, the reality that Price will play his entire career in a Canadiens uniform seems impossible to refute.\" [52]\n\n\nRetirement\nPrice's wife Angela hinted at Price’s retirement in April 2023, stating they were moving back to British Columbia Although Price said he wished he could have returned, he realized that it was not possible [65] Subsequently, The Athletic reported in September 2023 that \" [Price] knows he will never play professional hockey again,\" with his priority shifting to maintaining his quality of life [66]\n\n\nInternational play\nPrice made his international debut for Canada at the 2005 IIHF World U18 Championships in the Czech Republic He appeared in four games, earning a silver medal as Team Canada was defeated by the United States 5–1 in the gold medal game Two years later, in his final year of major junior, Price was named to Team Canada for the 2007 World Junior Championships in Sweden He led Team Canada to a third consecutive gold medal and was named Tournament MVP and Top Goaltender after going 6–0 with two shutouts, a 1.14 GAA and .961 save percentage He was also named to the Tournament All-Star team along with teammates Jonathan Toews and Kris Letang He led the 2005 IIHF world U18 Championships in save percentage and wins Price sold his U18 Championship helmet for charity.\n\n\nPlaying style\nLike many modern goaltenders, Price uses the \"butterfly hybrid\" technique, a mix of \"stand-up\" and \"butterfly style\" goaltending Using this style, Price will stay on his feet for high shots, and drop to his knees, pointing his skates outwards with his pads covering the bottom width of the net for low shots Price has been lauded by his teammates and opponents alike for his exceptionally calm demeanor on the ice, with 2014 Olympic teammate and Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty calling Price \"probably the calmest goalie  [he] played in front of\" [69] Price’s methodical and calm approach to the play often allows him to make difficult saves look mundane and routine [69] Price is considered by the Canadiens' management and coaches to be one of the leaders of the team and is present during meetings with the team's captain and alternate captains [70]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn October 2015, Price teamed up with CCM to donate $10,000 worth of equipment to a minor hockey league in Williams Lake, B.C [71] [72] Since 2014, Price has been an ambassador to the Breakfast Club of Canada which aims to provide all children across Canada with nutritious meals [73]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPrice, who is of Ulkatcho First Nation descent through his mother, [9] was named as an honorary co-chair at the 2010 National Aboriginal Hockey Championships that were held in Ottawa, Ontario, in May 2010 [76] Price is of the Nuxalk and Southern Carrier Aboriginal heritage [77]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nBold indicates league leader\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\nBold indicates league leader\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nSee

April 6, 2008) [19] as the Canadiens finished first overall in the Eastern Conference and earned their first division title since 1991–92 [18] Price completed the regular season leading all rookie goaltenders in wins (24), save percentage (.920) and shutouts (3) He was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team in recognition for his accomplishments in his first year in the NHL Entering the first round of the 2008 playoffs against the eighth-seeded Boston Bruins, Price recorded a 1–0 win on April 15, 2008, becoming the first Canadiens rookie to post a playoff shutout since Patrick Roy in 1986 [20] He would go on to record another shutout in game seven to eliminate the Bruins The Canadiens were then upset in the second round in five games to the sixth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers, with Price losing three of the last four games.\n\n\n2014–2021: Hart, Jennings and Vezina Trophies, Stanley Cup Finals appearance\nPrice would have the best season of his career in 2014–15, as he would finish the season as the leader of the three leading categories for goaltenders: GAA (1.96), save percentage (.933), and wins (44), all career highs as he would help the Canadiens win the Atlantic Division [31] He would go on to win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player in the regular season, the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender, the Ted Lindsay Award as most valuable player as voted by the NHLPA, and the William M Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (in a tie with Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks with 189 goals allowed) [32] He became only the second player in franchise history to win 4 awards in one season.\n\n\n2021–2023: Later years, Masterton Trophy and health struggles\nWith the arrival of the Seattle Kraken as the NHL's 32nd team, the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft was scheduled As each team was only allowed to protect one goaltender and Price had a contractual guarantee of protection in such situations, it was widely assumed that the Kraken would select Price's backup Jake Allen on the basis of his strong performance in the previous season and economical contract [51] Price proposed to waive his no movement clause so the Canadiens could instead protect Allen, with the team's calculation being that the Kraken would opt not to take Price's contract due to its cap hit and duration [52] Ultimately, the Kraken declined the opportunity to select Price, and selected defenseman Cale Fleury from the Canadiens instead [51] The Athletic remarked afterward that \"now that Seattle has taken a pass, the reality that Price will play his entire career in a Canadiens uniform seems impossible to refute.\" [52]\n\n\nRetirement\nPrice's wife Angela hinted at Price’s retirement in April 2023, stating they were moving back to British Columbia Although Price said he wished he could have returned, he realized that it was not possible [65] Subsequently, The Athletic reported in September 2023 that \" [Price] knows he will never play professional hockey again,\" with his priority shifting to maintaining his quality of life [66]\n\n\nInternational play\nPrice made his international debut for Canada at the 2005 IIHF World U18 Championships in the Czech Republic He appeared in four games, earning a silver medal as Team Canada was defeated by the United States 5–1 in the gold medal game Two years later, in his final year of major junior, Price was named to Team Canada for the 2007 World Junior Championships in Sweden He led Team Canada to a third consecutive gold medal and was named Tournament MVP and Top Goaltender after going 6–0 with two shutouts, a 1.14 GAA and .961 save percentage He was also named to the Tournament All-Star team along with teammates Jonathan Toews and Kris Letang He led the 2005 IIHF world U18 Championships in save percentage and wins Price sold his U18 Championship helmet for charity.\n\n\nPlaying style\nLike many modern goaltenders, Price uses the \"butterfly hybrid\" technique, a mix of \"stand-up\" and \"butterfly style\" goaltending Using this style, Price will stay on his feet for high shots, and drop to his knees, pointing his skates outwards with his pads covering the bottom width of the net for low shots Price has been lauded by his teammates and opponents alike for his exceptionally calm demeanor on the ice, with 2014 Olympic teammate and Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty calling Price \"probably the calmest goalie  [he] played in front of\" [69] Price’s methodical and calm approach to the play often allows him to make difficult saves look mundane and routine [69] Price is considered by the Canadiens' management and coaches to be one of the leaders of the team and is present during meetings with the team's captain and alternate captains [70]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nIn October 2015, Price teamed up with CCM to donate $10,000 worth of equipment to a minor hockey league in Williams Lake, B.C [71] [72] Since 2014, Price has been an ambassador to the Breakfast Club of Canada which aims to provide all children across Canada with nutritious meals [73]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPrice, who is of Ulkatcho First Nation descent through his mother, [9] was named as an honorary co-chair at the 2010 National Aboriginal Hockey Championships that were held in Ottawa, Ontario, in May 2010 [76] Price is of the Nuxalk and Southern Carrier Aboriginal heritage [77]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nBold indicates league leader\n\n\nRegular season and playoffs\nBold indicates league leader\n\n\nInternational\n\n\nAwards\n\n\nSee

Olympics**\n\nThe 2020 Games saw members of the Great Britain team achieve a number of prominent milestones. In the pool, Adam Peaty became the first British swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic gold medal, winning the 100 metre breaststroke for the second time. The British swimming team also had its most successful Olympics in history, winning eight medals (with four golds) eclipsing the previous Olympic swimming best of seven medals (which also included four golds) which had stood since the London 1908 Games (113 years). This included a 1–2 finish in the final of the Men's 200m freestyle for Duncan Scott (who took silver) and Tom Dean (who took gold) which was the first time British swimmers had achieved this in any Olympic swimming event since 1908.\n\n**Medallists**\n\nMultiple medallists\nThe following Team GB competitors won multiple medals at the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nAdministration\nOn 9 April 2018, the British Olympic Association announced that Mark England would be their Chef de Mission in Tokyo following his success in this role at Rio 2016.

No individual targets have been set for each sport as it was considered impossible to properly evaluate the position of each sport in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, and the large scale disruption to both training and sports events that entailed.\n\nCompetitors\nThe team included nine sets of siblings: Tom and Emily Ford (Rowing), Jennifer and Jessica Gadirova (Gymnastics), Charlotte and Mathilda Hodgkins-Byrne (Rowing), Joe and Max Litchfield (Swimming), Luke and Pat McCormack (Boxing), Andy and Jamie Murray (Tennis), Tiffany Porter and Cindy Sember (Athletics), Hannah and Jodie Williams (Athletics), and Adam and Simon Yates (Cycling).

There was also one married couple in multi-gold medallists: Jason and Laura Kenny (Cycling).\n\n**Archery**\n\nBritish archers qualified each for the men's and women's events by reaching the quarterfinal stage of their respective team recurves at the 2019 World Archery Championships in 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands.

Relay qualification is achieved by a top eight finish at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in a relay event, or a top eight ranking in that event not including previously qualified nations. The first confirmed place was therefore assured when Great Britain finished fourth in the mixed 4x400 metres relay event at the Worlds in Doha.

the twelfth episode filmed, despite the Christmas special being released as the eleventh episode overall in the series This was because the idea for the Christmas special came about when the first episode of the second part was \"too far down the line\" to alter its production schedule Despite the production switch, Aguirre-Sacasa said the first episode of the second part was written \"as a premiere episode for the second part\" and helps kick-off the storylines for the part [30] Production on the second season, consisting of the third and fourth parts, began on May 17, 2019, and

In March 2018, Jon Goldwater confirmed that the two series were \"two separate entities for right now\" but \"would love it if they could figure out a way to cross over.\" Goldwater also felt there was a possibility for the characters to appear on future episodes of Riverdale, since Greendale had already been mentioned as existing on that series [37]\n\n\nLawsuit\nIn November 2018, Satanic Temple activists sued the series' production team over the use of the Statue of Baphomet, which they claim was a direct copy of their own statue and portrayed the Temple in an inaccurate and

The tournament is the second-most prestigious competition in women's football, after the FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\n**History**\n\nThe inaugural European Championship for women was staged in 1984, almost three decades after the first men's European Championship. The tournament was held in Italy, with the Netherlands, Denmark, England, and Sweden competing. Germany dominated the early years, winning the first four editions of the tournament. However, in 1995, Norway and Germany became the first teams to win the competition multiple times.\n\nThe tournament has undergone several changes over the years. In the early years, the competition format varied, with some editions featuring a round-robin group stage and others featuring a knockout stage. From 1995 onwards, the tournament has featured a round-robin group stage, followed by a knockout stage.\n\n**Results**\n\nSince the tournament's inception, no official host nation has been designated. The tournament has been held in a different country each year, with the exception of 1995, when Norway hosted the tournament for the second consecutive year.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn the inaugural 1984 tournament, no bronze medal was awarded. However, from 1987 to 1993, a third-place play-off was held to determine the bronze medalist. In 1995, the tournament format was changed, and both losing semi-finalists were awarded bronze medals.\n\n**Medal Table**\n\nThe medal table is a cumulative record of the teams' performances in the tournament. The table is updated after each tournament, with points awarded for each match won, drawn, or lost. Teams are ranked by total points, then by goal difference, and finally by goals scored.\n\n**Debut of Teams**\n\nIn the tournament's early years, teams were awarded points for each match won, drawn, or lost, with 3 points awarded for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. As per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws.\n\n**Overall Team

Born on March 7, 1950, in Fort Dix, New Jersey, Harris is best known for his storied career as a running back in the National Football League (NFL), particularly with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nHarris was born to Cad Harris, a Black soldier who served in World War II, and Gina Parenti Harris, a native Italian. Harris's father was stationed in Italy during the war, and his mother became a \"war bride\" who moved with her husband to the United States after the war. Harris's early life was marked by a strong sense of family and community, which would later influence his philanthropic endeavors.\n\nHarris attended Rancocas Valley Regional High School in Mount Holly, New Jersey, where he excelled in football and track. He was a talented athlete, earning all-state honors in football and setting a state record in the 100-yard dash. Harris's academic achievements and athletic prowess earned him a scholarship to Penn State University, where he would go on to play football and become a key figure in the program's success.\n\n## Professional Career\n\nHarris was selected 13th overall in the first round of the 1972 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Despite assistant personnel director Bill Nunn and head coach Chuck Noll preferring Robert Newhouse, Harris's impressive college career and exceptional athleticism made him a coveted prospect. In his first season with the Steelers, Harris was named the NFL Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press. He gained 1,055 yards on 188 carries, with a 5.6 yards per carry average, and scored 10 touchdowns.\n\nHarris's playing style was characterized by his exceptional speed, agility, and elusiveness. He was a key component of the Steelers' powerful running game, which would become a hallmark of the team's success in the 1970s. Harris's popularity with Pittsburgh's large Italian-American population was evident in the formation of \"Franco's Italian Army,\" a group of fans who wore army helmets with his number on them.\n\n## NFL Career Statistics\n\nHarris's NFL career statistics are impressive, with 12,120 yards rushing, 91 touchdowns, and 2,063 yards receiving. He was a four-time Pro Bowl selection and was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1976. Harris's longevity and productivity on the field were hallmarks of his career, earning him a reputation as one of the greatest running backs in NFL history.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nHarris's playoff performances were notable for their consistency and clutch nature. He rushed for 1,462 yards and scored 13 touchdowns in 18 playoff games, including a memorable performance in Super Bowl IX, where he caught the \"Immaculate Reception\" – a 60-yard touchdown pass from Terry Bradshaw that remains one of the most iconic plays in NFL history.\n\n## Post-Football\n\nHarris's post-football career was marked by a commitment to philanthropy and entrepreneurship. In 1990, he and his former Penn State teammate Lydell Mitchell founded Super Bakery (renamed RSuper Foods in 2006), which produces nutrition-oriented food for schoolchildren. Harris and Mitchell also partnered in 1996 to rescue the Parks Sausage Company in Baltimore, the first African-American-owned business to go public in the U.S.\n\nHarris's philanthropic efforts have been focused on education, healthcare, and community development. He has been involved with various charitable organizations, including the United Way, the American Red Cross, and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Harris's commitment to giving back to his community has earned him numerous awards and recognition, including the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHarris was married to Dana Dokmanovich, and they had one son, Franco \"Dok\" Harris, who ran as a third-party candidate in the 2009 Pittsburgh mayoral election and finished in second place with 25% of the vote. Franco's brother, Pete Harris, played football for Penn State and died of a heart attack on August 15, 2006, at age 49.\n\n## Death and Tributes\n\nHarris passed away on December 20, 2022, at the age of 72.

He was a standout quarterback for Murray County High School, where his father was his head coach. Napier earned All-State honors in 1997 and accepted a scholarship to play football at Furman University.\n\nDuring his time with the Furman Paladins, Napier was a four-time letterman and took over the starting quarterback duties for his junior and senior seasons. The Paladins won two conference championships during Napier's time there, and he was selected to two All-Southern Conference teams at quarterback.

He spent the 2011 season as an analyst on Saban's staff, earning a championship ring following Alabama's win over LSU in the BCS National Championship Game.\n\nAs a result of his experience under Saban during the 2011 season as well as the time spent working closely with fellow Alabama assistant Jim McElwain, Napier was able to get back into hands-on coaching by following McElwain to Colorado State to become the QB coach and assistant head coach. However, he did not stay in Colorado for long, as he was hired by Jimbo Fisher, then head coach at Florida State, to be the team's tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator in January 2013.\n\nHowever, Napier departed less than a month later as Saban brought him back to Tuscaloosa to take over from Mike Groh as WR coach going into the 2013 season.\n\n**Louisiana**\n\nOn December 15, 2017, Napier was named the 26th football head coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, replacing Mark Hudspeth.

New South Wales from 2017 to 2021. She was the second woman to hold the position, after Kristina Keneally.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGladys Berejiklian was born in Manly Hospital, Sydney, to Armenian parents, Krikor and Arsha. Her grandparents were orphaned by Turkish soldiers during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. Berejiklian's father was born in Aleppo, Syria, where she still has family ties. Her mother was born in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine. Berejiklian spoke only Armenian until she was five years old, when she began learning English. She remains fluent in Armenian and has remained involved in the Armenian-Australian community, serving a term on the Armenian National Committee of Australia. In 2015, she attended a commemoration ceremony in Yerevan for the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n\n**Political Career (2003–2017)**\n\nBerejiklian joined the Liberal Party in 1993 and was president of the New South Wales Young Liberals from 1997 to 1998, becoming the third female president in its history. She also served as a Delegate to State Council (1996–2003), Urban Representative of the NSW Liberal Party State Executive (1997–2003), Campaign Director for State seat of Willoughby (1999), and Chair of Convention Committee (2002). Berejiklian also worked for Peter Collins and Senator Helen Coonan and the Commonwealth Bank as general manager, Youth Retail Banking and Government & Industry Affairs.\n\n**Opposition (2003–2011)**\n\nBerejiklian won Liberal preselection for Willoughby in 2003 when former Opposition Leader Peter Collins decided to retire. Willoughby has historically been a comfortably safe Liberal seat, and Berejiklian won by 144 votes, with the Liberals suffering a swing of 10.9 points. However, she faced a spirited challenge from Pat Reilly, the longtime mayor of the City of Willoughby, who nearly took the seat on Labor preferences. Berejiklian easily saw off a rematch with Reilly after picking up a healthy swing of 14.5 points, enough to revert Willoughby to its traditional status as a comfortably safe Liberal seat.\n\n**O'Farrell Government (2011–2014)**\n\nFollowing the election of the O'Farrell government at the 2011 state election, Berejiklian was appointed Minister for Transport on 3 April 2011.\n\n**Baird Government (2014–2017)**\n\nDespite receiving the support of Barry O'Farrell to succeed him, and despite having the numbers to win the premiership in a partyroom ballot, Berejiklian chose not to run for the leadership of the New South Wales Liberal Party. On 17 April 2014, Mike Baird was elected Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, and hence Premier, following O'Farrell's resignation, with Berejiklian elected as Baird's deputy.

The investigation, led by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), found that Berejiklian had breached public trust and encouraged corrupt behavior during their relationship.\n\n**Resignation**\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the ICAC announced an investigation into whether Berejiklian had breached public trust or encouraged corrupt behavior during her relationship with Daryl Maguire. With the ICAC announcement, Berejiklian announced her intention to resign as Premier and as a member of the Legislative Assembly.

right eye and required two stitches [101] [102] [103] According to Benson, Abdul-Jabbar initiated the elbowing, but there were no witnesses and it was not captured on replays [101] [103] Abdul-Jabbar, who broke the same bone in 1975 after he punched the backboard support, [102] was out for almost two months and missed 20 games [103] [104] He was fined a then-league record $5,000 but was not suspended [102] [104] Benson missed one game but was not punished by the league [103] [105] The Lakers were 8–13 when Abdul-Jabbar returned [106] He was not named to the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, the

immigrants from Trinidad; his uncle was the Black activist and medical pioneer Dr John Alcindor [19] [20] [21] Alcindor grew up in the Dyckman Street projects in the Inwood neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, which he moved to at the age of 3 in 1950 [22] At birth, Alcindor weighed 12 lb 11 oz (5.75 kg) and was 22+1⁄2 inches (57 cm) long [23] [24] Always very tall for his age, [23] he was already 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) by the age of nine [25] Alcindor was often depressed as a teenager because of the stares and comments about his height [23] By the eighth grade (age 13–14), he had grown to 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) and could already dunk a basketball [25] [26]\n\n\nCollege career\nAlcindor was not able to play professionally in the NBA out of high school At the time, the league only accepted players beginning with the year that they could have hypothetically graduated from college [33] [34] His other options to play basketball professionally would have been to join the Harlem Globetrotters or play overseas However, Alcindor's goal was to attend college [34] Recruited by hundreds of schools, he was the most sought-after prospect since Wilt Chamberlain Southern teams that were segregated were willing to break the color line to acquire Alcindor [32] He chose to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, [34] after being recruited by Bruins assistant coach Jerry Norman [35]\n\n\nSchool records\nAs of the 2019–20 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team season, [65] he still holds or shares a number of individual records at UCLA: [66]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe

The Bucks had won a coin toss with the Phoenix Suns for the first pick He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets [67] The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor's services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept only one offer from each team, he rejected the Nets' bid as too low Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge [52] [68] After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks' offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million Alcindor declined the offer, saying: \"A bidding war degrades the people involved It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that.\" [69]\n\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (1969–1975)\nThe Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first overall in the 1969 NBA draft by the

Alcindor declined the offer, saying: \"A bidding war degrades the people involved It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don't want to think like that.\" [69]\n\n\nFirst championship, MVP, and Finals MVP (1970–1971)\nThe next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard Oscar Robertson Milwaukee went on to record the best record in the league with 66 victories in the 1970–71 season, [27] including a then-record 20 straight wins [74] Alcindor was awarded his first of six NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, along with his first scoring title (31.7 ppg) [27] He also led the league in total points, with 2,596 [29] The Bucks won the NBA title, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals Alcindor posted 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in Game 4, [75] and he was named

head coach Larry Costello on a three-week basketball tour of Africa on behalf of the State Department In a press conference at the State Department on June 3, 1971, he stated that going forward he wanted to be called by his Muslim name, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, its translation roughly \"noble one, servant of the Almighty  [i.e., servant of God]\" [77] [78]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1975–1989)\nIn 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center Walt Wesley from the Bucks for center Elmore Smith, guard Brian Winters, blue-chip rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman, and cash [85] [92] In the 1975–76 season, his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding (16.9), blocked shots (4.12), and total minutes played (3,379) [93] [94] His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record (defensive rebounds were not recorded prior to the 1973–74 season) [95] He earned his fourth MVP award, becoming the first winner in Lakers' franchise history, [96] but missed the post-season for the second straight year as the Lakers finished 40–42 [97]\n\n\nFourth and fifth MVP awards (1975–1977)\nIn 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center Walt Wesley from the Bucks for center Elmore Smith, guard Brian Winters, blue-chip rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman, and cash [85] [92] In the 1975–76 season, his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding (16.9), blocked shots (4.12), and total minutes

becoming the first winner in Lakers' franchise history, [96] but missed the post-season for the second straight year as the Lakers finished 40–42 [97]\n\n\nPlayoff disappointments (1977–1979)\nTwo minutes into the opening game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar broke his right hand punching Milwaukee's Kent Benson in retaliation to the rookie's elbow to his stomach Benson suffered a black right eye and required two stitches [101] [102] [103] According to Benson, Abdul-Jabbar initiated the elbowing, but there were no witnesses and it was not captured on replays [101] [103] Abdul-Jabbar, who broke the same bone in 1975 after he punched the backboard support, [102] was out for almost two months and missed 20 games [103] [104] He was fined a then-league record $5,000 but was not suspended [102] [104] Benson missed one game but was not punished by the league [103] [105] The Lakers were 8–13 when Abdul-Jabbar returned [106] He was not named to the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, the only time in his 20-year career he was not selected to an All-Star Game [107] Chicago's Artis Gilmore and Detroit's Bob Lanier were chosen as reserves for the West, with Walton starting\nat center [108] Amid criticism from the media over his performance, Abdul-Jabbar had 39 points, 20 rebounds, six assists and four blocks in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers the day the All-Star rosters were announced [109] He added 37 points and 30 rebounds in a victory over the New Jersey Nets (now Brooklyn) in the final game before the All-Star break [110]\n\n\nLast MVP award and championship success (1979–1985)\nThe Lakers selected Magic Johnson with the first overall pick of 1979 NBA draft They had acquired the pick from the New Orleans Jazz (later Utah) in 1976, when league rules required that they compensate Los Angeles for their signing of free agent Gail Goodrich [112] The addition of Johnson paved the way for the Lakers' Showtime dynasty of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships [113] While less dominant than in his younger years, Abdul-Jabbar reinforced his status as one of the greatest basketball players ever, [113] adding an additional four All-NBA First Team selections and two All-Defense First Team honors [10] He won his record sixth MVP award in his first season with Johnson in 1979–80 [113] [114] In the 1980 finals, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 33.4 points in five games, spraining his ankle in Game 5, but returning to finish the contest with 40 points and leading the team to a win He missed Game 6, when the Lakers clinched the title, and Johnson was named the Finals MVP after recording 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists in the finale [115] [116] [117]\n\n\nFinal playing years and sixth ring (1985–1989)\nAbdul-Jabbar played in his 17th season in 1985–86, breaking the previous NBA record for seasons played of 16, held by Dolph Schayes, John Havlicek, Paul Silas, and Elvin Hayes [127] [128] [129] Prior to the 1986–87 season, he gained 13 pounds (5.9 kg), reaching close to 270 pounds (120 kg), to compete against the growing number of 7-footers (2.1 m) in the league [130] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals in each of his final three seasons, defeating Boston in 1987, and Detroit in 1988 [1] The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in his final season [131] After winning Game 7 of the 1988 finals, the 41-year-old Abdul-Jabbar announced in the locker room that he would return for one more season before retiring [132] [133] His points, rebounds, and minutes had dropped in his 19th season, [133] [134] [135] and there were reports prior to the game that he was retiring after the contest [132] [136] On his \"retirement tour\" he received standing ovations at games, both home and away, and gifts ranging from a yacht that said \"Captain Skyhook\" to framed jerseys from his career to a Persian rug [137] At the Forum against Seattle in his final regular season game, [137] every Laker came onto the court wearing Abdul-Jabbar's trademark goggles [138]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1995, Abdul-Jabbar began expressing an interest in coaching and imparting knowledge from his playing days [141] [142] His opportunities were limited despite the success he enjoyed during his playing days During his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen He was often unfriendly with the media [141] [142] [143] His sensitivity and shyness created a perception of him being aloof and surly [141] [144] At the time, his mentality was that he either did not have the time or did not owe anything to anyone [145] Magic Johnson recalled as a kid being brushed off after asking him for an autograph Abdul-Jabbar might freeze out a reporter if they touched him, and he once refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview [143]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nOn offense, Abdul-Jabbar was a dominant low-post threat In contrast to other low-post specialists like Wilt Chamberlain or Shaquille O'Neal, he was a slender giant, standing 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) tall while weighing around 240 to 250 lb (110 to 115 kg), although he bulked to 270 lb (120 kg) in 1986; [130] [155] in his early years, he used that frame for agility and speed while in later years he utilized a bigger frame for trying to guard under the basket [130] Abdul-Jabbar was famous for his ambidextrous skyhook shot It contributed to his .559 career field goal percentage, which ranked eighth in NBA history at the time of his retirement, [a] and reputation as a feared clutch shooter [158] He shot above 50% in every season but his last [159]\n\n\nSkyhook\nAbdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark skyhook, a hook shot in which he raised the ball and released it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion He could shoot the skyhook from up to 16 feet (4.9 m) With his long arms and great height, he released the ball so high that it was difficult for a defender to block without committing a goaltending violation [176] [177] His body being between the defender and the ball made it further difficult to block, [176] as did extending his non-shooting arm to fend off opponents [159] He was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left, which he developed in his later years [159]\n\n\nLegacy\nAbdul-Jabbar won a record six MVP awards [1] [4] His 38,387 career points remained the NBA's career scoring record until February 7, 2023, when he was surpassed by LeBron James of the Lakers in Los Angeles [140] Abdul-Jabbar attended the game, and passed the game ball to James during the in-game ceremony after the record was broken [179] Abdul-Jabbar held the scoring mark for nearly 39 years, the longest span in league history [180] His skyhook is considered one of the most unstoppable shots ever [155] He won six NBA championships and two Finals MVP awards, was voted to 15 All-NBA and 11 All-Defensive Teams, and was selected to 19 All-Star teams, [181] a record which stood until it was surpassed by James in 2024 [182] Abdul-Jabbar was named to the NBA's 35th, 50th, and 75th anniversary teams [183] He averaged 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 2.6 blocks per game in his career, [181] including three straight seasons where he averaged at least 30 points and 16 rebounds, and six times he averaged at least 27 points and 14.5 rebounds in the same season [184] He is ranked as the NBA's third leading all-time rebounder (17,440) [185] He is the third all-time in registered blocks (3,189), [186] which is impressive because this basketball statistic was not recorded until the fourth year of his career (1974) [187]  He is one of five players who have led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in the same season [b]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nPlaying in Los Angeles facilitated Abdul-Jabbar's trying his hand at acting He made his film debut in Bruce Lee's 1972 film Game of Death

training\" for the film [7] The Stepford Wives (1975) provided inspiration, about which Peele said, \"it's a horror movie but has a satirical premise.\" [8] As the film deals with racism, Peele has stated that the story is \"very personal\", although he noted that \"it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical.\" [7]\n\n\nDevelopment\nGet Out is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, who

the film deals with racism, Peele has stated that the story is \"very personal\", although he noted that \"it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical.\" [7]\n\n\nCasting\nThe lead actors, Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, were cast in November 2015, [10] [11] with other roles cast between December 2015 [12] and February 2016 [13] [14] Kaluuya was cast based on the strength of his performance in Black Mirror episode \"Fifteen Million Merits\" [15] \"That party sequence is why I really wanted to do this film, because I've been to that party,\" Kaluuya told the Los Angeles Times [16] \"He  [Chris] feels like an everyman He's kind of like J Cole Chris is that guy that everyone knows, who has been in everyone's class at school That good guy from around the area.\" [17] Tiffany Haddish was asked to audition for a role in the film but declined [18]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on February 16, 2016 [21] Shooting took place in Fairhope, Alabama, for three weeks, followed by Barton Academy and in the Ashland Place Historic District in midtown Mobile, Alabama [22] The exterior and interior of the house was filmed just south of Fairhope [23] Principal photography lasted 23 days.\n\nAlternative endings\nIn the original ending, Chris is arrested by the police after strangling Rose Instead of rescuing Chris, Rod meets him in jail and asks him for information about the Armitage family to investigate, but Chris insists that he stopped them and everything is fine Peele intended this ending to reflect the realities of racism [29] By the time production had begun, however, several high-profile police shootings of black people had made discussion, in Peele's words, \"more woke\" After gauging reception at test screenings, he decided the film needed a happy ending, but felt a moment when the audience believes Chris is about to be arrested would preserve the intended reaction [30] [31]\n\n\nMusic\nMichael Abels composed the film's score, which Peele wanted to have \"distinctly black voices and black musical references.\" This proved to be a challenge, as Peele found that African-American music typically has what he termed \"at the very least, a glimmer of hope to it.\" At the same time, Peele also wanted to avoid having a voodoo motif The final score features Swahili voices as well as a blues influence \"Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga\" is a Swahili phrase that translates to \"listen to (your) ancestors,\" which indicates to the listener, \"something bad is coming Run.\" [33]\n\n\nThemes and interpretations\nGet Out has been described as critical of post-racial America, the concept of \"colorblindness\", and neoliberalism [38] [39] [40] Lanre Bakare in The Guardian notes, \"The villains here aren't southern rednecks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called 'alt-right' They're middle-class white liberals  [...] The thing Get Out does so well—and the thing that will rankle with some viewers—is to show how, however unintentionally, these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester It's an attitude, an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution, but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous.\" [41]\n\n\nReception\nGet Out grossed $176 million in the United States and Canada and $79.4 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $255.5 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million [1] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $124.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the 10th most profitable release of 2017 [51] Vulture described Get Out's 5.3 multiple (total divided by opening weekend gross) as \"staggering\" [52]\n\n\nBox office\nGet Out grossed $176 million in the United States and Canada and $79.4 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $255.5 million, against a

Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 403 reviews, and an average rating of 8.30/10 The website's critical consensus reads, \"Funny, scary, and thought-provoking, Get Out seamlessly weaves its trenchant social critiques into a brilliantly effective and entertaining horror/comedy thrill ride.\" [60] The film was the highest rated wide release of 2017 on the site [61] On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 85 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [62] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 84% overall positive score and a 66% \"definite recommend\" [54]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 90th Academy Awards, the film earned four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya [72] Peele became the third person (after Warren Beatty and James L Brooks) to earn Best Picture, Director and Screenplay nominations for a debut film, and the first African-American winner for Best Original Screenplay (and fourth overall nominated, after John Singleton, Spike Lee, and Suzanne de Passe) [73] It also became the 6th horror film to be nominated for best picture, after The Exorcist, Jaws, The Sixth Sense, The Silence of the Lambs and Black Swan Get Out divided Oscar voters, with many older members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences dismissing it or choosing not to see it According to Vulture, new voting members said they ran into \"interference\" from more senior members when it came to evaluating the film as Best Picture \"I had multiple conversations with longtime Academy members who were like, 'That was not an Oscar film,'\" according to a new voter \"Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.\" [74] One anonymous Oscar voter told The Hollywood Reporter they felt alienated by the Oscar campaign: \"Instead of focusing on the fact that this was an entertaining little horror movie that made quite a bit of money, they started trying to suggest it had deeper meaning than it does, and, as far as I'm concerned, they played the race card, and that really turned me off In fact, at one of the luncheons, the lead actor  [Kaluuya], who is not from the United States, was giving us a lecture on racism in America and how black lives matter, and I thought, 'What does this have to do with Get Out? They're trying to make me think that if I don't vote for this movie, I'm a racist.' I was really offended.\" [75]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Get Out**\n\nGet Out is a 2017 American horror film written, produced, and directed by Jordan Peele.

reveals\", and that comedy gave him \"something of a training\" for the film [7] The Stepford Wives (1975) provided inspiration, about which Peele said, \"it's a horror movie but has a satirical premise.\" [8] As the film deals with racism, Peele has stated that the story is \"very personal\", although he noted that \"it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical.\"

in that \"so much of it is pacing, so much of it  [hinges on] reveals\", and that comedy gave him \"something of a training\" for the film [7] The Stepford Wives (1975) provided inspiration, about which Peele said, \"it's a horror movie but has a satirical premise.\" [8] As the film deals with racism, Peele has stated that the story is \"very personal\", although he noted that \"it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical.\" [7]\n\n\nCasting\nThe lead actors, Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, were cast in November 2015, [10] [11] with other roles cast between December 2015 [12] and February 2016 [13] [14] Kaluuya was cast based on the strength of his performance in Black Mirror episode \"Fifteen Million Merits\" [15] \"That party sequence is why I really wanted to do this film, because I've been to that party,\" Kaluuya told the Los Angeles Times [16] \"He  [Chris] feels like an everyman He's kind of like J Cole Chris is that guy that everyone knows, who has been in everyone's class at school That good guy from around the area.\" [17] Tiffany Haddish was asked to audition for a role in the film but declined [18]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on February 16, 2016 [21] Shooting took place in Fairhope, Alabama, for three weeks, followed by Barton Academy and in the Ashland Place Historic District in midtown Mobile, Alabama [22] The exterior and interior of the house was filmed just south of Fairhope [23] Principal photography lasted 23 days.\n\nAlternative endings\nIn the original ending, Chris is arrested by the police after strangling Rose Instead of rescuing Chris, Rod meets him in jail and asks him for information about the Armitage family to investigate, but Chris insists that he stopped them and everything is fine Peele intended this ending to reflect the realities of racism [29] By the time production had begun, however, several high-profile police shootings of black people had made discussion, in Peele's words, \"more woke\" After gauging reception at test screenings, he decided the film needed a happy ending, but felt a moment when the audience believes Chris is about to be arrested would preserve the intended reaction [30] [31]\n\n\nMusic\nMichael Abels composed the film's score, which Peele wanted to have \"distinctly black voices and black musical references.\" This proved to be a challenge, as Peele found that African-American music typically has what he termed \"at the very least, a glimmer of hope to it.\" At the same time, Peele also wanted to avoid having a voodoo motif The final score features Swahili voices as well as a blues influence \"Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga\" is a Swahili phrase that translates to \"listen to (your) ancestors,\" which indicates to the listener, \"something bad is coming Run.\" [33]\n\n\nThemes and interpretations\nGet Out has been described as critical of post-racial America, the concept of \"colorblindness\", and neoliberalism [38] [39] [40] Lanre Bakare in The Guardian notes, \"The villains here aren't southern rednecks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called 'alt-right' They're middle-class white liberals  [...] The thing Get Out does so well—and the thing that will rankle with some viewers—is to show how, however unintentionally, these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester It's an attitude, an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution, but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous.\" [41]\n\n\nReception\nGet Out grossed $176 million in the United States and Canada and $79.4 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $255.5 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million [1] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $124.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the 10th most profitable release of 2017 [51] Vulture described Get Out's 5.3 multiple (total divided by opening weekend gross) as \"staggering\" [52]\n\n\nBox office\nGet Out grossed $176 million in the United States and Canada and

gross) as \"staggering\" [52]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 403 reviews, and an average rating of 8.30/10 The website's critical consensus reads, \"Funny, scary, and thought-provoking, Get Out seamlessly weaves its trenchant social critiques into a brilliantly effective and entertaining horror/comedy thrill ride.\" [60] The film was the highest rated wide release of 2017 on the site [61] On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 85 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [62] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 84% overall positive score and a 66% \"definite recommend\" [54]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 90th Academy Awards, the film earned four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya [72] Peele became the third person (after Warren Beatty and James L Brooks) to earn Best Picture, Director and Screenplay nominations for a debut film, and the first African-American winner for Best Original Screenplay (and fourth overall nominated, after John Singleton, Spike Lee, and Suzanne de Passe) [73] It also became the 6th horror film to be nominated for best picture, after The Exorcist, Jaws, The Sixth Sense, The Silence of the Lambs and Black Swan Get Out divided Oscar voters, with many older members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences dismissing it or choosing not to see it According to Vulture, new voting members said they ran into \"interference\" from more senior members when it came to evaluating the film as Best Picture \"I had multiple conversations with longtime Academy members who were like, 'That was not an Oscar film,'\" according to a new voter \"Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.\" [74] One anonymous Oscar voter told The Hollywood Reporter they felt alienated by the Oscar campaign: \"Instead of focusing on the fact that this was an entertaining little horror movie that made quite a bit of money, they started trying to suggest it had deeper meaning than it does, and, as far as I'm concerned, they played the race card, and that really turned me off In fact, at one of the luncheons, the lead actor  [Kaluuya], who is not from the United States, was giving us a lecture on racism in America and how black lives matter, and I thought, 'What does this have to do with Get Out? They're trying to make me think that if I don't vote for this movie, I'm a racist.' I was really offended.\" [75]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1. Write the article in a neutral, encyclopedic tone\n2.

the project as a web series However, he later decided to make it as a feature film [25] He personally went for location scouting across Nallamala Hills as the film is set in Rayalaseema and Nellore

Pushpa moves up the ranks in smuggler Konda Reddy's group while evading DSP Govindappa Konda, who is Konda Reddy's brother and a strict law enforcement officer.

to model a fighter aircraft's performance in combat Boyd's work called for a small, lightweight aircraft that could maneuver with the minimum possible energy loss and which also incorporated an increased thrust-to-weight ratio [12] [13] In the late 1960s, Boyd gathered a group of like-minded innovators who became known as the Fighter Mafia, and in 1969, they secured Department of Defense funding for General Dynamics and Northrop to study design concepts based on the theory [14] [15]\n\n\nLightweight Fighter program\nUS Vietnam War experience showed the need for air superiority fighters and better air-to-air training for fighter pilots [11] Based on his experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor in the early 1960s, Colonel John Boyd with mathematician Thomas Christie developed the energy–maneuverability theory to model a fighter aircraft's performance in combat Boyd's work called for a small, lightweight aircraft that could maneuver with the minimum possible energy loss and which also incorporated an increased thrust-to-weight ratio [12] [13] In the late 1960s, Boyd gathered a group of like-minded innovators who became known as the Fighter Mafia, and in 1969, they secured Department of Defense funding for General Dynamics and Northrop to study design concepts based on the theory [14] [15]\n\n\nSelection of finalists and flyoff\nFive companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9 million and $39.8 million to produce the YF-16 and YF-17, respectively, with the first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974 To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the Fighter Mafia and other LWF proponents [which?] successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix [19] The \"high/low mix\" would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' fly-off, defining the relationship between the LWF and the F-15 [20] [21]\n\n\nAir Combat Fighter competition\nIncreased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program NATO allies Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway were seeking to replace their F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers [26] In early 1974, they reached an agreement with the U.S that if the USAF ordered the LWF winner, they would consider ordering it as well The USAF also needed to replace its F-105 Thunderchief and F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers The U.S Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter program that would be a naval fighter-bomber variant of the LWF The four NATO allies had formed the Multinational Fighter Program Group (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nProduction\nThe U.S Air Force initially ordered 15 full-scale development (FSD) aircraft (11 single-seat and four two-seat models) for its flight test program which was reduced to eight (six F-16A single-seaters and two F-16B two-seaters) [37] The YF-16 design was altered for the production F-16 The fuselage was lengthened by 10.6 in (0.269 m), a larger nose radome was fitted for the AN/APG-66 radar, wing area was increased from 280 to 300 sq ft (26 to 28 m2), the tailfin height was decreased, the ventral fins were enlarged, two more stores stations were added, and a single door replaced the original nosewheel double doors The F-16's weight was increased by 25% over the YF-16 by these modifications [38] [39]\n\n\nImprovements and upgrades\nOne change made during production was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack The stall issue had been raised during development but had originally been discounted Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated a real concern In response, the area of each horizontal stabilizer was increased by 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation [46] [47]\n\n\nProduction relocation\nTo make more room for assembly of its newer F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft, Lockheed Martin moved the F-16 production from Fort Worth, Texas to its plant in Greenville, South Carolina [3] Lockheed delivered the last F-16 from Fort Worth to the Iraqi Air Force on 14 November 2017, ending 40 years of F-16 production there The company resumed production in 2019, though engineering and modernization work will remain in Fort Worth [64] A gap in orders made it possible to stop production during the move; after completing orders for the last Iraqi purchase, [65] the company was negotiating an F-16 sale to Bahrain that would be produced in Greenville This contract was signed in June 2018, [2] and the first planes rolled off the Greenville line in 2023 [66]\n\n\nDesign\nThe F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multirole tactical fighter aircraft It is much smaller and lighter than its predecessors but uses advanced aerodynamics and avionics, including the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire (RSS/FBW) flight control system, to achieve enhanced maneuver performance Highly agile, the F-16 was the first fighter aircraft purpose-built to pull 9-g maneuvers and can reach a maximum speed of over Mach 2 Innovations include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, a side-mounted control stick, and a reclined seat to reduce g-force effects on the pilot It is armed with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration [67]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multirole tactical fighter aircraft It is much smaller and lighter than its

locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration [67]\n\n\nGeneral configuration\nThe F-16 has a cropped-delta wing incorporating wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung air intake (with splitter plate [70]) to the single turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal \"stabilator\" tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece \"bubble\" canopy of the cockpit Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's \"spine\", housing additional equipment or fuel [44] [71]\n\n\nArmament\nEarly F-16s could be armed with up to six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking short-range air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix [74] More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM, and US aircraft often mount that missile on their wingtips to reduce wing flutter [75] The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, a wide variety of air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods [74] The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.79 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon, which is mounted inside the fuselage to the left of the cockpit [74]\n\n\nRelaxed stability and fly-by-wire\nThe F-16 is the first production fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as relaxed static stability (RSS), to both reduce drag and improve maneuverability [76] Most aircraft are designed to have positive static stability, which induces the aircraft to return to straight and level flight attitude if the pilot releases the controls This reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome and increases a form of drag known as trim drag Aircraft with relaxed stability are designed to be able to augment their stability characteristics while maneuvering to increase lift and reduce drag, thus greatly increasing their maneuverability At Mach 1, the F-16 gains positive stability because of aerodynamic changes [77] [78] [79]\n\n\nCockpit and ergonomics\nA key feature of the F-16's cockpit is the exceptional field of view The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle over the side of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose Additionally, the F-16's canopy omits the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision [44] [91] The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15° The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases g-force tolerance; however, it has been associated with reports of neck aches, possibly caused by incorrect headrest usage [92] Subsequent U.S fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20° [44] [93] Because of the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing [94]\n\n\nFire-control radar\nThe F-16A/B was originally equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar Its slotted planar array antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability, and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory [98]\n\n\nPropulsion\nThe initial powerplant selected for the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, a modified version of the F-15's F100-PW-100, rated at 23,830 lbf (106.0 kN) thrust During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and \"rollbacks\", wherein the engine's thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within \"dead-stick landing\" distance of its bases [16] It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for the newly built Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU) The OCU introduced the 23,770 lbf (105.7 kN) F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the main advance being a Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence Beginning production in 1988, the \"-220\" also supplanted the F-15's \"-100\", for commonality Many of the \"-220\" engines on Block 25 and later aircraft were upgraded from 1997 onwards to the \"-220E\" standard, which enhanced reliability and maintainability; unscheduled engine removals were reduced by 35% [103]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center [citation needed]\n\n\nIsrael\nThe F-16's first air-to-air combat success was achieved by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) over the Bekaa Valley on 28 April 1981, against a Syrian Mi-8 helicopter, which was downed with cannon fire [113] On 7 June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s, escorted by six F-15s, executed Operation Opera, their first employment in a significant air-to-ground operation This raid severely damaged Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad, to prevent the regime of Saddam Hussein from using the reactor for the creation of nuclear weapons [114]\n\n\nPakistan\nDuring the Soviet–Afghan War, PAF F-16As shot down between 20 and 30 Soviet and Afghan warplanes; the political situation however resulted in PAF officially recognizing only 9 kills which were made inside Pakistani airspace [125] From May 1986 to January 1989, PAF F-16s from the Tail Choppers and Griffin squadrons using mostly AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, shot down four Afghan Su-22s, two MiG-23s, one Su-25, and one An-26 [126] Most of these kills were by missiles, but at least one, a Su-22, was destroyed by cannon fire One F-16 was lost in these battles The downed F-16 was likely hit accidentally by the other F-16 [127]\n\n\nTurkey\nThe Turkish Air Force acquired its first F-16s in 1987 F-16s were later produced in Turkey under four phases of Peace Onyx programs In 2015, they were upgraded to Block 50/52+ with CCIP by Turkish Aerospace Industries [145] Turkish F-16s are being fitted with indigenous AESA radars and EW suite called SPEWS-II [146]\n\n\nEgypt\nOn 16 February 2015, Egyptian F-16s struck weapons caches and training camps of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Libya in retaliation for the murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian construction workers by masked militants affiliated with ISIS The airstrikes killed 64 ISIS fighters, including three leaders in Derna and Sirte on the coast [177]\n\n\nEurope\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force, Belgian Air Component, Royal Danish Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force all fly the F-16 [178] All F-16s in most European air forces are equipped with drag chutes specifically to allow them to operate from automobile highways [179]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn May 2023, an international coalition consisting of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark announced their intention to train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 ahead of possible future deliveries to increase the Ukrainian Air Force capabilities in the current Russo-Ukrainian War The U.S confirmed that it would approve the re-export from these countries to Ukraine [189] Denmark has agreed to help train Ukrainians on their usage of the fighter Denmark's acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said that Denmark \"will now be able to move forward for a collective contribution to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s\" [190] On 6 July 2023, Romania announced that it will host the future training center after the meeting of the Supreme Council of National Defense [191] During the 2023 Vilnius summit, a coalition was formed consisting of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine [192] A number of Ukrainian pilots began training in Denmark and the U.S [193] [194] The European F-16 Training Center, organized by Romania, the Netherlands, and Lockheed Martin through several subcontractors, officially opened on 13 November 2023 It is located at the Romanian Air Force's 86th Air Base, and Ukrainian pilots are expected to start training there in early 2024 [195] [needs update] On 17 August 2023, the U.S approved the transfer of F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark to Ukraine after the Ukrainian pilots have completed their training [196] The Netherlands and Denmark have announced that together they will donate up to 61 F-16AM/BM Block 15 MLU fighters to Ukraine once pilot training has been completed [197] [198]\n\n\nOthers\nVenezuela Air Force have flown the F-16 on combat missions [178]\n\n\nPotential operators\nThe Bulgarian Air

"article": "**Introduction**\n\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon is a multirole fighter aircraft used by air forces around the world. Developed in the 1970s and 1980s by General Dynamics, the F-16 was designed to be a low-cost, highly maneuverable fighter that could perform a variety of tasks, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attacks, and reconnaissance. The F-16 has undergone numerous upgrades and variants over the years, and it remains one of the most widely used fighter aircraft in the world.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe development of the F-16 began in the late 1960s, when the United States Air Force (USAF) recognized the need for a new air superiority fighter. At the time, the USAF was operating the F-4 Phantom II and F-105 Thunderchief, but these aircraft were becoming outdated and were not capable of meeting the changing needs of the air force. In response to this need, the USAF issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a new air superiority fighter, which would eventually become the F-16.\n\nThe F-16 was designed by a team of engineers and designers at General Dynamics, led by engineer Dennis Muilenberg. The team worked closely with the USAF to develop an aircraft that met the air force's requirements for a new air superiority fighter. The F-16 was designed to be a highly maneuverable aircraft, with a unique design that incorporated a cropped delta wing and a variable geometry air intake.\n\n**Lightweight Fighter program**\n\nThe F-16 was part of the Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program, which was a joint effort between the USAF and General Dynamics to develop a new air superiority fighter. The LWF program was established in 1969, and it was designed to produce a new fighter that was capable of operating from short runways and carrying a variety of payloads. The LWF program was a key factor in the development of the F-16, as it provided the air force with a new fighter that was capable of performing a variety of tasks.\n\n**Selection of finalists and flyoff**\n\nIn 1972, the USAF selected General Dynamics and Northrop as finalists in the LWF program. The two companies were awarded contracts to produce the YF-16 and YF-17, respectively, with the first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. The flyoff between the YF-16 and YF-17 was a significant event in the development of the F-16, as it provided the opportunity for the air force to evaluate the performance of both aircraft.\n\n**Air Combat Fighter competition**\n\nIn 1974, the USAF announced that it would be holding a competition to select a new air combat fighter, which would eventually become the F-16. The competition was between the F-16 and the F-15, and it was a significant event in the development of the F-16. The USAF ultimately selected the F-16 as the winner of the competition, and it began production in 1974.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe F-16 was produced in a variety of variants, including the F-16A and F-16B. The F-16A was a single-seat version of the aircraft, while the F-16B was a two-seat version. The F-16A was produced in large numbers, with over 2,000 aircraft built during the 1970s and 1980s. The F-16B was also produced in large numbers, with over 1,000 aircraft built during the same period.\n\n**Improvements and upgrades**\n\nThe F-16 has undergone numerous improvements and upgrades over the years, including the installation of new engines, avionics, and weapons systems. In the 1980s, the F-16 was upgraded with the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 engine, which provided a significant increase in power and thrust. In the 1990s, the F-16 was upgraded with advanced avionics, including the AN/APG-66(V)2 radar system.\n\n**Relaxed stability and fly-by-wire**\n\nThe F-16 was designed to be a highly maneuverable aircraft, with a unique design that incorporates relaxed stability and fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. The relaxed stability design allows the aircraft to fly with a low level of stability, which enables it to be highly maneuverable and responsive to the pilot's inputs. The FBW system uses computer-controlled flight controls to enhance the aircraft's stability and control.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe F-16 has a variety of specifications, including:\n\n* Length: 52 feet 8 inches (16 meters)\n* Wingspan: 32 feet 1 inch (9.8 meters)\n* Height: 16 feet 5 inches (5 meters)\n* Empty weight: 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms)\n* Gross weight: 25,000 pounds (11,300 kilograms)\n* Max speed: Mach 2 (over 1,400 mph or 2,250 km/h)\n* Range: 300 miles (480 kilometers)\n* Service ceiling: 50,000 feet (15,240 meters)\n* Engines: 1 x Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220 turbofan engine\n* Thrust: 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms)\n\n**Operational history**\n\nThe F-16 has been used by a variety of military forces around the world, including the United States Air Force, the United States Navy, and the United States Marine Corps. The F-16 has seen combat in a variety of conflicts, including the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan.\n\n**Variants**\n\nThe F-16 has been produced in a variety of variants, including:\n\n* F-16A: A single-seat version of the aircraft\n* F-16B: A two-seat version of the aircraft\n* F-16C: A single-seat version of the aircraft with advanced avionics\n* F-16D: A two-seat version of the aircraft with advanced avionics\n\n**Related developments**\n\nThe F-16 has been involved in a variety of related developments, including:\n\n* The F-35 Lightning II: A fifth-generation fighter aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin\n* The F-22 Raptor: A fifth-generation fighter aircraft developed by Lockheed Martin\n* The F-15 Eagle: A fourth-generation fighter aircraft developed by

better air-to-air training for fighter pilots [11] Based on his experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor in the early 1960s, Colonel John Boyd with mathematician Thomas Christie developed the energy–maneuverability theory to model a fighter aircraft's performance in combat Boyd's work called for a small, lightweight aircraft that could maneuver with the minimum possible energy loss and which also incorporated an increased thrust-to-weight ratio [12] [13] In the late 1960s, Boyd gathered a group of like-minded innovators who became known as the Fighter Mafia, and in 1969, they secured Department of Defense funding for General Dynamics and Northrop to study design concepts based on the theory [14] [15]\n\n\nLightweight Fighter program\nUS Vietnam War experience showed the need for air superiority fighters and better air-to-air training for fighter pilots [11] Based on his experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor in the

like-minded innovators who became known as the Fighter Mafia, and in 1969, they secured Department of Defense funding for General Dynamics and Northrop to study design concepts based on the theory [14] [15]\n\n\nSelection of finalists and flyoff\nFive companies responded, and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on prototype development and testing phase GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9 million and $39.8 million to produce the YF-16 and YF-17, respectively, with the first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974 To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the Fighter Mafia and other LWF proponents [which?] successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix [19] The \"high/low mix\" would allow the USAF to be able to afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' fly-off, defining the relationship between the LWF and the F-15 [20] [21]\n\n\nAir Combat Fighter competition\nIncreased interest turned the LWF into a serious acquisition program NATO allies Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway were seeking to replace their F-104G Starfighter fighter-bombers [26] In early 1974, they reached an agreement with the U.S that if the USAF ordered the LWF winner, they would consider ordering it as well The USAF also needed to replace its F-105 Thunderchief and F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers The U.S Congress sought greater commonality in fighter procurements by the Air Force and Navy, and in August 1974 redirected Navy funds to a new Navy Air Combat Fighter program that would be a naval fighter-bomber variant of the LWF The four NATO allies had formed the Multinational Fighter Program Group (MFPG) and pressed for a U.S decision by December 1974; thus, the USAF accelerated testing [27] [28] [29]\n\n\nProduction\nThe U.S Air Force initially ordered 15 full-scale development (FSD) aircraft (11 single-seat and four two-seat models) for its flight test program which was reduced to eight (six F-16A single-seaters and two F-16B two-seaters) [37] The YF-16 design was altered for the production F-16 The fuselage was lengthened by 10.6 in (0.269 m), a larger nose radome was fitted for the AN/APG-66 radar, wing area was increased from 280 to 300 sq ft (26 to 28 m2), the tailfin height was decreased, the ventral fins were enlarged, two more stores stations were added, and a single door replaced the original nosewheel double doors The F-16's weight was increased by 25% over the YF-16 by these modifications [38] [39]\n\n\nImprovements and upgrades\nOne change made during production was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack The stall issue had been raised during development but had originally been discounted Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated a real concern In response, the area of each horizontal stabilizer was increased by 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation [46] [47]\n\n\nProduction relocation\nTo make more room for assembly of its newer F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft, Lockheed Martin moved the F-16 production from Fort Worth, Texas to its plant in Greenville, South Carolina [3] Lockheed delivered the last F-16 from Fort Worth to the Iraqi Air Force on 14 November 2017, ending 40 years of F-16 production there The company resumed production in 2019, though engineering and modernization work will remain in Fort Worth [64] A gap in orders made it possible to stop production during the move; after completing orders for the last Iraqi purchase, [65] the company was negotiating an F-16 sale to Bahrain that would be produced in Greenville This contract was signed in June 2018, [2] and the first planes rolled off the Greenville line in 2023 [66]\n\n\nDesign\nThe F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multirole tactical fighter aircraft It is much smaller and lighter than its predecessors but uses advanced aerodynamics and avionics, including the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire (RSS/FBW) flight control system, to achieve enhanced maneuver performance Highly agile, the F-16 was the first fighter aircraft purpose-built to pull 9-g maneuvers and can reach a maximum speed of over Mach 2 Innovations include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, a side-mounted control stick, and a reclined seat to reduce g-force effects on the pilot It is armed with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration [67]\n\n\nOverview\nThe F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multirole tactical fighter

in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration [67]\n\n\nGeneral configuration\nThe F-16 has a cropped-delta wing incorporating wing-fuselage blending and forebody vortex-control strakes; a fixed-geometry, underslung air intake (with splitter plate [70]) to the single turbofan jet engine; a conventional tri-plane empennage arrangement with all-moving horizontal \"stabilator\" tailplanes; a pair of ventral fins beneath the fuselage aft of the wing's trailing edge; and a tricycle landing gear configuration with the aft-retracting, steerable nose gear deploying a short distance behind the inlet lip There is a boom-style aerial refueling receptacle located behind the single-piece \"bubble\" canopy of the cockpit Split-flap speedbrakes are located at the aft end of the wing-body fairing, and a tailhook is mounted underneath the fuselage A fairing beneath the rudder often houses ECM equipment or a drag chute Later F-16 models feature a long dorsal fairing along the fuselage's \"spine\", housing additional equipment or fuel [44] [71]\n\n\nArmament\nEarly F-16s could be armed with up to six AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking short-range air-to-air missiles (AAM) by employing rail launchers on each wingtip, as well as radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range AAMs in a weapons mix [74] More recent versions support the AIM-120 AMRAAM, and US aircraft often mount that missile on their wingtips to reduce wing flutter [75] The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, a wide variety of air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods [74] The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.79 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon, which is mounted inside the fuselage to the left of the cockpit [74]\n\n\nRelaxed stability and fly-by-wire\nThe F-16 is the first production fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as relaxed static stability (RSS), to both reduce drag and improve maneuverability [76] Most aircraft are designed to have positive static stability, which induces the aircraft to return to straight and level flight attitude if the pilot releases the controls This reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome and increases a form of drag known as trim drag Aircraft with relaxed stability are designed to be able to augment their stability characteristics while maneuvering to increase lift and reduce drag, thus greatly increasing their maneuverability At Mach 1, the F-16 gains positive stability because of aerodynamic changes [77] [78] [79]\n\n\nCockpit and ergonomics\nA key feature of the F-16's cockpit is the exceptional field of view The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle over the side of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose Additionally, the F-16's canopy omits the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision [44] [91] The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15° The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases g-force tolerance; however, it has been associated with reports of neck aches, possibly caused by incorrect headrest usage [92] Subsequent U.S fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20° [44] [93] Because of the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing [94]\n\n\nFire-control radar\nThe F-16A/B was originally equipped with the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar Its slotted planar array antenna was designed to be compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability, and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory [98]\n\n\nPropulsion\nThe initial powerplant selected for the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, a modified version of the F-15's F100-PW-100, rated at 23,830 lbf (106.0 kN) thrust During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and \"rollbacks\", wherein the engine's thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within \"dead-stick landing\" distance of its bases [16] It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for the newly built Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU) The OCU introduced the 23,770 lbf (105.7 kN) F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the main advance being a Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence Beginning production in 1988, the \"-220\" also supplanted the F-15's \"-100\", for commonality Many of the \"-220\" engines on Block 25 and later aircraft were upgraded from 1997 onwards to the \"-220E\" standard, which enhanced reliability and maintainability; unscheduled engine removals were reduced by 35% [103]\n\n\nOperational history\nThe F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center [citation needed]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center [citation needed]\n\n\nIsrael\nThe F-16's first air-to-air combat success was achieved by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) over the Bekaa Valley on 28 April 1981, against a Syrian Mi-8 helicopter, which was downed with cannon fire [113] On 7 June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s, escorted by six F-15s, executed Operation Opera, their first employment in a significant air-to-ground operation This raid severely damaged Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad, to prevent the regime of Saddam Hussein from using the reactor for the creation of nuclear weapons [114]\n\n\nPakistan\nDuring the Soviet–Afghan War, PAF F-16As shot down between 20 and 30 Soviet and Afghan warplanes; the political situation however resulted in PAF officially recognizing only 9 kills which were made inside Pakistani airspace [125] From May 1986 to January 1989, PAF F-16s from the Tail Choppers and Griffin squadrons using mostly AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, shot down four Afghan Su-22s, two MiG-23s, one Su-25, and one An-26 [126] Most of these kills were by missiles, but at least one, a Su-22, was destroyed by cannon fire One F-16 was lost in these battles The downed F-16 was likely hit accidentally by the other F-16 [127]\n\n\nTurkey\nThe Turkish Air Force acquired its first F-16s in 1987 F-16s were later produced in Turkey under four phases of Peace Onyx programs In 2015, they were upgraded to Block 50/52+ with CCIP by Turkish Aerospace Industries [145] Turkish F-16s are being fitted with indigenous AESA radars and EW suite called SPEWS-II [146]\n\n\nEgypt\nOn 16 February 2015, Egyptian F-16s struck weapons caches and training camps of the Islamic State (ISIS) in Libya in retaliation for the murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian construction workers by masked militants affiliated with ISIS The airstrikes killed 64 ISIS fighters, including three leaders in Derna and Sirte on the coast [177]\n\n\nEurope\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force, Belgian Air Component, Royal Danish Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force all fly the F-16 [178] All F-16s in most European air forces are equipped with drag chutes specifically to allow them to operate from automobile highways [179]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn May 2023, an international coalition consisting of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark announced their intention to train Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 ahead of possible future deliveries to increase the Ukrainian Air Force capabilities in the current Russo-Ukrainian War The U.S confirmed that it would approve the re-export from these countries to Ukraine [189] Denmark has agreed to help train Ukrainians on their usage of the fighter Denmark's acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said that Denmark \"will now be able to move forward for a collective contribution to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s\" [190] On 6 July 2023, Romania announced that it will host the future training center after the meeting of the Supreme Council of National Defense [191] During the 2023 Vilnius summit, a coalition was formed consisting of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine [192] A number of Ukrainian pilots began training in Denmark and the U.S [193] [194] The European F-16 Training Center, organized by Romania, the Netherlands, and Lockheed Martin through several subcontractors, officially opened on 13 November 2023 It is located at the Romanian Air Force's 86th Air Base, and Ukrainian pilots are expected to start training there in early 2024 [195] [needs update] On 17 August 2023, the U.S approved the transfer of F-16s from the Netherlands and Denmark to Ukraine after the Ukrainian pilots have completed their training [196] The Netherlands and Denmark have announced that together they will donate up to 61 F-16AM/BM Block 15 MLU fighters to Ukraine once pilot training has been completed [197] [198]\n\n\nOthers\nVenezuela Air Force have flown the F-16 on combat missions [178]\n\n\nPotential operators\nThe Bulgarian Air Force expects delivery of the first eight new F-16 Block 70s by 2025 and the second batch of eight F-16 Block 70s is expected to arrive in 2027 [207]\n\n\nBulgaria\nThe Bulgarian Air Force expects delivery of the first eight new F-16 Block 70s by 2025 and the second batch

ambassador to the US, that the State Department has approved the transfer of 38 F-16s from Denmark [208]\n\n\nPhilippines\nOn 24 June 2021, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved the Philippines' purchase of 12 F-16s worth an estimated US$2.43 billion However, the Philippines has yet to complete this deal due to financial constraints with negotiations ongoing [209] [210]\n\n\nCivilian operators\nIn January 2021, Canadian defence contractor Top Aces announced that they had taken delivery of the first civilian owned F-16s to their US HQ in Mesa, Arizona [211] In an approval process that had taken years, they had purchased a batch of 29 F-16A/B Netz from the Israeli Air Force, including several that had taken part in Operation Opera A year later, the first of these aircraft had finished the extensive AAMS mission system upgrades including AESA radar, HMCS, ECM, and Tactical Datalink In late 2022 they began regular operations flying as contracted aggressors for USAF F-22 and F-35 squadrons in Luke AFB and Eglin AFB, as well as supporting exercises in other USAF and USMC bases [212]\n\n\nTop Aces\nIn January 2021, Canadian defence contractor Top Aces

She manages to escape her stalker after pulling into a gas station, but the experience leaves her shaken. The film then cuts to 30 years later, where we meet two detectives, Joe \"Deke\" Deacon (Denzel Washington) and Jim Baxter (Rami Malek), who are tasked with solving a murder case in Los Angeles.\n\nAs Deke and Baxter investigate the murder, they discover that the victim, Mary Roberts, was a young woman who was shot by Deke in a previous case. Deke's past comes back to haunt him as he is forced to confront the consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, a serial killer, Albert Sparma (Jared Leto), is on the loose, and Deke becomes convinced that Sparma is the killer they are looking for.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, Deke and Baxter become obsessed with catching Sparma, but their methods become increasingly unorthodox. They begin to stalk Sparma, following him to his favorite haunts and monitoring his every move. However, their actions are called into question by their superiors, and they are forced to confront the ethics of their investigation.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including:\n\n* Denzel Washington as Joe \"Deke\" Deacon\n* Rami Malek as Jim Baxter\n* Jared Leto as Albert Sparma\n* Sofia Vassilieva as Tina Salvatore\n* Maya Kazan as Rhonda Rathbun\n* Anna McKitrick as Mary Roberts\n* Sheila Houlahan as Paige Callahan\n* Ebony N Mayo as Tamara Ewing\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film's script was written by John Lee Hancock in 1993, but it was not produced at the time.

The score features a haunting and atmospheric sound, with a mix of orchestral and choral elements.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 29, 2021, by Warner Bros Pictures. It was also released on the HBO Max streaming service for 31 days, as part of Warner Bros.' plan for all of its 2021 films.

He was known for his exceptional ability to analyze the market and make informed investment decisions, which earned him the nickname \"Big Bull\" of the Indian stock market.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala was born on July 5, 1960, in a Marwadi family. His surname indicates that his ancestors belonged to Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan. Growing up, Jhunjhunwala was fascinated by the stock market, observing his father discuss the markets with his friends. However, his father never gave him money to invest and forbade him from asking friends for money. This ultimately forced Jhunjhunwala to rely on his own savings to start investing in the stock market.\n\nJhunjhunwala graduated from Sydenham College and later enrolled at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. During his college days, he began investing in the stock market with an initial capital of ₹5,000 in 1985. His early investments paid off, and he earned a significant profit of ₹5 lakh in 1986. Between 1986 and 1989, he earned an impressive profit of almost ₹20-25 lakh.\n\n**Career**\n\nJhunjhunwala's interest in the stock market led him to start his career as a stockbroker. He began his journey at a young age and worked hard to build his reputation as a successful stock trader. He started with a small capital and gradually increased his investments, always keeping a close eye on market trends and making informed decisions.\n\nAs of 2021, Jhunjhunwala's biggest investment was in Titan Company, worth ₹7,294.8 crore. By 2022, his investment had grown to ₹11,000 crores. He was known for his exceptional ability to analyze the market and make informed investment decisions, which earned him a reputation as one of the most successful stock traders of all time.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nIn 2021, Jhunjhunwala was investigated for insider trading related to unusual dealings in shares of Aptech Computers. SEBI alleged that Jhunjhunwala and others traded in Aptech when in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI). According to the SEBI order, this was an UPSI between March 14, 2016, and September 7, 2016, the date of official announcement. In July 2021, the SEBI settled the issue after a total payment of ₹35 crore from Jhunjhunwala and his associates. Jhunjhunwala paid ₹18.5 crore, and his wife paid ₹3.2 crores.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nJhunjhunwala was a philanthropist who donated a significant portion of his wealth to charity. His net worth stood at $5.8 billion at the time of his death, and he had plans to donate a quarter of his wealth to charity. His philanthropic portfolio included health care and education-related initiatives, supporting organizations such as St Jude, Agastya International Foundation, Ashoka University, Friends of Tribals Society, and Olympic Gold Quest. He was also active in efforts to construct the R J Sankara eye hospital in New Panvel.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nOn June 7, 2012, the authors of a blog parodying Jhunjhunwala were revealed by The Economic Times to be two people: Mark Fidelman, a Forbes columnist, and Aditya Magal, a writer. The blog was a tongue-in-cheek take on Jhunjhunwala's life and career, highlighting his exceptional abilities as a stock trader.\n\n**Death**\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala passed away on August 14, 2022, at approximately 6:30 a.m. at Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai. Doctors later reported that he suffered from kidney-related problems and acute multiple organ failure. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared his condolences, stating, \"Rakesh Jhunjhunwala was indomitable. Full of life, witty and insightful, he leaves behind an indelible contribution to the financial world. He was also very passionate about India's progress. His passing away is saddening for the financial world.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala married Rekha Jhunjhunwala on February 22, 1987. The couple had three children: their daughter Nishtha, born on June 30, 2004, and their twin sons Aryaman and Aryaveer, born on March 2, 2009.\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala's legacy will live on through his remarkable achievements in the stock market and his philanthropic efforts.

It is the country's largest airport and serves as a hub for several airlines. The airport has a long history, dating back to the 1920s, and has undergone several renovations and modernizations over the years.\n\n**History**\n\nKabul Airport was originally built during the Kingdom of Amanullah Khan in the 1920s, which housed aircraft of the Afghan Air Force and Afghan Post. It was modernized in 1960 by Soviet engineers. The airport was locally named Khwaja Rawash Airport because it was built in the area called Khwaja Rawash. Foreign tourists began visiting Afghanistan via Kabul Airport, but this era ended after the 1978 Saur Revolution, especially after the 1979 Soviet invasion.\n\nThe airport played a significant role during the Soviet-Afghan War, with the Soviet military using it as a base for their operations. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the airport continued to serve as a major transportation hub for the country. In the 1990s, the airport suffered significant damage during the Civil War, which led to a decline in its infrastructure and services.\n\n**2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan**\n\nIn July 2021, the Taliban took over many areas in Afghanistan, including those near Kabul Airport. Turkey announced that it would provide security at the airport, while U.S and NATO forces were still deployed at the airport as well. A few weeks later, Kabul fell into the hands of the Taliban, prompting hundreds of people to flee to the airport in an attempt to leave the country. Seven people were alleged to have died at the airport after the crowds consisting of hundreds of people tried to forcibly enter planes leaving the airport. US forces fired in the air to prevent the crowds running onto the tarmac and runways.\n\nOn 16 August 2021, the US Deputy Security Advisor announced the deployment of more forces to secure the airport. The Pentagon confirmed the head of U.S Central Command, General Kenneth F McKenzie Jr., met Taliban leaders in Qatar. The Taliban officials agreed to terms set by McKenzie for refugees to flee using the Kabul International Airport.\n\n**Operation under Taliban rule**\n\nFollowing the Taliban takeover, the airport was closed. Much of its infrastructure had been degraded or destroyed during the evacuation. According to Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar was to send technical assistance to Afghanistan to help reopen the airport as soon as possible. Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, stated that the Taliban and other countries had requested Turkey for help in resuming operations at the airport. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, Sigrid Kaag, stated that her government was willing to support Turkey and Qatar in reopening the airport.\n\nMeanwhile, the security of the airport was handed over to the Al-Fatah Brigade of the special forces of the group on 3 September.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nThe airport has two terminals: the original that opened in 1960 and a newer building that opened in 2008. The terminal that opened in 2008 is used for international flights; the original 1960 Soviet-constructed terminal is used for domestic flights. Several hangars along the runway are for military aircraft. There are no hangars for civilian (or transient) aircraft. The airport has seven helicopter pads which are used mostly for military traffic. Fire fighting equipment is present, with a capacity of up to 12,000 litres (2,600 imp gal; 3,200 US gal) of water and the ability to reach 90 metres (300 ft) in height to manage fire outbreaks.\n\n**Airlines and destinations**\n\nBuses, taxi, and private cars provide transportation to and from the airport. A four-lane highway connects the airport to Kabul.\n\n**Transportation**\n\nBuses, taxi, and private cars provide transportation to and from the airport. A four-lane highway connects the airport to Kabul.\n\n**Accidents and incidents**\n\n*   Civilian: There have been several civilian aircraft accidents at the airport over the years, including a 1999 incident in which a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed on the runway, killing 45 people.\n*   Military: The airport has also been the site of several military aircraft crashes, including a 2005 incident in which a U.S. Air Force C-130 crashed on approach to the airport, killing all 16 people on board.\n*   Non-aircraft related: In 2011, a bomb exploded at the airport, injuring several people.\n\n**See also**\n\n*   List of airports in Afghanistan\n*   List of airlines of Afghanistan\n*   Transportation in Afghanistan\n\n**References**\n\n*   \"Kabul International Airport\".

It is considered the most prestigious honor that can be bestowed upon an individual, and its members are known for their courage, loyalty, and dedication to the British monarchy.\n\n## History\n\nThe Order of the Garter was founded by King Edward III around the time of his claim to the French throne. The traditional year of foundation is usually given as 1348, when it was formally proclaimed. However, some historians argue that the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344, listing each founding member as knighted in 1344. The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt, of whom the latest notice is 20 October 1345. Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed. The King's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348. Its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight, and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year. Its foundation is likely to have been inspired by the Castilian Order of the Band, established in about 1330.\n\n## Legendary Origins\n\nVarious legends account for the origin of the Order. The most popular involves the \"Countess of Salisbury\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais. When the surrounding courtiers snickered, the King picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\" ('Shame on him who thinks ill of it!'), which phrase has become the Order's motto. However, the earliest written version of this story dates from the 1460s, and it seems to have been conceived as a retrospective explanation for the adoption of what was then seen as an item of female underclothing as the symbol of a band of knights. In fact, at the time of the Order's establishment in the mid-14th century, garters were predominantly an item of male attire.\n\n## Ladies of the Garter\n\nSoon after the founding of the Order, women were appointed \"Ladies of the Garter\", but some historians argue that they were not appointed Companions, as they were not Knights. Queen Philippa was the first Lady to be appointed in 1358. King Henry VII discontinued the practice in 1488; his mother, Margaret Beaufort, was the last Lady of the Garter before Queen Alexandra.\n\n## Composition\n\nMembership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the Monarch, the Prince of Wales, not more than 24 Companion members, and various supernumerary members. The monarch alone decides who is appointed. The monarch is known as the Sovereign of the Garter, and the Prince of Wales is known as a Royal Knight Companion of the Garter.\n\n## Members\n\nFor the Order's ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Garter Day, the members wear elaborate vestments and accoutrements, which include the Garter, a blue sash with a gold buckle, and a white mantle with a blue border. The members also wear a sword and a helmet, which is surmounted by a crest.\n\n## Supernumerary Members\n\nThe Order includes supernumerary members, whose number do not count towards the limit of 24 companions. Several supernumerary members, known as \"Royal Knights and Ladies of the Garter\", belong to the royal family. These titles were introduced in 1786 by King George III so that his many sons would not curtail the number of non-royal companions. He created the statute of supernumerary members in 1805 so that any descendant of King George II could be installed as such a member. In 1831, this statute was extended again to include all descendants of King George I.\n\n## Degradation of Members\n\nThe sovereign may \"degrade\" members who have taken up arms against the Crown. From the late 15th century, there was a formal ceremony of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied by the rest of the Heralds, processed to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a Herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former Knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the Heralds kicked them down the length of the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, in 1716.\n\n## Officers\n\nFor ceremonial occasions of the Order, the officers wear the following garments and accessories: the Garter, a blue sash with a gold buckle, a white mantle with a blue border, a sword, and a helmet, which is surmounted by a crest. The officers also wear a cloak, which is worn over the left shoulder and draped over the right arm.\n\n## Military Knights of Windsor\n\nAt the founding of the Order of the Garter, 26 \"poor knights\" were appointed and attached to the Order and its chapel. This number was not always maintained, and by the 17th century, there were only thirteen such knights. King Charles II increased the number to 18 (in large part because of funds allocated from Sir Francis Crane's will) after his coronation in 1660. After the knights objected to being termed \"poor\", King William IV redesignated them in the 19th century as the Military Knights of Windsor.\n\n## Robes and Insignia\n\nFor the Order's ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Garter Day, the members wear elaborate vestments and accoutrements, which include the Garter, a blue sash with a gold buckle, and a white mantle with a blue border. The members also wear a sword and a helmet, which is surmounted by a crest.\n\n## Chapel\n\nSt George's Chapel in Windsor is the mother church of the Order of the Garter and the location of special services in relation to the Order.\n\n## Investiture and Installation\n\nEach June, on Garter Day, the members of the Order, wearing their habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights and/or Ladies of the Garter are due for installation, an investiture ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all available Knights and Ladies Companion of the Order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their spouses.\n\n## Privileges\n\nMembers are assigned positions in the order of precedence, coming before all others of knightly rank, and above baronets. The wives, sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law of Knights Companion are also assigned precedence. Relatives of Ladies Companion are not, however, assigned any special positions. The Chancellor is also assigned precedence, but since 1837 the office has been held by a diocesan bishop of the Church of England or a peer, who have a higher precedence than that bestowed by the Chancellorship.\n\n## Heraldry\n\nIn their heraldic achievements, members of the Order of the Garter may encircle their escutcheon with the Garter. Knights and Ladies Companion are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters, a privilege granted to few other private individuals. While some families claim supporters by ancient use, and others have been granted them as a special reward, only members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders of chivalry are automatically entitled to them.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Order_of_the_Garter\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nKing Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne [1] The traditional year of foundation is usually given as 1348 (when it was formally proclaimed) However, The Complete Peerage, under \"The Founders of the Order of the Garter\", states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344, listing each founding member as knighted in 1344 The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt, of whom the latest notice (according to the book) is 20 October 1345 [4] Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed The King's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348 Also, its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight (what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year [5] Its foundation is likely to have been inspired by the Castilian Order of the Band, established in about 1330 [6]\n\n\nList of Founder Knights\nAt the time of its foundation, the Order consisted of King Edward III, together with 25 Founder Knights, listed in ascending order of stall number in St George's Chapel: [7]\n\n\nLegendary origins\nVarious legends account for the origin of the Order The most popular involves the \"Countess of Salisbury\", whose garter is said to have slipped from her leg while she was dancing at a court ball at Calais When the surrounding courtiers snickered, the King picked it up and returned it to her, exclaiming, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense!\" ('Shame on him who thinks ill of it!'), which phrase has become the Order's motto [1] [8] However, the earliest written version of this story dates from the 1460s, and it seems to have been conceived as a retrospective explanation for the adoption of what was then seen as an item of female underclothing as the symbol of a band of knights In fact, at the time of the Order's establishment in the mid-14th century, garters were predominantly an item of male attire [9]\n\n\nLadies of the Garter\nSoon after the founding of the Order, women were appointed \"Ladies of the Garter\", but some historians argue that they were not appointed Companions, as they were not Knights Queen Philippa was the first Lady to be appointed in 1358 King Henry VII discontinued the practice in 1488;

She encounters an erratic man in pale makeup, which sets off a chain of events that lead her into a world of horror and dread. The film's narrative is loosely inspired by the killing of JonBenét Ramsey, a six-year-old beauty pageant participant who was murdered in 1996.\n\nThe murder took place approaching Christmas, and one present that the parents had gotten for JonBenét was a life-size replica doll of herself, wearing one of her pageant dresses. The doll was in a cardboard box in the basement, 15 feet from where she was killed. Osgood Perkins has stated that he was fascinated by this detail and used it as a plot device in Longlegs.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of Longlegs includes:\n\n* Nicolas Cage as Longlegs, the erratic man in pale makeup\n* The young girl, whose name is not revealed in the film, is played by a talented up-and-coming actress\n* The rest of the cast includes a talented ensemble of actors who play various roles, including parents, police officers, and other characters\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Neon, a independent film production company that has produced a number of successful horror films in recent years.

the Netherlands was later disqualified from the final, resulting in the entry from Luxembourg, which was set to perform in position 4, preceding Israel in the actual show [178] Golan once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May She performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 11 May Israel placed fifth in the final, scoring 375 points;

This article provides an overview of Israel's participation in the contest.\n\nBackground\n\nPrior to the 2024 contest, the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) until 2017, and the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation (IPBC/Kan) since 2018, had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Israel forty-five times since IBA's first entry in 1973. They had won the contest on four occasions: in 1978 with the song \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\" by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta, in 1979 with the song \"Hallelujah\" by Milk and Honey, in 1998 with the song \"Diva\" by Dana International, and in 2018 with the song \"Toy\" by Netta. Since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, they had, to this point, managed to qualify to the final 12 times, achieving, besides its 2018 victory, four top ten results: in 2005 with \"Hasheket Shenish'ar\" by Shiri Maimon placing fourth, in 2008 with \"The Fire in Your Eyes\" by Boaz placing ninth, in 2015 with \"Golden Boy\" by Nadav Guedj placing ninth, and in 2023 with \"Unicorn\" by Noa Kirel placing third.\n\nBefore Eurovision\n\nAs was the case between 2015 and 2020, the singer who would perform the Israeli entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 was selected through the reality singing competition HaKokhav HaBa, produced by Tedy Productions and Keshet Media Group, and broadcast on Keshet 12 as well as online via mako.co.il. The shows took place at the Neve Ilan Communications Center in Neve Ilan, and were hosted by Assi Azar and Rotem Sela. The judging panel for the competition was composed of Assaf Amdursky, Keren Peles, Shiri Maimon (2005 Israeli Eurovision entrant), Ran Danker, Itay Levi, and Eden Hason.\n\nHaKokhav HaBa\n\nAs was the case between 2015 and 2020, the singer who would perform the Israeli entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 was selected through the reality singing competition HaKokhav HaBa, produced by Tedy Productions and Keshet Media Group, and broadcast on Keshet 12 as well as online via mako.co.il. The shows took place at the Neve Ilan Communications Center in Neve Ilan, and were hosted by Assi Azar and Rotem Sela. The judging panel for the competition was composed of Assaf Amdursky, Keren Peles, Shiri Maimon (2005 Israeli Eurovision entrant), Ran Danker, Itay Levi, and Eden Hason.\n\nShows and impact of the Israel–Hamas war\n\nQualifiers from the preliminary casting phase proceeded to the auditions proper, held in Jerusalem and originally set to be filmed in the presence of an audience from late September or early October 2023 and to begin airing in November 2023. However, following the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war on 7 October 2023, filming for the competition was initially postponed in compliance with the Home Front Command's protection guidelines. Eventually, filming began without an audience in the week between 16 and 22 October, with the broadcasts initially scheduled to start on 31 October. The audience vote, which was set to determine 40% of the result alongside the judges, was replaced by the votes of a focus group.\n\nAuditions\n\nCandidates were required to get a score of at least 70% of the votes from the judges and a focus group in order to advance.\n\nShortlisting round\n\nThe following phase, aired in segments on 31 December 2023, consisted of a shortlisting round, where the artists receiving a \"yes\" vote from all six judges automatically qualified and the others were chosen among those who had received four or five \"yes\" votes. Fourteen artists were shortlisted, namely Lian Biran, Eden Golan, Arik Sinai, Yehuda Saado, Shai Tamino, Ido Bartal, Mika Moshe, Jonathan Bitton, Mika Kertis, Dor Shimon, Or Cohen, Gal Kafri, Moria Angel, and Orel Ravid.\n\nTop 14 round\n\nIn the top 14 round, the votes of the judges and an audience determined one contestant to be eliminated from each show, ultimately coming down to the top five. In each of the first two shows and in the sixth show, the artist to be eliminated was the one getting the lowest overall score. In the third, fourth, seventh, and ninth shows, the artists were paired in duels, with the winners directly qualifying to the next round; the judges then selected one eliminee per show among the others. In the fifth show, the artists were coupled to perform duets, with the eliminee selected between the lowest scoring duo. In the eighth show, each contestant performed a duet with a surprise guest artist.\n\nSemi-final round\n\nIn the first show of the semi-final, the votes of the judges and the audience determined one qualifier to the final. In the second show, the remaining four artists performed, and one of them left the competition.\n\nFinal\n\nFollowing the semi-final, Israel drew \"producer's choice\" for the final, meaning that the country would perform in the half decided by the contest's producers. Israel was set to perform in position 6, following the entry from the Netherlands and before the entry from Lithuania. The Netherlands was later disqualified from the final, resulting in the entry from Luxembourg, which was set to perform in position 4, preceding Israel in the actual show. Golan once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May. She performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 11 May. Israel placed fifth in the final, scoring 375 points; 323 points from the public televoting and 52 points from the juries.\n\nSong selection\n\nThe song that Eden Golan would perform in the contest was internally selected by a professional committee. On 16 January 2024, Kan and Keshet opened a window for specially selected songwriters to submit their entries until 11 February; submissions were required to include lyrics in Hebrew. Golan also had the option to submit her own entry. The selected entry, titled \"Hurricane\", was revealed on 10 March during a special broadcast on Kan 11, aired from the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Tel Aviv and hosted by Lior Suchard.\n\nControversy\n\nOn 19 February 2024, a report by Israel Hayom claimed that the proposed entry for the contest was being written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles, and Stav Beger, with it most likely being titled \"October Rain\". On 21 February, a report by Ynet claimed that the EBU had rejected the entry on the grounds of political content in its lyrics, but that Kan was not planning to change the song or its content. Kan and the EBU later addressed this report, stating that the song was being examined, and that if it did not meet the criteria, Kan would be given the opportunity to alter the lyrics or submit a new entry by 11 March. However, Kan added that if it was asked to change the contents of the song, it would not do so, and be forced to withdraw from the contest. Miki Zohar, Culture and Sports Minister of Israel, called the intention of the EBU to reject the song \"scandalous\", and \"called on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally and not to let politics influence art\". He later expressed his support for the song to be altered in order to meet the criteria for the contest.\n\nCalls for exclusion\n\nThe ongoing humanitarian crisis resulting from Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip led to calls for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to exclude Israel from the 2024 contest, with human rights activists urging other countries to boycott the event. Despite this, Israel ultimately appeared on the list of participants released by the EBU on 5 December 2023. On 8 December, the EBU issued a statement maintaining that Kan \"complies with all competition rules\", allowing it to participate in 2024. The situation sparked controversy in a number of participating countries.\n\nHistorical precedence\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. On 30 January 2024, an allocation draw was held to determine which of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show, each country would perform in; the EBU split up the competing countries into different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. At the request of Kan, Israel was allocated to the second semi-final as the rehearsal date for the first one coincides with Yom HaShoah. The country was drawn to perform in the second half of the show. The shows' producers then decided the running order for the semi-finals; Israel was set to perform in position 14.\n\nAt Eurovision\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024.

Livne claimed that the organisers explicitly instructed him against using any symbolism that might have political references to \"the situation in Israel\", rejecting a number of costume proposals.

submissions were required to include lyrics in Hebrew [52] [53] Golan also had the option to submit her own entry [51] The selected entry, titled \"Hurricane\", was revealed on 10 March during a special broadcast on Kan 11, aired from the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Tel Aviv and hosted by Lior Suchard [54] [55] [56]\n\n\nControversy\nOn 19 February 2024, a report by Israel Hayom claimed that the proposed entry for the contest was being written by Avi Ohayon  [he], Keren Peles, and Stav Beger, with it most likely being titled \"October Rain\" [57] On 21 February, a report by Ynet claimed that the EBU had rejected the entry on the grounds of political content in its lyrics, but that Kan was not planning to change the song or its content [58] Kan and the EBU later addressed this report, stating that the song was being examined, and that if it did not meet the criteria, Kan would be given the opportunity to alter the lyrics or submit a new entry by 11 March [59] [60] However, Kan added that if it was asked to change the contents of the song, it would not do so, and be forced to withdraw from the contest Miki Zohar, Culture and Sports Minister of Israel, called the intention of the EBU to reject the song \"scandalous\", and \"called on the European Broadcasting Union to continue to act professionally and neutrally and not to let politics influence art\"; [61] he later expressed his support for the song to be altered in order to meet the criteria for the contest [62]\n\n\nCalls for exclusion\nThe ongoing humanitarian crisis resulting from Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip led to calls for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to exclude Israel from the 2024 contest, with human rights activists urging other countries to boycott the event [70] [71] Despite this, Israel ultimately appeared on the list of participants released by the EBU on 5 December 2023 [72] On 8 December, the EBU issued a statement maintaining that Kan \"complies with all competition rules\", allowing it to participate in 2024 [73] [74] The situation sparked controversy in a number of participating countries:\n\n\nHistorical precedence\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024 All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final On 30 January 2024, an allocation draw was held to determine which of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show, each country would perform in; the EBU split up the competing countries into different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot [155] At the request of Kan, Israel was allocated to the second semi-final as the rehearsal date for the first one coincides with Yom HaShoah; [156] the country was drawn to perform in the second half of the show [157] The shows' producers then decided the running order for the semi-finals; Israel was set to perform in position 14 [158]\n\n\nAt Eurovision\nThe Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024 All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final;

Born Charlotte Emma Aitchison on August 2, 1992, in Cambridge, England, she rose to fame in the late 2000s and has since become a prominent figure in the music industry.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCharli XCX grew up in Start Hill, Essex, with her parents, Shameera and Jon Aitchison. Her mother is of Gujarati Indian descent and was born in Uganda, while her father is Scottish. Aitchison's early life was marked by a love for music, with her parents encouraging her to explore her creative side. She attended Bishop's Stortford College in nearby Bishop's Stortford, where she began writing and recording her own music.\n\n**Career**\n\nAt 14, Aitchison persuaded her parents to grant her a loan to record her first album, 14. She began posting songs from the album, as well as numerous other demos, on her official Myspace page. This caught the attention of a promoter running numerous illegal warehouse raves and parties in East London, who invited her to perform at them. She was billed on flyers under the stage name Charli XCX, with \"XCX\" being her MSN Messenger display name when she was younger. Despite the illicit nature of the gigs, her parents were supportive of her career and attended several raves with her.\n\n**2008-2013: Career Beginnings and True Romance**\n\nIn 2008, Aitchison released her debut single \"!Franchesckaar!\" and double A-side \"Emelline\"/\"Art Bitch\" under Orgy Music.

$10 million, [44] outcompeting a bid by Trifecta Enterprises, a group headed by Robert De Niro To make the bid, Kushner used money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings he purchased in Somerville, Massachusetts, [45] with family members providing the backing for his investments [46] The buildings, which he purchased for $8.3 million in 2000, sold four years later for $13 million [47]\n\n\nPolitics\nJared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics [58] He had donated over $10,000 to

but joined his father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015 [66] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign [67]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nFrom the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo.\" [68] The digital team tested more than one hundred thousand ad combinations a week, raising more than $250 million in small-dollar donations in the closing months of the campaign Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's top advertising executive during the 2016 campaign cycle, called it the “single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen from any advertiser.” [69] [70]\n\n\nPresidential transition\nDuring the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant,\" [81] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children [82] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation

the Office of American Innovation The office, created by President Trump in March 2017, was to draw on the lessons of the private sector to solving problems in government, such as the federal government's IT spend, economic activity, and the opioid crisis [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nFiring of Chris Christie\nKushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie [109] [110] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie.. He's always held  [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\" [111] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together .. I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\" [112] In his memoir Christie said that Steve Bannon fired him at Trump Tower but that Kushner had his firing ordered as revenge for what Christie had done to Kushner's father Charles Kushner for several felonies [113] [114]\n\n\nRussia investigation\nKushner's contacts with Russian officials came under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election [115]  Before meeting with the Senate and House intelligence committees, Kushner delivered an 11-page document describing his contacts with Russian figures during the campaign and after the election  The Wall Street Journal called it \"comprehensive disclosure\" and said it \"introduced a useful precedent to the Trump presidency\" [116]\n\n\nCriminal justice reform — FIRST STEP Act\nKushner was a strong supporter within the Trump administration for the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) which President Trump signed into law in December 2018 [143] [144] [145] [146] The legislation implemented several reforms to America's prison and criminal justice systems, reducing sentences for certain non-violent offenders and improving prison programs to reduce recidivism, among other priorities [147] [148] In announcing his support for the bill, Trump argued that it would “make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life According to reporting by Axios in 2020, Trump expressed regrets in private about having followed Jared Kushner's lead in going through with the First Step Act [149]\n\n\nMiddle East peace plan and Abraham Accords\nTrump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, despite the fact that Kushner had no foreign experience or experience in the Middle East [150] [151] [152] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [153] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him [154] [155]) He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East [153]\n\n\nUS–Mexico–Canada Agreement\nShortly after Trump assumed office, Kushner and several administration officials initiated discussions with the Mexican government around renegotiating NAFTA In April 2017 reports surfaced that Trump intended to withdraw from the trade agreement [185] Working with counterparts in the Mexican and Canadian governments, Kushner convinced Trump to set aside these plans and instead enter into formal trade negotiations [186] [187] When the Senate confirmed Robert Lighthizer as United States Trade Representative in May 2017, [188] Lighthizer commenced formal negotiations, leading on the technical aspects of the discussions while Kushner managed the relationships with the Mexican and Canadian governments On August 27, 2018, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary deal without Canada [189] A month later, Canada announced that it intended to join the deal as well At a press conference in the Rose Garden on September 30, 2018, Lighthizer stated that the $1.3 trillion trade deal “would not have happened” without Kushner's efforts [190] In recognition of these efforts, President Peña Nieto awarded Kushner the Order of the Aztec Eagle, Mexico's highest honor granted to a non-Mexican citizen, calling Kushner a “grand ally” of Mexico and an “important actor” in the U.S.-Mexico relationship [191]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic actions and response\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, Kushner was an influential advisor to President Trump, and shaped the administration's actions [192] [193] At Trump's order, Kushner set up what has been described as a \"shadow task force,\" separate from the official coronavirus task force chaired by Vice President Mike Pence [194] [195] The Kushner operation was staffed by a dozen young volunteers from the private sector; they worked out of offices on the seventh floor of the Health and Human Services building [192] Their first assignment was to facilitate the search for medical supplies and protective equipment, with their performance receiving criticism for favoritism shown to Trump associates [194] [196] According to The Washington Post, numerous rudimentary initiatives proposed by Kushner interrupted the work of other government officials who were seeking to manage the U.S response to the coronavirus pandemic [192] The New York Times reported that one way that Kushner was seeking advice on how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak was to ask his brother's father-in-law, a physician, for recommendations The physician then proceeded to crowdsource advice on a Facebook group for physicians [197]\n\n\n2020 election aftermath\nKushner did not participate in the Trump administration's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election He started writing a memoir, made plans to move his family to Miami, and focused on his

attack, he was returning from a diplomatic trip around the Persian gulf states On January 11, 2021, he arranged a meeting between vice-president Mike Pence and Donald Trump to try to reconcile their relationship [221] On March 31, 2022, he voluntarily spoke to the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack for six hours He was the highest-ranking Trump administration official interviewed to date, as well as the first Trump family member to be interviewed [222]\n\n\nCareer after Trump Administration\nKushner's firm landed the more than $2 billion only six months after

$2 billion from the Saudi public investment fund, with Kushner stating that he hopes to open an \"investment corridor between Saudi Arabia and Israel\", [224] [225] seen internationally as a \"sign of warming ties between two historic rivals\" [226]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia investment fund\nKushner's firm landed the more than $2 billion only six months after Kushner stopped working as a senior adviser for the president, [223] to invest in American and Israeli companies expanding in India, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia  Investors include $2 billion from the Saudi public investment fund, with Kushner stating that he hopes to open an \"investment corridor between Saudi Arabia and Israel\", [224] [225] seen internationally as a \"sign of warming ties between two historic rivals\" [226]\n\n\nPolitical memoir: Breaking History\nKushner wrote a memoir, Breaking History: A White House Memoir, that was published in August 2022 [221]\n\n\nControversies\nKushner's appointment as Trump's senior advisor in the White House in January 2017 was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law which forbids public officials from hiring family members, and explicitly one's son-in-law, in agencies or offices they oversee [236] The law was passed in response to President John F Kennedy's decision to appoint his brother, Robert F Kennedy, as attorney general in 1961 [237] However, on January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating the anti-nepotism law does not apply to appointments within the White House, [238] [239] after Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick claimed the 1967 law does not apply to the White House because it is not an 'agency' [240] Among other precedents, the OLC opinion invoked a 1993 D.C Circuit Court ruling that enabled Hillary Clinton to serve within the White House during the Clinton administration [241] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017 [242] and was given the office which is physically the closest to the Oval Office [243]\n\n\nAllegations of nepotism\nKushner's appointment as Trump's senior advisor in the White House in January 2017 was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law which forbids public officials from hiring family members, and explicitly one's son-in-law, in agencies or offices they oversee [236] The law was passed in response to President John F Kennedy's decision to appoint his brother, Robert F Kennedy, as attorney general in 1961 [237] However, on January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion

administration [241] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017 [242] and was given the office which is physically the closest to the Oval Office [243]\n\n\nSecurity clearance\nOn January 18, 2017, immediately after his appointment as senior advisor to President Trump, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance, [123] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\" [244] [245] The request omitted all of Kushner's contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov, though he quickly updated his filing to notify government officials that he would supplement his disclosure to provide the required information [123] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment [246] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\", [247] and that \"a member of  [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed [244]\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nWhile serving in the Trump administration, Kushner retained ownership of businesses, which drew criticism from government ethics experts who said it created conflicts of interest [197]\n\n\nUse of WhatsApp for White House duties\nWhile a White House official, Kushner used WhatsApp to conduct government business, raising concerns among cybersecurity experts that sensitive government communications could be vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments and hackers [266] Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly one of the individuals that Kushner contacted through WhatsApp; in January 2020, UN investigators said that there was evidence that bin Salman was involved in the hacking of Jeff Bezos's phone through WhatsApp communications, advising that Kushner and others in contact with the Crown Prince should take measures to protect their communications [267] Kushner reportedly used WhatsApp to communicate with his coronavirus team during March and April 2020 [268] Ethics watchdogs have since confirmed that Kushner turned over his WhatsApp records prior to departing the White House, and that these records have been acquired in full by the National Archives and Records Administration [269]\n\n\nPardoning white collar criminals\nUpon his suggestion and the Aleph Institute, several white collar criminals have been pardoned; for example in 2020 Philip Esformes, who defrauded Medicare for about $1.3 billion Esformes has been described as \"a man driven by almost unbounded greed,\" [270]\n\n\nSecret Service protection\nJared Kushner was in the list of 13 family members and three Cabinet appointees, who were granted security for additional six months after Donald Trump left the White House, a dispensation which had also been granted to Sasha and Malia Obama [271]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole [273] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009 They had met in 2005 through mutual friends [274] [275] [276] Kushner and his wife Ivanka (who converted to Judaism in 2009 [277]) are Modern Orthodox Jews, keep a kosher home, and observe the Jewish Shabbat [278] [279] [280] They have three children, a daughter born in July 2011 [281] and two sons, born in October 2013 [282] and

However, on January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating the anti-nepotism law does not apply to appointments within the White House, after Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick claimed the 1967 law does not apply to the White House because it is not an 'agency.'\n\n**Allegations of Nepotism**\n\nKushner's appointment as Trump's senior advisor in the White House in January 2017 was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law which forbids public officials from hiring family members, and explicitly one's son-in-law, in agencies or offices they oversee.\n\n**Security Clearance**\n\nOn January 18, 2017, immediately after his appointment as senior advisor to President Trump, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance, using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions.\" The request omitted all of Kushner's contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov, though he quickly updated his filing to notify government officials that he would supplement his disclosure to provide the required information.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\n\nWhile serving in the Trump administration, Kushner retained ownership of businesses, which drew criticism from government ethics experts who said it created conflicts of interest.\n\n**Use of WhatsApp for White House Duties**\n\nWhile a White House official, Kushner used WhatsApp to conduct government business, raising concerns among cybersecurity experts that sensitive government communications could be vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments and hackers.\n\n**Pardoning White Collar Criminals**\n\nUpon his suggestion and the Aleph Institute, several white collar criminals have been pardoned; for example in 2020 Philip Esformes, who defrauded Medicare for about $1.3 billion.\n\n**Secret Service Protection**\n\nJared Kushner was in the list of 13 family members and three Cabinet appointees, who were granted security for additional six months after Donald Trump left the White House, a dispensation which had also been granted to Sasha and Malia Obama.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nKushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole.

[44] outcompeting a bid by Trifecta Enterprises, a group headed by Robert De Niro To make the bid, Kushner used money he says he earned during his college years by closing deals on residential buildings he purchased in Somerville, Massachusetts, [45] with family members providing the backing for his investments [46] The buildings, which he purchased for $8.3 million in 2000, sold four years later for $13 million [47]\n\n\nPolitics\nJared Kushner had been a lifelong Democrat prior to his father-in-law Donald Trump entering politics [58] He had donated over $10,000 to Democratic campaigns

father-in-law Donald Trump's nascent US presidential campaign in the field of the Republican candidates in 2015 [66] Kushner had no prior involvement in campaign politics or in government before Trump's campaign [67]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nFrom the outset of the presidential campaign of his father-in-law Donald Trump, Kushner was the architect of Trump's digital, online, and social media campaigns, enlisting talent from Silicon Valley to run a 100-person social-media team dubbed \"Project Alamo.\" [68] The digital team tested more than one hundred thousand ad combinations a week, raising more than $250 million in small-dollar donations in the closing months of the campaign Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's top advertising executive during the 2016 campaign cycle, called it the “single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen from any advertiser.” [69] [70]\n\n\nPresidential transition\nDuring the presidential transition, Kushner was said to be his father-in-law's \"confidant,\" [81] and one of Donald Trump's closest advisors, even more so than Trump's four adult children [82] Trump was reported to have requested the top-secret security clearance for him to attend the presidential daily intelligence briefings as his staff-level companion, along with General Mike Flynn, who already had the clearance prior to his resignation [83]\n\n\nSenior Advisor to the President\nOn January 9, 2017, Kushner was named Senior Advisor to the President [84] (formally, \"Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor\") [85] He consequently resigned as CEO of Kushner Companies, and as publisher of the Observer [86]\n\n\nOffice of American Innovation\nFrom 2017 until the end of the Trump Administration in January 2021, Kushner directed the Office of American Innovation The office, created by President Trump in March 2017, was to draw on the lessons of the private sector to solving problems in government, such as the federal government's IT spend, economic activity, and the opioid crisis [105] [106] [107] [108]\n\n\nFiring of Chris Christie\nKushner was reportedly an influential factor behind the firing of New Jersey governor Chris Christie as head of the transition team, as well as the dismissal from the Donald Trump transition team of anyone connected to Christie [109] [110] An anonymous source familiar with the transition told Politico, \"Jared doesn't like Christie.. He's always held  [the prosecution of his father] against Christie.\" [111] Kushner told Forbes that the reports that he was involved in Christie's dismissal were false: \"Six months ago, Governor Christie and I decided this election was much bigger than any differences we may have had in the past, and we worked very well together .. I was not behind pushing out him or his people.\" [112] In his memoir Christie said that Steve Bannon fired him at Trump Tower but that Kushner had his firing ordered as revenge for what Christie had done to Kushner's father Charles Kushner for several felonies [113] [114]\n\n\nRussia investigation\nKushner's contacts with Russian officials came under scrutiny as part of the larger federal investigation into Russian interference in the election [115]  Before meeting with the Senate and House intelligence committees, Kushner delivered an 11-page document describing his contacts with Russian figures during the campaign and after the election  The Wall Street Journal called it \"comprehensive disclosure\" and said it \"introduced a useful precedent to the Trump presidency\" [116]\n\n\nCriminal justice reform — FIRST STEP Act\nKushner was a strong supporter within the Trump administration for the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill Formerly Incarcerated Reenter Society Transformed Safely Transitioning Every Person Act (FIRST STEP ACT, H.R. 5682) which President Trump signed into law in December 2018 [143] [144] [145] [146] The legislation implemented several reforms to America's prison and criminal justice systems, reducing sentences for certain non-violent offenders and improving prison programs to reduce recidivism, among other priorities [147] [148] In announcing his support for the bill, Trump argued that it would “make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life According to reporting by Axios in 2020, Trump expressed regrets in private about having followed Jared Kushner's lead in going through with the First Step Act [149]\n\n\nMiddle East peace plan and Abraham Accords\nTrump put Kushner in charge of brokering peace in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, despite the fact that Kushner had no foreign experience or experience in the Middle East [150] [151] [152] On August 24, 2017, Kushner traveled to Israel to talk to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [153] (with whom Kushner has longstanding personal links and family ties, causing Palestinians to distrust him [154] [155]) He then traveled to Palestine to meet President Mahmoud Abbas in an attempt to restart a peace process in the Middle East [153]\n\n\nUS–Mexico–Canada Agreement\nShortly after Trump assumed office, Kushner and several administration officials initiated discussions with the Mexican government around renegotiating NAFTA In April 2017 reports surfaced that Trump intended to withdraw from the trade agreement [185] Working with counterparts in the Mexican and Canadian governments, Kushner convinced Trump to set aside these plans and instead enter into formal trade negotiations [186] [187] When the Senate confirmed Robert Lighthizer as United States Trade Representative in May 2017, [188] Lighthizer commenced formal negotiations, leading on the technical aspects of the discussions while Kushner managed the relationships with the Mexican and Canadian governments On August 27, 2018, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary deal without Canada [189] A month later, Canada announced that it intended to join the deal as well At a press conference in the Rose Garden on September 30, 2018, Lighthizer stated that the $1.3 trillion trade deal “would not have happened” without Kushner's efforts [190] In recognition of these efforts, President Peña Nieto awarded Kushner the Order of the Aztec Eagle, Mexico's highest honor granted to a non-Mexican citizen, calling Kushner a “grand ally” of Mexico and an “important actor” in the U.S.-Mexico relationship [191]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic actions and response\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, Kushner was an influential advisor to President Trump, and shaped the administration's actions [192] [193] At Trump's order, Kushner set up what has been described as a \"shadow task force,\" separate from the official coronavirus task force chaired by Vice President Mike Pence [194] [195] The Kushner operation was staffed by a dozen young volunteers from the private sector; they worked out of offices on the seventh floor of the Health and Human Services building [192] Their first assignment was to facilitate the search for medical supplies and protective equipment, with their performance receiving criticism for favoritism shown to Trump associates [194] [196] According to The Washington Post, numerous rudimentary initiatives proposed by Kushner interrupted the work of other government officials who were seeking to manage the U.S response to the coronavirus pandemic [192] The New York Times reported that one way that Kushner was seeking advice on how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak was to ask his brother's father-in-law, a physician, for recommendations The physician then proceeded to crowdsource advice on a Facebook group for physicians [197]\n\n\n2020 election aftermath\nKushner did not participate in the Trump administration's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election He started writing a memoir, made plans to move his family to Miami, and focused on his

$2 billion from the Saudi public investment fund, with Kushner stating that he hopes to open an \"investment corridor between Saudi Arabia and Israel\", [224] [225] seen internationally as a \"sign of warming ties between two historic rivals\" [226]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia investment fund\nKushner's firm landed the more than $2 billion only six months after Kushner stopped working as a senior adviser for the president, [223] to invest in American and Israeli companies expanding in India, Africa, the Middle East and other parts of Asia  Investors include $2 billion from the Saudi public investment fund, with Kushner stating that he hopes to open an \"investment corridor between Saudi Arabia and Israel\", [224] [225] seen internationally as a \"sign of warming ties between two historic rivals\" [226]\n\n\nPolitical memoir: Breaking History\nKushner wrote a memoir, Breaking History: A White House Memoir, that was published in August 2022 [221]\n\n\nControversies\nKushner's appointment as Trump's senior advisor in the White House in January 2017 was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law which forbids public officials from hiring family members, and explicitly one's son-in-law, in agencies or offices they oversee [236] The law was passed in response to President John F Kennedy's decision to appoint his brother, Robert F Kennedy, as attorney general in 1961 [237] However, on January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion stating the anti-nepotism law does not apply to appointments within the White House, [238] [239] after Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick claimed the 1967 law does not apply to the White House because it is not an 'agency' [240] Among other precedents, the OLC opinion invoked a 1993 D.C Circuit Court ruling that enabled Hillary Clinton to serve within the White House during the Clinton administration [241] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017 [242] and was given the office which is physically the closest to the Oval Office [243]\n\n\nAllegations of nepotism\nKushner's appointment as Trump's senior advisor in the White House in January 2017 was questioned on the basis of a 1967 anti-nepotism law which forbids public officials from hiring family members, and explicitly one's son-in-law, in agencies or offices they oversee [236] The law was passed in response to President John F Kennedy's decision to appoint his brother, Robert F Kennedy, as attorney general in 1961 [237] However, on January 20, 2017, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion

administration [241] Kushner was sworn in on January 22, 2017 [242] and was given the office which is physically the closest to the Oval Office [243]\n\n\nSecurity clearance\nOn January 18, 2017, immediately after his appointment as senior advisor to President Trump, Kushner requested Top Secret security clearance, [123] using \"Standard Form 86 (SF86): Questionnaire for National Security Positions\" [244] [245] The request omitted all of Kushner's contacts with foreign officials, including the meetings with Kislyak and Gorkov, though he quickly updated his filing to notify government officials that he would supplement his disclosure to provide the required information [123] Failure to disclose pertinent contacts can cause security clearances to be declined or revoked, and an intentional failure to disclose can result in imprisonment [246] Kushner's lawyers said that the omissions were \"an oversight\", [247] and that \"a member of  [Kushner's] staff had prematurely hit the 'send' button\" before the form was completed [244]\n\n\nConflicts of interest\nWhile serving in the Trump administration, Kushner retained ownership of businesses, which drew criticism from government ethics experts who said it created conflicts of interest [197]\n\n\nUse of WhatsApp for White House duties\nWhile a White House official, Kushner used WhatsApp to conduct government business, raising concerns among cybersecurity experts that sensitive government communications could be vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments and hackers [266] Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was reportedly one of the individuals that Kushner contacted through WhatsApp; in January 2020, UN investigators said that there was evidence that bin Salman was involved in the hacking of Jeff Bezos's phone through WhatsApp communications, advising that Kushner and others in contact with the Crown Prince should take measures to protect their communications [267] Kushner reportedly used WhatsApp to communicate with his coronavirus team during March and April 2020 [268] Ethics watchdogs have since confirmed that Kushner turned over his WhatsApp records prior to departing the White House, and that these records have been acquired in full by the National Archives and Records Administration [269]\n\n\nPardoning white collar criminals\nUpon his suggestion and the Aleph Institute, several white collar criminals have been pardoned; for example in 2020 Philip Esformes, who defrauded Medicare for about $1.3 billion Esformes has been described as \"a man driven by almost unbounded greed,\" [270]\n\n\nSecret Service protection\nJared Kushner was in the list of 13 family members and three Cabinet appointees, who were granted security for additional six months after Donald Trump left the White House, a dispensation which had also been granted to Sasha and Malia Obama [271]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKushner has a younger brother, Joshua, and two sisters, Dara and Nicole [273] He married Ivanka Trump in a Jewish ceremony on October 25, 2009 They had met in 2005 through mutual friends [274] [275] [276] Kushner and his wife Ivanka (who converted to Judaism in 2009 [277]) are

{"title": "Wagner_Group", "content": "\nOrigins and leadership\nThe Wagner Group first appeared in 2014, during the Russian annexation of Crimea [89] Until 2022 it was unclear who founded and led the group Both Dmitry Utkin and Yevgeny Prigozhin have been named as its founders and leaders During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin claimed to have founded Wagner and he was referred to as the group's head [83] Some sources say Prigozhin was its owner and financier while Utkin was its military commander [90]\n\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin\nIt was long reported that Prigozhin had links with Wagner [91] [92] and Utkin personally [93] [94] He was sometimes called \"Putin's chef\", because of his catering businesses that hosted dinners for Vladimir Putin [95] [96] [97] The businessman was said to be the main funder [98] [99] and actual owner of the Wagner Group [100] [101] Prigozhin denied any link with Wagner [102] and had sued Bellingcat, Meduza, and Echo of Moscow for reporting his links to the mercenary group [84] In September 2022, he claimed to have founded the group, saying \"I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself and found specialists who could help me with this From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later came to be called the Wagner Battalion\" [83] Prigozhin became Wagner's public face and was referred to as its chief, but as he had no military background, he reportedly relied on Utkin to command Wagner's military operations [90]\n\n\nDmitry Utkin\nUtkin was a Russian military veteran Before his involvement with the Wagner Group, he was a lieutenant colonel and brigade commander of a Spetsnaz GRU unit, [103] [11] [104] [105] and fought in the First and Second Chechen wars Many sources name Utkin as a founder and the first commander of Wagner [90] [106] Reportedly, Utkin was an admirer of Nazi Germany and the group was named from his alias \"Wagner\" [107] The European Union sanctions against the Wagner Group name Utkin as its founder and leader [90] It is reported that Utkin was Wagner's military commander, responsible for overseeing its military operations, while Prigozhin was its owner, financier and public face [90] According to Bellingcat, evidence suggests Utkin \"was more of a field commander\" and \"was not in the driver's seat of setting up this private army, but was employed as a convenient and deniable decoy to disguise its state provenance\" [107]\n\n\nKonstantin Pikalov\nColonel Konstantin Aleksandrovich Pikalov (alias \"Mazay\") was said to have been put in charge of Wagner's African operations in 2019 [107] Pikalov served as an officer in Russia's experimental military unit numbered 99795, based in the village of Storozhevo, near Saint Petersburg The unit was tasked, in part, with \"determining the effects of radioactive rays on living organisms\" Following his retirement, he continued to live on the military base until at least 2012 and ran a private detective agency In 2014 he allegedly took part in suppressing opponents of the Russian-backed president of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, during the Republika Srpska general election Between 2014 and 2017, Pikalov traveled several times to destinations near the Ukrainian border, sometimes on joint bookings with known Wagner officers [107] Former employees of Prigozhin said Pikalov took part in military operations in Ukraine and Syria [107]\n\n\nOrganization\nIn early 2016, Wagner had 1,000 employees, [18] which later rose to 5,000 by August 2017, [112] and 6,000 by December 2017 [17] The organization was said to be registered in Argentina [18] [112] and has offices in Saint Petersburg [113] and Hong Kong [114] In November 2022, Wagner opened a new headquarters and technology center at the PMC Wagner Center building in the east of Saint Petersburg [115]\n\n\nRecruitment, training, techniques\nThe company trains its personnel at a Russian MoD facility, Molkino (Молькино), [104] [128] near the remote village of Molkin, Krasnodar Krai [129] [130] [131] The barracks at the base are officially not linked to the Russian MoD, with court documents describing them as a children's vacation camp [132] According to a report published by Russian monthly Sovershenno Sekretno  [ru], the organisation that hired personnel for Wagner did not have a permanent name and had a legal address near the military settlement Pavshino in Krasnogorsk, near Moscow [133] In December 2021, New Lines magazine analyzed data about 4,184 Wagner members who had been identified by researchers at the Ukrainian Center of Analytics and Security, finding that the average age of a Wagner private military contractor (PMC) is forty years old and that the PMCs came from as many as fifteen different countries, though the majority were from Russia [134]\n\n\nUnits\nThe Wagner Group includes a contingent known as Rusich, or Task Force Rusich, [147] referred to as a \"sabotage and assault reconnaissance group\", which has been fighting as part of the Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine [148] Rusich are described as a far-right extremist [149] [150] or neo-Nazi unit, [151] and their logo features a Slavic swastika [152] The group was founded by Alexey Milchakov and Yan Petrovsky in the summer of 2014, after graduating from a paramilitary training program run by the Russian Imperial Legion, the fighting arm of the Russian Imperial Movement [153] As of 2017, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and the International Criminal Court (ICC) were investigating fighters of this unit for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine [154]\n\n\nRusich unit\nThe Wagner Group includes a contingent known as Rusich, or Task Force Rusich, [147] referred to as a \"sabotage and

Bosnian Serb [24] who was a member of the Serb Volunteer Guard (also known as Arkan's Tigers) during the Bosnian War and the Special Operations Unit (JSO) during the Kosovo War [155] [156] His call sign in Bosnia was \"Elvis\" [156] Savičić was reportedly only three days in the Luhansk region when a BTR armored personnel carrier fired at his checkpoint, leaving him shell-shocked After this, he left to be treated [24] He was also reported to had been involved in the first offensive to capture Palmyra from the Islamic State (ISIL) in early 2016 [155]\n\n\nRelationship with the Russian state\nOn 27 June 2023, President Putin, while declaring an investigation into Wagner Group spending, confirmed that the Russian state fully funded it from the country's defense budget and state budget From May 2022 to May 2023 alone, the Russian state paid 86.262 billion RUB to the group, approximately $1 billion [162] Putin previously repeatedly denied any links between the Russian state and Wagner, stating that Wagner is a \"private military company\" [163] [164]\n\n\nWagner Group rebellion\nOn 24 June 2023, Prigozhin was accused by the Russian government of organizing an armed uprising after he threatened to attack Russian forces in response to a claimed air strike on his paramilitary soldiers Russian security forces accused the founder of the Wagner group of launching a coup attempt as he pledged a \"march of justice\" against the Russian army Prigozhin posted a voice memo claiming that Wagner had left Ukraine and was advancing on the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don Senior Russian generals urged Wagner's fighters to withdraw Meanwhile Russia's national security service, FSB, said it had filed criminal charges against Prigozhin and moved to arrest him [199] Prigozhin claimed that Wagner mercenary forces entered Rostov without any resistance [200] [201] [202] [203] A deal was eventually brokered by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko de-escalated the rebellion According to the agreement, Prigozhin was to leave Russia for Belarus, and the criminal case against him was to be dropped No legal action was to be taken against his troops, and the Wagner fighters were to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry [204]\n\n\nActivities\nThe Wagner Group is known to have operated in at least 11 countries; Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Mali, Libya, Venezuela, and Madagascar, spanning four continents, Europe, Africa, South America and Asia There are unconfirmed reports of activities in other countries.\n\n\nUkraine\nWagner has played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where it has been reportedly deployed to assassinate Ukrainian leaders, [71] among other activities, and for which it has recruited prison inmates from Russia for frontline combat [72] [73] In December 2022, United States National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby claimed Wagner had 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts [74] Others put the number of recruited prisoners at more than 20,000, [75] with the overall number of PMC forces present in Ukraine estimated at 20,000 [76] In 2023, Russia granted combat veteran status to Wagner contractors who took part in the invasion [196]\n\n\nCrimea annexation and War in Donbas\nWagner PMCs were first active in February 2014 in Crimea [20] [21] during Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula where they operated in line with regular Russian army units, disarmed the Ukrainian Army and took control over facilities The takeover of Crimea was almost bloodless [210] The PMCs, along with the regular soldiers, were called \"polite people\" at the time [211] due to their well-mannered behavior They kept to themselves, carried weapons that were not loaded, and mostly made no effort to interfere with civilian life [212] Another name for them was \"little green men\" since they were masked, wearing unmarked green army uniforms and their origin was initially unknown [213]\n\n\nFull-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022\nThe Times reported that the Wagner Group flew in more than 400 contractors from the Central African Republic in mid- to late-January 2022 on a mission to assassinate Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and members of his government, and thus to prepare the ground for Russia to take control for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started on 24 February 2022 [228] A US official stated that there were \"some indications\" that Wagner was being employed, but it was not clear where or how much [229] By 3 March, according to The Times, Zelenskyy had survived three assassination attempts, two of which were allegedly orchestrated by the Wagner Group [230]\n\n\nBelarus\nIn July 2020, ahead of the country's presidential election, Belarusian law enforcement agencies arrested 33 Wagner contractors The arrests took place after the security agencies received information about over 200 PMCs arriving in the country \"to destabilize the situation during the election campaign\", according to the state-owned Belarusian Telegraph Agency (BelTA) [256] The Belarusian Security Council accused those arrested of preparing \"a terrorist attack\" [257] Radio Liberty reported the contractors were possibly on their way to Sudan, citing video footage that showed Sudanese currency and a telephone card depicting Kassala's Khatmiya Mosque among the belongings of those who had been arrested [256] Others also believed the contractors were simply using Belarus as a staging post on their way to or from their latest assignment, [257] possibly in Africa, with BBC News pointing out the footage of the Sudanese currency and a Sudanese phone card as well [258]\n\n\nSyria\nThe presence of the PMCs in Syria was first reported in late October 2015, almost a month after the start of the Russian military intervention in the country's civil war, when between three and nine PMCs were killed in a mortar attack in Latakia province [25] [269] [270]\n\n\nAfrica\nThe Wagner Group has been active in Africa since 2017 It has provided military support, security and protection to several African governments In return, Russian and Wagner-linked companies have been given privileged access to those countries' natural resources, such as rights to gold and diamond mines, while the Russian military has been given access to strategic locations such as airbases and ports [77] [285] This has been described as a kind of state capture, whereby Russia gains influence over those states and they become dependent on it [286]\n\n\nSudan\nThe earliest reports of PMC Wagner involvement in Sudan came in 2017 [290] The PMCs were sent to Sudan to support it militarily against South Sudan and protect gold, uranium and diamond mines [291]\n\n\nCentral African Republic\nIn 2018, the Wagner Group deployed its personnel to the CAR, to protect lucrative mines, support the CAR government, and provide close protection for the president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra [298]\n\n\nLibya\nThe group's presence in Libya was first reported in October 2018, when Russian military bases had been set up in Benghazi and Tobruk in support of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who leads the Libyan National Army (LNA) The group was said to be providing training and support to Haftar's forces, and Russian missiles and SAM systems were also thought to be set up in Libya [citation needed] By early March 2019, around 300 Wagner PMCs were in Benghazi supporting Haftar, according to a British government source [306] The LNA made large advances in the country's south, capturing a number of towns in quick succession, including the city of Sabha and the El Sharara oil field, Libya's largest oil field [307] Following the southern campaign, the LNA launched an offensive against the Government of National Accord (GNA)-held capital of Tripoli, but the offensive stalled within two weeks on the outskirts of the city due to stiff resistance [308]\n\n\nMali\nIn September 2021, reports surfaced that an agreement was close to being finalized that would allow the Wagner Group to operate in Mali France, which previously ruled Mali as a colony, was making a diplomatic push to prevent the agreement being enacted Since late May 2021, Mali has been ruled by a military junta that came into power following a coup d'état [311] The United Kingdom, European Union and Ivory Coast also warned Mali not to engage in an agreement with the Wagner Group [312] [313] [314] Still, on 30 September, Mali received a shipment of four Mil Mi-17 helicopters, as well as arms and ammunition, as part of a contract agreed in December 2020 [315] [316]\n\n\nVenezuela\nIn late January 2019, Wagner PMCs were reported by Reuters to have arrived in Venezuela during the unfolding presidential crisis They were sent to provide security for President Nicolás Maduro, who was facing opposition protests as part of the socioeconomic and political crisis that had been gripping Venezuela since 2010 The leader of a local chapter of a paramilitary group of Cossacks with ties to the PMCs reported that about 400 contractors may have been in Venezuela at that point It was said that the PMCs flew in two chartered aircraft to Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela [46] [321]\n\n\nPossible activities\nAmid reports in March 2023 claiming Russia was plotting the toppling of the government of Moldova, and a subsequent anti-government demonstration, the Moldovan Border Police reported it had detained and deported an alleged member of the Wagner Group at Chisinau Airport [323] [324]\n\n\nMoldova\nAmid reports in March 2023 claiming Russia was plotting the toppling of the government of Moldova, and a subsequent anti-government demonstration, the Moldovan Border Police reported it had detained and deported an alleged member of the Wagner Group at Chisinau Airport [323] [324]\n\n\nNagorno-Karabakh\nSeveral days after Russian media reported that Russian PMCs were ready to fight against Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, [325] a source within the Wagner Group, as well as Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, reported Wagner contractors were sent to support armed forces of the partially recognized Republic of Artsakh against Azerbaijan during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War as ATGM operators [326] [327] However, Bellingcat reported that the Wagner Group was not present in Nagorno-Karabakh, pointing to the Reverse Side of the Medal (RSOTM) public channel, used by Russian PMCs, including Wagner RSOTM posted two images and a song alluding to the possibility of Wagner PMCs arriving in Nagorno-Karabakh, but Bellingcat determined the images were unrelated [328]\n\n\nSerbia\nA Russian news video claiming to show Serbian \"volunteers\" being trained by the Wagner Group to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine has prompted outrage in Serbia [332] Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vučić, reacted angrily on national TV, asking why the Wagner Group would call on anyone from Serbia when it is against the country's regulations [332] It is illegal for Serbians to take part in conflicts abroad [332]\n\n\nOther\nAccording to information from leaked US intelligence findings, Wagner has sought to expand its operations into Haiti, reaching out to the embattled Haitian government with a proposal to combat gangs on behalf of the government [333]\n\n\nCasualties\nFamilies of killed PMCs are prohibited from talking to the media under a non-disclosure that is a prerequisite for them to get compensation from the company The standard compensation for the family of a killed Wagner employee is up to 5 million rubles (about 80,000 dollars), according to a Wagner official [130] In contrast, the girlfriend of a killed fighter stated the families are paid between 22,500 and 52,000 dollars depending on the killed PMC's rank and mission [368] In mid-2018, Russian military veterans urged the Russian government to acknowledge sending private military contractors to fight in Syria, in an attempt to secure financial and medical benefits for the PMCs and their families [369]\n\n\nSanctions\nPrigozhin was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury in December 2016 for Russia's involvement in the war in Ukraine, [373] [374] and by the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom in October 2020 for links to Wagner activities in Libya [375]\n\n\nPlane crash\nOn 23 August 2023, Wagner leaders Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin died in a plane crash in Tver Oblast, Russia While the cause of the crash is unknown, The Wall Street Journal cited sources within the US government as saying that the crash was likely caused by a bomb onboard or \"some other form of sabotage\" [394] Early reports suggested a missile strike, but the Journal cited three veteran aviation experts who said that the visual evidence indicates a catastrophic structural failure not attributable to a missile [395] Meduza discounted the possibility of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) strike, saying that the aircraft was flying too high to be hit by a short-range man-portable air-defense system, while a more potent medium-range SAM such as those operated by Russian forces in the area would cause much more severe and readily identifiable damage [396] The United States Department of Defense press secretary Patrick Ryder said that the Pentagon had no indication that the plane had been shot down by a SAM, calling it false information [397] [398] Experts consulted by The New York Times said that the size of the debris field—with the fuselage being found some 3 km (2 mi) from the empennage—suggests a catastrophic structural failure that could not be caused by a simple mechanical problem [399]\n\n\nFar-right elements\nVarious elements of the Wagner Group have been linked to extremism, including white supremacy and neo-Nazism [400] [401] [402] [403] Some founding members of Wagner belong to the far-right ultranationalist Russian Imperial Movement [404] Wagner's first commander, Dmitry Utkin, [145] was reportedly a neo-Nazi and had several Nazi tattoos, [405] [406] [401] [403] greeted subordinates by saying \"Heil!\", wore a Wehrmacht field cap around the unit's training grounds, and occasionally signed his name with the two lightning bolt insignia of the Nazi SS [145]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nWagner PMCs have received state awards [24] in the form of military decorations [113] and certificates signed by Russian president Putin [413] Wagner commanders Andrey Bogatov and Andrei Troshev were awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation honor for assisting in the first capture of Palmyra in March 2016 Bogatov was seriously injured during the battle Meanwhile, Alexander Kuznetsov and Dmitry Utkin had reportedly won the Order of Courage four times [109] Family members of killed PMCs also received medals from Wagner itself, with the mother of one killed fighter being given two medals, one for \"heroism and valour\" and the other for \"blood and bravery\" [414] A medal for conducting operations in Syria was also issued by Wagner to its PMCs [415]\n\n\nPost Yevgeny Prigozhin's death\nOn 11 September 2023, Russian media reported that the National Guard, Rosgvardia, had begun recruiting former convicts who served in Ukraine as members of the Wagner Group [431]\n\n\nNationalization of Wagner Group\nOn 13 November 2023, it was reported that four former inmates who fought for the Wagner Group in eastern Ukraine, have been receiving calls and text messages offering them military contracts Three of the veterans reported that specifically Rosgvardia was trying to recruit them A text message said: \"Wagner is officially becoming a unit of Rosgvardia...The entire structure, methods of work and commanders remain the same.\" Other reports indicate that former Wagner fighters have joined Chechen Akhmat units, whilst still wearing Wagner patches [435]\n\n\nNotable

leaving him shell-shocked After this, he left to be treated [24] He was also reported to had been involved in the first offensive to capture Palmyra from the Islamic State (ISIL) in early 2016 [155]\n\n\nRelationship with the Russian state\nOn 27 June 2023, President Putin, while declaring an investigation into Wagner Group spending, confirmed that the Russian state fully funded it from the country's defense budget and state budget From May 2022 to May 2023 alone, the Russian state paid 86.262 billion RUB to the group, approximately $1 billion [162] Putin previously repeatedly denied any links between the Russian state and Wagner, stating that Wagner is a \"private military company\" [163] [164]\n\n\nWagner Group rebellion\nOn 24 June 2023, Prigozhin was accused by the Russian government of organizing an armed uprising after he threatened to attack Russian forces in response to a claimed air strike on his paramilitary soldiers Russian security forces accused the founder of the Wagner group of launching a coup attempt as he pledged a \"march of justice\" against the Russian army Prigozhin posted a voice memo claiming that Wagner had left Ukraine and was advancing on the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don Senior Russian generals urged Wagner's fighters to withdraw Meanwhile Russia's national security service, FSB, said it had filed criminal charges against Prigozhin and moved to arrest him [199] Prigozhin claimed that Wagner mercenary forces entered Rostov without any resistance [200] [201] [202] [203] A deal was eventually brokered by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko de-escalated the rebellion According to the agreement, Prigozhin was to leave Russia for Belarus, and the criminal case against him was to be dropped No legal action was to be taken against his troops, and the Wagner fighters were to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry [204]\n\n\nActivities\nThe Wagner Group is known to have operated in at least 11 countries; Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, Mozambique, Central African Republic, Mali, Libya, Venezuela, and Madagascar, spanning four continents, Europe, Africa, South America and Asia There are unconfirmed reports of activities in other countries.\n\n\nUkraine\nWagner has played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where it has been reportedly deployed to assassinate Ukrainian leaders, [71] among other activities, and for which it has recruited prison inmates from Russia for frontline combat [72] [73] In December 2022, United States National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby claimed Wagner had 50,000 fighters in Ukraine, including 10,000 contractors and 40,000 convicts [74] Others put the number of recruited prisoners at more than 20,000, [75] with the overall number of PMC forces present in Ukraine estimated at 20,000 [76] In 2023, Russia granted combat veteran status to Wagner contractors who took part in the invasion [196]\n\n\nCrimea annexation and War in Donbas\nWagner PMCs were first active in February 2014 in Crimea [20] [21] during Russia's 2014 annexation of the peninsula where they operated in line with regular Russian army units, disarmed the Ukrainian Army and took control over facilities The takeover of Crimea was almost bloodless [210] The PMCs, along with the regular soldiers, were called \"polite people\" at the time [211] due to their well-mannered behavior They kept to themselves, carried weapons that were not loaded, and mostly made no effort to interfere with civilian life [212] Another name for them was \"little green men\" since they were masked, wearing unmarked green army uniforms and their origin was initially unknown [213]\n\n\nFull-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022\nThe Times reported that the Wagner Group flew in more than 400 contractors from the Central African Republic in mid- to late-January 2022 on a mission to assassinate Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and members of his government, and thus to prepare the ground for Russia to take control for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started on 24 February 2022 [228] A US official stated that there were \"some indications\" that Wagner was being employed, but it was not clear where or how much [229] By 3 March, according to The Times, Zelenskyy had survived three assassination attempts, two of which were allegedly orchestrated by the Wagner Group [230]\n\n\nBelarus\nIn July 2020, ahead of the country's presidential election, Belarusian law enforcement agencies arrested 33 Wagner contractors The arrests took place after the security agencies received information about over 200 PMCs arriving in the country \"to destabilize the situation during the election campaign\", according to the state-owned Belarusian Telegraph Agency (BelTA) [256] The Belarusian Security Council accused those arrested of preparing \"a terrorist attack\" [257] Radio Liberty reported the contractors were possibly on their way to Sudan, citing video footage that showed Sudanese currency and a telephone card depicting Kassala's Khatmiya Mosque among the belongings of those who had been arrested [256] Others also believed the contractors were simply using Belarus as a staging post on their way to or from their latest assignment, [257] possibly in Africa, with BBC News pointing out the footage of the Sudanese currency and a Sudanese phone card as well [258]\n\n\nSyria\nThe presence of the PMCs in Syria was first reported in late October 2015, almost a month after the start of the Russian military intervention in the country's civil war, when between three and nine PMCs were killed in a mortar attack in Latakia province [25] [269] [270]\n\n\nAfrica\nThe Wagner Group has been active in Africa since 2017 It has provided military support, security and protection to several African governments In return, Russian and Wagner-linked companies have been given privileged access to those countries' natural resources, such as rights to gold and diamond mines, while the Russian military has been given access to strategic locations such as airbases and ports [77] [285] This has been described as a kind of state capture, whereby Russia gains influence over those states and they become dependent on it [286]\n\n\nSudan\nThe earliest reports of PMC Wagner involvement in Sudan came in 2017 [290] The PMCs were sent to Sudan to support it militarily against South Sudan and protect gold, uranium and diamond mines [291]\n\n\nCentral African Republic\nIn 2018, the Wagner Group deployed its personnel to the CAR, to protect lucrative mines, support the CAR government, and provide close protection for the president, Faustin-Archange Touadéra [298]\n\n\nLibya\nThe group's presence in Libya was first reported in October 2018, when Russian military bases had been set up in Benghazi and Tobruk in support of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who leads the Libyan National Army (LNA) The group was said to be providing training and support to Haftar's forces, and Russian missiles and SAM systems were also thought to be set up in Libya [citation needed] By early March 2019, around 300 Wagner PMCs were in Benghazi supporting Haftar, according to a British government source [306] The LNA made large advances in the country's south, capturing a number of towns in quick succession, including the city of Sabha and the El Sharara oil field, Libya's largest oil field [307] Following the southern campaign, the LNA launched an offensive against the Government of National Accord (GNA)-held capital of Tripoli, but the offensive stalled within two weeks on the outskirts of the city due to stiff resistance [308]\n\n\nMali\nIn September 2021, reports surfaced that an agreement was close to being finalized that would allow the Wagner Group to operate in Mali France, which previously ruled Mali as a colony, was making a diplomatic push to prevent the agreement being enacted Since late May 2021, Mali has been ruled by a military junta that came into power following a coup d'état [311] The United Kingdom, European Union and Ivory Coast also warned Mali not to engage in an agreement with the Wagner Group [312] [313] [314] Still, on 30 September, Mali received a shipment of four Mil Mi-17 helicopters, as well as arms and ammunition, as part of a contract agreed in December 2020 [315] [316]\n\n\nVenezuela\nIn late January 2019, Wagner PMCs were reported by Reuters to have arrived in Venezuela during the unfolding presidential crisis They were sent to provide security for President Nicolás Maduro, who was facing opposition protests as part of the socioeconomic and political crisis that had been gripping Venezuela since 2010 The leader of a local chapter of a paramilitary group of Cossacks with ties to the PMCs reported that about 400 contractors may have been in Venezuela at that point It was said that the PMCs flew in two chartered aircraft to Havana, Cuba, from where they transferred onto regular commercial flights to Venezuela [46] [321]\n\n\nPossible activities\nAmid reports in March 2023 claiming Russia was plotting the toppling of the government of Moldova, and a subsequent anti-government demonstration, the Moldovan Border Police reported it had detained and deported an alleged member of the Wagner Group at Chisinau Airport [323] [324]\n\n\nMoldova\nAmid reports in March 2023 claiming Russia was plotting the toppling of the government of Moldova, and a subsequent anti-government demonstration, the Moldovan Border Police reported it had detained and deported an alleged member of the Wagner Group at Chisinau Airport [323] [324]\n\n\nNagorno-Karabakh\nSeveral days after Russian media reported that Russian PMCs were ready to fight against Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, [325] a source within the Wagner Group, as well as Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, reported Wagner contractors were sent to support armed forces of the partially recognized Republic of Artsakh against Azerbaijan during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War as ATGM operators [326] [327] However, Bellingcat reported that the Wagner Group was not present in Nagorno-Karabakh, pointing to the Reverse Side of the Medal (RSOTM) public channel, used by Russian PMCs, including Wagner RSOTM posted two images and a song alluding to the possibility of Wagner PMCs arriving in Nagorno-Karabakh, but Bellingcat determined the images were unrelated [328]\n\n\nSerbia\nA Russian news video claiming to show Serbian \"volunteers\" being trained by the Wagner Group to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine has prompted outrage in Serbia [332] Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vučić, reacted angrily on national TV, asking why the Wagner Group would call on anyone from Serbia when it is against the country's regulations [332] It is illegal for Serbians to take part in conflicts abroad [332]\n\n\nOther\nAccording to information from leaked US intelligence findings, Wagner has sought to expand its operations into Haiti, reaching out to the embattled Haitian government with a proposal to combat gangs on behalf of the government [333]\n\n\nCasualties\nFamilies of killed PMCs are prohibited from talking to the media under a non-disclosure that is a prerequisite for them to get compensation from the company The standard compensation for the family of a killed Wagner employee is up to 5 million rubles (about 80,000 dollars), according to a Wagner official [130] In contrast, the girlfriend of a killed fighter stated the families are paid between 22,500 and 52,000 dollars depending on the killed PMC's rank and mission [368] In mid-2018, Russian military veterans urged the Russian government to acknowledge sending private military contractors to fight in Syria, in an attempt to secure financial and medical benefits for the PMCs and their families [369]\n\n\nSanctions\nPrigozhin was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury in December 2016 for Russia's involvement in the war in Ukraine, [373] [374] and by the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom in October 2020 for links to Wagner activities in Libya [375]\n\n\nPlane crash\nOn 23 August 2023, Wagner leaders Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin died in a plane crash in Tver Oblast, Russia While the cause of the crash is unknown, The Wall Street Journal cited sources within the US government as saying that the crash was likely caused by a bomb onboard or \"some other form of sabotage\" [394] Early reports suggested a missile strike, but the Journal cited three veteran aviation experts who said that the visual evidence indicates a catastrophic structural failure not attributable to a missile [395] Meduza discounted the possibility of a surface-to-air missile (SAM) strike, saying that the aircraft was flying too high to be hit by a short-range man-portable air-defense system, while a more potent medium-range SAM such as those operated by Russian forces in the area would cause much more severe and readily identifiable damage [396] The United States Department of Defense press secretary Patrick Ryder said that the Pentagon had no indication that the plane had been shot down by a SAM, calling it false information [397] [398] Experts consulted by The New York Times said that the size of the debris field—with the fuselage being found some 3 km (2 mi) from the empennage—suggests a catastrophic structural failure that could not be caused by a simple mechanical problem [399]\n\n\nFar-right elements\nVarious elements of the Wagner Group have been linked to extremism, including white supremacy and neo-Nazism [400] [401] [402] [403] Some founding members of Wagner belong to the far-right ultranationalist Russian Imperial Movement [404] Wagner's first commander, Dmitry Utkin, [145] was reportedly a neo-Nazi and had several Nazi tattoos, [405] [406] [401] [403] greeted subordinates by saying \"Heil!\", wore a Wehrmacht field cap around the unit's training grounds, and occasionally signed his name with the two lightning bolt insignia of the Nazi SS [145]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nWagner PMCs have received state awards [24] in the form of military decorations [113] and certificates signed by Russian president Putin [413] Wagner commanders Andrey Bogatov and Andrei Troshev were awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation honor for assisting in the first capture of Palmyra in March 2016 Bogatov was seriously injured during the battle Meanwhile, Alexander Kuznetsov and Dmitry Utkin had reportedly won the Order of Courage four times [109] Family members of killed PMCs also received medals from Wagner itself, with the mother of one killed fighter being given two medals, one for \"heroism and valour\" and the other for \"blood and bravery\" [414] A medal for conducting operations in Syria was also issued by Wagner to its PMCs [415]\n\n\nPost Yevgeny Prigozhin's death\nOn 11 September 2023, Russian media reported that the National Guard, Rosgvardia, had begun recruiting former convicts who served in Ukraine as members of the Wagner Group [431]\n\n\nNationalization of Wagner Group\nOn 13 November 2023, it was reported that four former inmates who fought for the Wagner Group in eastern Ukraine, have been receiving calls and text messages offering them military contracts Three of the veterans reported that specifically Rosgvardia was trying to recruit them A text message said: \"Wagner is officially becoming a unit of Rosgvardia...The entire structure, methods of work and commanders remain the same.\" Other reports indicate that former Wagner fighters have joined Chechen Akhmat units, whilst still wearing Wagner patches [435]\n\n\nNotable

It was first contested in 2000 as a competition between the champions of each of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's national league champions.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe first club tournament to be billed as the Football World Championship was held in 1887, in which FA Cup winners Aston Villa beat Scottish Cup winners Hibernian, the winners of the only national competitions at the time. The first time when the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3. Ironically, the Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship consisted entirely of Scottish players – Scottish players who moved to England to play professionally in those days were known as the Scotch Professors.\n\nOrigin\n--------\n\nThe idea of a club world championship was first proposed by FIFA in 1960, but it wasn't until the 1990s that the competition began to take shape. In 1997, FIFA invited the six continental confederations to send their champions to a tournament in Saudi Arabia, which would become the first Club World Cup.\n\nInauguration (2000–2001)\n------------------------\n\nThe inaugural tournament was held in Brazil in 2000, with the hosts being Real Madrid. The competition was a huge success, with over 500,000 fans attending the matches. The tournament was won by Real Madrid, who defeated Corinthians 1–0 in the final.\n\nKnock-out tournaments (2005–present)\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe first knock-out tournament was held in 2005, with the reigning champions receiving a bye to the semi-finals. The tournament was won by São Paulo, who defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the final. The 2005 edition saw the introduction of a new trophy, the Toyota Trophy.\n\nExpansion\n----------\n\nIn 2016, FIFA President Gianni Infantino suggested an expansion of the Club World Cup to 32 teams beginning in 2019. However, this proposal was met with opposition from the UEFA and CONMEBOL, who argued that it would damage the existing continental competitions. In 2017, FIFA discussed proposals to expand the competition to 24 teams and have it be played every four years by 2021, replacing the FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\nResults\n--------\n\nThe tournament has been dominated by European and South American teams, with only a handful of teams from other confederations reaching the final. The African teams that have reached the final include TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Moroccan club Raja CA. The Asian teams that have reached the final include Kashima Antlers from Japan, Al-Ain from the United Arab Emirates and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia. The North American team that has reached the final includes Mexican team Tigres UANL.\n\nFinals\n--------\n\nThe final is played between the winners of the semi-finals, with the winner being crowned the champion. The final is played in a single match, with extra time and penalties if necessary.\n\nPerformances by club\n-------------------\n\nThe clubs that have performed well in the tournament include the European and South American teams. Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United have all won the tournament multiple times. São Paulo and Corinthians have also performed well, reaching the final on multiple occasions.\n\nPerformances by country\n----------------------\n\nThe countries that have performed well in the tournament include the European and South American countries. Spain, Germany, and Italy have all won the tournament multiple times. Brazil and Argentina have also performed well, reaching the final on multiple occasions.\n\nPerformances by confederation\n-----------------------------\n\nThe confederations that have performed well in the tournament include the UEFA and CONMEBOL. The UEFA has won the tournament 14 times, while the CONMEBOL has won 10 times.\n\nFormat and rules\n-----------------\n\nThe tournament is played in a knock-out format, with the reigning champions receiving a bye to the semi-finals. The teams are drawn into groups of four, with the winners advancing to the semi-finals. The semi-finals are played as single matches, with the winners advancing to the final.\n\nTrophy\n------\n\nThe trophy used during the inaugural competition was called the FIFA Club World Championship Cup. The original trophy was created by Sawaya & Moroni, an Italian designer company that produces contemporary designs with cultural backgrounds and design concepts.\n\nAwards\n------\n\nAt the end of each Club World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. The current awards include the Golden Ball, Golden Boot, and Golden Glove.\n\nPrize money\n------------\n\nThe 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was the inaugural edition of this competition; it provided US$28 million in prize money for its participants. The prize money received by the clubs participating was divided into fixed payments based on participation and results.\n\nSponsorship\n------------\n\nThe FIFA Club World Cup has several sponsors, including Toyota Motor Corporation, a Japanese multinational automaker headquartered in Toyota, Aichi. The tournament also has several other sponsors, including Budweiser, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's.\n\nRecords and statistics\n------------------------\n\nThe tournament has several records and statistics, including the most titles won by a player, the overall top scorer, and the most appearances in the competition.\n\nOfficial songs\n--------------\n\nThe FIFA Club World Cup has featured official songs for each tournament since 2005.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nThe tournament has received differing reception since its inception in 2000. In most of Europe, it struggles to find broad media attention compared to the UEFA Champions League and commonly lacks recognition as a high-ranking contest. In South America, however, it is widely considered the highest point in the career of a footballer, coach and/or team at international club level.\n\nList of current broadcasters\n---------------------------\n\nThe FIFA Club World Cup is broadcast in several countries around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Brazil.\n\nSee also\n---------\n\n* FIFA Club World Cup records and statistics\n* List of FIFA Club World Cup finals\n* List of FIFA Club World Cup winners\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* \"FIFA Club World Cup\".

He is widely regarded as one of the most popular and beloved children's authors of all time, with over 60 books published under his name and more than 600 million copies sold worldwide.\n\n# Life and Career\n\nTheodor Geisel was born on March 2, 1904, in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Theodor Robert Geisel and Henrietta Seuss Geisel. His father was a brewmaster and later became a park superintendent, while his mother was a homemaker. Geisel's early life was marked by a strong sense of imagination and creativity, which would later become the hallmark of his writing and illustration style.\n\nGeisel's family was of Jewish descent, but he was raised as a Missouri Synod Lutheran. He attended Dartmouth College, where he became a member of the humor magazine The Jack-O-Lantern, and later transferred to Oxford University, where he studied English literature. However, he dropped out of Oxford without graduating and returned to the United States in 1927.\n\n# Early Years\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Geisel began to pursue a career in writing and illustration. He submitted his work to various magazines and book publishers, and his first nationally published cartoon appeared in The Saturday Evening Post in 1927. He later accepted a job as a writer and illustrator at the humor magazine Judge, where he began to develop his signature style and voice.\n\nGeisel's early work was marked by a sense of humor and satire, which would become a hallmark of his later writing. He was particularly interested in politics and social issues, and his cartoons often reflected his progressive views. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Geisel's work gained popularity, and he began to establish himself as a prominent figure in the world of children's literature.\n\n# World War II-Era Work\n\nAs World War II began, Geisel turned to political cartoons, drawing over 400 in two years as editorial cartoonist for the left-leaning New York City daily newspaper, PM. His cartoons were highly critical of fascist leaders such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, and he denounced the racist attitudes that were prevalent in the United States at the time. Geisel's cartoons were widely praised for their wit and satire, and he became one of the most prominent cartoonists of the war era.\n\n# Later Years\n\nAfter the war, Geisel and his wife, Helen, moved to the La Jolla community of San Diego, California, where he returned to writing children's books. He published most of his books through Random House in North America and William Collins, Sons (later HarperCollins) internationally. Geisel wrote many beloved classics, including \"The Cat in the Hat,\" \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal.\n\n# Style\n\nGeisel's writing and illustration style was characterized by his use of anapestic tetrameter, a poetic meter that was employed by many poets of the English literary canon. He was known for his whimsical and imaginative illustrations, which often featured made-up words and phrases. Geisel's style was highly influential, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important children's authors of the 20th century.\n\n# Political Views\n\nGeisel was a liberal Democrat and a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. His early political cartoons show a passionate opposition to fascism, and he urged action against it both before and after the United States entered World War II. Geisel's cartoons portrayed the fear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the House Committee on Un-American Activities and those who threatened to cut the United States' \"life line\" to the USSR and Stalin.\n\n# In His Children's Books\n\nGeisel made a point of not beginning to write his stories with a moral in mind, stating that \"kids can see a moral coming a mile off.\" He was not against writing about issues, however; he said that \"there's an inherent moral in any story,\" and he remarked that he was \"subversive as hell.\" Many of his stories dealt with social issues, such as racism, sexism, and environmentalism.\n\n# Retired Books\n\nIn 2021, Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced that it would stop publishing and licensing six books, including \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,\" \"If I Ran the Zoo,\" \"McElligot's Pool,\" \"On Beyond Zebra!,\" \"Scrambled Eggs Super!\", and \"The Cat's Quizzer.\" The organization stated that the books \"portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong\" and are no longer being published.\n\n# Artwork\n\nGeisel's early artwork often employed the shaded texture of pencil drawings or watercolors, but in his children's books of the post-war period, he generally made use of a starker medium—pen and ink—normally using just black, white, and one or two colors. His later books, such as \"The Lorax,\" used more colors.\n\n# Adaptations\n\nFor most of his career, Geisel was reluctant to have his characters marketed in contexts outside of his own books. However, he did permit the creation of several animated cartoons, an art form in which he had gained experience during World War II, and he gradually relaxed his policy as he aged.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nGeisel wrote more than 60 books over the course of his long career.

(1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960) He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): McElligot's Pool (1947), Bartholomew and the Oobleck (1949), and If I Ran the Zoo (1950) Dr Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr T., which was released in 1953 The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film [citation needed] During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in Redbook magazine Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as The Sneetches and Other Stories) or reworked into independent books (If I Ran the Zoo) A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.\n\n\nIllness, death, and posthumous honors\nGeisel died of cancer on September 24, 1991, at his home in the La Jolla community of San Diego at the age of 87 [21] [64] His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean On December 1, 1995, four years after his death, University of California, San Diego's University Library Building was renamed Geisel Library in honor of Geisel and Audrey for the generous contributions that they made to the library and their devotion to improving literacy [65]\n\n\nPen names\nGeisel's most famous pen name is regularly pronounced /suːs/, [3] an anglicized pronunciation of his German name (the standard German pronunciation is German pronunciation:  [ˈzɔʏ̯s]) He himself noted that it rhymed with \"voice\" (his own pronunciation being /sɔɪs/) Alexander Laing, one of his collaborators on the Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, [72] wrote of it:\n\n\nPolitical views\nGeisel was a liberal Democrat and a supporter of President Franklin D Roosevelt and the New Deal [78] His early political cartoons show a passionate opposition to fascism, and he urged action against it both before and after the U.S entered World War II [79] His cartoons portrayed the fear of communism as overstated, finding greater threats in the House Committee on Unamerican Activities and those who threatened to cut the U.S.'s \"life line\" [48] to the USSR and Stalin, whom he once depicted as a porter carrying \"our war load\" [47]\n\n\nIn his children's books\nGeisel made a point of not beginning to write his stories with a moral in mind, stating that \"kids can see a moral coming a mile off.\" He was not against writing about issues, however; he said that \"there's an inherent moral in any story\", [88] and he remarked that he was \"subversive as hell.\" [89]\n\n\nRetired books\nSeuss's work for children has been criticized for unconscious racist themes [91] Dr Seuss Enterprises, the organization that owns the rights to the books, films, TV shows, stage productions, exhibitions, digital media, licensed merchandise, and other strategic partnerships, announced on March 2, 2021, that it will stop publishing and licensing six books The publications include And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937), If I Ran the Zoo (1950), McElligot's Pool (1947), On Beyond Zebra!
