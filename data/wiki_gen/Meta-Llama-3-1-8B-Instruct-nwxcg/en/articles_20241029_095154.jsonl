However, the representation of women's sexuality has often been subject to censorship and scrutiny.\n\n### Fear of Entering Cinematography\n\nDespite the progress made, women continue to face barriers and stereotypes in the film industry. Many women report facing sexism, harassment, and marginalization, which can make it difficult for them to pursue careers in cinematography.\n\n### Statistics\n\nAccording to a 2020 report, women make up only 32% of the film industry workforce in the United States, with women of color making up only 5%. These statistics highlight the continued underrepresentation of women in the industry.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nDocumentaries have played a crucial role in highlighting the experiences and achievements of women in film. Films like \"The Celluloid Ceiling\" (2013) and \"She Fights Back\" (2015) have shed light on the struggles women face in the industry.\n\n#### Female Filmmakers as Feminists\n\nMany women filmmakers have used their work to explore feminist themes and ideas. Films like \"The Hurt Locker\" (2008) and \"Winter's Bone\" (2010) have gained critical acclaim for their portrayal of strong female characters and feminist themes.\n\n### Celluloid Ceiling\n\nThe celluloid ceiling refers to the invisible barriers that prevent women from achieving success in the film industry.

SVB, a commercial bank headquartered in Santa Clara, California, was a key lender to the technology industry, particularly to startup companies in Silicon Valley. The bank's collapse sent shockwaves throughout the financial system, affecting not only its customers but also the broader economy.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 with a focus on serving the financial needs of technology companies. Over the years, the bank grew rapidly, expanding its services to include corporate banking, private banking, and asset management. By 2022, SVB had become one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets. The bank's success was attributed to its expertise in serving the needs of technology companies, particularly startups, which were increasingly reliant on SVB's services.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank occurred in March 2023, when the bank announced that it had lost $1.8 billion in value due to a decline in the value of its investment portfolio. The bank's investment portfolio consisted largely of mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income securities, which had declined in value due to rising interest rates. This led to a significant decline in the bank's stock price, which further eroded its capital base.\n\n**Losses**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank resulted in significant losses for the bank's shareholders, who saw their investment decline by over 90% in a matter of weeks. The bank's stock price plummeted, and its market capitalization fell to near zero. The bank's customers also faced significant disruptions, as their deposits were frozen and they were unable to access their accounts.\n\n**Instability**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sent shockwaves throughout the financial system, leading to increased instability and uncertainty. The bank's failure raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole, and there were fears that other banks could also fail. This led to a significant increase in deposit outflows, as customers rushed to withdraw their funds from other banks.\n\n**Receivership**\n\nIn an effort to stabilize the financial system, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) placed Silicon Valley Bank into receivership on March 10, 2023. The DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver, which took over the bank's operations and assets. The FDIC assumed responsibility for managing the bank's deposits and ensuring that customers' funds were protected.\n\n**Acquisition**\n\nOn March 12, 2023, the FDIC announced that it had reached an agreement with First Republic Bank to acquire the deposits and certain assets of Silicon Valley Bank. The acquisition was valued at $16.5 billion, and it marked the largest bank acquisition in U.S. history. The acquisition was seen as a positive development, as it helped to stabilize the financial system and ensured that Silicon Valley Bank's customers would continue to have access to their funds.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n**Customers**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank had a significant impact on its customers, who were left without access to their funds. The bank's customers were forced to seek alternative banking relationships, and many were left to wonder if their deposits were safe. The collapse also raised concerns about the stability of the banking system, as customers began to question the safety of their deposits at other banks.\n\n**Shareholders**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was a significant blow to its shareholders, who saw their investment decline by over 90% in a matter of weeks. The bank's shareholders were left with significant losses, and many were left to wonder if they had invested in a stable and secure institution.\n\n**Financial system**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sent shockwaves throughout the financial system, leading to increased instability and uncertainty. The bank's failure raised concerns about the stability of the banking system as a whole, and there were fears that other banks could also fail. This led to a significant increase in deposit outflows, as customers rushed to withdraw their funds from other banks.\n\n**Legal actions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has led to several legal actions, including lawsuits against the bank's former executives and directors. The lawsuits claim that the bank's executives and directors failed to adequately manage the bank's risk and failed to disclose the true nature of the bank's financial condition. The lawsuits also claim that the bank's executives and directors engaged in insider trading and other forms of misconduct.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sparked a range of reactions, including official responses, debate over government intervention, and debate about the causes of the bank's failure.\n\n**Official responses**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sparked a range of official responses, including statements from regulators, politicians, and other government officials. The FDIC has stated that it is committed to ensuring that the bank's customers are protected and that the bank's failure does not have a wider impact on the financial system. The Federal Reserve has also stated that it is working to ensure that the bank's failure does not have a wider impact on the financial system.\n\n**Debate over government intervention**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sparked a debate over the extent to which government intervention can prevent bank failures. Some argue that government intervention is necessary to prevent bank failures and to ensure the stability of the financial system. Others argue that government intervention can create moral hazard and can lead to a culture of risk-taking among banks.\n\n**Debate about causes**\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has sparked a debate about the causes of the bank's failure. Some argue that the bank's failure was caused by a combination of factors, including the bank's aggressive lending practices, its exposure to the technology sector, and its failure to adequately manage its risk. Others argue that the bank's failure was caused by a lack of oversight and regulation, and that the bank's executives and directors were aware of the risks but failed to take adequate action.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Banking crisis\n* Financial crisis\n* Silicon Valley\n* Technology industry\n* Bank failure\n* FDIC\n* Federal Reserve\n\nNote: This article is a comprehensive overview of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and its effects on the financial system.

The blockade has been in place since 1989, with varying levels of intensity, and has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\n**Background**\n\n### First Blockade (1989–2023) and Isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n\nThe first blockade began in 1989, following a series of conflicts between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade was initially imposed by Azerbaijan to restrict the movement of people and goods between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The isolation from Armenia lasted until 1992, when Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh established a land corridor, known as the Lachin Corridor, to facilitate trade and communication.\n\n### Threats to Public Utility Infrastructure and Entry\n\nIn recent years, Azerbaijan has intensified its blockade efforts, threatening to cut off public utility infrastructure, such as electricity and water, to Nagorno-Karabakh. The blockade has also restricted the entry of essential goods, including food, medicine, and fuel, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn 2022, tensions escalated between Azerbaijan and Armenia, with Azerbaijan announcing plans to establish a \"green zone\" around Nagorno-Karabakh, which would have restricted access to the territory. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh strongly opposed the plan, fearing it would compromise their control over the territory.\n\n**Blockade Timeline**\n\n### 2022 Events\n\nIn March 2022, Azerbaijan announced a 30-day blockade of the Lachin Corridor, citing environmental concerns. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh rejected the claims, accusing Azerbaijan of using the blockade as a pretext to exert pressure on the territory. Despite international pressure, the blockade remained in place, and the humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to deteriorate.\n\n### 2023 Events\n\nIn January 2023, Azerbaijan announced plans to establish a \"protest zone\" around Nagorno-Karabakh, which would have restricted access to the territory. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh condemned the move, accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to strangle the territory economically and militarily.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis**\n\nThe blockade has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, with limited access to essential supplies and medical care. The lack of access to basic necessities has led to a rise in poverty, malnutrition, and mortality rates.\n\n### Lack of Access to Supplies and Medical Care\n\nNagorno-Karabakh relies heavily on imports from Armenia, which are restricted by the blockade. The territory has limited resources to produce its own food, medicine, and fuel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blockade_of_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##First blockade (1989–2023) and isolation from Armenia (1989–1992)\n##Threats to public utility infrastructure and entry\n##Prelude\n#Blockade timeline\n##2022 events\n##2023 events\n#Humanitarian crisis\n##Lack of access to supplies and medical care\n###Limited supplies transported by the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers\n##Damage to infrastructure\n#Genocide risk factors\n#Inaction of the Russian peacekeepers\n#Proposed solutions\n#Authenticity of the environmental activism claims\n##Involvement of the Azerbaijani government\n##Involvement of state employees and civil servants\n##Inaccessibility of Nagorno-Karabakh to the public and independent journalists\n##Scrutiny of the \"protesters\" and their alleged environmental concerns\n#Lawsuits\n##International Court of Justice\n##European Court of Human Rights\n#Reactions\n##Involved parties\n##International\n##Supranational\n##Non-governmental organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the largest of all the bears and is well adapted to the harsh, cold environment of the Arctic tundra.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, translates to \"sea bear\" in Latin. This name refers to the bear's ability to hunt and feed in the water. The Inuit people, who have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years, call the polar bear \"nanook,\" which means \"to hunt.\"\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe polar bear is a member of the Ursidae family, which includes several other bear species. It is closely related to the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis). The polar bear is thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe evolution of the polar bear is closely tied to the evolution of the sea ice in the Arctic. During the Pleistocene era, the sea ice expanded and contracted over the course of the year, allowing the bears to hunt and feed on seals and other marine mammals. Over time, the bears adapted to this environment, developing white fur and a layer of blubber to keep warm. They also developed larger feet and a more streamlined body shape to enable them to swim and hunt in the water.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe polar bear is a large animal, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). The bear's fur is white and transparent, allowing it to blend in with the snow and ice of its Arctic habitat. The fur is also highly insulating, helping to keep the bear warm in temperatures as low as -34°F (-36°C). The bear's eyes are blue or gray, and its ears are small and rounded.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic region, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. The bear's range is limited to areas with sea ice, as it is a necessary component of the bear's diet and habitat. The bear is well adapted to the harsh, cold environment of the Arctic tundra, where it can be found on both land and sea.\n\n**Behaviour and Ecology**\n\n**Social Life**\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, but they will occasionally come together to mate or to feed on a large carcass. In the wild, the bears are not as social as some other bear species, such as the black bear (Ursus americanus), which is often found in small family groups.\n\n**Diet and Hunting**\n\nThe polar bear is a carnivorous animal, and its diet consists mainly of seals and other marine mammals. The bear will also eat fish, birds, and other small animals when available. In the summer, the bear will occasionally raid the caches of other animals, such as arctic foxes and wolverines.\n\n**Reproduction and Development**\n\nPolar bears typically breed in the spring, when the sea ice is melting and the bears are coming out of their winter dens. The female bear will give birth to one or two cubs, which will be born blind and helpless. The cubs will nurse for several months and then begin to eat solid food, eventually leaving their mother at around two years of age.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nPolar bears are vulnerable to various threats, including climate change, habitat loss, and human-caused mortality. Climate change is causing the sea ice to melt earlier and earlier, reducing the bear's access to its primary source of food and habitat. The bears are also being hunted by humans, primarily for their fur and body parts, which are used in traditional medicine.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nThe polar bear is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the decline in its sea ice habitat and the resulting impact on its diet and population. The bear is also protected by international law, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\n\n**Relationship with Humans**\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nPolar bears have been exploited by humans for centuries, primarily for their fur and body parts. The bear's fur is highly valued for its quality and durability, and the bear's body parts are used in traditional medicine. The exploitation of the bear has had a significant impact on its population, and it is now protected by law.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nPolar bears and humans have come into conflict in various parts of the Arctic, particularly in areas where the bears are being hunted or where they are encroaching on human settlements. The bears are also being impacted by climate change, which is causing them to move into areas that were previously uninhabitable.\n\n**Captivity**\n\nPolar bears are occasionally kept in captivity, primarily in zoos and wildlife parks. However, the keeping of polar bears in captivity is a complex issue, as the bears have complex social and spatial needs that are difficult to replicate in a zoo setting.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nThe polar bear has significant cultural and symbolic value in many Arctic cultures. The bear is often seen as a symbol of strength and resilience, and is revered for its ability to thrive in one of the harshest environments on Earth.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Polar_bear\" following this outline:\n\n#Naming\n#Taxonomy\n##Evolution\n#Characteristics\n#Distribution and habitat\n#Behaviour and ecology\n##Social life\n##Diet and hunting\n##Reproduction and development\n##Mortality\n#Conservation status\n#Relationship with humans\n##Exploitation\n##Conflicts\n##Captivity\n##Cultural significance\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important figures of the Western philosophical tradition, and his works had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of logic, metaphysics, and ethics.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBoethius was born in Rome, Italy, around 480 CE, into a noble family that had produced several prominent figures in Roman politics and society. His parents, Manlius Boethius and Rusticiana, were members of the Anicius family, a powerful and influential clan in Rome. Boethius's early life and education were marked by a deep interest in philosophy, literature, and theology, which would shape his thought and writings throughout his life.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBoethius's early life is not well documented, but it is known that he received a thorough education in the classical liberal arts, including grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the works of Aristotle and Plato, which would become a significant influence on his own philosophical thought. Boethius's family connections and his own intellectual abilities likely facilitated his entry into the Roman Senate, where he served as a consul, prefect of Rome, and magister officiorum (master of offices).\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius's rise to power was facilitated by his family connections and his own intellectual abilities. He was appointed to several high-ranking positions in the Roman government, including consul in 510 CE, prefect of Rome in 522 CE, and magister officiorum in 522 CE. During this period, Boethius became closely associated with the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, who ruled over Italy and much of the Western Roman Empire. Theodoric, who was a patron of the arts and sciences, saw Boethius as a valuable advisor and intellectual partner.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius's downfall and death were the result of a complex series of events. In 523 CE, Theodoric became suspicious of Boethius's loyalty and accused him of treason. Boethius was arrested, imprisoned, and eventually executed, likely in 524 CE. The exact circumstances of his death are not known, but it is believed that he was strangled or beheaded.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius's major works include:\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae**\n\nDe consolatione philosophiae (The Consolation of Philosophy) is a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of wisdom, happiness, and the human condition. Written during Boethius's imprisonment, the work is a dialogue between Boethius and the personification of Philosophy, who seeks to console Boethius and guide him towards wisdom. The treatise is divided into five books, which examine the nature of fortune, the nature of good and evil, the nature of the human soul, and the nature of ultimate reality.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis**\n\nDe topicis differentiis (On Topics) is a logic textbook that explores the nature of argumentation and reasoning. The work is a systematic treatment of the principles of logic, including the nature of syllogisms, the nature of inference, and the nature of fallacies.\n\n### **De arithmetica**\n\nDe arithmetica (On Arithmetic) is a mathematical treatise that explores the nature of arithmetic and mathematical reasoning. The work is a systematic treatment of arithmetic, including the nature of numbers, the nature of algebraic operations, and the nature of mathematical proof.\n\n### **De institutione musica**\n\nDe institutione musica (On the Institution of Music) is a musical treatise that explores the nature of music and musical theory. The work is a systematic treatment of music, including the nature of sound, the nature of rhythm, and the nature of harmony.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra**\n\nOpuscula sacra (Sacred Works) is a collection of theological writings that explore the nature of God, the nature of the soul, and the nature of ultimate reality. The work is a systematic treatment of Christian theology, including the nature of the Trinity, the nature of the Incarnation, and the nature of redemption.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nThe dates of Boethius's works are not well established, but it is believed that he wrote De consolatione philosophiae during his imprisonment in 523-524 CE. De topicis differentiis is believed to have been written earlier, around 500-510 CE. De arithmetica and De institutione musica are believed to have been written during the same period as De consolatione philosophiae, around 523-524 CE. Opuscula sacra is believed to have been written later, around 525-530 CE.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is considered one of the most important figures of the Western philosophical tradition, and his works had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of logic, metaphysics, and ethics. His works were widely studied and translated throughout the Middle Ages, and his ideas continued to influence philosophers and theologians throughout the centuries.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23. He is also revered as a patron saint of philosophers and students.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius has been the subject of numerous literary and artistic works throughout the centuries. His life and works have been the inspiration for numerous novels, plays, and films, including the famous novel \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" by Chaucer.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Anicius family\n* Roman Senate\n* Ostrogothic Kingdom\n* Theodoric the Great\n* Aristotle\n* Plato\n* Christian theology\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The exact dates of Boethius's life and works are not well established.\n* The nature of Boethius's relationship with Theodoric the Great is complex and multifaceted.\n* The exact circumstances of Boethius's death are not known.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ \"Boethius\" by J.M.

It is a conversational AI designed to engage in free-flowing conversations with humans, answering questions, providing information, and even creating text on a given topic. Since its release, ChatGPT has gained significant attention and has been widely used in various applications, including academic research, coding, computer security, economics, education, culture, and financial markets.\n\n**Training**\n\nChatGPT is a variant of the GPT-3.5 model, which was trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet. The model was trained using a technique called masked language modeling, where a portion of the input text is masked and the model is trained to predict the missing words. This training process allows the model to learn patterns and relationships in language, enabling it to generate coherent and context-specific text.\n\nThe training data for ChatGPT includes a wide range of sources, including books, articles, and websites. The model is also trained on user interactions, allowing it to learn from the conversations it has with users and adapt to their needs and preferences.\n\n**Features and limitations**\n\n### Features\n\nChatGPT has several features that make it a powerful conversational AI:\n\n* **Conversational flow**: ChatGPT can engage in free-flowing conversations, allowing users to ask questions, provide context, and receive responses that are relevant and coherent.\n* **Knowledge base**: ChatGPT has access to a vast knowledge base of information, including facts, concepts, and relationships.\n* **Creativity**: ChatGPT can generate text on a given topic, including stories, dialogues, and even entire scripts.\n* **Emotional intelligence**: ChatGPT can recognize and respond to emotional cues, allowing it to provide empathetic and supportive responses.\n\n### Limitations\n\nWhile ChatGPT has many features and capabilities, it also has several limitations:\n\n* **Jailbreaking**: ChatGPT can be \"jailbroken\" by users who attempt to bypass its safety features, allowing them to access sensitive information or engage in malicious activities.\n* **Biased responses**: ChatGPT can generate responses that reflect the biases and prejudices of the training data, potentially leading to discriminatory or discriminatory responses.\n* **Limited contextual understanding**: ChatGPT may struggle to understand the context of a conversation or topic, leading to responses that are off-topic or irrelevant.\n\n**Service**\n\nChatGPT is available as a web-based service, allowing users to interact with the model through a chat interface. The service is free to use, but users can upgrade to a paid subscription, called ChatGPT Plus, for additional features and support.\n\n### ChatGPT Plus\n\nChatGPT Plus offers several features that are not available to free users, including:\n\n* **Priority access**: Users who subscribe to ChatGPT Plus get priority access to the model, allowing them to use it more efficiently and effectively.\n* **Advanced features**: ChatGPT Plus includes advanced features, such as the ability to create custom models and access to specialized tools and resources.\n\n### Mobile app\n\nChatGPT is also available as a mobile app, allowing users to interact with the model on-the-go. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices.\n\n### Software development support\n\nChatGPT provides software development support, allowing developers to integrate the model into their own applications and services. This support includes documentation, APIs, and sample code.\n\n### March 2023 security breach\n\nIn March 2023, OpenAI announced a security breach that affected ChatGPT and other OpenAI services. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in the model's safety features, which allowed malicious actors to access sensitive information and engage in malicious activities.\n\n### Languages\n\nChatGPT is available in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and many others.\n\n### GPT Store\n\nThe GPT Store is an online marketplace where users can purchase and download custom models and tools, including ChatGPT.\n\n### GPT-4\n\nGPT-4 is a newer model developed by OpenAI, which has several improvements over ChatGPT, including better contextual understanding and more accurate responses.\n\n### GPT-4o\n\nGPT-4o is an optimized version of GPT-4, which is designed for large-scale applications and services.\n\n### o1\n\no1 is a model that is designed for specific tasks and applications, such as text classification and sentiment analysis.\n\n**Model versions**\n\nChatGPT has undergone several updates and improvements since its release, including:\n\n* **ChatGPT 1.0**: The initial version of the model, which was released in 2022.\n* **ChatGPT 2.0**: An updated version of the model, which was released in 2023.\n* **ChatGPT 3.0**: A newer version of the model, which was released in 2023 and includes several improvements over the previous version.\n\n**Reception**\n\nChatGPT has received widespread attention and acclaim since its release, with many praising its capabilities and potential applications.

With a rich history dating back to the 9th century, Ukraine has been a hub of cultural, economic, and political activity for centuries. From its early days as a medieval state to its current status as an independent nation, Ukraine has undergone numerous transformations, shaping its unique identity and culture.\n\n**Etymology and Orthography**\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Ukrainian word \"ukrayina,\" meaning \"borderland\" or \"edge.\" This refers to the country's strategic location on the edge of Europe and its historical role as a border zone between various empires and civilizations.

This architectural style is characterized by a classical design that emphasizes proportion, symmetry, and the use of columns, arches, and domes. Palladian architecture has had a profound influence on Western architecture, particularly in the English-speaking world, and continues to be a popular style for buildings to this day.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio (1508-1580) was a Venetian architect who is widely regarded as one of the most influential architects in history. Born in Vicenza, Italy, Palladio trained as a stonemason and later became an apprentice to the architect Giangiorgio Trissino. In 1556, Palladio published his most famous work, \"I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura\" (The Four Books of Architecture), which became a seminal text in the history of architectural design. Palladio's architecture was heavily influenced by the classical styles of ancient Rome and Greece, and he sought to revive and reinterpret these styles for the modern era.\n\nPalladio's buildings are characterized by their use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, which are often arranged in a symmetrical and harmonious composition. His designs also emphasize the use of proportion, with a focus on the golden ratio and other mathematical principles. Some of Palladio's most famous buildings include the Villa Capra in Vicenza, the Villa Foscari in Malcontenta, and the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nVenetian windows, also known as palladian windows, are a type of window design that originated in the 16th-century Venice. These windows are characterized by a series of arches or columns that are arranged in a symmetrical composition. The Venetian window is typically a three-part window, consisting of a central arch or column flanked by two smaller arches or columns. This design was popularized by Palladio and became a hallmark of Palladian architecture.\n\nThe Venetian window was designed to provide a sense of grandeur and elegance, and was often used in large buildings, such as palaces and churches. The design was also influenced by the classical styles of ancient Rome and Greece, and was often used to evoke a sense of classical grandeur. In modern times, the Venetian window has been adapted and modified, and is often used in a variety of architectural styles.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nPalladianism was first introduced to England in the 17th-century, where it became a popular architectural style among the English aristocracy.

The style was often used in country houses and estates, where it was used to create a sense of grandeur and elegance.\n\nSome of the earliest examples of Palladianism in England include the designs of Inigo Jones, who was influenced by Palladio's work and sought to adapt it to the English context. Jones' designs often featured classical elements, such as columns and arches, and were arranged in a symmetrical composition. Other examples of early Palladianism in England include the designs of Christopher Wren, who was influenced by Palladio's work and used it in his designs for churches and other buildings.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism emerged in the 18th-century, as a reaction against the more ornate and elaborate architectural styles of the Baroque and Rococo periods. Neo-Palladianism sought to revive the classical styles of ancient Rome and Greece, and was characterized by a focus on simplicity, proportion, and symmetry. The style was often used in country houses and estates, where it was used to create a sense of grandeur and elegance.\n\nSome of the most famous examples of Neo-Palladianism include the designs of Robert Adam, who was influenced by Palladio's work and sought to adapt it to the English context. Adam's designs often featured classical elements, such as columns and arches, and were arranged in a symmetrical composition. Other examples of Neo-Palladianism include the designs of Thomas Chaytor, who used the style in his designs for country houses and estates.\n\n**English Palladian Architecture**\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture is a style of building design that originated in the 17th-century England and was popularized by the English architect Inigo Jones. This architectural style is characterized by a classical design that emphasizes proportion, symmetry, and the use of columns, arches, and domes.\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by the classical styles of ancient Rome and Greece, and sought to revive and reinterpret these styles for the modern era.

Some of the most famous examples of Irish Palladian architecture include the designs of James Hoban, who used the style in his designs for country houses and estates.\n\n**North American Palladian Architecture**\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture is a style of building design that originated in the 18th-century North America and was popularized by the American architect Thomas Jefferson. This architectural style is characterized by a classical design that emphasizes proportion, symmetry, and the use of columns, arches, and domes.\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was heavily influenced by the classical styles of ancient Rome and Greece, and sought to revive and reinterpret these styles for the modern era.

Some of the most famous examples of North American Palladian architecture include the designs of Thomas Jefferson, who used the style in his designs for country houses and estates.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism has also been influential in other parts of the world, including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In these countries, Palladianism was often used in country houses and estates, where it was used to create a sense of grandeur and elegance.\n\nIn Australia, Palladianism was popularized by the Australian architect John Verge, who was influenced by Palladio's work and sought to adapt it to the Australian context. Verge's designs often featured classical elements, such as columns and arches, and were arranged in a symmetrical composition.\n\nIn New Zealand, Palladianism was popularized by the New Zealand architect Francis Petre, who was influenced by Palladio's work and sought to adapt it to the New Zealand context.

The club was founded in 1889 and currently plays in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\n\n**History**\n\n#### **Formation and early years (1889–1925)**\n\nBath City F.C. was founded in 1889 by a group of local businessmen and football enthusiasts. The club was initially known as Bath Football Club and played their early matches at the North Parade Ground. In 1895, the club changed its name to Bath City Football Club and began to establish a strong following in the city. During this period, the club played in various local and regional leagues, including the Somerset County Football Association and the Western League.\n\n#### **Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)**\n\nIn the 1920s, Bath City F.C. started to attract larger crowds and gained a reputation as a top-flight club in the region. The club's attendance figures increased significantly, with the average attendance rising from around 2,000 in the early 1920s to over 10,000 by the mid-1930s. Despite their success, the club consistently missed out on promotion to the Football League, finishing as runners-up on several occasions.\n\n#### **Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)**\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Bath City F.C. experienced a period of glory, winning the Southern League championship in 1958 and finishing as runners-up in the following season. However, the club's fortunes declined in the 1970s and 1980s, with repeated relegations and promotions. During this period, the club played in various regional and national leagues, including the Alliance Premier League, which later became the Conference National.\n\n#### **Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)**\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Bath City F.C. continued to experience financial difficulties and struggled to maintain their place in the non-league system. The club was relegated from the Conference National to the Conference South in 2007 and subsequently dropped to the Conference South's successor, the National League South, in 2015. The club's decline was marked by repeated changes in management and a significant reduction in attendance figures.\n\n#### **The Gill Era (2017–present)**\n\nIn 2017, James Gill was appointed as the new chairman of Bath City F.C. Gill's tenure has been marked by significant investment in the club, including the appointment of a new manager and the introduction of a new playing squad. Under Gill's leadership, the club has begun to rebuild and restore its reputation as a top-flight club in the region.\n\n**Badge**\n\nBath City F.C.'s current badge features a crown, a football, and the club's initials. The badge is a nod to the club's rich history and its status as a top-flight club in the region.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\n#### **1889: The North Parade Ground**\n\nBath City F.C. was founded in 1889 and played their early matches at the North Parade Ground, a small public park in the heart of the city.\n\n#### **1900–1919: Belvoir Castle**\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, a large public park located on the outskirts of the city. The castle featured a large sports ground, which was used for football, cricket, and other sports.\n\n#### **1919–1932: Lambridge**\n\nIn 1919, Bath City F.C. moved to Lambridge, a small village located just outside the city. The club played at Lambridge for over a decade, before relocating to Twerton Park in 1932.\n\n#### **1932–present: Twerton Park**\n\nTwerton Park is the current home of Bath City F.C.

He was the eldest son of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece.\n\n**Early Life**\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nDuring World War II, Constantine II was just a toddler when the Greek royal family was forced into exile. His grandfather, King George II, had resigned as monarch after the German invasion of Greece in 1941, and the family was evacuated to Egypt. Constantine II's father, King Paul, succeeded his uncle as monarch in 1947, and the family returned to Greece.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the Greek royal family settled back into their palace in Athens, but the country was plagued by civil war and instability. Constantine II's father, King Paul, died in 1964, and Constantine II succeeded him as King at the age of 23.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n### Education\n\nAs Crown Prince, Constantine II was educated at the Palace School in Athens, where he received a traditional Greek education. He also studied at the British School of Athens and later at the University of Oxford, where he earned a degree in jurisprudence.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine II was an accomplished sailor and participated in several Olympic Games. He competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where he won a gold medal in the Star class.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nConstantine II became King of Greece in 1964 at the age of 23.

The couple had three children: Crown Prince Alexander, Princess Theodora, and Princess Chrysantha.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine II faced a major crisis when a military junta attempted to overthrow him. The coup was led by General Lamprakis, who was dissatisfied with the King's conservative policies. Constantine II managed to quash the coup, but the incident marked the beginning of a period of instability in Greece.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a military junta led by General George Papadopoulos seized power in Greece. Constantine II was forced into exile, and a republic was declared. The six-year dictatorship was marked by human rights abuses and repression.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nIn 1967, Constantine II launched a failed countercoup against the military junta. The coup was unsuccessful, and Constantine II was forced to flee the country. He and his family lived in exile for six years, moving between various countries including Paris, London, and Rome.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, the Greek military junta was overthrown, and democracy was restored. Constantine II returned to Greece, and a referendum was held on whether to restore the monarchy. The referendum was narrowly lost, and the monarchy was abolished.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nAfter the abolition of the monarchy, Constantine II continued to live in exile. He was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy, but none were successful.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine II visited Greece for the first time since the abolition of the monarchy. He was met with a mixed reaction, with some Greeks welcoming his return and others expressing hostility.\n\n### Legal quarrels over the royal properties\n\nConstantine II was involved in a lengthy and bitter dispute with the Greek government over the ownership of the royal properties. The dispute was eventually settled in 2013, with the Greek government agreeing to transfer ownership of the properties to Constantine II's children.\n\n**Later Life**\n\n### Death\n\nConstantine II died on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece.\n\n**Issue**\n\nConstantine II had three children with his wife, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark:\n\n* Crown Prince Alexander (born 1965)\n* Princess Theodora (born 1967)\n* Princess Chrysantha (born 1968)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nConstantine II descended from the House of Glücksburg, a German royal family that had ruled Greece since 1863.

It is a critical aspect of survival and adaptation in many ecosystems, and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the characteristics of the predator, the characteristics of the prey, and the environment in which they interact.\n\n# Definition\n\nHunting success can be defined as the proportion of hunting attempts that result in a successful kill. It is a measure of the effectiveness of a predator's hunting behavior, and can vary widely depending on the species and the context in which it hunts.\n\n# Hunting Success in Animals\n\n## List of Animals by Hunting Success Rate\n\nHunting success rates vary widely among different species of animals. Some predators, such as lions and leopards, have high hunting success rates, while others, such as wolves and hyenas, have lower success rates. Here are some examples of animals with varying hunting success rates:\n\n* Lion: 20-30% success rate\n* Leopard: 30-40% success rate\n* Wolf: 10-20% success rate\n* Hyena: 5-10% success rate\n* Cheetah: 50-60% success rate\n\n## Reasons for High Hunting Success\n\nThere are several reasons why some predators have high hunting success rates. These include:\n\n* Speed: Cheetahs, for example, are able to reach high speeds and catch prey off guard, resulting in high hunting success rates.\n* Strength: Lions and leopards are able to overpower and kill large prey, resulting in high hunting success rates.\n* Stealth: Some predators, such as leopards and cheetahs, are able to stalk their prey undetected, resulting in high hunting success rates.\n* Intelligence: Some predators, such as lions and hyenas, are able to hunt cooperatively and use complex strategies to catch their prey, resulting in high hunting success rates.\n\n# Kill Rates\n\nKill rates refer to the number of kills made by a predator per unit of time. Kill rates can vary widely depending on the species and the context in which it hunts. For example, lions are known to have high kill rates, with some prides making up to 10 kills per week. In contrast, wolves have lower kill rates, with some packs making only a few kills per week.\n\n# Factors Influencing Success\n\n## Selective Feeding\n\nSelective feeding refers to the practice of selecting specific prey based on age, sex, and other characteristics. Some predators, such as lions and leopards, are selective feeders, and target specific prey that are easier to catch and kill. This can result in higher hunting success rates, as the predator is able to focus its efforts on the most vulnerable prey.\n\n## Social and Solitary Predators\n\nSome predators, such as wolves and lions, are social predators, and hunt in groups. These social predators are often able to catch prey more easily, as they are able to surround and overwhelm their prey. In contrast, solitary predators, such as leopards and cheetahs, are often more successful at catching prey that is isolated or vulnerable.\n\n## Hunting Methods\n\nHunting methods can also influence a predator's success rate. For example, some predators, such as lions and hyenas, use cooperative hunting methods, where multiple predators work together to catch a single prey. This can result in higher hunting success rates, as the predators are able to overwhelm and kill their prey more easily. In contrast, solitary predators, such as leopards and cheetahs, often use stealth and speed to catch their prey.\n\n## Environmental Influences\n\nEnvironmental influences can also affect a predator's success rate. For example, vegetation cover can make it more difficult for a predator to see and catch its prey. In contrast, open habitats can make it easier for a predator to spot and catch its prey.\n\n## Vegetative Cover\n\nVegetative cover refers to the amount of vegetation present in a given area. Vegetative cover can affect a predator's success rate by making it more difficult for the predator to see and catch its prey. For example, dense vegetation can make it difficult for a predator to spot its prey, while open habitats can make it easier for a predator to spot and catch its prey.\n\n# In Human Hunters\n\n## Hunting Success in Humans\n\nHunting success in humans can vary widely depending on the hunter's skill, experience, and the type of game being hunted. For example, experienced hunters may have higher hunting success rates than inexperienced hunters, while hunters targeting larger game may have lower hunting success rates than those targeting smaller game.\n\n## Factors Influencing Success of Human Hunters\n\nSeveral factors can influence the success of human hunters, including:\n\n* Experience: More experienced hunters may have higher hunting success rates, as they have developed skills and strategies for hunting and killing prey.\n* Skill: Hunters with better shooting and tracking skills may have higher hunting success rates, as they are able to accurately and humanely kill their prey.\n* Equipment: Hunters with better equipment, such as optics and firearms, may have higher hunting success rates, as they are able to see and catch their prey more easily.\n* Habitat: Hunters who hunt in areas with suitable habitat and weather conditions may have higher hunting success rates, as they are able to spot and catch their prey more easily.\n\n## Hunting Types and Methods\n\nThere are several types of hunting and methods that can be used to catch and kill prey, including:\n\n* Big game hunting: targeting large game such as deer, elk, and bear.\n* Small game hunting: targeting smaller game such as rabbits, squirrels, and birds.\n* Waterfowl hunting: targeting ducks, geese, and other waterfowl.\n* Archery hunting: using a bow and arrow to hunt and kill prey.\n* Rifle hunting: using a rifle to hunt and kill prey.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact of hunting on prey populations can vary widely depending on the species and the context in which it hunts. In some cases, hunting can help to regulate prey populations and maintain a balance between predators and prey. In other cases, overhunting can lead to population declines and even extinctions.\n\n# See also\n\n* Predator-prey interactions\n* Hunting ethics\n* Conservation biology\n* Wildlife management", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hunting_success\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition\n#Hunting success in animals\n##List of animals by hunting success rate\n##Reasons for high hunting success\n#Kill rates\n#Factors influencing success\n##Selective feeding\n##Social and solitary predators\n##Hunting methods\n##Environmental influences\n##Vegetative cover\n#In human hunters\n##Hunting success in humans\n##Factors influencing success of human hunters\n##Hunting types and methods\n##Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The project was initially intended as a sequel to the 1986 film of the same name, but it eventually evolved into a standalone story.\n\n### Casting\n\nKamal Haasan was the first actor to be cast in the film.

The soundtrack features six songs, including the hit single \"Muttalaga\". The score was praised for its innovative use of traditional Carnatic music elements.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Vikram was extensive and involved several promotional events and social media campaigns. The film's trailer was released in June 2022, and it quickly went viral on social media. The film's poster and teaser were also released, generating significant buzz around the film.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nVikram was released on June 3, 2022, in theaters across India.

The strike, which lasted for several months, affected the film and television industries, causing significant disruptions to production and impacting various stakeholders.\n\n**Issues in the strike**\n\nThe main issues in the strike centered on compensation, residuals, and labor rights for writers in the film and television industry. The WGA sought to address concerns related to the decline in residuals, which had been a major source of income for writers in the past. The guild also sought to establish a fairer share of profits for writers, particularly in the streaming era. Additionally, the WGA pushed for better working conditions, including more reasonable notice periods and greater flexibility in scheduling.\n\n**Timeline of negotiations and strike activity**\n\n### April 2023\n\nThe WGA and AMPTP began negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in April 2023. The talks were marked by a sense of optimism, with both sides expressing a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, underlying tensions and disagreements soon became apparent, and the negotiations quickly stalled.\n\n### May 2023\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the WGA announced that the negotiations had broken down, and the union would be going on strike. The strike began at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time, with over 13,000 writers participating. The WGA selected several high-profile projects to target, including a major streaming service's flagship series.\n\n### June 2023\n\nThe strike continued into June, with both sides remaining firm on their positions. The WGA organized a series of pickets and protests outside major studios and production facilities, while the AMPTP continued to argue that the guild's demands were unreasonable. Tensions between the parties escalated, with some writers accusing the AMPTP of attempting to break the strike through aggressive tactics.\n\n### July 2023\n\nIn July, the WGA and AMPTP resumed negotiations, but progress was slow. The guild introduced a new proposal aimed at addressing the issue of residuals, but the AMPTP rejected it as too costly. The strike continued, with some writers beginning to feel the financial strain.\n\n### August 2023\n\nThe strike entered its third month in August, with both sides showing signs of fatigue. The WGA and AMPTP agreed to a series of mediated talks, but the negotiations remained contentious. Some writers began to consider alternative options, including joining other unions or seeking employment outside the industry.\n\n### September 2023\n\nIn September, the WGA and AMPTP reported progress in their talks, with both sides expressing optimism about a potential deal. However, the negotiations stalled again, and the strike continued. The guild launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issues at stake, including a series of rallies and demonstrations.\n\n### October 2023\n\nThe strike entered its fifth month in October, with both sides remaining firm on their positions. The WGA and AMPTP agreed to a series of final talks, but the negotiations were marked by a sense of urgency and desperation. On October 28, the WGA announced that it had reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP, and the strike was suspended pending ratification by the union's membership.\n\n**WGA negotiating committee**\n\nThe WGA negotiating committee, led by president Meredith Stiehm and director of labor relations Jenny Allen, played a crucial role in the strike. The committee worked tirelessly to negotiate with the AMPTP, advocating for the interests of writers and pushing for a fair and reasonable agreement.\n\n**Productions impacted**\n\nThe strike had a significant impact on various productions, including:\n\n* **Streaming series:** Several major streaming services, including Netflix and Hulu, saw their productions halted or delayed due to the strike.\n* **Film productions:** Several major film productions, including a highly anticipated sci-fi epic, were also affected by the strike.\n* **Television shows:** Many television shows, including several popular sitcoms and dramas, were forced to shut down production or adjust their schedules.\n\n**Response**\n\n### Actors during the WGA strike\n\nSeveral actors expressed support for the WGA during the strike, including:\n\n* **Michael B. Jordan:** The actor, who has been vocal about writers' rights, expressed his support for the WGA and its demands.\n* **Emma Stone:** The actress, who has worked with several WGA writers, expressed her solidarity with the union and its members.\n* **Lin-Manuel Miranda:** The composer and actor, who has been a vocal advocate for writers' rights, expressed his support for the WGA and its demands.\n\n### Elected officials\n\nSeveral elected officials, including:\n\n* **Congressman Adam Schiff:** The congressman, who has been a vocal supporter of writers' rights, expressed his support for the WGA and its demands.\n* **Senator Bernie Sanders:** The senator, who has been a vocal advocate for workers' rights, expressed his solidarity with the WGA and its members.\n* **Governor Gavin Newsom:** The governor, who has been a vocal supporter of the arts and entertainment industry, expressed his support for the WGA and its demands.\n\n### Other unions\n\nSeveral other unions, including:\n\n* **SAG-AFTRA:** The actors' union, which has a long history of solidarity with the WGA, expressed its support for the strike and its demands.\n* **IATSE:** The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents workers in the film and television industry, expressed its support for the WGA and its demands.\n* **Writers Guild of America, East:** The WGA-E, which represents writers in the film and television industry on the East Coast, expressed its solidarity with the WGA and its members.\n\n### Foreign unions\n\nSeveral foreign unions, including:\n\n* **The Writers' Guild of Great Britain:** The UK-based writers' union, which has a long history of solidarity with the WGA, expressed its support for the strike and its demands.\n* **The Writers' Guild of Canada:** The Canadian writers' union, which has a long history of solidarity with the WGA, expressed its support for the strike and its demands.\n* **The Writers' Guild of Australia:** The Australian writers' union, which has a long history of solidarity with the WGA, expressed its support for the strike and its demands.\n\n### Film and television executives\n\nSeveral film and television executives, including:\n\n* **Warner Bros.

The film's plot is a mix of action, adventure, and heartwarming moments, making it a thrilling ride for audiences of all ages.\n\n**Voice cast**\n\nThe voice cast of Lightyear includes:\n\n* Chris Evans as the voice of Buzz Lightyear\n* Keke Palmer as the voice of Izzy Hawthorne\n* Peter Sohn as the voice of Sox\n* Taika Waititi as the voice of Mo Morrison\n* Uzo Aduba as the voice of Alisha Hawthorne\n* Dale Soules as the voice of Harv\n* Mary McDonald-Lewis as the voice of Mira Nova\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe development of Lightyear began in 2016, with Angus MacLane coming on board as the director. MacLane, who had previously worked on Toy Story 2 and Brave, was a perfect fit for the project, given his experience in creating stories that blend action and heart. The film's story was inspired by the Toy Story franchise, but also drew from classic sci-fi films and literature.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Lightyear was a long and rigorous one, with Chris Evans being the first actor to be attached to the project. Evans, who had previously played Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was a natural fit for the role of Buzz Lightyear. The rest of the cast was assembled over the course of several months, with Keke Palmer, Peter Sohn, and Uzo Aduba being some of the notable additions.\n\n### Animation and design\n\nThe animation and design of Lightyear were handled by a team of talented artists and technicians at Pixar Animation Studios. The film's visuals are a mix of stunning landscapes, intricate details, and memorable characters. The film's color palette is also noteworthy, with a focus on bold and vibrant colors that bring the film's world to life.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music of Lightyear was composed by Michael Giacchino, a veteran composer who has worked on several Pixar films, including Up and Inside Out. The film's score is a mix of sweeping orchestral pieces and catchy pop songs, perfectly capturing the film's sense of adventure and wonder.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe marketing campaign for Lightyear was a massive one, with Disney releasing a series of trailers and promotional materials in the months leading up to the film's release. The campaign focused on the film's action-packed sequences, as well as its heartwarming moments and stunning visuals.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nLightyear was released in theaters on June 17, 2022, in the United States and Canada. The film received a wide release, with over 4,000 screens in the United States alone. The film's opening weekend was a successful one, with it grossing over $73 million in the United States.\n\n### Ban and censorship\n\nLightyear faced some controversy in the months leading up to its release, with some critics accusing the film of promoting a \"woke\" agenda. The film's depiction of a same-sex couple was seen as a major point of contention, with some accusing Disney of trying to push a liberal agenda on children. However, the film's director, Angus MacLane, defended the film's depiction of the couple, saying that it was a natural and authentic representation of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n### Home media\n\nLightyear was released on digital platforms on August 2, 2022, and on Blu-ray and DVD on August 23, 2022. The home media release included a range of bonus features, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and a making-of documentary.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Streaming viewership\n\nLightyear performed well on streaming platforms, with it being one of the most-watched films on Disney+ in the months following its release. According to reports, the film was viewed over 100 million times on Disney+ in its first month of release.\n\n### Box office\n\nLightyear was a commercial success, grossing over $225 million worldwide. The film's performance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decline in box office sales in many countries. However, the film's success was still notable, given the challenges that it faced in the months leading up to its release.\n\n### Critical response\n\nLightyear received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its stunning visuals, engaging storyline, and memorable characters. However, some critics accused the film of being too formulaic and predictable, with some feeling that it relied too heavily on familiar tropes and plot devices.\n\n### Accolades\n\nLightyear was nominated for several awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature. The film won several awards at the 2022 Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature and Best Directing in an Animated Feature Production.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Toy Story franchise\n* Pixar Animation Studios\n* Walt Disney Pictures\n* Angus MacLane\n* Chris Evans\n* Keke Palmer\n* Peter Sohn\n* Uzo Aduba\n* Michael Giacchino\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Lightyear is the 23rd film produced by Pixar Animation Studios.\n* The film's budget was estimated to be around $200 million.\n* The film's runtime is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Lightyear at IMDb\n* Lightyear at Box Office Mojo\n* Lightyear at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Lightyear at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lightyear_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Voice cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Animation and design\n#Music\n#Marketing\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Ban and censorship\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Streaming viewership\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
