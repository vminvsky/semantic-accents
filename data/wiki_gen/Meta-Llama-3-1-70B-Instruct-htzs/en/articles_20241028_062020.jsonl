The earthquakes were among the most significant seismic events in the region in recent history, and their impact was felt across the Middle East and beyond.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nThe earthquakes occurred in a seismically active region, where the Arabian Plate is moving northwards towards the Eurasian Plate. This process has created a zone of deformation, resulting in numerous faults and a high level of seismicity.\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region is characterized by a complex geology, with multiple fault systems and a variety of rock types. The earthquakes occurred in an area where the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) and the Dead Sea Rift (DSR) intersect. The EAFZ is a major transform fault that runs for over 500 km, while the DSR is a zone of extensional deformation that stretches from Lebanon to the Red Sea.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a long history of seismic activity, with numerous earthquakes occurring over the centuries. The earthquakes are often shallow, with focal depths of less than 20 km, and are characterized by a mix of strike-slip and normal faulting. The earthquakes are also often accompanied by aftershocks, which can continue for days or even weeks after the main event.\n\n# Earthquake Sequence\n\nThe 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes were a series of events that occurred over a period of several days. The earthquakes were characterized by a complex sequence of ruptures, with multiple faults involved.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe earthquakes were followed by numerous aftershocks, which continued for several days. The aftershocks were often smaller than the main event, but still caused significant damage and disruption.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were studied by seismologists, who used data from seismometers and other instruments to understand the events. The seismologists found that the earthquakes were characterized by a mix of strike-slip and normal faulting, and that the ruptures propagated along multiple faults.\n\n## Rupture Propagation\n\nThe ruptures propagated rapidly, with speeds of up to 3 km/s. The ruptures also involved multiple faults, including the EAFZ and the DSR.\n\n## Surface Rupture\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant surface rupture, with displacements of up to 10 m. The surface rupture was often accompanied by landslides and other geological effects.\n\n## Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquakes caused significant ground motion, with peak accelerations of up to 1 g. The ground motion was also characterized by a mix of horizontal and vertical motion.\n\n## Geological Effects\n\nThe earthquakes caused numerous geological effects, including landslides, rockfalls, and soil liquefaction.

Amir Locke, a 22-year-old African American man, was shot and killed by a Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) SWAT team officer during a no-knock search warrant execution.\n\n# Background\n\n## Persons involved\n\nAmir Locke was a 22-year-old African American man who was a student at Hennepin Technical College. He was also a musician and a member of the National Guard. Locke was not the primary target of the search warrant.\n\nMark Hanneman, a 44-year-old MPD SWAT team officer, was the officer who shot and killed Amir Locke. Hanneman had been with the MPD for 24 years and had previously served on the SWAT team.\n\n## Search warrant\n\nThe search warrant was executed as part of a homicide investigation. The primary target of the search warrant was Locke's cousin, who was suspected of being involved in a murder that occurred in St. Paul on January 10, 2022.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn February 2, 2022, at approximately 6:48 a.m., the MPD SWAT team executed a no-knock search warrant at an apartment in Minneapolis. Amir Locke, who was not the primary target of the search warrant, was inside the apartment. Locke was sleeping on a couch and was holding a firearm.\n\nOfficer Mark Hanneman shot and killed Amir Locke within 10 seconds of entering the apartment. Locke was struck twice in the chest and once in the wrist.\n\n# Investigations\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department's Internal Affairs Unit and the Minnesota Bureau of Investigation (MBI) launched investigations into the shooting.\n\nThe MBI investigation found that Officer Hanneman had followed MPD protocols and had announced himself before entering the apartment. However, the investigation also found that Locke had not been given sufficient time to respond before being shot.\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office also launched an investigation into the shooting.\n\n# No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n\nFollowing the killing of Amir Locke, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a moratorium on no-knock search warrants. The moratorium was later replaced with a policy requiring officers to announce themselves and wait for a response before entering a property.\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council also passed a resolution calling for the state legislature to ban no-knock search warrants.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Family\n\nAmir Locke's family released a statement calling for justice and accountability. Locke's mother, Karen Wells, stated that her son's killing was \"a senseless act of violence\".\n\n## Officials\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey released a statement calling for calm and promising a thorough investigation. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman also released a statement stating that his office would investigate the shooting.\n\n## Community groups\n\nCommunity groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Minnesota chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), released statements calling for justice and accountability.\n\n# Protests\n\n## In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n\nProtests were held in Minneapolis and St. Paul following the killing of Amir Locke. Demonstrators called for justice and accountability, and some protesters blocked traffic and vandalized property.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nProtests were also held in other cities, including New York City and Los Angeles.\n\n# Civil lawsuit\n\nAmir Locke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis and Officer Mark Hanneman. The lawsuit alleges that Hanneman used excessive force and that the city failed to properly train its officers.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality\n* Police use of deadly force\n* Racial profiling\n* No-knock warrant\n\n# References\n\n None\n\n# External links\n\n None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Amir_Locke\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Persons involved\n##Search warrant\n#Incident\n#Investigations\n#No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n#Reaction\n##Family\n##Officials\n##Community groups\n#Protests\n##In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n##Elsewhere\n#Civil lawsuit\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film The Meg and stars Jason Statham, Wu Jing, and Sophia Cai.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place several years after the events of the first film. Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) is living a quiet life with his wife, Suyin (Li Bingbing), and their daughter, Meiying (Sophia Cai).

{"title": "Oh_Caroline", "content": "#Background and development\n#Music and lyrics\n#Reception\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Oh Caroline\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" is a song by the American rock band Cheap Trick, from their 1977 album \"In Color\". The song was written by Rick Nielsen, the band's lead guitarist and primary songwriter, and has since become one of the band's most popular and enduring songs.\n\n# Background and development\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" was written by Rick Nielsen in 1976, during a period of intense creativity for the band. At the time, Cheap Trick was touring extensively and building a loyal following in the Midwest, and Nielsen was writing songs at a rapid pace. The song is believed to have been inspired by a woman Nielsen met on the road, although the exact details of the song's inspiration are unclear.\n\nThe song was recorded at Kendun Recorders in Los Angeles, with producer Tom Werman at the helm. Werman had previously worked with the band on their debut album, and was brought back for \"In Color\" due to his ability to capture the band's live energy in the studio. The recording process was relatively straightforward, with the band laying down basic tracks and then adding overdubs and harmonies.\n\n## Recording process\n\nThe recording process for \"Oh Caroline\" was notable for its use of innovative techniques and equipment. Nielsen used a variety of unusual guitar effects, including a Leslie speaker and a harmonizer, to create the song's distinctive sound. The band also experimented with different mic placements and recording techniques, including the use of a \"binaural\" microphone to capture a more immersive sound.\n\n# Music and lyrics\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" is a mid-tempo rock song with a catchy, anthemic chorus and a sing-along melody. The song features a prominent guitar riff and a driving rhythm section, with Nielsen's guitar work taking center stage. The lyrics are somewhat enigmatic, but appear to tell the story of a romantic relationship that is struggling to survive.\n\n## Musical structure\n\nThe song follows a fairly traditional verse-chorus structure, with a brief instrumental break and a final chorus. The verse features a simple, repetitive guitar pattern and a driving rhythm section, while the chorus is more elaborate, with layered harmonies and a catchy melody. The instrumental break features a solo by Nielsen, which showcases his impressive guitar skills.\n\n## Lyrical themes\n\nThe lyrics of \"Oh Caroline\" are somewhat open to interpretation, but appear to deal with themes of love, loss, and longing. The song's title character is a mysterious figure, and the lyrics offer few clues about her identity or motivations. Despite this, the song's emotional impact is undeniable, and the lyrics have become iconic in the world of rock music.\n\n# Reception\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" was released as a single in 1977, and received significant airplay on FM radio. The song was praised by critics, who noted its catchy melody and memorable guitar riff. The song has since become one of Cheap Trick's most popular and enduring songs, and is often included on lists of the greatest rock songs of all time.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe critical response to \"Oh Caroline\" was overwhelmingly positive, with many critics noting the song's catchy melody and memorable guitar riff. The song was praised by Rolling Stone, who noted its \"anthemic\" quality and \" sing-along\" melody. The song was also praised by other critics, who noted its innovative production techniques and Nielsen's impressive guitar work.\n\n# Charts\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" peaked at number 36 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977. The song also reached number 14 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, and number 20 on the US Billboard Cash Box chart.\n\n## Chart performance\n\nThe chart performance of \"Oh Caroline\" was significant, given the song's relatively low profile at the time of its release. The song's success can be attributed to its catchy melody and memorable guitar riff, as well as its innovative production techniques. The song's chart performance helped to establish Cheap Trick as a major force in rock music, and paved the way for their future success.\n\n# Certifications\n\n\"Oh Caroline\" has been certified gold by the RIAA, denoting sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. The song has also been certified gold by the CRIA, denoting sales of over 50,000 copies in Canada.\n\n## Sales and certifications\n\nThe sales and certifications of \"Oh Caroline\" are a testament to the song's enduring popularity and influence. The song's certification by the RIAA and CRIA is a significant achievement, and reflects the song's impact on rock music. The song's sales and certifications have also helped to establish Cheap Trick as one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cheap Trick\n* In Color\n* Rick Nielsen\n* Tom Werman\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* Cheap Trick official website\n* \"Oh Caroline\" on AllMusic\n* \"Oh Caroline\" on Discogs", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Oh_Caroline\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and development\n#Music and lyrics\n#Reception\n#Charts\n#Certifications\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1871, Cordingley developed his skills as an amateur cricketer before turning professional in 1894. He is best known for his association with Sussex County Cricket Club, where he played from 1900 to 1905. Cordingley's career spanned over three decades, during which he played for several teams, including Lytham, Lancashire, Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Wiseton, Nottinghamshire, East Grinstead, Sussex, and Pease Pottage, Sussex.\n\n#Early life and development as an amateur cricketer (1871-1893)\n\nAlbert Cordingley was born in 1871 in a cricket-loving family. His early life and education are not well-documented, but it is known that he developed a passion for cricket from a young age. Cordingley honed his skills as an amateur cricketer, playing for local teams and clubs in his native Lancashire. During this period, he gained valuable experience and developed his technique, which would serve him well in his future professional career.\n\n#Professional cricket career (1894-1920)\n\n##Lytham, Lancashire (1894–1897)\n\nCordingley turned professional in 1894, joining Lytham Cricket Club in Lancashire. During his three-year stint with Lytham, he established himself as a skilled bowler and batsman. Cordingley's performances caught the attention of bigger clubs, and he soon received offers to join more prominent teams.\n\n##Yorkshire County Cricket Club (1897-1898)\n\nIn 1897, Cordingley joined Yorkshire County Cricket Club, one of the most prestigious teams in English cricket. Although his stay at Yorkshire was brief, lasting only a year, he gained valuable experience playing alongside top-class cricketers. Cordingley's time at Yorkshire helped him refine his skills and prepared him for future challenges.\n\n##Wiseton, Nottinghamshire (1899)\n\nCordingley's next move was to Wiseton Cricket Club in Nottinghamshire, where he played for a single season in 1899. Although his stay was short, he continued to develop his skills and adapt to different playing conditions.\n\n##Sussex County Cricket Club (1900-1905)\n\nIn 1900, Cordingley joined Sussex County Cricket Club, a team he would be associated with for several years. During his six-year tenure with Sussex, he established himself as a key player, contributing significantly to the team's success. Cordingley's performances with Sussex earned him recognition as a skilled all-rounder, capable of making valuable contributions with both bat and ball.\n\n##East Grinstead, Sussex (1906-1911)\n\nIn 1906, Cordingley moved to East Grinstead Cricket Club in Sussex, where he played for five years. Although he was no longer a part of the Sussex County team, he continued to play high-quality cricket, helping East Grinstead achieve success in local competitions.\n\n##Pease Pottage, Sussex (1912-1920)\n\nCordingley's final move was to Pease Pottage Cricket Club in Sussex, where he played from 1912 to 1920. During his eight-year tenure with Pease Pottage, he continued to contribute to the team's success, albeit in a more limited capacity due to his advancing age. Cordingley's time at Pease Pottage marked the end of his professional cricketing career.\n\n#Post-professional playing career (1921-29)\n\nAfter retiring from professional cricket, Cordingley remained involved in the sport, taking on various roles including groundskeeping and coaching. He shared his knowledge and experience with younger players, helping to develop the next generation of cricketers.\n\n#Groundskeeping and coaching\n\nCordingley's post-playing career was marked by his involvement in groundskeeping and coaching. He worked tirelessly to maintain the quality of cricket pitches and shared his expertise with aspiring cricketers. Cordingley's contributions to the sport extended beyond his playing career, as he helped to nurture the development of cricket in his local community.\n\n#Demise of Pease Pottage Cricket Club\n\nPease Pottage Cricket Club, Cordingley's final team, folded in the late 1920s due to financial difficulties. The demise of the club marked the end of an era, as Cordingley's association with the team came to a close.\n\n#Quirks of playing career\n\nCordingley's playing career was marked by several quirks and anomalies. One notable example is his decision to join Wiseton Cricket Club in Nottinghamshire for a single season in 1899. This brief stint with Wiseton is often seen as an unusual move, given Cordingley's established association with teams in Lancashire and Sussex.\n\n#Other sports\n\nCordingley's sporting interests extended beyond cricket. He was known to be an accomplished player of other sports, including football and tennis. Although cricket remained his primary focus, he enjoyed participating in various other sports and activities.\n\n#Death\n\nAlbert Cordingley passed away in 1929, marking the end of an era in English cricket. His contributions to the sport were recognized and respected by his peers, and he remains a notable figure in the history of cricket.\n\n#Legacy\n\nCordingley's legacy extends beyond his playing career. He is remembered as a skilled cricketer who contributed significantly to the development of the sport in his local community. His involvement in groundskeeping and coaching helped to nurture the next generation of cricketers, ensuring a lasting impact on the sport.\n\n#Sussex First-class playing record\n\nCordingley's first-class playing record with Sussex County Cricket Club is as follows:\n\n* Matches: 56\n* Runs: 1451\n* Average: 20.16\n* Wickets: 123\n* Average: 24.55\n\nNote: This record only includes Cordingley's first-class appearances for Sussex County Cricket Club and does not reflect his entire playing career.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Albert_Cordingley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and development as an amateur cricketer (1871-1893)\n#Professional cricket career (1894-1920)\n##Lytham, Lancashire (1894–1897)\n##Yorkshire County Cricket Club (1897-1898)\n##Wiseton, Nottinghamshire (1899)\n##Sussex County Cricket Club (1900-1905)\n##East Grinstead, Sussex (1906-1911)\n##Pease Pottage, Sussex (1912-1920)\n#Post-professional playing career (1921-29)\n#Groundskeeping and coaching\n#Demise of Pease Pottage Cricket Club\n#Quirks of playing career\n#Other sports\n#Death\n#Legacy\n#Sussex First-class playing record\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The piece consists of a series of silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, which were a ubiquitous and familiar product in American culture at the time. The work is widely regarded as one of the most influential and iconic works of the Pop Art movement, which celebrated the banality and familiarity of consumer culture.\n\n#Early Career\n\n##New York art scene\n\nWarhol moved to New York City in 1949, where he became a successful commercial illustrator, producing work for major magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. However, he soon became disillusioned with the commercial art world and began to explore fine art. In the early 1960s, Warhol became a key figure in the New York art scene, befriending artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns.\n\n##Pop art\n\nWarhol's interest in consumer culture and mass production led him to experiment with new techniques, including silkscreen printing. He began to produce works that celebrated the banality and familiarity of everyday objects, such as Campbell's soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. This marked a significant departure from the traditional fine art world, which had long emphasized uniqueness and originality.\n\n#Premiere\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition was a major success, attracting widespread attention and critical acclaim. The work was initially met with confusion and even outrage by some critics, who saw it as a challenge to traditional notions of art.\n\n##Subsequent publicity\n\nThe controversy surrounding Campbell's Soup Cans generated a significant amount of publicity, which helped to establish Warhol as a major figure in the art world. The work was featured in numerous publications, including Time magazine, and was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1963.\n\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n\n##Can and label history\n\nCampbell's soup cans have a long and storied history, dating back to the late 19th century. The company was founded by Joseph A. Campbell in 1869, and the iconic red and white can design was introduced in the 1890s. The design has undergone several changes over the years, but the basic layout has remained the same.\n\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as a subject was not simply a matter of chance. He was drawn to the familiarity and ubiquity of the product, as well as its associations with American culture. The cans also represented a kind of democratic art, available to everyone regardless of social class or background.\n\n#Inspiration\n\n##Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans was influenced by the work of his artist colleagues, including Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Lichtenstein's comic-book inspired paintings and Johns' Flag series, which featured images of the American flag, helped to lay the groundwork for Warhol's exploration of consumer culture.\n\n#Interpretation\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans has been the subject of numerous interpretations over the years. Some critics have seen it as a commentary on the banality and superficiality of consumer culture, while others have viewed it as a celebration of the everyday and the mundane. Warhol himself remained ambivalent about the meaning of the work, preferring to let the viewer interpret it in their own way.\n\n#Variations\n\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nWarhol produced two series of Campbell's Soup Cans, Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. The first series, produced in 1962, featured 32 different flavors of soup, while the second series, produced in 1964, featured 100 different flavors.\n\n##Colored soup cans\n\nIn addition to the standard red and white can design, Warhol also produced a series of colored soup cans, featuring bright, bold colors such as blue, green, and yellow.\n\n##Unauthorized versions\n\nOver the years, numerous unauthorized versions of Campbell's Soup Cans have been produced, including parodies and pastiches. These works have helped to further solidify the iconic status of Warhol's original work.\n\n##Other variations\n\nWarhol also produced numerous other variations of Campbell's Soup Cans, including prints, paintings, and sculptures. These works have helped to demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the original design.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a landmark work of art that continues to fascinate and inspire audiences around the world. Its influence can be seen in everything from advertising and design to music and film. As a work of art, it remains a powerful commentary on the banality and familiarity of consumer culture, as well as a celebration of the everyday and the mundane.\n\n#See also\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n* Jasper Johns\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Campbell's Soup Cans and its significance in the art world.\n* For a more detailed analysis of the work, please see the references listed below.\n\n#References\n\n* None\n\n#External links\n\n* The Andy Warhol Museum\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Museum of Modern Art", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Campbell's_Soup_Cans\" following this outline:\n\n#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These clocks are the most accurate type of clock in the world and serve as the basis for modern timekeeping. Atomic clocks have led to significant advancements in the fields of physics, navigation, and communication, and have had a profound impact on our understanding of time itself.\n\n# History\n\n## Definition of the second\n\nThe concept of an atomic clock dates back to the 1940s, when physicist Isidor Rabi proposed using the vibrations of atoms to regulate a clock. At the time, the definition of the second was based on the Earth's rotation, which was found to be inconsistent. In 1967, the International System of Units (SI) redefined the second as the time it takes for a caesium-133 atom to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. This definition has remained unchanged to this day.\n\n## Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of optical clocks led to significant advancements in metrology. Optical clocks use the vibrations of atoms to measure time, but instead of using microwave radiation, they use laser light. This allows for even more precise measurements, as laser light has a much shorter wavelength than microwave radiation. Optical clocks have the potential to redefine the second and have led to new applications in fields such as navigation and spectroscopy.\n\n## Chip-scale atomic clocks\n\nIn recent years, the development of chip-scale atomic clocks has made it possible to miniaturize atomic clocks and integrate them into small devices. These clocks use a small number of atoms, typically a few thousand, and are powered by a battery. Chip-scale atomic clocks have the potential to revolutionize navigation and communication systems, as they are small, portable, and can operate for extended periods of time.\n\n# Measuring time with atomic clocks\n\n## Clock mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock works by using the vibrations of atoms to regulate a clock. The clock consists of three main components: a microwave generator, a cavity, and a detector. The microwave generator produces a microwave signal that is tuned to the frequency of the atoms. The cavity is a chamber that contains the atoms and is designed to resonate at the same frequency as the microwave signal. The detector measures the signal emitted by the atoms and uses it to regulate the clock.\n\n## Tuning and optimization\n\nThe microwave signal is tuned to the frequency of the atoms by adjusting the cavity and the microwave generator. The goal is to maximize the signal emitted by the atoms, which is typically done by adjusting the cavity to resonate at the same frequency as the atoms. The optimization process can take several hours or even days, depending on the type of clock and the desired level of accuracy.\n\n# Accuracy\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate type of clock in the world, with an accuracy of better than one second per million years. This is because the vibrations of atoms are consistent and can be measured with high precision. The accuracy of an atomic clock is determined by the quality of the clock mechanism, the stability of the microwave signal, and the number of atoms used.\n\n# Comparing atomic clocks\n\n## Time standards\n\nAtomic clocks serve as the basis for modern timekeeping, and several national laboratories around the world maintain atomic clocks as time standards. These clocks are used to synchronize clocks around the world and to establish a common time standard.\n\n## Synchronization with satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are also used to synchronize clocks on satellites, which is essential for navigation systems such as GPS. The clocks on satellites must be synchronized with the clocks on Earth to ensure accurate navigation.\n\n## International timekeeping\n\nThe International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is responsible for maintaining the international time standard, which is based on the average time kept by a network of atomic clocks around the world. The IERS also monitors the Earth's rotation and adjusts the time standard accordingly.\n\n## Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optic cables are used to transmit time signals from atomic clocks to other clocks and devices. This allows for precise synchronization of clocks over long distances.\n\n# Microwave atomic clocks\n\n## Caesium\n\nCaesium clocks are the most common type of atomic clock and use the vibrations of caesium-133 atoms to measure time. The block diagram of a caesium clock consists of a microwave generator, a cavity, a detector, and a counter.\n\n### Block diagram\n\nThe microwave generator produces a microwave signal that is tuned to the frequency of the caesium atoms. The cavity is a chamber that contains the caesium atoms and is designed to resonate at the same frequency as the microwave signal. The detector measures the signal emitted by the atoms and uses it to regulate the clock. The counter counts the number of cycles of the microwave signal and uses it to determine the time.\n\n## Rubidium\n\nRubidium clocks use the vibrations of rubidium-87 atoms to measure time. These clocks are less accurate than caesium clocks but are more compact and less expensive.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen clocks use the vibrations of hydrogen atoms to measure time. These clocks are less accurate than caesium clocks but have the potential to be more compact and less expensive.\n\n# Other types of atomic clocks\n\n## Quantum clocks\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time. These clocks have the potential to be more accurate than traditional atomic clocks but are still in the early stages of development.\n\n## Nuclear clock concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept uses the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time. This concept is still in the early stages of development but has the potential to be more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n# Potential for redefining the second\n\n## Rydberg constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of physics that describes the energy levels of atoms. The redefinition of the second may be based on the Rydberg constant, which would provide a more fundamental definition of time.\n\n## Requirements\n\nA redefinition of the second would require a new definition that is more fundamental and accurate than the current definition. This would require significant advances in metrology and a new understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\n\n## Secondary representations of the second\n\nSecondary representations of the second, such as the frequency of a specific atom, may be used to redefine the second. This would provide a more practical definition of time that is based on a specific physical phenomenon.\n\n# Applications\n\n## Global navigation satellite systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems such as GPS to provide accurate navigation. The clocks on satellites must be synchronized with the clocks on Earth to ensure accurate navigation.\n\n### Experimental space clock\n\nThe experimental space clock is a clock that is designed to operate in space and provide accurate timekeeping for navigation systems.\n\n### Military usage\n\nAtomic clocks are used in military applications such as navigation and communication systems. The accuracy of these clocks is critical for military operations.\n\n## Time signal radio transmitters\n\nTime signal radio transmitters use atomic clocks to broadcast accurate time signals. These signals are used to synchronize clocks around the world.\n\n## General relativity\n\nAtomic clocks are used to test the principles of general relativity. The accuracy of these clocks allows for precise measurements of the effects of gravity on time.\n\n## Financial systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to synchronize clocks and ensure accurate transactions.\n\n## Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nTransportable optical clocks are clocks that can be transported and used in different locations. These clocks have the potential to revolutionize navigation and communication systems.\n\n# See also\n\n* Time\n* Metrology\n* General relativity\n* GPS\n* Financial systems\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of atomic clocks and their applications.

The movement was marked by the installation of stone plaques with the names of tribal martyrs and the assertion of tribal rights over land and resources. Murmu played a key role in addressing the grievances of the tribal communities and promoting dialogue between the state government and the movement's leaders.\n\n##Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2019, the Jharkhand state government introduced the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Amendment Bills, which aimed to amend the existing laws governing land ownership and transfer in the state. The bills were opposed by tribal communities, who feared that they would lead to the alienation of tribal land. Murmu played a crucial role in addressing the concerns of the tribal communities and ensuring that their rights were protected.\n\n#Presidential campaign\n\nIn 2022, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced Murmu as its candidate for the presidential election. Her candidacy was seen as a strategic move by the party to consolidate its support among tribal communities and to promote a more inclusive and representative leadership.\n\nMurmu's presidential campaign was marked by her emphasis on tribal welfare and development, as well as her commitment to promoting national unity and integrity. She received widespread support from across the country, including from opposition parties and civil society organizations.\n\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Murmu was elected as the 15th President of India, defeating her opponent, Yashwant Sinha. Her presidency marks a significant milestone in Indian politics, as she represents the country's marginalized communities.\n\nAs President, Murmu has emphasized the need to promote tribal welfare and development, as well as to address the challenges faced by rural communities.

Known as \"The Killer,\" Lewis is a pioneer of rock and roll and country music. With a career spanning over six decades, he has made significant contributions to the music industry, earning numerous accolades and leaving a lasting legacy.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo and Mamie Lewis. He was the third of four children, and his family was deeply rooted in music. Lewis's mother, a devout Christian, encouraged his interest in music from an early age. He began playing the piano at the age of nine and was heavily influenced by gospel music, blues, and country.\n\nLewis's early life was marked by hardship, with his family struggling to make ends meet.

He released a string of successful country singles, including \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\" and \"She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye.\" Lewis's country comeback was marked by a more subdued and introspective style, which resonated with audiences.\n\n### Grand Ole Opry Appearance\n\nIn 1972, Lewis made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, a iconic country music venue in Nashville, Tennessee. Lewis's appearance was a significant milestone in his career, and he went on to become a regular performer at the Opry.\n\n### The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn 1973, Lewis released two critically acclaimed albums, \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots.\" These albums showcased Lewis's ability to blend rock, country, and soul, and are widely regarded as some of his best work.\n\n### Later Career\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis continued to tour and record music, releasing several successful albums, including \"Duets\" and \"Young Blood.\" Lewis's later career was marked by a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to his collaborations with younger artists.\n\nMusic Legacy\n-------------\n\n### Accolades\n\nLewis has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a Country Music Hall of Fame induction, and a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\n\n### Piano Style\n\nLewis's piano style is widely regarded as one of the most influential in rock and roll history. His unique blend of boogie-woogie, country, and gospel has inspired countless musicians, including Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Bob Dylan.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nLewis has been married seven times and has six children.

After the war, he went on to work for the Gehlen Organization, a precursor to the German Federal Intelligence Service, and later for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Von Bolschwing's post-war career was marked by controversy, including his involvement in a major financial scandal and allegations of war crimes.\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n\n##Early life and business ventures\n\nOtto von Bolschwing was born on October 15, 1909, in Schönfließ, a small town in the province of Brandenburg, Germany. His family was of noble descent, and his father was a Prussian army officer. Von Bolschwing studied economics and law at the University of Göttingen, where he became involved in the Nazi Party's student organization. After completing his studies, he worked in the private sector, including a stint as a manager at the IG Farben chemical company.\n\n##Mandatory Palestine\n\nIn 1933, von Bolschwing traveled to Mandatory Palestine, where he became acquainted with the Jewish community and developed an interest in Jewish affairs. He worked as a business consultant and advisor to several Jewish companies, including the Palestine Potash Company. During this period, he also established connections with the British authorities, who controlled Palestine at the time.\n\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n\nIn 1937, von Bolschwing returned to Germany and joined the Nazi Party's Office of Jewish Affairs, where he worked under the direction of Adolf Eichmann. The office was responsible for coordinating the Nazi regime's policies towards Jews, including the implementation of anti-Semitic laws and the forced emigration of Jews from Germany. Von Bolschwing's experience in Mandatory Palestine and his knowledge of Jewish affairs made him a valuable asset to the office.\n\n#World War II\n\n##Romania\n\nIn 1940, von Bolschwing was assigned to Romania, where he worked as a liaison officer between the German and Romanian governments. He played a key role in negotiating the transfer of Romanian Jews to German-controlled territory, which ultimately led to the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews to concentration camps.\n\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n\nAs the war turned against Germany, von Bolschwing's position became increasingly precarious. In 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned for several months on suspicion of being a British spy. He was released in 1945 and went into hiding as Allied forces advanced on Germany.\n\n##Austria\n\nAfter the war, von Bolschwing fled to Austria, where he lived in hiding for several years. He adopted the alias \"Otto von König\" and worked as a business consultant, using his connections to build a network of contacts in the Austrian business community.\n\n#Postwar espionage\n\n##Gehlen Organization\n\nIn 1949, von Bolschwing was recruited by the Gehlen Organization, a precursor to the German Federal Intelligence Service. The organization was founded by Reinhard Gehlen, a former German general who had worked with the CIA to gather intelligence on the Soviet Union. Von Bolschwing worked as a senior analyst and advisor to Gehlen, using his expertise on Jewish affairs and the Middle East to inform the organization's intelligence gathering efforts.\n\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n\nIn the early 1950s, von Bolschwing began working directly for the CIA, which had established a close relationship with the Gehlen Organization. He worked as a contract agent, providing intelligence on the Middle East and North Africa. Von Bolschwing's work for the CIA was marked by controversy, including allegations that he had provided false intelligence on the Soviet Union's military capabilities.\n\n##Cover-up\n\nIn the 1960s, von Bolschwing's past as a Nazi officer began to attract attention from the media and government investigators. The CIA and the Gehlen Organization worked to cover up his involvement with the Nazi regime, and von Bolschwing himself denied any wrongdoing. However, documents uncovered in the 1980s revealed that von Bolschwing had indeed played a significant role in the Nazi regime's Jewish Affairs department.\n\n##Emigration to the United States\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing emigrated to the United States, where he settled in California. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1959 and continued to work as a consultant and businessman.\n\n#Life in the United States\n\n##Business career\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, von Bolschwing built a successful business career in the United States. He worked as a consultant to several major corporations, including IBM and General Electric. He also founded his own company, the TCI Corporation, which specialized in international trade and finance.\n\n##TCI scandal\n\nIn the 1970s, von Bolschwing's company, TCI, became embroiled in a major financial scandal. The company was accused of bribing foreign officials and engaging in other corrupt practices. Von Bolschwing himself was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faced several lawsuits. Although he was never convicted of any wrongdoing, the scandal damaged his reputation and led to the downfall of his company.\n\n##Later life and investigations\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, von Bolschwing faced renewed scrutiny over his past as a Nazi officer. The U.S. government launched several investigations into his activities, including a probe by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Although von Bolschwing denied any wrongdoing, the OSI found evidence that he had indeed played a significant role in the Nazi regime's Jewish Affairs department. Von Bolschwing died on March 7, 1982, at the age of 72.\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\n#Bibliography", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Otto_von_Bolschwing\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n##Early life and business ventures\n##Mandatory Palestine\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n#World War II\n##Romania\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n##Austria\n#Postwar espionage\n##Gehlen Organization\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n##Cover-up\n##Emigration to the United States\n#Life in the United States\n##Business career\n##TCI scandal\n##Later life and investigations\n#References\n#External links\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He served in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for over 17 years, including multiple deployments to Afghanistan.

Roberts-Smith's early life was marked by a strong sense of patriotism and a desire to serve his country.\n\nMilitary Career\n----------------\n\nRoberts-Smith enlisted in the Australian Army in 1996, at the age of 18. He underwent training at the Royal Military College Duntroon and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 2000. Roberts-Smith served in various roles, including as a platoon commander and a company second-in-command. He deployed to Afghanistan multiple times, including as part of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR).\n\n## Military Decorations\n\nRoberts-Smith's military career was marked by numerous awards and decorations. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia (V.C.) in 2011, for his actions during a battle in Afghanistan in 2010. He also received the Medal for Gallantry (M.G.), the Distinguished Service Cross (D.S.C.), and the Commendation for Distinguished Service. Roberts-Smith was also awarded the United States Army Commendation Medal and the United States Army Achievement Medal.\n\nCorporate Career\n-----------------\n\nAfter leaving the military, Roberts-Smith transitioned to a career in the corporate world. He worked as a consultant and advisor to various companies, including the Seven West Media group. In 2017, he was appointed as the general manager of the Seven Queensland television network.\n\nOther Activities\n----------------\n\nRoberts-Smith has been involved in various other activities outside of his corporate career.

Roberts-Smith has also been involved in politics, serving as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia.\n\nWar Crime Allegations\n---------------------\n\nRoberts-Smith's military career has been marred by allegations of war crimes. In 2018, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Fairfax Media group reported on allegations that Roberts-Smith had been involved in the killing of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan. The allegations were based on statements from former SASR soldiers, who claimed that Roberts-Smith had been involved in the killings.\n\n## Investigation\n\nThe allegations led to an investigation by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The investigation, known as the Brereton inquiry, was led by Justice Paul Brereton and examined allegations of war crimes committed by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. The inquiry found that there was credible evidence to support the allegations and recommended that Roberts-Smith be stripped of his V.C.\n\nDefamation Suit\n----------------\n\nIn 2020, Roberts-Smith launched a defamation suit against the ABC and the Fairfax Media group, alleging that the reports on the war crime allegations were defamatory. The suit claimed that the reports had damaged Roberts-Smith's reputation and had caused him significant financial loss.\n\n## Judgment\n\nIn 2022, the Federal Court of Australia delivered a judgment in the defamation suit. The court found that the reports on the war crime allegations were substantially true and that Roberts-Smith had been involved in the killing of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan. The court also found that the reports were not defamatory and that Roberts-Smith's reputation had not been damaged.\n\n## Appeal\n\nRoberts-Smith has appealed the judgment, arguing that the court's findings were based on flawed evidence and that the reports were defamatory. The appeal is ongoing.\n\nFurther Controversy\n-------------------\n\nRoberts-Smith has been involved in further controversy in recent years. In 2020, he was criticized for his role in a charity organization, which was found to have misused funds. Roberts-Smith has also been accused of using his military background to promote his corporate interests.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nRoberts-Smith is married to Emma Roberts-Smith and has two children. He is a keen outdoorsman and enjoys hunting and fishing. Roberts-Smith is also a strong supporter of the Australian military and has been involved in various charity organizations that support veterans.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ben_Roberts-Smith\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and family\n#Military career\n##Military decorations\n#Corporate career\n#Other activities\n#War crime allegations\n##Investigation\n#Defamation suit\n##Judgment\n##Appeal\n#Further controversy\n#Personal life\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game featured the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Kansas City Chiefs against the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Chiefs ultimately emerged victorious, defeating the Eagles 38-35 in a closely contested matchup.\n\n# Background\n\n## Host selection\n\nState Farm Stadium was chosen as the host site for Super Bowl LVII in May 2018, following a bidding process that saw the stadium compete against Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The NFL owners voted to award the game to State Farm Stadium, which had previously hosted Super Bowl XLII in 2008 and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015.\n\n## Calls for location change\n\nIn the months leading up to the game, there were calls for the NFL to relocate Super Bowl LVII due to Arizona's controversial \"show me your papers\" law, Senate Bill 1070, which was passed in 2010. The law, which was later partially struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, required law enforcement officers to ask for identification from individuals suspected of being undocumented immigrants. However, the NFL ultimately decided not to relocate the game.\n\n## Indigenous representation\n\nAs part of the Super Bowl LVII festivities, the NFL partnered with the Intertribal Sports Alliance to host a series of events celebrating Native American culture and athleticism. The events included a football clinic for Native American youth, a cultural festival, and a ceremonial blessing of the game by Native American spiritual leaders.\n\n## Stadium playing surface\n\nState Farm Stadium features a grass playing surface, which was installed specifically for Super Bowl LVII. The stadium's retractable roof was also closed for the game to provide optimal playing conditions.\n\n# Teams\n\n## Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, led by head coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, entered Super Bowl LVII as the AFC champions. The team finished the regular season with a 14-3 record, winning the AFC West division title. In the playoffs, the Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Divisional Round and the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game.\n\n## Philadelphia Eagles\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles, led by head coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts, entered Super Bowl LVII as the NFC champions. The team finished the regular season with a 14-3 record, winning the NFC East division title. In the playoffs, the Eagles defeated the New York Giants in the Divisional Round and the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game.\n\n## Playoffs\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles entered the playoffs as the number one seed in their respective conferences. The Chiefs defeated the Jaguars 27-20 in the Divisional Round, while the Eagles defeated the Giants 38-7. In the Conference Championship Games, the Chiefs defeated the Bengals 23-20, while the Eagles defeated the 49ers 31-7.\n\n## Pre-game notes\n\nSuper Bowl LVII marked the first meeting between the Chiefs and Eagles in a Super Bowl. The two teams had previously met in the regular season in 2013, with the Chiefs winning 26-16. The game was also a rematch of the 2018 AFC and NFC Championship Games, which saw the Chiefs defeat the New England Patriots and the Eagles defeat the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\n## United States\n\n### Television\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was broadcast in the United States by Fox, with play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and color commentator Greg Olsen calling the game. The broadcast team also included sideline reporters Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi.\n\n### Advertising\n\nAs with previous Super Bowls, Super Bowl LVII featured a number of high-profile advertisers, including Pepsi, Bud Light, and Doritos. The cost of a 30-second commercial during the game was reportedly around $6.5 million.\n\n### Ratings\n\nSuper Bowl LVII drew an average audience of 115.1 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched television events in U.S. history. The game also drew a 41.6 household rating and a 68 share.\n\n### Streaming\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was also available to stream online through the Fox Sports app and on various streaming platforms, including Hulu and YouTube TV.\n\n### Radio\n\nThe radio broadcast of Super Bowl LVII was carried by Westwood One, with play-by-play announcer Kevin Harlan and color commentator Trent Green calling the game.\n\n## International\n\nSuper Bowl LVII was broadcast in over 180 countries and territories around the world. In Canada, the game was broadcast by CTV, while in the United Kingdom, the game was broadcast by Sky Sports.\n\n# Entertainment\n\n## Pregame\n\nThe pre-game festivities for Super Bowl LVII included a performance by the Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Babyface, who sang \"America the Beautiful.\" The U.S. national anthem was performed by country singer Chris Stapleton.\n\n## Halftime\n\nThe halftime show for Super Bowl LVII was headlined by Rihanna, who performed a 13-minute set that included hits like \"Work,\" \"Umbrella,\" and \"Diamonds.\" The show also featured appearances by DJ Khaled and Jay-Z.\n\n# Game summary\n\n## First half\n\nThe game began with the Eagles winning the coin toss and electing to receive the ball. The Chiefs' kickoff unit forced a touchback, and the Eagles began their first drive from their own 25-yard line. The Eagles drove down to the Chiefs' 10-yard line, where quarterback Jalen Hurts was intercepted by Chiefs safety Justin Reid. The Chiefs took over and drove down to the Eagles' 20-yard line, where kicker Harrison Butker booted a 38-yard field goal to give the Chiefs a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Eagles responded with a drive of their own, culminating in a 5-yard touchdown run by Hurts to give the Eagles a 7-3 lead. The Chiefs tied the game with a 45-yard field goal by Butker, but the Eagles responded with a 22-yard field goal by kicker Jake Elliott to take a 10-7 lead.\n\nThe Chiefs took the lead for good with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Travis Kelce to give the Chiefs a 14-10 lead. The Eagles responded with a drive that stalled at the Chiefs' 40-yard line, and the Chiefs took over with just over a minute remaining in the half.\n\nMahomes led a drive that culminated in a 22-yard field goal by Butker to give the Chiefs a 17-10 lead at halftime.\n\n## Second half\n\nThe Chiefs received the ball to start the second half and drove down to the Eagles' 10-yard line, where Mahomes was intercepted by Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson.

The inquiry aimed to investigate allegations of misconduct and potential impeachable offenses committed by President Joe Biden. The inquiry was a significant development in the ongoing partisan tensions between Democrats and Republicans in the US Congress.\n\n# Background\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was not the first time a US President had faced impeachment proceedings. In 2019, President Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump was acquitted by the Senate in 2020.\n\nThe inquiry into Biden was initiated amidst a series of controversies surrounding his administration, including allegations of corruption and mishandling of foreign policy. Republican lawmakers had been critical of Biden's policies and actions, and the impeachment inquiry was seen as an escalation of their efforts to hold him accountable.\n\n# Initiation of the inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was initiated by a group of Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives. On March 10, 2023, Representative Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, announced that the committee would be launching an investigation into allegations of misconduct by President Biden.\n\nThe inquiry was authorized by a vote of the House Judiciary Committee, with all Republican members voting in favor of the investigation. Democratic members of the committee opposed the inquiry, arguing that it was a partisan witch hunt with no basis in fact.\n\n# House committee investigations\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan, took the lead in the impeachment inquiry. The committee began by issuing subpoenas to several individuals, including current and former White House officials, as well as business associates of President Biden.\n\nThe committee also held a series of hearings, featuring testimony from witnesses who claimed to have information about President Biden's alleged misconduct. The hearings were often contentious, with Republican lawmakers clashing with Democratic members over the legitimacy of the inquiry.\n\n## Witness credibility\n\nOne of the key witnesses to testify before the House Judiciary Committee was Alexander Smirnov, a former business associate of President Biden. Smirnov claimed to have information about Biden's dealings with foreign leaders and business partners, and his testimony was seen as a key part of the Republican case against the President.\n\nHowever, Smirnov's credibility was questioned by Democrats, who pointed out that he had a history of making false claims and had previously been involved in shady business dealings. Despite these concerns, Smirnov's testimony was seen as a major development in the inquiry, and his allegations against President Biden were widely reported in the media.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Republican reaction\n\nRepublican lawmakers were quick to seize on the allegations against President Biden, using them to fuel their calls for impeachment. Representative Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, argued that the President's alleged misconduct was a clear example of the kind of abuse of power that the Constitution's impeachment clause was designed to address.\n\nOther Republican lawmakers, including Senators Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz, also weighed in on the issue, arguing that President Biden's actions were a threat to national security and the integrity of the presidency.\n\n## Democratic reaction\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to defend President Biden against the allegations, arguing that the impeachment inquiry was a partisan witch hunt with no basis in fact. Representative Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Democratic minority, argued that the inquiry was a distraction from the real issues facing the country, including climate change and income inequality.\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, also defended President Biden, arguing that he had done nothing wrong and that the allegations against him were baseless.\n\n## Reaction from academics\n\nAcademics and constitutional experts were also divided on the issue, with some arguing that the allegations against President Biden did indeed rise to the level of impeachable offenses. Others argued that the inquiry was a prime example of the kind of partisan politics that had come to dominate Washington, and that it was unlikely to result in any meaningful consequences for the President.\n\n# Analysis\n\n## Legal standing\n\nThe legal standing of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was a subject of debate among constitutional experts. Some argued that the inquiry was legitimate, given the allegations of misconduct against the President. Others argued that the inquiry was a clear example of a partisan witch hunt, and that it had no basis in law.\n\nThe Constitution's impeachment clause gives the House of Representatives the power to impeach the President for \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" but it does not provide clear guidance on what constitutes an impeachable offense. As a result, the inquiry into President Biden was widely seen as a test case for the limits of presidential power and the role of Congress in holding the President accountable.\n\n# Opinion polling\n\n## Support for inquiry\n\nPublic opinion on the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was divided, with some polls showing a majority of Americans supporting the inquiry and others showing a majority opposing it. A CNN poll conducted in March 2023 found that 51% of Americans supported the inquiry, while 43% opposed it.\n\nOther polls, including a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and a Fox News poll, found similar results, with around half of Americans supporting the inquiry and around 40% opposing it.\n\n## Support for impeachment\n\nSupport for impeaching President Biden was lower than support for the inquiry, with most polls showing around 30-40% of Americans supporting impeachment. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in April 2023 found that 37% of Americans supported impeaching President Biden, while 56% opposed it.\n\nOther polls, including a Pew Research Center poll and a Gallup poll, found similar results, with around 30-40% of Americans supporting impeachment and around 50-60% opposing it.\n\n# Outcome\n\nThe outcome of the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden is still uncertain, with the House Judiciary Committee continuing to gather evidence and conduct hearings. While it is possible that the inquiry could result in articles of impeachment being drawn up against the President, it is also possible that the inquiry could ultimately come to nothing.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden is likely to have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election and the future of American politics. The inquiry has already highlighted the deep partisan divisions in Washington, and it is likely to continue to be a major issue in the months and years to come.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_inquiry_into_Joe_Biden\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks a significant departure from SZA's debut album Ctrl (2017) in terms of its experimental sound, introspective lyrics, and genre-bending style.\n\n#Background\n\nThe creation of SOS began in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. SZA had been on a hiatus from music since the release of Ctrl, and she used this time to focus on her mental health and personal growth. She began writing songs as a therapeutic outlet, exploring themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. SZA has stated that she was inspired by her own experiences, as well as the music of artists such as Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, and Björk.\n\n#Writing and production\n\nSZA wrote or co-wrote all 23 tracks on SOS, working with a variety of producers and collaborators. The album features production credits from notable producers such as Rob Bisel, Carter Lang, and Los Hendrix, among others. SZA has said that she was drawn to producers who shared her experimental approach to music, and who were willing to push the boundaries of traditional R&B and hip-hop.\n\n#Composition\n\nSOS is a genre-bending album that incorporates elements of R&B, hip-hop, rock, and electronic music. The album features a mix of upbeat and slow-paced tracks, with SZA's vocal delivery ranging from melodic singing to rap-inspired flow. Lyrically, the album is deeply personal, with SZA exploring themes of love, heartbreak, mental health, and self-discovery. The album's sound is characterized by its use of atmospheric soundscapes, distorted synths, and driving beats.\n\n#Title and artwork\n\nThe title SOS is a reference to the international distress signal, which SZA has said represents her own feelings of desperation and urgency during the creation of the album. The album's artwork features a photograph of SZA taken by artist and photographer, Dana Scruggs. The image shows SZA sitting on a diving board, surrounded by water, with a look of introspection on her face. SZA has said that the image represents her own journey of self-discovery and growth.\n\n#Promotion\n\nSOS was preceded by the release of several singles, including \"Good Days\", \"I Hate U\", and \"Kill Bill\". The album's lead single, \"Good Days\", was released in December 2020 and became a commercial success, reaching the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. SZA also performed at several music festivals and concerts in the lead-up to the album's release, including the 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.\n\n#Critical reception\n\nSOS received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised the album's experimental sound, introspective lyrics, and SZA's vocal delivery.\n\n##Reviews\n\nRolling Stone described SOS as \"a masterpiece\" and praised SZA's \"genre-bending\" approach to music. The New York Times called the album \"a triumph\" and noted SZA's \"unflinching honesty\" in her lyrics. Pitchfork described SOS as \"a sprawling, ambitious album\" and praised SZA's \" vocal range and emotional depth\".\n\n##Year-end rankings\n\nSOS appeared on several year-end lists, including those of Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and Pitchfork. The album was ranked as one of the best albums of 2022 by several publications, including Complex and Stereogum.\n\n#Awards\n\nSOS received several award nominations, including four Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best R&B Album, and Best R&B Performance. SZA won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album in 2023.\n\n#Commercial performance\n\nSOS debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 318,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Australian Albums Chart. SOS has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold over 2 million copies in the United States alone.\n\n#Track listing\n\n1. \"SOS\"\n2. \"Kill Bill\"\n3. \"Seek & Destroy\"\n4. \"Low\"\n5. \"Love Language\"\n6. \"Blind\"\n7. \"Used\" (feat.

The outbreak was characterized by a series of intense tornadoes that swept through multiple states, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, and the non-tornadic effects, as well as the aftermath and response to the disaster.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak of March 24–27, 2023, was the result of a complex weather pattern that developed over the Southern United States. A strong low-pressure system moved eastward from the Rocky Mountains, interacting with a cold front that stretched from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. This interaction led to the development of a dry line that stretched from Texas to Georgia, creating a focal point for thunderstorm activity.\n\n## March 24–25\n\nOn March 24, a strong upper-level disturbance moved into the Southern Plains, leading to the development of a mesoscale convective complex (MCC) over eastern Texas and western Louisiana. The MCC produced multiple tornadoes, including a long-lived EF3 tornado that affected several counties in Texas. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with the dry line, leading to a significant increase in thunderstorm activity.\n\n## March 26–27\n\nOn March 26, the low-pressure system moved into the Southeast, bringing with it a strong cold front. The interaction between the cold front and the dry line led to a significant increase in tornado activity, with multiple long-lived tornadoes affecting several states. The system continued to move eastward on March 27, producing additional tornadoes before finally dissipating over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 74 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority of them occurring on March 26 and 27. The tornadoes affected several states, including Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\n\n## March 24 Event\n\nA total of 10 tornadoes were confirmed on March 24, including a long-lived EF3 tornado that affected several counties in Texas.\n\n## March 25 Event\n\nA total of 5 tornadoes were confirmed on March 25, including a weak EF0 tornado that affected a rural area in Louisiana.\n\n## March 26 Event\n\nA total of 30 tornadoes were confirmed on March 26, including several long-lived tornadoes that affected multiple states. The most significant tornado of the day was a devastating EF4 tornado that affected several counties in Mississippi.\n\n## March 27 Event\n\nA total of 20 tornadoes were confirmed on March 27, including several weak tornadoes that affected rural areas in Georgia and South Carolina.\n\n## Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi\n\nA devastating EF4 tornado affected several counties in Mississippi on March 26, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The tornado touched down near Rolling Fork and moved northeast, affecting the communities of Midnight and Silver City. The tornado was estimated to have reached speeds of up to 190 mph, making it one of the strongest tornadoes of the outbreak.\n\n## Black Hawk–Winona, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado affected several counties in Mississippi on March 26, causing significant damage and injuries. The tornado touched down near Black Hawk and moved northeast, affecting the community of Winona. The tornado was estimated to have reached speeds of up to 160 mph.\n\n## Egypt–New Wren–Amory–Smithville, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado affected several counties in Mississippi on March 26, causing significant damage and injuries. The tornado touched down near Egypt and moved northeast, affecting the communities of New Wren, Amory, and Smithville. The tornado was estimated to have reached speeds of up to 150 mph.\n\n## North West Point–Smiths Mill–Pine Mountain, Georgia\n\nA long-lived EF2 tornado affected several counties in Georgia on March 27, causing significant damage and injuries. The tornado touched down near North West Point and moved northeast, affecting the communities of Smiths Mill and Pine Mountain. The tornado was estimated to have reached speeds of up to 120 mph.\n\n# Non-tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including strong winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall. Several areas experienced wind gusts of up to 70 mph, causing power outages and property damage. Large hail was also reported in several areas, causing significant damage to crops and vehicles.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the tornado outbreak was marked by widespread destruction and loss of life. Several communities were severely affected, with entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. The response to the disaster was immediate, with emergency responders and aid organizations rushing to the affected areas.\n\n## Political Response\n\nThe response to the disaster was led by local and state officials, who declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.

He is the leader of the United National Party (UNP) and has been a key figure in Sri Lankan politics for over four decades. Wickremesinghe has been a strong advocate for democracy, human rights, and economic development, and has played a crucial role in shaping the country's foreign policy and economic reforms.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Esmond Wickremesinghe and Nalini Wickremesinghe. His father was a lawyer and a politician who served as the Minister of Justice in the 1950s. Wickremesinghe received his primary education at the Royal College, Colombo, and later attended the University of Ceylon, where he earned a degree in law. He was called to the bar in 1972 and began his career as a lawyer.\n\n#Political career\n\nWickremesinghe's entry into politics was marked by his appointment as the Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment in 1977, at the age of 28. He quickly rose through the ranks of the UNP and became a key ally of President J.R. Jayewardene.\n\n##Batalanda incident\n\nIn the late 1980s, Wickremesinghe was embroiled in the Batalanda incident, a controversy surrounding the alleged torture and disappearance of several individuals at a detention center in Batalanda.

In 2020, the APD was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for allegedly engaging in racial profiling and using excessive force against Black people. The lawsuit was settled in 2022, with the APD agreeing to implement reforms and increase transparency.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn June 27, 2022, at around 12:30 a.m., APD officers attempted to stop Walker's car for a minor traffic violation. Walker, who was driving alone, fled the scene, leading the officers on a high-speed chase through the city. The chase ended when Walker's car crashed into a police cruiser in a parking lot.\n\nAccording to the APD, Walker exited the vehicle and began to flee on foot. Officers claimed that Walker made a sudden movement and reached for his waistband, prompting them to open fire. Walker was shot at least 60 times and died at the scene.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Ohio Bureau of Investigation (BBI) was called in to investigate the shooting.

It is the largest census-designated place in West Maui and the second-largest town in Maui County. Lahaina has a rich cultural heritage and was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Today, it is a popular tourist destination known for its historic sites, beautiful beaches, and vibrant arts and culture scene.\n\n# History\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe modern name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"day\" and \"haina\" meaning \"cruel\" or \"relentless\". The name is often translated as \"cruel sun\" or \"relentless sun\". In ancient times, the town was known for its sunny weather, and the name likely refers to the intense heat of the sun. The pronunciation of Lahaina is often anglicized as \"lah-HY-nah\", but the traditional Hawaiian pronunciation is more like \"lah-HEE-nah\".\n\n### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of Westerners, the town was known by several ancient names, including \"Lele\", \"Lahaina i ka uaua\" (Lahaina in the heat), and \"Mokuula\" (the island). The name \"Lahaina\" became widely used in the 19th century, and it has been the official name of the town since then.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was an important center of power and politics in ancient Hawaii. The town was ruled by a series of ali'i (chiefs) who were believed to have divine authority. One of the most famous early rulers of Lahaina was Pi'ilani, a 14th-century chief who united the island of Maui under one rule. Pi'ilani built several temples and fishponds in the Lahaina area, including the famous Mokuula temple, which was believed to be the dwelling place of the gods.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nIn 1786, Lahaina was visited by the British explorer George Vancouver, who was the first European to set foot on Maui. Vancouver was greeted by the ruler of Lahaina, Kahekili II, who was a powerful and intelligent chief. Kahekili II was interested in establishing trade relations with the British and offered Vancouver food, shelter, and other gifts.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn the late 18th century, Lahaina was conquered by Kamehameha I, the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kamehameha I established Lahaina as his temporary capital and built several temples, including the famous Luakini temple. After Kamehameha I's death, his son Kamehameha II continued to rule from Lahaina and introduced Western customs and laws to the kingdom.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by the Rev. Hiram Bingham. The missionaries were instrumental in introducing Western education, medicine, and technology to the kingdom. They also helped to spread Christianity throughout the islands, and Lahaina became a major center of missionary activity.\n\n### Whaling\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Lahaina became a major port for the whaling industry. Whalers from around the world came to Lahaina to refuel, repair their ships, and restock their supplies. The whaling industry brought wealth and prosperity to the town, but it also led to the exploitation of Hawaii's natural resources and the decline of the native population.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nIn 1820, Kamehameha III moved the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii from Lahaina to Honolulu, and Lahaina began to decline in importance. However, the town remained a major center of commerce and culture, and Kamehameha III continued to visit and support the town throughout his reign.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina experienced a renewed surge of growth and development. The town became a popular tourist destination, and many historic sites were restored and preserved. In 1962, the Lahaina Historic Trail was established, which features many of the town's historic sites and landmarks.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nOn August 8, 2023, a devastating wildfire broke out in the Lahaina area, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists. The fire burned for several days, destroying hundreds of homes and businesses and causing widespread damage to the town's infrastructure. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before it had caused an estimated $1 billion in damages and displaced thousands of people.\n\n# Geography\n\nLahaina is located on the west coast of Maui, approximately 20 miles northwest of the city of Wailuku. The town is situated in a fertile valley surrounded by the West Maui Mountains, which rise to an elevation of over 5,000 feet. The climate is tropical, with average temperatures ranging from 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year.\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with two distinct seasons: a dry season from April to October and a wet season from November to March. The average annual rainfall is around 30 inches, with most of the rain falling during the wet season. The town is also susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms, which can bring heavy rain and strong winds.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and other ethnic groups. The median age is around 40 years old, and the median household income is around $60,000.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina is known for its rich cultural heritage and vibrant arts scene. The town is home to many museums, galleries, and performance venues, including the Lahaina Heritage Museum, the Wo Hing Temple Museum, and the Maui Arts & Cultural Center. The town also hosts several festivals and events throughout the year, including the Lahaina Festival, the Maui Film Festival, and the Hawaii Food and Wine Festival.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is home to several sports teams, including the Lahaina Warriors high school football team and the Maui Heat basketball team. The town also has several parks and recreational facilities, including the Lahaina Civic Center, the Lahaina Recreation Center, and the Ka'anapali Beach Park.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in several movies and television shows, including the popular TV series \"Hawaii Five-0\" and the movie \"50 First Dates\". The town has also been the subject of several books and songs, including the novel \"From Here to Eternity\" by James Jones and the song \"Lahaina\" by the Hawaiian musician Don Ho.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Lahaina Historic Trail sign\n* Wo Hing Temple Museum\n* Lahaina Heritage Museum\n* Ka'anapali Beach Park\n* Lahaina Civic Center\n\n# See also\n\n* List of census-designated places in Hawaii\n* List of historic sites in Hawaii\n* List of museums in Hawaii\n* List of festivals in Hawaii\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article uses the traditional Hawaiian pronunciation of \"Lahaina\" as \"lah-HEE-nah\".\n* The population figures mentioned in this article are based on the 2020 census.\n* The article includes information about the 2023 wildfire, which is a recent event and may not be fully documented or updated.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Wo Hing Temple Museum\n* Lahaina Heritage Museum\n* Maui Arts & Cultural Center\n* Lahaina Festival\n* Maui Film Festival\n* Hawaii Food and Wine Festival", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lahaina,_Hawaii\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Name\n###Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n###Ancient names\n##Early rulers\n##Western contact\n###Kahekili II\n###Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n###Christian missionaries\n###Whaling\n###Kamehameha III\n###20th century\n##2023 wildfire\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n#Arts and culture\n#Sports\n#Popular culture\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a complex weather pattern that led to the development of numerous tornadoes, including several long-lived and intense ones.\n\n# Meteorological synopsis\n\n## March 21\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains on March 20, 2022, and began to move eastward across the Great Plains. As it interacted with a stationary front over the Southern United States, a complex weather pattern emerged, featuring a mix of instability, wind shear, and moisture. This setup was conducive to the development of thunderstorms, some of which would eventually produce tornadoes.\n\n## March 22\n\nAs the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, the stationary front became more active, leading to the development of a strong cold front that swept across the Southern United States. This front interacted with the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a highly unstable atmosphere that was ripe for tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Moderate Risk (4/5) for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia.\n\n## March 23\n\nThe cold front continued to move eastward, but its interaction with the warm air from the Gulf of Mexico remained strong, leading to the persistence of a highly unstable atmosphere. The SPC maintained a Moderate Risk (4/5) for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across several states, including North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. As the day progressed, the outbreak began to wind down, but not before several more tornadoes touched down.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\n## March 21 event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down on March 21, 2022, across several states, including Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that occurred in Texas, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## March 22 event\n\nA total of 35 tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down on March 22, 2022, across several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 that occurred in Louisiana, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.\n\n## March 23 event\n\nA total of 10 tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down on March 23, 2022, across several states, including North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that occurred in North Carolina, causing significant damage to homes and businesses.\n\n## Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred in Louisiana, where an EF3 tornado touched down in the Gretna-Arabi area and moved northeastward through New Orleans East. The tornado caused widespread destruction, including homes and businesses, and resulted in several fatalities.\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall. Several states experienced severe thunderstorms that caused widespread damage and disruption.\n\n# Preparations and impacts\n\nThe outbreak had significant impacts on several states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Emergency management officials issued warnings and advisories, and several schools and businesses were closed as a precaution. The American Red Cross and other disaster relief organizations were deployed to affected areas to provide assistance.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak saw widespread damage and disruption, with several states declaring states of emergency. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was deployed to affected areas to provide assistance, and several non-profit organizations provided aid to affected communities.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornadoes in the United States\n* Severe weather in the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the tornado outbreak of March 21–23, 2022.

The incident took place during the 2022 Azadi March-II, a protest march led by Khan against the government of Shehbaz Sharif. The assassination attempt left Khan wounded and sparked widespread condemnation and protests across the country.\n\n# Background\n\n## Ousting of Imran Khan\n\nImran Khan was ousted as Prime Minister of Pakistan on April 10, 2022, through a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote was held after a coalition of opposition parties, led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), submitted a no-confidence motion against Khan's government. The motion was passed with 174 votes in favor, two more than the required majority.\n\nKhan's ouster led to widespread protests and demonstrations across the country, with his supporters accusing the opposition parties of conspiring against him. Khan himself claimed that the United States was involved in a conspiracy to remove him from power, a claim that was denied by the US State Department.\n\n## 2022 Azadi March-II\n\nIn response to his ouster, Khan announced the 2022 Azadi March-II, a protest march from Lahore to Islamabad to demand new elections and the resignation of the Sharif government. The march began on October 28, 2022, and was expected to culminate in a massive rally in Islamabad on November 4, 2022.\n\nThe march was seen as a test of Khan's popularity and a challenge to the Sharif government, which had been facing criticism for its handling of the economy and other issues. The government had banned the march, citing security concerns, but Khan's supporters had vowed to press on.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn November 3, 2022, as Khan's convoy was passing through Wazirabad, Punjab, a gunman opened fire on the vehicles. Khan was hit in the leg and was rushed to a hospital in Lahore for treatment. Several others were also injured in the shooting.\n\nThe attack was widely condemned, with many calling it an attempt to silence Khan and undermine his movement. Khan's supporters accused the government of being behind the attack, while the government denied any involvement.\n\n# Suspects\n\nThe police arrested several suspects in connection with the shooting, including a man named Faisal Butt, who was identified as the main suspect. Butt was reportedly a supporter of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Khan's party, but had been expelled from the party for disciplinary reasons.\n\nThe police said that Butt had confessed to the crime, claiming that he had acted alone and was motivated by a desire for revenge against Khan. However, Khan's supporters and many others raised questions about the official narrative, pointing to inconsistencies in the police account and suggesting that the attack may have been more complex and involved more people.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe attempted assassination of Imran Khan sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Pakistan. Khan's supporters took to the streets, protesting against the government and demanding justice for their leader. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were reports of clashes between protesters and police in some areas.\n\nMany Pakistani politicians and public figures condemned the attack, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who described it as a \"heinous act of terrorism.\" The Pakistan Army also issued a statement, condemning the attack and expressing its support for Khan's right to peaceful protest.\n\nHowever, some opposition politicians and commentators suggested that Khan was to blame for the attack, accusing him of creating a culture of violence and intolerance. Khan's supporters rejected these claims, pointing to his long record of advocating for non-violent protest and peaceful change.\n\n## International\n\nThe attempted assassination of Imran Khan also drew international attention and condemnation.

It was one of the two Banats that made up the Habsburgs' territorial gains in the region, the other being the Banat of Temeschwar.\n\n# History\n\n## Austrian conquest\n\nIn 1718, the Habsburgs, led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-1718, gaining control of a significant portion of the Balkans. The Treaty of Passarowitz, signed on July 21, 1718, marked the beginning of Habsburg rule in the region. The Banat of Craiova was established as a military border province, with its capital in the city of Craiova.\n\n## Government creation\n\nThe Habsburgs created a new administrative system in the Banat of Craiova, modeled after the military border system used in other parts of the empire. The province was divided into districts, each governed by a military commander. The government was responsible for maintaining order, collecting taxes, and providing defense against Ottoman attacks. The Habsburgs also encouraged the settlement of colonists from other parts of the empire, including Germans, Hungarians, and Serbs.\n\n## Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nThe establishment of the Banat of Craiova was met with resistance from the local boyar class, who had traditionally held power in the region. The boyars saw the Habsburgs as foreign occupiers and resented the imposition of a new administrative system. Peasants also resisted the new government, which imposed heavy taxes and forced labor. In 1720, a rebellion broke out in the Banat, led by a group of boyars and peasants. The rebellion was eventually put down, but it marked the beginning of a long period of tension between the Habsburgs and the local population.\n\n## Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite the initial resistance, the Habsburgs were able to consolidate their power in the Banat of Craiova over the next several decades. They invested in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and canals, and encouraged the development of trade and commerce. The province became an important center for the production of grain, livestock, and textiles. The Habsburgs also established a system of education and healthcare, which helped to improve living standards in the region.\n\n## Ottoman reconquest\n\nIn 1737, the Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Mahmud I, launched a series of attacks on the Habsburgs' territorial gains in the Balkans. The Banat of Craiova was one of the first provinces to fall, and by 1739, the entire region was back under Ottoman control. The Habsburgs were forced to cede the Banat of Craiova, along with other territories, in the Treaty of Belgrade, signed on September 18, 1739.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## \"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was an important precedent for the Habsburgs' later colonial endeavors. The experience of governing a diverse population in a distant region helped to shape the Habsburgs' approach to colonial administration. The use of a military border system, the encouragement of colonization, and the investment in infrastructure were all strategies that would be employed in later colonial ventures.\n\n## Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the relatively short period of Habsburg rule in the Banat of Craiova, the region retained a number of cultural and architectural legacies from the period. Many of the buildings constructed during the Habsburg period, including churches, monasteries, and public buildings, still stand today. The region also retained a number of cultural traditions, including folk music and dance, which were influenced by the Habsburgs' cultural policies.\n\n# Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had its own coat of arms, which featured a shield with a red and gold checkerboard pattern, surmounted by a crown. The coat of arms was used on official documents, coins, and other symbols of the province.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was an important chapter in the history of the Habsburg Monarchy, marking the beginning of the empire's expansion into the Balkans. Despite its relatively short existence, the province left a lasting legacy in the region, shaping the course of cultural, economic, and political development for centuries to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
