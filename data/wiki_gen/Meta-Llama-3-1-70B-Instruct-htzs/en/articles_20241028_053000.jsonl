It began on June 1, 2023, and ended on November 30, 2023. This season was marked by a significant number of storms, including several major hurricanes that caused extensive damage and loss of life.\n\n# Seasonal forecasts\n\n## Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, several organizations released forecasts predicting the level of activity for the upcoming season. These forecasts were based on various climate models and statistical analyses. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted a near-normal to above-normal season, with 14-21 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 2-5 major hurricanes. Other organizations, such as the Weather Channel and AccuWeather, also released forecasts, which were generally consistent with NOAA's predictions.\n\n## Mid-season forecasts\n\nAs the season progressed, forecasts were updated to reflect the current state of the atmosphere and ocean. In August, NOAA released an updated forecast, which predicted an above-normal season, with 16-22 named storms, 7-11 hurricanes, and 3-6 major hurricanes. This updated forecast was based on the continued presence of a La Niña event in the Pacific, which was expected to enhance hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\n\n# Seasonal summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was marked by a complex interplay of atmospheric and oceanic factors. A La Niña event in the Pacific, which began in the fall of 2022, continued to influence the atmosphere and ocean throughout the 2023 hurricane season. This event led to an increase in wind shear over the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, which suppressed hurricane activity in these regions. However, the La Niña event also led to an increase in moisture and instability over the Atlantic, which enhanced hurricane activity in this region.\n\n## Early activity\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season began with a slow start, with only a few named storms forming in June and July. The first named storm of the season was Tropical Storm Arlene, which formed on June 2. This storm brought heavy rain and strong winds to the southeastern United States. The next named storm was Tropical Storm Bret, which formed on June 19. This storm passed close to the Lesser Antilles, causing strong winds and rough seas.\n\n## Peak to late activity\n\nAs the season progressed, the number of named storms increased, with several major hurricanes forming in August and September. Hurricane Don, which formed on August 1, was the first major hurricane of the season. This storm passed close to the southeastern United States, causing strong winds and heavy rain. The next major hurricane was Hurricane Idalia, which formed on August 20. This storm passed close to the northeastern United States, causing strong winds and coastal flooding.\n\n# Systems\n\n## Unnamed subtropical storm\n\nThe first system of the season was an unnamed subtropical storm that formed on May 25.

The earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life, with significant impacts on the local population, infrastructure, and economy.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, an area of significant tectonic activity. The region is situated near the boundary between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, which have been interacting for millions of years. This interaction has resulted in the formation of several major fault lines, including the Atlas Fault, which runs through the Al Haouz Province. The region's geology is characterized by a complex mixture of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks, which have been shaped by millions of years of tectonic activity.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was a shallow, crustal earthquake that occurred at a depth of approximately 10 km. The earthquake's focal mechanism indicated that it was a thrust faulting event, with the Eurasian plate being pushed beneath the African plate. This type of faulting is consistent with the regional tectonic setting and is likely to have been triggered by the ongoing interaction between the two plates.\n\n## Ground Effects\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread ground shaking, with the strongest effects felt in the Al Haouz Province. The shaking was intense enough to cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and natural features. The earthquake also triggered several landslides and rockfalls, which blocked roads and rivers, and caused additional damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\n# Damage and Casualties\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life. The earthquake damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings, including homes, schools, hospitals, and government buildings. The destruction was particularly severe in rural areas, where many buildings were not designed or constructed to withstand earthquakes. The earthquake also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\nAccording to official reports, the earthquake resulted in over 2,000 fatalities and more than 5,000 injuries. Many people were trapped under rubble or debris, and emergency responders faced significant challenges in reaching affected areas.\n\n# Search and Rescue\n\nEmergency responders from Morocco and around the world launched a massive search and rescue operation in the aftermath of the earthquake. Rescue teams worked tirelessly to locate and extract survivors from the rubble, often using specialized equipment and techniques to reach trapped individuals. The search and rescue effort was complicated by difficult terrain, limited access to affected areas, and the risk of further earthquakes.\n\n# International Response\n\nThe international community responded quickly and generously to the disaster, with many countries offering aid, assistance, and condolences. Emergency responders, aid workers, and humanitarian organizations from around the world deployed to Morocco to support the relief effort. The United Nations played a key role in coordinating the international response, working closely with the Moroccan government and other stakeholders to ensure a unified and effective response.\n\n# Recovery and Assistance\n\nThe recovery effort following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was a long-term process that required significant resources and support. The Moroccan government, with assistance from the international community, worked to provide emergency aid, shelter, and support to affected individuals and communities. The government also established a number of initiatives to support the recovery effort, including programs to provide financial assistance, rebuild infrastructure, and restore basic services.\n\n## International Aid\n\nThe international community provided significant aid and assistance to support the recovery effort. Many countries donated funds, goods, and services to support affected individuals and communities. Humanitarian organizations, such as the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), played a key role in delivering aid and support to affected areas.\n\n## Crisis Management\n\nThe Moroccan government, with support from the international community, established a crisis management system to coordinate the response to the disaster. The system included a number of key components, including emergency response protocols, communication networks, and coordination mechanisms. The crisis management system played a critical role in ensuring a unified and effective response to the disaster.\n\n## Protests\n\nIn the aftermath of the earthquake, there were protests in some affected areas, with residents expressing frustration and anger over the government's response to the disaster. The protests were largely peaceful, but they highlighted the need for greater transparency, accountability, and support for affected individuals and communities.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nThe reconstruction effort following the 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was a long-term process that required significant resources and support. The Moroccan government, with assistance from the international community, worked to rebuild infrastructure, restore basic services, and support affected individuals and communities. The reconstruction effort included a number of key initiatives, such as programs to rebuild homes, restore utilities, and support local businesses.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Morocco\n* 1960 Agadir earthquake\n* 2004 Chlef earthquake\n\n# References\n\n# External Links\n\n* ReliefWeb: 2023 Al Haouz earthquake\n* UNOCHA: 2023 Al Haouz earthquake\n* Moroccan Government: 2023 Al Haouz earthquake response", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Al_Haouz_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Mechanism\n##Ground effects\n#Damage and casualties\n#Search and rescue\n#International response\n#Recovery and assistance\n#Aid and crisis management\n##International aid\n##Crisis management\n##Protests\n##Reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was a major power in Southeast Asia during its time, playing a significant role in the region's politics, economy, and culture. The kingdom was known for its strong military, efficient administration, and rich cultural heritage. This article provides an overview of the Ayutthaya Kingdom's history, government, politics, culture, and economy.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\n### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, the region was inhabited by various cities and kingdoms. The city of Lavo, which was established in the 7th century, was a major center of trade and commerce. Another significant city was Suphanburi, which was an important cultural and intellectual center.\n\n### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I. The king, who was also known as Uthong, established the city of Ayutthaya as the capital of his kingdom. The city was strategically located on an island in the Chao Phraya River, which provided natural protection and facilitated trade and commerce.\n\n## Early maritime dominance\n\nDuring the early years of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the kingdom focused on expanding its maritime trade and commerce. The kingdom established trade relationships with neighboring countries, including China, India, and the Malay states. Ayutthaya's strategic location on the Chao Phraya River made it an important center for trade and commerce in the region.\n\n## Age of warfare\n\n### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nIn the 15th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to shift its focus from maritime trade to the development of its hinterland. The kingdom expanded its territory through military conquests, incorporating neighboring cities and kingdoms into its territory. This marked the beginning of Ayutthaya's transition from a maritime state to a hinterland state.\n\n### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nAs the Ayutthaya Kingdom expanded its territory, the kingdom's administration became more centralized. The king and his officials exercised control over the kingdom's provinces and cities. The Northern lords, who were the kingdom's most powerful nobles, played a significant role in the kingdom's administration and military.\n\n### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the 16th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom faced a series of wars with the Burmese kingdom of Pegu. The Burmese kingdom, which was a major power in Southeast Asia at the time, launched several invasions of Ayutthaya. The kingdom's military, led by the Northern lords, successfully defended Ayutthaya against the Burmese invasions.\n\n## Peace and commerce\n\n### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nFollowing the Burmese wars, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of peace and prosperity. The kingdom's economy flourished, and trade and commerce with neighboring countries increased. The kingdom's culture also flourished, with significant advances in art, literature, and architecture.\n\n### Persian and French influences\n\nDuring this period, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was influenced by Persian and French cultures. Persian merchants and traders introduced new technologies and ideas to the kingdom, while French missionaries introduced Christianity to the kingdom.\n\n## Late Ayutthaya period\n\n### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to prosper. The kingdom's economy grew, and trade and commerce with China increased. Chinese merchants and traders introduced new technologies and ideas to the kingdom, while Chinese culture had a significant impact on the kingdom's art, literature, and architecture.\n\n### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nHowever, the kingdom also faced succession conflicts and corruption. The kingdom's nobles and officials often competed for power and influence, leading to instability and corruption.\n\n### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nDuring this period, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was introduced to capitalism. The kingdom's economy became more market-oriented, and the rise of a wealthy middle class led to the growth of a proto-nationalist movement.\n\n### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's nobility played a significant role in the kingdom's administration and military. The kingdom's nobles were also patrons of Buddhism, and the kingdom's monasteries and temples became centers of learning and culture.\n\n### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nBy the mid-18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was facing significant military and political challenges. The kingdom's military was weakened, and the kingdom's nobles and officials were divided. The kingdom was also facing pressure from neighboring countries, including the Burmese kingdom of Pegu.\n\n## Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1767, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was conquered by the Burmese kingdom of Pegu. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, was destroyed, and the kingdom's nobles and officials were either killed or taken captive. The fall of Ayutthaya marked the end of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and the beginning of a new era in Thai history.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Ayutthaya had significant consequences for the region. The Burmese kingdom of Pegu became a dominant power in Southeast Asia, while the Thai people were forced to adapt to a new era of foreign rule. However, the legacy of the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to shape Thai culture and identity, and the kingdom's history remains an important part of Thai heritage.\n\n# Government\n\n## Kings\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was a monarchical state, with the king serving as the head of state and government. The king was considered to be a divine ruler, with absolute power and authority.\n\n## Mandala system\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was organized according to the mandala system, which was a system of administration and governance used in ancient India and Southeast Asia. The kingdom was divided into provinces and cities, each of which was governed by a governor or viceroy.\n\n# Political development\n\n## Social classes\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was a hierarchical society, with a system of social classes. The kingdom's nobles and officials were at the top of the social hierarchy, followed by the kingdom's merchants and traders. The kingdom's peasants and laborers were at the bottom of the social hierarchy.\n\n## Ranking of social classes\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom's social classes were ranked according to a system of titles and honors.

The film stars Chiranjeevi and Ram Charan in the lead roles, with Kajal Aggarwal and Pooja Hegde playing the female leads. The movie follows the story of a middle-aged Naxalite-turned-social reformer who launches a fight against the Endowments Department over the misappropriation of temple funds and donations.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Dharmasthali, where the local temple is a major source of revenue for the Endowments Department. The story revolves around Acharya (Chiranjeevi), a former Naxalite who has renounced violence and is now a social reformer. He becomes aware of the large-scale corruption and embezzlement of temple funds by the Endowments Department officials. Acharya decides to take on the corrupt officials and fight for the rights of the people.\n\nAs Acharya's movement gains momentum, he is joined by his son Siddha (Ram Charan), who is a student leader. Siddha is initially hesitant to join his father's crusade but eventually becomes an integral part of the movement. The mother-son duo faces stiff resistance from the corrupt officials, who will stop at nothing to maintain their grip on power.\n\nThe film's narrative is interspersed with action sequences, songs, and emotional moments, which add to the overall drama. The climax features an intense confrontation between Acharya and the main antagonist, which forms the crux of the story.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Chiranjeevi as Acharya\n* Ram Charan as Siddha, Acharya's son\n* Kajal Aggarwal as Neelambari, a journalist\n* Pooja Hegde as Sathya, Siddha's love interest\n* Sonu Sood as Basava, the main antagonist\n* Jisshu Sengupta as Home Minister\n* Nassar as the Chief Minister\n* Vennela Kishore as a CBI officer\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was announced in 2019, with Koratala Siva writing and directing the project.

The court stayed the film's release, pending an investigation. The stay was later lifted, and the film was released as scheduled.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's music was composed by Mani Sharma, with lyrics written by Ramajogayya Sastry and Bhaskarabhatla.

The conflict has its roots in the country's complex history, cultural ties, and geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West. The war has resulted in significant human suffering, economic losses, and a substantial impact on international relations.\n\n#Background\n\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine gained independence. However, the country's early years were marked by economic struggles, corruption, and a lack of clear direction. The Orange Revolution in 2004 brought about significant changes, with the pro-European Union and pro-NATO government of Viktor Yushchenko coming to power. This shift in Ukraine's foreign policy orientation was seen as a threat by Russia, which had long considered Ukraine to be within its sphere of influence.\n\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union, opting instead for closer ties with Russia. This decision sparked widespread protests in Kyiv's Independence Square, known as the Euromaidan. The protests ultimately led to Yanukovych's ouster in February 2014. However, this event was met with resistance from pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine, who saw the new government as illegitimate and a threat to their interests.\n\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia had maintained a significant military presence in Crimea since the Soviet era, with the port city of Sevastopol serving as the base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Russian military had a lease agreement with Ukraine to maintain this presence until 2042. However, following the ouster of Yanukovych, Russian troops began to take control of key infrastructure and government buildings in Crimea.\n\n##Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe question of whether the conflict between Russia and Ukraine constitutes a war is a matter of debate. Ukraine has consistently referred to the conflict as a \"war\" and has accused Russia of aggression. Russia, on the other hand, has denied any involvement in the conflict, characterizing it as an internal Ukrainian matter. The international community has also been divided on the issue, with some countries recognizing the conflict as a war and others refraining from doing so.\n\n#History\n\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, with the Russian parliament approving the annexation treaty. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with the United Nations General Assembly adopting a resolution that affirmed Ukraine's territorial integrity. The annexation was also met with significant economic sanctions from the United States and the European Union.\n\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea, pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine began to organize protests and seize government buildings. The Ukrainian government responded with force, leading to clashes between the two sides.\n\n###Armed conflict\n\nIn April 2014, the conflict in eastern Ukraine escalated into an armed conflict, with the Ukrainian military launching an \"anti-terrorist operation\" against pro-Russian separatists. The conflict resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, marking a significant escalation of the conflict. The Russian military intervention was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and the European Union imposing further economic sanctions.\n\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian forces launched an offensive against pro-Russian separatists in the city of Mariupol. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire agreement, known as the Minsk Protocol, which was brokered by Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, fighting continued in eastern Ukraine, with both sides accusing each other of violations. In February 2015, a new ceasefire agreement, known as Minsk II, was signed, which included provisions for the withdrawal of heavy artillery and the establishment of a buffer zone.\n\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, Russian forces seized three Ukrainian naval vessels that were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and the European Union imposing further economic sanctions.\n\n###2019–2020\n\nDespite ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, the conflict saw a relative decrease in violence in 2019 and 2020. However, the conflict remained unresolved, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations.\n\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\n###Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia massed troops along the Ukrainian border, sparking concerns of a potential invasion. The United States and the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia, while also providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\n###Escalation\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with missile strikes and ground assaults on multiple fronts. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, with the United States and the European Union imposing significant economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n###Full-scale invasion\n\nThe invasion resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire. The conflict also sparked a significant refugee crisis, with millions of Ukrainians fleeing their homes.\n\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n\nIn the months following the invasion, Ukrainian forces launched a series of counteroffensives, which resulted in significant gains against Russian forces. However, the conflict remained unresolved, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations.\n\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n\nIn December 2023, Russian forces launched a series of campaigns in eastern Ukraine, which were met with resistance from Ukrainian forces. The conflict remains ongoing, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations.\n\n#Human rights violations\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been marked by significant human rights violations, including reports of torture, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial killings. Both sides have been accused of committing human rights abuses, with the international community calling for accountability.\n\n#Related issues\n\n##Spillover\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has resulted in a significant spillover effect, with the conflict affecting neighboring countries and the wider region. The conflict has also sparked concerns of a potential escalation into a broader conflict involving other countries.\n\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has also been marked by gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine, with the two countries disagreeing over the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine. In September 2022, the Nord Stream pipeline, which carries Russian gas to Europe, was sabotaged, sparking concerns of a potential escalation.\n\n##Hybrid warfare\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been characterized as a form of hybrid warfare, with Russia using a combination of conventional and non-conventional tactics to achieve its objectives. The conflict has also seen the use of cyber warfare and disinformation campaigns.\n\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n\nRussia has been accused of launching propaganda and disinformation campaigns to influence public opinion and shape the narrative of the conflict. The international community has condemned these efforts, with some countries imposing sanctions on Russian media outlets.\n\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has also been marked by tensions between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The Russian Orthodox Church has been accused of supporting Russian aggression in Ukraine, while the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been seen as a symbol of Ukrainian identity.\n\n##Russia–NATO relations\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has also had a significant impact on Russia–NATO relations, with the two sides disagreeing over the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe. The conflict has sparked concerns of a potential escalation into a broader conflict involving NATO.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n\n###Ukrainian response\n\nThe Ukrainian government condemned the annexation of Crimea, with the Ukrainian parliament voting to terminate the lease agreement with Russia.\n\n###NATO and United States military response\n\nNATO and the United States condemned the annexation, with NATO imposing economic sanctions on Russia. The United States also imposed economic sanctions on Russia and provided military aid to Ukraine.\n\n###Financial markets\n\nThe annexation resulted in significant economic losses for Ukraine, with the Ukrainian economy contracting by over 6% in 2014.\n\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine was widely condemned by the Ukrainian public, with many Ukrainians seeing the conflict as a threat to Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n###Russian public opinion\n\nThe conflict was also widely condemned by the Russian public, with many Russians seeing the conflict as a threat to Russian interests.\n\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n\nThe invasion was widely condemned by the Ukrainian public, with many Ukrainians seeing the invasion as a threat to Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n###Russian public opinion\n\nThe invasion was also widely condemned by the Russian public, with many Russians seeing the invasion as a threat to Russian interests.\n\n###United States\n\nThe United States condemned the invasion, with the U.S. government imposing economic sanctions on Russia and providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\n###Russian military suppliers\n\nThe invasion resulted in significant economic losses for Russian military suppliers, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n###United Nations\n\nThe United Nations condemned the invasion, with the U.N.

The earthquake was a shallow, high-impact event that caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the affected areas.\n\n#Tectonic setting\n\nIndonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity that encircles the Pacific Ocean. The country is situated on the boundary between several tectonic plates, including the Eurasian, Australian, and Philippine Sea plates. This complex tectonic setting makes Indonesia prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The 2022 West Java earthquake occurred in the southern part of the province, near the city of Cianjur, which is located in a seismically active region.\n\n#Earthquake\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale and a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Cianjur Regency, about 70 kilometers southeast of the provincial capital, Bandung. The earthquake struck at 13:21 local time, causing widespread shaking and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and homes. The earthquake was followed by several aftershocks, including a 3.9-magnitude quake that struck about an hour after the main event.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a significant impact on the affected areas, causing widespread destruction and displacement of communities. The earthquake damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, buildings, and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public facilities. Many people were left without access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and healthcare. The earthquake also disrupted economic activities, including agriculture, industry, and trade.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake resulted in significant loss of life and injury. According to official reports, at least 602 people were killed, and over 7,000 were injured in the disaster. Many of the victims were trapped under rubble or debris, while others succumbed to injuries sustained during the earthquake.\n\n##Search and rescue\n\nSearch and rescue operations were launched immediately after the earthquake, with teams from the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), the military, and local authorities working together to locate and retrieve trapped survivors. The search and rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the affected areas, lack of access to damaged infrastructure, and limited resources.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 West Java earthquake saw a massive response from the government, humanitarian organizations, and local communities. Emergency aid, including food, water, shelter, and medical care, was provided to affected communities. The government also launched a reconstruction program to rebuild damaged infrastructure and homes.\n\n##Reconstruction\n\nThe reconstruction program aimed to rebuild and restore damaged infrastructure, homes, and public facilities in the affected areas. The program included the construction of temporary shelters, rehabilitation of damaged buildings, and restoration of basic services like water, electricity, and sanitation. The government also provided financial assistance to affected communities to support their recovery and rebuilding efforts.\n\n#Response\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was led by the Indonesian government, with support from humanitarian organizations, local authorities, and the international community. The government deployed emergency responders, including search and rescue teams, medical personnel, and aid workers, to the affected areas.\n\n##International aid\n\nThe international community provided significant aid and support to Indonesia in response to the earthquake. Countries like Australia, the United States, Japan, and Singapore provided financial assistance, humanitarian aid, and technical expertise to support the relief and reconstruction efforts.\n\n#Controversy\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was not without controversy. Some critics argued that the government's response was slow and inadequate, while others raised concerns about the distribution of aid and the transparency of the relief efforts.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake\n* 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full complexity of the 2022 West Java earthquake or its aftermath.\n\n#External links\n\n* Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB)\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n* International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_West_Java_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n#Impact\n#Casualties\n##Search and rescue\n#Aftermath\n##Reconstruction\n#Response\n##International aid\n#Controversy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused widespread damage and loss of life, with its strong winds and heavy rainfall affecting millions of people. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations, impact, aftermath, retirement, and related topics.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\n## Formation and intensification\n\nTropical Storm Megi formed on April 8, 2022, as a low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km east of the Philippines. The system gradually intensified into a tropical depression, with sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) and a central pressure of 1004 hPa. Over the next 24 hours, the storm strengthened further, becoming a tropical storm with sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\n## Movement and landfall\n\nMegi moved westward, crossing the eastern coast of Samar, Philippines, on April 10. The storm made landfall as a tropical storm, with sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) and a central pressure of 990 hPa. After crossing the Philippines, Megi entered the South China Sea, where it intensified further, reaching its peak intensity as a severe tropical storm with sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a central pressure of 975 hPa.\n\n## Dissipation\n\nMegi made landfall in China's Fujian Province on April 12, as a tropical storm, with sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). The storm rapidly weakened over land, dissipating into a low-pressure area on April 13.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued several warnings and advisories as Megi approached the country. Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals were raised over several provinces, with Signal No. 2 (sustained winds of 61-120 km/h) issued over the eastern coast of Samar. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency operations center, with personnel and equipment on standby for response and relief efforts.\n\n## China\n\nThe China Meteorological Administration (CMA) issued a yellow alert for Megi, warning of strong winds and heavy rainfall. The Fujian Provincial Government activated its emergency response plan, with personnel and equipment deployed to affected areas.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Philippines\n\nMegi caused widespread damage and disruption in the Philippines, particularly in the eastern coast of Samar. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected over 200,000 people, with 10 reported deaths and 20 injured. Over 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, with several roads and bridges impassable due to flooding and landslides. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of over PHP 1 billion (USD 20 million).\n\n## China\n\nMegi caused significant damage and disruption in China's Fujian Province, particularly in the cities of Fuzhou and Quanzhou. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected over 1 million people, with 5 reported deaths and 10 injured. Over 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, with several roads and highways impassable due to flooding and landslides. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of over CNY 1 billion (USD 150 million).\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Relief efforts\n\nThe Philippine and Chinese governments deployed relief teams and supplies to affected areas, with food, shelter, and medical aid provided to those in need. The international community also provided assistance, with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting relief efforts.\n\n## Economic impact\n\nThe economic impact of Megi was significant, with estimated losses of over PHP 2 billion (USD 40 million) in the Philippines and CNY 2 billion (USD 300 million) in China. The storm also affected several industries, including agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.\n\n# Retirement\n\nThe name \"Megi\" was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names in the western Pacific Ocean, due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the storm. The name was replaced by \"Mangkhut\", which was used for a tropical cyclone in 2018.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n* Tropical cyclones in China\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per your request*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per your request*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The story centers around Jack Conrad (played by Brad Pitt), a silent film star struggling to adapt to the new world of talkies. He is married to Ina Conrad (played by Olivia Wilde), a former actress who now focuses on her family life.\n\nThe story also follows Manny Torres (played by Diego Calva), a young Mexican immigrant who arrives in Hollywood with dreams of becoming a film star. He becomes friends with Jack and becomes embroiled in his personal life. The film also explores the life of Nellie LaRoy (played by Margot Robbie), a young and ambitious actress who rises to fame during the transition to talkies.\n\nThe film's narrative is non-linear, jumping back and forth in time to explore the characters' pasts and their relationships with each other. Along the way, the film tackles themes such as the decline of the silent film era, the rise of talkies, and the personal struggles of the characters.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Olivia Wilde as Ina Conrad\n* Samara Weaving as Constance Moore\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer\n* Li Jun Li as Lady Fay Zhu\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nDamien Chazelle began working on the script for Babylon in 2019.

The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Chazelle worked with cinematographer Linus Sandgren to capture the look and feel of 1920s Hollywood.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who previously collaborated with Chazelle on La La Land and First Man. The score incorporates jazz and orchestral elements to evoke the spirit of 1920s Hollywood.\n\n# Themes\n\nBabylon explores several themes, including the decline of the silent film era and the rise of talkies. The film also delves into the personal struggles of the characters, including their relationships and addictions. The film is also a commentary on the excesses of Hollywood and the corrupting influence of fame.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in the United States on December 23, 2022. The film received a wide release, playing in over 3,000 theaters.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on February 21, 2023, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 21, 2023.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was launched in the summer of 2022, with the release of the first trailer.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n=====================\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a hypothetical fundamental object that is proposed to be the building block of black holes and other compact objects. The concept of fuzzballs was introduced to resolve the black hole information paradox and to provide a more fundamental understanding of the nature of spacetime.\n\nPhysical properties\n-----------------\n\nThe physical properties of fuzzballs are a subject of ongoing research and debate in the string theory community.\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be composed of extremely dense, vibrational modes of strings. These strings are the fundamental objects of string theory, and they give rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. In the context of fuzzballs, the strings are densely packed and vibrate at extremely high frequencies, creating a \"fuzzy\" structure that is thought to be the fundamental building block of black holes and other compact objects.\n\nThe exact composition of fuzzballs is still not well understood and is the subject of ongoing research. However, it is thought that they are made up of a combination of open and closed strings, as well as other objects such as D-branes and other higher-dimensional objects.\n\n### Densities\n\nFuzzballs are thought to be extremely dense objects, with densities that are many orders of magnitude higher than those of normal matter. This high density is due to the extremely high frequency of the vibrational modes of the strings, which creates a region of spacetime that is highly curved and condensed.\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is thought to be related to the entropy of the object, which is a measure of the amount of information that is contained within it. The entropy of a fuzzball is thought to be proportional to the surface area of the object, rather than its volume, which is a characteristic that is shared by black holes.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nFuzzballs have been proposed as a possible explanation for the collapse of neutron stars. Neutron stars are incredibly dense objects that are formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion. However, if the neutron star is massive enough, it will eventually collapse under its own gravity, forming a black hole.\n\nFuzzballs provide a possible explanation for this collapse, as they are thought to be the fundamental building blocks of black holes. According to this idea, the neutron star collapses into a fuzzball, which is a region of spacetime that is highly curved and condensed. The fuzzball then grows and expands, eventually forming a black hole.\n\nInformation paradox\n-----------------\n\nThe information paradox is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics that arises when considering the behavior of black holes. The paradox states that information that falls into a black hole is lost forever, which is a consequence of the no-hair theorem.\n\nThe no-hair theorem states that a black hole has only three hairs: its mass, charge, and angular momentum. This means that any information that falls into a black hole is lost, as it is not encoded in these three hairs. However, this creates a problem, as the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that information cannot be destroyed.\n\nFuzzballs provide a possible solution to the information paradox, as they are thought to be the fundamental building blocks of black holes. According to this idea, the information that falls into a black hole is not lost, but is instead encoded in the fuzzball. The fuzzball then grows and expands, eventually forming a black hole, which contains the information that was originally lost.\n\nTestability of the theory\n------------------------\n\nThe testability of fuzzball theory is still an open question. While fuzzballs provide a possible solution to the information paradox, they are still a highly speculative idea, and there is currently no experimental evidence to support them.\n\nHowever, there are several ways in which fuzzball theory could be tested in the future. For example, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and VIRGO provide a new way to study black holes and test the predictions of fuzzball theory. Additionally, future experiments such as the Square Kilometre Array may be able to detect the faint radiation that is predicted to be emitted by fuzzballs.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on April 23, 1981, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has spent his life pushing the limits of human potential on the rock, redefining the sport of climbing, and inspiring countless others to follow in his footsteps.\n\n# Early life\n\nSharma began climbing at the age of 12, when his parents took him to the local climbing gym in Santa Cruz. He quickly fell in love with the sport, drawn to the physical and mental challenges it presented. Sharma's early climbing experiences were shaped by the laid-back, beach-town culture of Santa Cruz, where he spent countless hours climbing and surfing with his friends. As he grew older, Sharma began to take climbing more seriously, dedicating himself to training and honing his skills.\n\n# Climbing career\n\nSharma's climbing career can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant achievements and shifts in his approach to the sport.\n\n## 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's early career was marked by a string of impressive ascents in the United States and abroad. In 1996, at the age of 15, he made the first ascent of \"Narcissus\" (5.13d), a difficult sport climb in the Shawangunks, New York. Over the next several years, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was thought possible, establishing new routes and repeating existing ones with ease.\n\nIn 2000, Sharma traveled to Spain, where he made the first ascent of \"Biographie\" (5.15a), a groundbreaking route in the Ceüse region. This ascent marked a turning point in Sharma's career, as he began to gain international recognition and establish himself as one of the world's top climbers.\n\n## 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nIn 2002, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Realization\" (5.15a), a notorious route in the Verdon Gorge, France. This ascent cemented Sharma's reputation as one of the world's most talented climbers and marked the beginning of a new era in his career.\n\nOver the next several years, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was possible, establishing new routes and repeating existing ones with ease. In 2007, he made the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love\" (5.15b), a massive, 250-foot route in the Clark Mountain area of California. This ascent marked a new benchmark in climbing, as Sharma became the first person to climb a route of such magnitude.\n\n## 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nIn 2008, Sharma traveled to Oliana, Spain, where he made the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura\" (5.15c), a difficult route that would go on to become one of the most famous climbs in the world. This ascent marked a new level of difficulty in climbing, as Sharma pushed the limits of human potential and redefined what was thought possible.\n\nOver the next several years, Sharma continued to explore new destinations and establish new routes. In 2010, he made the first ascent of \"Golpe de Estado\" (5.15b), a difficult route in the Siurana region of Spain.\n\n## Post 2013\n\nIn recent years, Sharma has continued to climb at an elite level, establishing new routes and repeating existing ones with ease. In 2015, he made the first ascent of \"Stoking the Fire\" (5.15a), a difficult route in the Santa Linya region of Spain.\n\nIn addition to his climbing accomplishments, Sharma has become increasingly involved in environmental activism, using his platform to raise awareness about issues such as climate change and conservation.\n\n# Legacy\n\nChris Sharma's impact on the sport of climbing cannot be overstated. Through his groundbreaking ascents and his commitment to exploration and innovation, Sharma has redefined what is possible on the rock and inspired countless others to follow in his footsteps.\n\nSharma's legacy extends far beyond his climbing accomplishments, however. He has become a role model and a source of inspiration for people around the world, demonstrating the power of dedication, perseverance, and creativity.\n\n# Personal life\n\nSharma is known for his laid-back, easygoing personality, which has endeared him to fans and fellow climbers alike. He is deeply committed to his family and friends, and values his relationships above all else.\n\n## Zen\n\nSharma has long been fascinated by Eastern spirituality and philosophy, particularly Zen Buddhism. He has incorporated many Zen principles into his daily life, using meditation and mindfulness to cultivate a deeper sense of awareness and connection to the world around him.\n\n# Notable ascents\n\nSharma has made numerous notable ascents throughout his career.

The term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid,\" but tartan typically refers to specific, traditional patterns associated with Scottish clans and families. Tartan has played a significant role in Scottish culture and identity, particularly in the Highland regions, and has been adopted and adapted by various cultures around the world.\n\nEtymology and Terminology\n-------------------------\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which referred to a type of woolen cloth. In Scotland, the term \"tartan\" was used to describe specific patterns of woven cloth, often associated with particular clans or families. The term \"plaid\" is more general and can refer to any type of striped or checked pattern.\n\nWeaving and Design\n-----------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan patterns are created through a specific type of weaving called \"twill\" or \"tartan twill.\" This involves interlacing two or more colors of yarn in a specific sequence to create a diagonal rib pattern. The resulting fabric has a distinctive diagonal grid appearance, with the warp and weft yarns intersecting at specific points.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nThere are several traditional tartan styles, including:\n\n* **Symmetrical:** Where the pattern is mirrored on either side of a central axis.\n* **Asymmetrical:** Where the pattern is not mirrored and appears more random.\n* **Reversible:** Where the pattern appears the same on both sides of the fabric.\n\nTartan designs often follow specific principles, such as:\n\n* **Thread count:** The number of threads of each color in a specific sequence.\n* **Color palette:** The selection of colors used in the tartan.\n* **Sett:** The specific sequence of thread counts and colors used in a tartan.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan colors have specific meanings and associations, often reflecting the natural environment, cultural heritage, or family history of the associated clan or family. For example:\n\n* **Red:** Often represents courage, strength, or passion.\n* **Blue:** May represent loyalty, wisdom, or water.\n* **Green:** Can represent nature, fertility, or growth.\n\nEarly History\n-------------\n\n### Pre-medieval Origins\n\nThe earliest evidence of tartan-like patterns dates back to ancient civilizations in the Middle East and Asia, around 3000 BCE. These early patterns were often used in textiles and ceramics.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, tartan patterns emerged in Europe, particularly in Scotland and Ireland. These early tartans were often simple, repeating patterns used in textiles and clothing.\n\n### 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, tartan patterns became more complex and sophisticated, with the development of new weaving techniques and dyes.\n\n### 17th Century\n\nThe 17th century saw the rise of specific tartan patterns associated with Scottish clans and families. These patterns were often used in clothing, particularly in the Highlands.\n\n### 18th Century\n\n#### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nIn the 18th century, tartan patterns played a significant role in Scottish politics, particularly during the Jacobite rebellions. Tartan was seen as a symbol of Scottish identity and resistance to English rule.\n\n#### Proscription and its Aftermath\n\nAfter the Jacobite rebellions, the British government banned the wearing of tartan in Scotland, as part of the Proscription Act of 1747. This led to a decline in the use of tartan, particularly in the Highlands.\n\nRegimental Tartans\n-----------------\n\nRegimental tartans are specific patterns associated with Scottish military regiments. These tartans were often used in uniforms and other official regalia.\n\nClan Tartans\n-------------\n\n### Long-running Debate\n\nThere is ongoing debate about the origins and authenticity of clan tartans. Some argue that these tartans were invented in the 19th century, while others claim they have a longer history.\n\n### Earliest Evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 17th century, when specific patterns were associated with particular clans and families.\n\n### Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption\n\nDespite this early evidence, there is a lack of further evidence of the widespread adoption of clan tartans in Scotland before the 19th century.\n\n### 19th Century Broad Adoption\n\nIn the 19th century, clan tartans became more widely used and accepted,

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century, known for his innovative and provocative approach to storytelling, cinematography, and narrative structure. Godard's films often explored themes of politics, social issues, and personal relationships, and his work had a significant impact on the development of the French New Wave movement.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nJean-Luc Godard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, to Paul Godard, a Swiss doctor, and Odile Monod, a French woman. Godard's family moved to Switzerland when he was a child, and he spent much of his childhood in the town of Nyon, near Geneva. Godard's interest in film began at an early age, encouraged by his father, who was a cinephile.\n\nGodard attended the Lycée Buffon in Paris, where he developed a passion for philosophy and literature. After completing his secondary education, Godard studied ethnology at the Sorbonne, but he soon abandoned his studies to focus on film.\n\nEarly Career (1950-1959)\n------------------------\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard began his career in film as a critic, writing for the influential French film magazine _Cahiers du Cinéma_ in the early 1950s. Along with other young critics, including François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer, and Claude Chabrol, Godard helped shape the magazine's editorial direction and developed a distinctive approach to film criticism that emphasized the importance of directorial style and personal vision.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's first forays into filmmaking were in the form of short films, including _Opération Béton_ (1954) and _Une femme coquette_ (1955). These early films showcased Godard's interest in experimentation and innovation, and laid the groundwork for his later feature films.\n\nNew Wave Period (1960-1967)\n---------------------------\n\n### Breathless\n\nGodard's breakthrough film, _Breathless_ (1960), was a landmark of the French New Wave movement. The film's innovative cinematography, editing, and narrative structure helped establish Godard as a major talent, and its success paved the way for a new generation of filmmakers.\n\n### Early Work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's next film, _The Little Soldier_ (1960), was also a collaboration with the Danish actress Anna Karina, who would become Godard's wife and muse. The two worked together on several films, including _A Woman Is a Woman_ (1961) and _Vivre sa vie_ (1962).\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\n_Vivre sa vie_ (1962) is widely regarded as one of Godard's greatest films. The film's innovative narrative structure, which explores the life of a young woman (played by Anna Karina) through a series of fragmented vignettes, helped establish Godard as a master of cinematic storytelling.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nGodard's next two films, _Le petit soldat_ (1960) and _Les Carabiniers_ (1963), were both critical of modern war and its effects on society. These films showcased Godard's growing interest in politics and social issues, and helped establish him as a major voice on the left.\n\n### Contempt\n\n_Contempt_ (1963) was a major turning point in Godard's career, marking a shift towards more experimental and innovative filmmaking. The film's use of color, cinematography, and narrative structure helped establish Godard as a major talent, and its success paved the way for a new generation of filmmakers.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nIn 1964, Godard founded Anouchka Films, a production company that would produce many of his later films. Anouchka Films was established as a way for Godard to maintain creative control and independence, and it played a major role in his later career.\n\n### Week End\n\nGodard's next film, _Week End_ (1967), was a critical and commercial success, and marked a major turning point in his career. The film's innovative narrative structure, which explores the breakdown of modern society through a series of fragmented vignettes, helped establish Godard as a master of cinematic storytelling.\n\nPolitical Period (1968-1979)\n---------------------------\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nGodard's next film, _La Chinoise_ (1967), was a critical examination of the Vietnam War and its effects on French society. The film's innovative use of color, cinematography, and narrative structure helped establish Godard as a major voice on the left.\n\n### Bertolt Brecht\n\nGodard's interest in the playwright Bertolt Brecht had a major impact on his later work. Brecht's theories on epic theatre and the role of the audience in shaping the narrative helped shape Godard's approach to filmmaking.\n\n### Marxism\n\nGodard's growing interest in Marxism had a major impact on his later work, and he became increasingly involved in left-wing politics during the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\n### Revolutionary Period (1968-1979)\n\nGodard's films during this period, including _Sympathy for the Devil_ (1968) and _Tout va bien_ (1972), were highly experimental and innovative, and showcased his interest in politics and social issues.\n\n### Films\n\nGodard's films during this period were often critical of modern capitalism and its effects on society. Films like _Sympathy for the Devil_ and _Tout va bien_ helped establish Godard as a major voice on the left.\n\n### Sonimage\n\nIn 1972, Godard founded Sonimage, a production company that would produce many of his later films. Sonimage was established as a way for Godard to maintain creative control and independence, and it played a major role in his later career.\n\n### Jean-Pierre Gorin\n\nGodard's collaboration with the filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin had a major impact on his later work. Gorin's interest in Marxist theory and its application to filmmaking helped shape Godard's approach to narrative and storytelling.\n\n### Dziga Vertov Group\n\nThe Dziga Vertov Group was a filmmaking collective founded by Godard and Gorin in 1968. The group's films, including _Sympathy for the Devil_ and _Tout va bien_, were highly experimental and innovative, and helped establish Godard as a major talent.\n\nReturn to Commercial Films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980-2000)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nGodard's return to commercial filmmaking in the 1980s was marked by a series of films that were more conventional in terms of narrative and style. Films like _Sauve qui peut (la vie)_ (1980) and _Passion_ (1982) were critical and commercial successes, and helped establish Godard as a major talent once again.\n\nLate Period Films (2001-2022)\n---------------------------\n\nGodard's later films, including _In Praise of Love_ (2001) and _Goodbye to Language_ (2014), were highly experimental and innovative, and showcased his ongoing interest in politics and social issues.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n---------------------\n\nGodard was married to the Danish actress Anna Karina from 1961 to 1965, and to the Swiss filmmaker Anne-Marie Miéville from 1978 to 2000. Godard died on September 13, 2022, at the age of 91.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nGodard's influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and his innovative approach to narrative and storytelling has inspired generations of filmmakers. Godard's films continue to be celebrated for their intellectual curiosity, visual innovation, and emotional depth.\n\nSelected Filmography\n---------------------\n\n* _Breathless_ (1960)\n* _Vivre sa vie_ (1962)\n* _Contempt_ (1963)\n* _Week End_ (1967)\n* _La Chinoise_ (1967)\n* _Sympathy for the Devil_ (1968)\n* _Tout va bien_ (1972)\n* _Sauve qui peut (la vie)_ (1980)\n* _Passion_ (1982)\n* _In Praise of Love_ (2001)\n* _Goodbye to Language_ (2014)\n\nCollaboration with ECM Records\n-----------------------------\n\nGodard collaborated with the ECM Records label on several film projects, including _Histoire(s) du cinéma_ (1988-1998) and _JLG/JLG_ (1994).\n\nSee Also\n----------\n\n* French New Wave\n* Cinema of France\n* Marxism and film\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n\nSources and Further Reading\n---------------------------\n\n* Sterritt, David. _The Films of Jean-Luc Godard: Seeing the Invisible_.

He played for Australia in 145 Test matches and 194 One Day Internationals (ODIs), taking 708 and 293 wickets, respectively.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nShane Warne was born on 13 September 1969 in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia. He grew up in a sporting family and was encouraged by his parents to play cricket from a young age.

He was an all-rounder in his early days, but eventually focused on bowling, developing his leg spin skills.\n\nEarly Career\n------------\n\nWarne's early cricket career began at the age of 11, playing for the Upper Ferntree Gully Cricket Club. He quickly rose through the ranks, representing the Victorian Under-16 and Under-19 teams. In 1988, he made his first-class debut for Victoria, playing against Western Australia.

He took 1/150 in his first innings, but struggled to make an impact in his early days. However, he persevered and eventually found his rhythm, taking 7/52 against the West Indies in 1992. Warne's first five-wicket haul in ODIs came against New Zealand in 1993, and he went on to take 3/34 in the 1993 Ashes series.\n\n### West Indies Tour, Cricket World Cup, and Injury (1995–1999)\n\nWarne's career took off during the 1995 West Indies tour, where he took 15 wickets in three Tests.

He played a crucial role in Australia's success during this period, taking 39 wickets in 11 Tests.\n\n### Wickets and Injuries (2001–2003)\n\nWarne continued to take wickets at an incredible rate, reaching 400 Test wickets in 2002. However, he suffered a series of injuries, including a shoulder injury and a broken finger, which kept him out of the game for several months.\n\n### Ban from Cricket (2003)\n\nWarne was banned from cricket for 12 months in 2003 after testing positive for a banned diuretic. He claimed that he had taken the substance to reduce his weight, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) imposed a harsh penalty.\n\n### Return to Cricket and Beyond 600 Test Wickets (2004–2006)\n\nWarne returned to cricket in 2004 and quickly regained his form. He took 40 wickets in 10 Tests in 2004, including a 10-wicket haul against Sri Lanka. Warne reached 600 Test wickets in 2005, becoming the first bowler to achieve this milestone.\n\n### Later International Career, 700th Test Wicket, and Retirement (2006–2007)\n\nWarne played his 100th Test match in 2006 and took his 700th Test wicket in 2007. He announced his retirement from international cricket in 2007, citing a desire to spend more time with his family.\n\nTwenty20 Career (2008–2013)\n---------------------------\n\nWarne played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Rajasthan Royals from 2008 to 2011, leading the team to victory in the inaugural season. He also played for the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League (BBL) from 2012 to 2013.\n\nPlaying Style\n-------------\n\nWarne was a right-arm leg spin bowler who relied on his ability to turn the ball sharply.

Her disappearance sparked a massive search effort and widespread media attention. The case led to criticism of the media and the police handling of the investigation. This article provides an overview of the events surrounding Nicola Bulley's disappearance, the investigation, and the subsequent developments.\n\n# Background\n\nNicola Bulley lived in Inskip, Lancashire, with her partner, Paul Ansell, and their two daughters. She worked as a mortgage advisor at a local firm. On the morning of January 27, 2023, Bulley took her dog, a brown spaniel named Willow, for a walk along the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre. This was a routine walk that she had done many times before.\n\n# Disappearance\n\nBulley's disappearance was first reported by her partner, Paul Ansell, when she failed to return home after her walk. Ansell became concerned when Bulley did not respond to his calls and texts. He contacted the police, who launched an investigation into her disappearance. The police began searching the area along the River Wyre, where Bulley was last seen.\n\n## Police\n\nThe Lancashire Police force led the investigation into Bulley's disappearance. They deployed a team of officers, including detectives, search teams, and forensic experts. The police searched the area along the River Wyre, including the riverbank, woods, and nearby fields. They also reviewed CCTV footage and spoke to witnesses who may have seen Bulley on the day of her disappearance.\n\n## Private search team\n\nA private search team, led by Peter Faulding, a specialist in underwater search and recovery, was brought in to assist the police. Faulding's team used specialized equipment, including underwater cameras and sonar, to search the River Wyre. The team searched the river and surrounding areas, but did not find any sign of Bulley.\n\n# Recovery of body and inquest\n\nOn February 19, 2023, a body was recovered from the River Wyre, near to where Bulley was last seen. The body was later confirmed to be that of Nicola Bulley. The recovery of the body was met with widespread media attention and public interest.\n\nAn inquest into Bulley's death was opened, and the coroner's office began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death. The inquest heard evidence from the police, forensic experts, and other witnesses.\n\n# Criticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n\nThe media coverage of Bulley's disappearance and death was criticized for being intrusive and sensationalized. Some media outlets were accused of publishing speculative and inaccurate information, which added to the distress of Bulley's family and friends.\n\nThe Lancashire Police force was also criticized for its handling of the investigation. Some critics argued that the police had not done enough to search the area where Bulley was last seen, and that they had not provided enough support to Bulley's family.\n\n# Independent review\n\nFollowing the criticism of the police handling of the investigation, the Lancashire Police force announced that it would conduct an independent review of the case. The review would examine the police response to Bulley's disappearance and the investigation that followed.\n\n# Documentary\n\nA documentary about the case, titled \"The Disappearance of Nicola Bulley,\" was broadcast on television. The documentary examined the events surrounding Bulley's disappearance and the investigation that followed.\n\n# See also\n\n* Missing person\n* Investigation\n* Inquest\n* Media criticism\n\n# Footnotes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Death_of_Nicola_Bulley\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Disappearance\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Private search team\n#Recovery of body and inquest\n#Criticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n#Independent review\n#Documentary\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The phenomenon began in late June 1947 and peaked in early July, with a series of reported sightings and alleged landings of mysterious aerial objects. The craze was marked by widespread media coverage, public excitement, and speculation about the origins and purpose of the flying discs.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a significant event in the history of UFO sightings, marking a turning point in the public's perception and awareness of unidentified aerial phenomena. The incident drew attention from the media, the military, and the general public, and its impact can still be felt today. The craze was characterized by a series of reported sightings and alleged landings of flying discs, as well as speculation about their origins and purpose.\n\n# Events of Summer 1947\n\n## Initial reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc occurred on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold spotted nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was widely reported in the media and is often credited with starting the flying disc craze. In the days that followed, similar sightings were reported in other parts of the country, including California, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\n### Additional reports\n\nAs the days passed, more and more people came forward with reports of flying disc sightings. On June 25, a United Airlines pilot reported seeing five or six disk-shaped objects while flying over the Cascade Mountains. On June 26, a group of people in Seattle reported seeing a strange, disk-shaped object hovering in the sky. These reports, along with others, helped to fuel the growing interest in flying discs.\n\n### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nThe Pacific Northwest region of the United States was a hotbed of flying disc activity in the summer of 1947. Many of the early sightings were reported in this region, and the area was home to a number of military airbases. Some speculated that the flying discs might be a new type of jet aircraft or a secret military project. However, the military consistently denied any involvement in the sightings.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nAs the days passed, reports of flying disc sightings began to come in from all over the western United States. People in California, Arizona, and New Mexico reported seeing strange, disk-shaped objects in the sky. These reports helped to fuel the growing public interest in flying discs.\n\n### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the number of sightings grew, so did the number of potential explanations for the flying discs. Some speculated that they might be a new type of aircraft or a secret military project. Others suggested that they might be of extraterrestrial origin. Still, others proposed more mundane explanations, such as misidentifications of natural phenomena or man-made objects.\n\n## Increasing prominence\n\nAs the flying disc craze gained momentum, it began to attract more and more attention from the media and the public. The incident was front-page news in many newspapers, and radio stations and newsreels carried stories about the sightings.\n\n### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn July 1, 1947, the Lt. Governor of Washington state reported seeing a flying disc while driving through the Cascade Mountains. This high-profile sighting helped to fuel the growing public interest in the incident, and the state government launched an official investigation into the sightings.\n\n### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a series of fireworks exploded over San Francisco Bay, and some people reported seeing flying discs in the area. Others claimed that the discs had landed in the nearby hills. These reports were widely publicized and helped to fuel the growing public interest in the incident.\n\n### July 4 press reports\n\nJuly 4, 1947, was a big day for flying disc coverage in the press. Many newspapers carried front-page stories about the sightings, and some reported that the discs had been seen in multiple locations.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a United Airlines flight reported seeing a flying disc while flying over the Rocky Mountains. This sighting was widely publicized and helped to fuel the growing public interest in the incident.\n\n### Group sightings\n\nAs the days passed, more and more people reported seeing flying discs in groups. This helped to fuel the growing public interest in the incident and led to speculation about the origins and purpose of the discs.\n\n### Atomic link claimed\n\nSome people speculated that the flying discs might be connected to the development of atomic energy. This theory was fueled by reports that the discs had been seen in areas where atomic research was being conducted.\n\n### Reports peak\n\nBy early July, the flying disc craze had reached its peak. Reports of sightings were coming in from all over the country, and the media was saturated with stories about the incident.\n\n## Weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes\n\nAs the flying disc craze gained momentum, it became clear that not all of the sightings were genuine. Some were the result of misidentifications of natural phenomena or man-made objects, while others were deliberate hoaxes.\n\n### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The military initially reported that they had recovered a flying disc, but later claimed that it was a weather balloon. This incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO stories of all time.\n\n### Reports diminish\n\nAs the days passed, the number of reported flying disc sightings began to decline. The public's interest in the incident began to wane, and the media began to lose interest.\n\n### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn July 1947, two fake flying discs were recovered in Hollywood and Detroit. These hoaxes were widely publicized and helped to fuel the growing skepticism about the flying disc sightings.\n\n### Balloons\n\nAs the days passed, it became clear that many of the reported flying disc sightings were actually misidentifications of weather balloons or other man-made objects.\n\n### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nIn July 1947, a fake flying disc was recovered in Twin Falls, Idaho. This hoax was widely publicized and helped to fuel the growing skepticism about the flying disc sightings.\n\n## Reports subside\n\nBy mid-July, the flying disc craze had begun to subside. The number of reported sightings had declined, and the media had lost interest in the incident.\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn July 24, 1947, a strange object crashed near Kelso, Washington. This incident was widely reported, but it was later determined to be a hoax.\n\n## Public awareness\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze marked a significant turning point in the public's awareness and perception of unidentified flying objects. The incident drew widespread media attention and sparked a national conversation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n## Maps and table of reports\n\nThere are many maps and tables of the 1947 flying disc sightings available online and in UFO literature. These resources provide a detailed overview of the incident and can help to illustrate the scope and scale of the sightings.\n\n# Contemporary interpretations\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was interpreted in many different ways by the public and the media. Some of the most popular interpretations include:\n\n## Technological\n\nSome people believed that the flying discs were a new type of aircraft or a secret military project.\n\n## Conventional\n\nOthers believed that the sightings were the result of misidentifications of natural phenomena or man-made objects.\n\n## Behavioral\n\nSome people believed that the sightings were the result of mass hysteria or a form of collective delusion.\n\n## Interplanetary\n\nMany people believed that the flying discs were of extraterrestrial origin and that they were visiting Earth.\n\n## Biological\n\nSome people believed that the sightings were the result of a new form of life or a previously unknown species.\n\n## Eschatological\n\nSome people believed that the sightings were a sign of the end times or a harbinger of doom.\n\n## Occult\n\nSome people believed that the sightings were connected to the occult or supernatural forces.\n\n## Esoteric\n\nSome people believed that the sightings were connected to esoteric or mystical forces.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze had a significant impact on the public's perception and awareness of unidentified flying objects. The incident also spawned a number of conspiracy theories and legends that continue to be popular today.\n\n## Flying saucer conspiracy theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze spawned a number of conspiracy theories about the government's involvement in the incident. Some people believed that the government was covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life or that they were developing their own flying saucer technology.\n\n## Roswell conspiracy theory\n\nThe Roswell incident, which occurred during the 1947 flying disc craze, has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO stories of all time. Many people believe that the government recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft and that they have been covering up the evidence ever since.\n\n## Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nIn the years following the 1947 flying disc craze, the government launched a number of secret projects to study UFOs and develop new surveillance technology.

The party was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a popular actor and politician, as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The AIADMK has since become one of the major parties in Tamil Nadu, with a significant presence in the state's politics.\n\n# Ideology and policies\n\nThe AIADMK's ideology is centered around the principles of social justice, equality, and economic development. The party's policies are designed to address the needs and aspirations of the people of Tamil Nadu, with a focus on the marginalized and underprivileged sections of society.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong emphasis on Tamil culture and heritage. The party has sought to promote and preserve the state's rich cultural traditions, including its language, literature, and arts. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the rights of the Tamil people, both within India and globally.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe AIADMK's economic policies are focused on promoting growth, development, and employment in Tamil Nadu. The party has sought to attract investment, improve infrastructure, and enhance the state's competitiveness in various sectors, including industry, agriculture, and services.\n\n## Social justice\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to social justice, with a focus on addressing the needs and concerns of the marginalized and underprivileged sections of society. The party has sought to promote equality, empowerment, and inclusiveness, particularly for women, dalits, and other vulnerable groups.\n\n## State water policy\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong emphasis on water management and conservation, with a focus on addressing the state's water scarcity challenges. The party has sought to promote efficient use of water resources, improve irrigation facilities, and enhance the state's water infrastructure.\n\n## Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to environmental protection and conservation, with a focus on addressing the state's ecological challenges. The party has sought to promote sustainable development, reduce pollution, and preserve the state's natural resources, including its forests, wildlife, and water bodies.\n\n# History\n\nThe AIADMK was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a popular actor and politician, as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazham (DMK). The party has since undergone several phases of development, with significant events and milestones shaping its history.\n\n## M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nM. G. Ramachandran was the founder and first leader of the AIADMK. He was a popular actor and politician who dominated the party's early years, leading it to several electoral victories in Tamil Nadu. During his tenure, the AIADMK focused on promoting social justice, equality, and economic development in the state.\n\n### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter M. G. Ramachandran's death in 1987, a succession conflict emerged between two factions of the party, led by Janaki Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa. The conflict ultimately led to a split in the party, with Jayalalithaa emerging as the leader of the AIADMK.\n\n## J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nJ. Jayalalithaa was a dominant figure in the AIADMK's history, leading the party for over two decades. During her tenure, the AIADMK focused on promoting economic development, social justice, and women's empowerment in Tamil Nadu. Jayalalithaa was known for her strong leadership and her ability to connect with the people of the state.\n\n### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nDuring Jayalalithaa's tenure, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, contesting elections in other states and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The party also established alliances with other parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n## V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala, a close aide of Jayalalithaa, emerged as the leader of the AIADMK. However, her leadership was short-lived, as she was convicted in a corruption case and expelled from the party. T. T. V. Dhinakaran, Sasikala's nephew, also played a significant role in the party during this period.\n\n### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nIn 2017, V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran were expelled from the AIADMK, following a merger of the two factions of the party, led by O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami.\n\n## O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K.

The concept of Jewish identity has been shaped by various factors, including history, culture, and biology, and has evolved over time. This article provides an overview of the literature on racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, as well as a historical analysis of how these conceptions have developed and impacted the movement.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nScholars have long debated the concept of Jewish identity and its relationship to Zionism. Some have argued that Jewish identity is primarily a cultural and historical phenomenon, while others have emphasized the role of biology and genetics. The literature on racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism reflects these debates, with some scholars focusing on the ways in which Zionism has constructed Jewish identity as a racial category, while others have examined the impact of these conceptions on Jewish-non-Jewish relations.\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential studies on the subject is Arthur Ruppin's \"The Jews of To-Day,\" published in 1913. Ruppin, a Jewish sociologist and Zionist leader, argued that the Jewish people were a distinct racial group, shaped by a common history, culture, and biology. His work laid the foundation for later studies on the subject, including those by scholars such as Hans F.K. Günther and Maurice Fishberg.\n\nMore recent studies have challenged the idea of a fixed Jewish racial identity, highlighting instead the complex and evolving nature of Jewish identity. Scholars such as Eric Goldstein and John M. Efron have examined the ways in which Jewish identity has been constructed and reconstructed over time, often in response to changing social and cultural contexts.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has a long and complex history, dating back to ancient times. The Jewish people have been shaped by a variety of factors, including culture, history, and biology, and have developed a distinct identity that is separate from other nations and groups.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the emergence of modern nationalism and the rise of anti-Semitism led to a renewed focus on the concept of Jewish identity. Zionism, which emerged during this period, emphasized the need for a Jewish homeland and the creation of a distinct Jewish nation.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nEarly Zionists, such as Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, emphasized the need for a Jewish homeland and the creation of a distinct Jewish nation. They drew on a range of influences, including European nationalism and Jewish mysticism, to construct a vision of Jewish identity that was distinct and separate from other nations and groups.\n\nHerzl, in particular, emphasized the importance of biology and genetics in shaping Jewish identity. In his book \"The Jewish State,\" published in 1896, he argued that the Jewish people were a distinct racial group, shaped by a common history and biology. This idea was later developed by other Zionist leaders, including Arthur Ruppin and Hans F.K. Günther.\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the development of Zionism and the concept of Jewish identity. The new state was founded on the principles of Jewish nationalism and the idea of a distinct Jewish identity.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Israeli leaders, including David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir, emphasized the importance of biology and genetics in shaping Jewish identity. They drew on the work of earlier Zionist leaders, including Herzl and Ruppin, to construct a vision of Jewish identity that was distinct and separate from other nations and groups.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant shift in the concept of Jewish identity, as Israeli society became more diverse and complex. The rise of Mizrahi Jews, who were of Middle Eastern and North African descent, challenged the dominant Ashkenazi (European) culture and led to a re-evaluation of the concept of Jewish identity.\n\nScholars such as Eric Goldstein and John M. Efron examined the ways in which Jewish identity was constructed and reconstructed over time, often in response to changing social and cultural contexts. They highlighted the complex and evolving nature of Jewish identity, challenging the idea of a fixed Jewish racial identity.\n\n## The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe discovery of the human genome in 2003 marked a significant turning point in the study of Jewish identity. The use of genetic testing and DNA analysis has led to a renewed focus on the biological basis of Jewish identity, with some scholars arguing that Jewish identity can be defined by a shared genetic heritage.\n\nStudies such as the \"Genetic Legacy of the Jewish Diaspora\" have used genetic analysis to examine the origins and migration patterns of Jewish populations. These studies have highlighted the complex and diverse nature of Jewish identity, challenging the idea of a fixed Jewish racial identity.\n\n## Race and Non-Jews\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has also been shaped by the relationship between Jews and non-Jews. Zionism has often been criticized for its treatment of non-Jews, particularly Palestinians, who have been displaced and marginalized by the creation of the State of Israel.\n\nScholars such as Edward Said and Ilan Pappé have examined the ways in which Zionism has constructed Jewish identity as a racial category, often at the expense of non-Jews. They have highlighted the complex and often fraught nature of Jewish-non-Jewish relations, challenging the idea of a fixed Jewish racial identity.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has had a significant impact on Zionism and the State of Israel. The emphasis on biology and genetics has shaped the way in which Jewish identity is constructed and understood, often leading to a narrow and exclusive definition of Jewishness.\n\nThe treatment of non-Jews, particularly Palestinians, has also been shaped by the concept of Jewish identity. The displacement and marginalization of Palestinians has been justified by some Zionists as a necessary step in the creation of a Jewish homeland.\n\nHowever, the concept of Jewish identity has also been challenged and re-evaluated over time. The rise of Mizrahi Jews and the use of genetic testing and DNA analysis have highlighted the complex and diverse nature of Jewish identity, challenging the idea of a fixed Jewish racial identity.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Genetics and Jewish identity\n* Mizrahi Jews\n* Ashkenazi Jews\n* Palestinians\n* Israel\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The day also serves as a call to action for accelerating women's equality and addressing the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide. The celebration has a rich history, dating back to the early 20th century, and has evolved over the years to become a widely recognized and observed event.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when women's rights movements were gaining momentum in various parts of the world. In 1908, 15,000 women marched through New York City demanding better pay, shorter working hours, and voting rights. This event inspired women in other countries to organize similar protests and demonstrations.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1910, the International Conference of Socialist Women was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, where Clara Zetkin, a German socialist and women's rights activist, proposed the idea of an International Women's Day. The conference agreed to establish a day to promote women's rights and equality, but no specific date was set. In 1917, on March 8, women in Russia organized a strike and demonstration, demanding \"Bread and Peace,\" which ultimately contributed to the Russian Revolution. The date of March 8 was subsequently adopted as International Women's Day by communist countries, including the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day was celebrated in various countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. However, the holiday gained little traction in these countries, and its popularity waxed and waned over the years. In the 1960s, the feminist movement gained momentum, and International Women's Day became a rallying cry for women's rights activists.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second wave of feminism, which emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, played a significant role in popularizing International Women's Day. Feminist activists, such as Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, used the holiday to raise awareness about women's rights and to mobilize support for the feminist movement. The holiday became a symbol of women's empowerment and a call to action for social change.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations General Assembly recognized International Women's Day as a global holiday, and in 1996, the UN declared March 8 as an official UN holiday. The UN has since used the holiday to promote women's rights and empowerment, and to address various issues affecting women worldwide, such as violence against women, poverty, and lack of access to education and healthcare.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has been adopted by corporations and businesses worldwide, which use the holiday to promote diversity, inclusion, and women's empowerment in the workplace. Many companies use the holiday to launch initiatives and programs aimed at supporting women's careers and addressing the various biases and barriers that women face in the workplace.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nIn 1995, the UN held the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, which marked a significant turning point in the global women's rights movement. The conference resulted in the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which outlined a comprehensive agenda for women's empowerment and equality.\n\n## 1996\n\nIn 1996, the UN General Assembly declared March 8 as an official UN holiday, and the first International Women's Day was celebrated under UN auspices.\n\n## 2003\n\nIn 2003, the UN launched the UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women) campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and address the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\n## 2006\n\nIn 2006, the UN launched the UNITE to End Violence Against Women campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and to mobilize support for efforts to prevent and address this issue.\n\n## 2008\n\nIn 2008, the UN launched the MDG (Millennium Development Goals) campaign, which aimed to promote the achievement of the MDGs, including the goal of promoting gender equality and empowering women.\n\n## 2009\n\nIn 2009, the UN launched the Say NO to Violence Against Women campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and to mobilize support for efforts to prevent and address this issue.\n\n## 2010\n\nIn 2010, the UN launched the UN Women campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n## 2011\n\nIn 2011, the UN launched the Safe Cities for Women campaign, which aimed to promote the safety and security of women in urban areas.\n\n## 2012\n\nIn 2012, the UN launched the One Billion Rising campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about violence against women and to mobilize support for efforts to prevent and address this issue.\n\n## 2013\n\nIn 2013, the UN launched the Stop Rape in Conflict campaign, which aimed to raise awareness about the use of rape as a weapon of war and to mobilize support for efforts to prevent and address this issue.\n\n## 2014\n\nIn 2014, the UN launched the HeForShe campaign, which aimed to promote men's engagement in the promotion of women's rights and empowerment.\n\n## 2015\n\nIn 2015, the UN launched the Beijing+20 campaign, which aimed to review progress towards the achievement of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\n\n## 2016\n\nIn 2016, the UN launched the Planet 50-50 by 2030 campaign, which aimed to promote the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including the goal of promoting gender equality and empowering women.\n\n## 2017\n\nIn 2017, the UN launched the Women in the Changing World of Work campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face in the workplace.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn 2018, the UN launched the Time is Now campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn 2019, the UN launched the Think Equal campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, the UN launched the Generation Equality campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the UN launched the Women Lead campaign, which aimed to promote women's leadership and to address the various challenges and biases that women face in leadership positions.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn 2022, the UN launched the Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n## 2023\n\nIn 2023, the UN launched the DigitALL campaign, which aimed to promote women's empowerment and to address the various challenges and biases that women face in the digital age.\n\n## 2024\n\nIn 2024, the UN will launch a new campaign, which will promote women's empowerment and address the various challenges and biases that women face worldwide.\n\n# Around the world\n\nInternational Women's Day is celebrated in various ways around the world.

The incident has been widely reported and has significant implications for the Wagner Group and its operations.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company that has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Africa. The group has been linked to the Russian government and has been accused of carrying out clandestine operations on behalf of the Kremlin.\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe plane that crashed was a Embraer Legacy 600, a business jet that is commonly used for corporate and private flights. The aircraft was registered in Russia and was operated by a company called 223 Flight Unit.\n\n# Incident\n\nThe plane took off from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport at 11:57 AM local time and was headed for St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport.

He spent the latter part of his life in exile, primarily in the United Kingdom. His death on January 10, 2023, marked the end of an era for the Greek royal family and sparked an outpouring of tributes and condolences from around the world.\n\n# Background\n\nConstantine II was born on June 2, 1940, in Athens, Greece, to King Paul and Queen Frederica. He was the second child and only son of the royal couple, and his birth was seen as a significant event in Greece. Constantine was educated at the prestigious Anatolia College in Thessaloniki and later at the British Royal Navy's Dartmouth Naval College.\n\nConstantine ascended to the throne in 1964, following the death of his father. However, his reign was marked by controversy and turmoil, particularly surrounding his involvement in the 1967 Greek military coup. The coup ultimately led to a referendum in 1973, which resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nAfter the monarchy was abolished, Constantine and his family went into exile, primarily residing in the United Kingdom. Despite efforts to restore the monarchy, Constantine never regained the throne. Instead, he dedicated his life to supporting various charitable causes and maintaining connections with his Greek heritage.\n\n# Death\n\nConstantine II passed away on January 10, 2023, at the age of 82, in Athens, Greece.

The election was triggered by Johnson's resignation as party leader on 7 July 2022, following a government crisis that saw the resignation of numerous cabinet ministers.\n\n# Background\n\n## Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\nThe Conservative Party had been led by Boris Johnson since July 2019, when he won the party's leadership election. Johnson's leadership was marked by his efforts to deliver Brexit, which he ultimately achieved in January 2020. However, his leadership was also marred by controversy and criticism, particularly over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 2019 general election\nIn the 2019 general election, the Conservative Party won a landslide victory, securing an 80-seat majority in the House of Commons. Johnson's campaign focused on delivering Brexit and restoring stability to the country. However, the election also saw the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, suffer a significant defeat, leading to Corbyn's resignation as party leader.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the UK, with the country experiencing multiple lockdowns and a significant economic contraction. Johnson's government was criticized for its handling of the pandemic, particularly over its slow response to the crisis and its decision to impose lockdowns. The government was also embroiled in the Partygate scandal, which saw numerous allegations of rule-breaking and law-breaking by government officials, including Johnson himself.\n\n## June 2022 confidence vote\nIn June 2022, Johnson faced a confidence vote from his own party, which he narrowly won. However, the vote was seen as a significant blow to Johnson's authority, and he faced increasing pressure to resign.\n\n## Government crisis\nIn the days following the confidence vote, Johnson's government was hit by a wave of resignations, including those of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The resignations were seen as a significant blow to Johnson's authority, and he eventually announced his resignation as party leader on 7 July 2022.\n\n# Election details\n\nThe leadership election was conducted by the Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which sets the rules for the election.

It is considered one of the most significant events in the history of Christianity, leading to the emergence of Protestantism as a distinct branch of Christianity. The Reformation had far-reaching consequences, shaping Western society, culture, and politics for centuries to come.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" is derived from the Latin word \"reformatio,\" meaning \"restoration\" or \"renewal.\" It was originally used to describe the efforts of reform-minded individuals within the Catholic Church to correct abuses and restore the church to its original purity. However, the term eventually came to be associated with the more radical movements that sought to break away from the Catholic Church and establish new Christian denominations.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe 14th century saw a series of calamities that shook the foundations of European society. The Black Death, which ravaged Europe from 1346 to 1353, led to widespread social, economic, and cultural disruption. The Hundred Years' War between England and France (1337-1453) caused further devastation, while the Avignon Papacy (1309-1377) and the Western Schism (1378-1417) created a crisis of authority within the Catholic Church.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was the dominant institution in medieval Europe, wielding significant power and influence over society. The church was organized into a hierarchical structure, with the Pope at its head, followed by cardinals, bishops, and priests. Monasteries and convents played a vital role in preserving learning and culture, while the Inquisition was established to root out heresy and enforce orthodoxy.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy were seen as intermediaries between God and humanity, responsible for interpreting scripture and administering the sacraments. However, many clergy were poorly educated, corrupt, and more interested in accumulating wealth and power than in serving the spiritual needs of their flock.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was the central authority of the Catholic Church, with the Pope claiming supremacy over all Christians. However, the papacy was often embroiled in politics, and Popes were frequently at odds with secular rulers.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nEfforts to reform the church from within had been ongoing since the 11th century. The Cluniac Reforms, the Gregorian Reform, and the Conciliar Movement all sought to address issues such as clerical corruption, simony, and the abuse of power. However, these reforms ultimately failed to bring about lasting change.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, which emerged in the 14th century, emphasized the study of classical texts and the potential of human beings to achieve great things through education and individual effort. Humanists such as Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Erasmus sought to revive the classical learning of ancient Greece and Rome, which they saw as a way to reform the church and society.\n\nLay religion, which emphasized personal piety and direct communication with God, also gained popularity during this period. The rise of mysticism and the emergence of lay movements such as the Devotio Moderna and the Brethren of the Common Life reflected a growing desire for spiritual renewal and reform.\n\n## Dissidents\n\nThe 14th and 15th centuries saw the emergence of various dissident movements that challenged the authority of the Catholic Church. The Lollards in England, the Hussites in Bohemia, and the Waldensians in southern Europe all sought to reform the church from within, but were ultimately condemned as heretics.\n\n# Beginnings\n\n## Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nOn October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, a German theologian and professor, published his famous Ninety-five Theses, which criticized the sale of indulgences and challenged the authority of the Pope. Luther's actions sparked a controversy that quickly spread throughout Europe, marking the beginning of the Reformation.\n\n## New theology\n\nLuther's theology emphasized justification by faith alone, the authority of scripture, and the priesthood of all believers. His ideas were influenced by humanism and the devotional writings of mystics such as Johannes Tauler and Meister Eckhart.\n\n## Spread\n\nThe Reformation spread rapidly throughout Europe, with Luther's ideas being disseminated through printed pamphlets, sermons, and letters. The emergence of Protestantism as a distinct movement was facilitated by the invention of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of books and pamphlets.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with a mixture of resistance and oppression. The Pope condemned Luther as a heretic, and the Emperor Charles V sought to crush the Protestant movement through military force and persecution.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nThe Reformation also inspired more radical movements, such as the Saxon radicals and the rebellious knights of southern Germany. These groups sought to overthrow the existing social and political order and establish a new, more equal society.\n\n## Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation, advocating for a more radical break with Catholicism. Zwingli's ideas emphasized the importance of scripture, the role of the laity, and the need for social and economic reform.\n\n## Swiss Brethren\n\nThe Swiss Brethren, a group of Anabaptists, sought to establish a more radical, egalitarian form of Christianity, based on the principles of adult baptism, community of goods, and non-violence.\n\n## Peasants' War\n\nThe Peasants' War, which broke out in 1524, was a major uprising of peasants and laborers against the ruling classes in southern Germany. The war was sparked by economic hardship, social injustice, and the influence of Protestant ideas.\n\n# Consolidation\n\n## Princely Reformation in Germany\n\nThe Reformation was consolidated in Germany through the efforts of Protestant princes, such as Philip of Hesse and John of Saxony. These rulers established Protestant churches in their territories, which became the basis for the modern Lutheran and Calvinist denominations.\n\n## Stalemate in Switzerland\n\nThe Reformation in Switzerland was marked by a stalemate between the Protestant and Catholic cantons, which ultimately led to the division of the country along confessional lines.\n\n## Schleitheim Articles\n\nThe Schleitheim Articles, adopted in 1527, were a key document of the Anabaptist movement, outlining the principles of adult baptism, community of goods, and non-violence.\n\n## Confessions\n\nThe Reformation saw the emergence of various confessions, such as the Augsburg Confession (1530) and the Helvetic Confession (1536), which defined the theological and ecclesiastical structures of Protestantism.\n\n## Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nThe Reformation was also adopted in Scandinavia, where monarchs such as Gustav Vasa of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark established Protestant churches in their territories.\n\n# Catholic reform\n\n## Beginnings\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with a series of reforms, aimed at addressing the issues that had led to the Protestant revolt.\n\n## New Orders\n\nThe Catholic Church established new orders, such as the Jesuits and the Capuchins, which were dedicated to missionary work, education, and social reform.\n\n## Council of Trent\n\nThe Council of Trent, which met from 1545 to 1563, was a major ecumenical council that sought to reform the Catholic Church and respond to the Protestant challenge. The council reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, reformed the clergy, and established new institutions, such as the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\n\n# New waves\n\n## English reformation under Henry VIII\n\nThe English Reformation was a complex and tumultuous process, which was influenced by the desires of King Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. The English Reformation ultimately led to the establishment of the Church of England, with the monarch as its head.\n\n## Münster\n\nThe city of Münster in northern Germany was the site of a major Anabaptist uprising in 1534, which was brutally suppressed by the Catholic authorities.\n\n## Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin, a French theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation, advocating for a more radical break with Catholicism. Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, published in 1536, was a major theological treatise that defined the principles of Protestantism.\n\n## Reformation in Britain\n\nThe Reformation in Britain was marked by a series of complex and often violent conflicts, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Church of England and the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.\n\n## Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n\nMichael Servetus, a Spanish theologian, advocated for a more radical form of Protestantism, which emphasized the importance of reason and individual conscience. Servetus's ideas were influential, but he was ultimately executed for heresy in Geneva.\n\n# Wars of religion and tolerance\n\n## Schmalkaldic Wars\n\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars, fought from 1546 to 1547, were a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic states in Germany, which ultimately led to the Peace of Augsburg.\n\n## French Wars of Religion\n\nThe French Wars of Religion, fought from 1562 to 1598, were a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic factions in France, which ultimately led to the Edict of Nantes.\n\n## Revolt in the Netherlands\n\nThe Revolt in the Netherlands, fought from 1566 to 1609, was a major uprising against Spanish rule, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Dutch Republic.\n\n## Edict of Torda\n\nThe Edict of Torda, issued in 1568, was a major decree of tolerance, which granted freedom of worship to Protestants and Catholics in Transylvania.\n\n## Warsaw Confederation\n\nThe Warsaw Confederation, established in 1573, was a major alliance of Protestant and Catholic states in Poland, which granted freedom of worship to all citizens.\n\n## Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, led by the Catholic Church, sought to suppress Protestantism and restore Catholicism in Europe. Regional conflicts, such as the Thirty Years' War, also played a significant role in shaping the course of the Reformation.\n\n# Reformation outside Germany\n\n## Nordic countries\n\n### Iceland\n\nIceland was one of the first countries to adopt Protestantism, with the Icelandic Reformation taking place in the 16th century.\n\n## Great Britain\n\n### England\n\n#### English North America\n\nThe English Reformation had a significant impact on the establishment of English colonies in North America, with the Pilgrims and the Puritans playing a major role in shaping American history.\n\n### Wales\n\nWales was a major center of Protestantism, with the Welsh Reformation taking place in the 16th century.\n\n### Scotland\n\nScotland was also a major center of Protestantism, with the Scottish Reformation taking place in the 16th century.\n\n## France\n\nFrance was a major center of Protestantism, with the French Reformation taking place in the 16th century.\n\n## Spain\n\nSpain was a major center of Catholicism, but the Spanish Reformation also took place in the 16th century.\n\n## Italy\n\nItaly was a major center of Catholicism, but the Italian Reformation also took place in the 16th century.\n\n## Slovenia\n\nSlovenia was a major center of Protestantism, with the Slovenian Reformation taking place in the 16th century.\n\n## Greece\n\nGreece was a major center of Orthodox Christianity, but the Greek Reformation also took place in the 16th century.\n\n# Spread\n\nThe Reformation spread rapidly throughout Europe, with Protestantism emerging as a distinct branch of Christianity.\n\n# Conclusion and legacy\n\n## Thirty Years' War: 1618–1648\n\nThe Thirty Years' War was a major conflict that took place in Europe from 1618 to 1648, which ultimately led to the Peace of Westphalia and the recognition of Protestantism as a legitimate branch of Christianity.\n\n## Consequences of the Reformation\n\nThe Reformation had far-reaching consequences, shaping Western society, culture, and politics for centuries to come.\n\n## Radical Reformation\n\nThe Radical Reformation, which emerged in the 16th century, sought to establish a more radical, egalitarian form of Christianity.\n\n## Literacy\n\nThe Reformation led to a significant increase in literacy rates, as Protestantism emphasized the importance of individual interpretation of scripture.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n### Human capital formation\n\nThe Reformation led to a significant increase in human capital formation, as Protestantism emphasized the importance of education and individual effort.\n\n### Protestant ethic\n\nThe Protestant ethic, which emerged in the 16th century, emphasized the importance of hard work, thrift, and individual responsibility.\n\n### Economic development\n\nThe Reformation led to significant economic development, as Protestantism emphasized the importance of individual initiative and entrepreneurship.\n\n### Governance\n\nThe Reformation led to significant changes in governance, as Protestantism emphasized the importance of individual rights and liberties.\n\n### Other outcomes\n\nThe Reformation also led to significant changes in art, literature, and culture, as Protestantism emphasized the importance of individual creativity and expression.\n\n## Historiography\n\nThe historiography of the Reformation is complex and multifaceted, with different interpretations and perspectives emerging over time.\n\n## Music and art\n\nThe Reformation had a significant impact on music and art, with Protestantism emphasizing the importance of simplicity, clarity, and individual expression.\n\n# See also\n\n* Protestantism\n* Catholicism\n* Christianity\n* European history\n* Renaissance\n* Enlightenment\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Reformation, and is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Bainton, Roland H.

They were a powerful and influential people who played a significant role in the history of ancient Italy, particularly during the Samnite Wars against the Romans.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe origin of the name \"Samnites\" is uncertain, but it is believed to derive from the Oscan word \"safinim,\" which means \"those from the Sabine land.\" The Samnites were indeed closely related to the Sabines, another Italic people who lived in central Italy.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe Samnites emerged as a distinct people in the 5th century BC, in the region of Samnium, which is now part of the Italian provinces of Campania, Molise, and Puglia. They were a mountainous people, living in a region of rugged terrain, and developed a culture that was adapted to their environment. The Samnites were skilled farmers, herders, and warriors, and their economy was based on agriculture, pastoralism, and trade.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites are perhaps best known for their wars against the Romans, which took place from 343 to 290 BC. The Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts that were sparked by Roman expansion into Samnite territory. The Samnites were a powerful and determined people, and they resisted Roman expansion fiercely. The wars were marked by several notable battles, including the Battle of the Caudine Forks, in which the Samnites defeated the Romans, and the Battle of Bovianum, in which the Romans defeated the Samnites.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to live in their region, but they were increasingly influenced by Roman culture and politics. Many Samnites became Roman citizens, and the region of Samnium was eventually incorporated into the Roman Empire. The Samnites played a significant role in the Social War, a conflict that took place from 91 to 88 BC, in which the Italian allies of Rome rebelled against Roman rule. The Samnites were among the leaders of the rebellion, and they fought bravely against the Romans. However, the rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Samnites were defeated.\n\nSociety\n-------\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based on agriculture, pastoralism, and trade. The Samnites were skilled farmers, and they grew crops such as wheat, olives, and grapes. They were also skilled herders, and they raised animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle. The Samnites traded with other regions of Italy, and they were known for their high-quality wool and textiles.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnites were a tribal society, and they were organized into several tribes or clans.

They believed in a pantheon of gods, including Jupiter, Mars, and Diana, and they built temples and shrines to honor these deities.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nIn Samnite society, men and women had distinct roles. Men were responsible for warfare, politics, and trade, while women were responsible for domestic duties, such as childcare and household management.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were known for their artistic skills, particularly in the areas of pottery and metalwork.

The search was related to an investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified documents, by Trump and his staff.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by federal law and regulations. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) requires the President and his staff to preserve and turn over all presidential records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of their term in office. The PRA defines presidential records as documents, memoranda, correspondence, or other materials that relate to the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed three federal statutes as the basis for the search: 18 U.S.C. § 793 (gathering, transmitting, or losing national defense information); 18 U.S.C. § 2071 (concealment, removal, or mutilation of documents); and 18 U.S.C. § 1519 (destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations). These statutes relate to the unauthorized removal or destruction of classified documents and other presidential records.\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President has the authority to classify and declassify national security information. However, this authority is subject to regulations and guidelines set forth by the executive branch. The President's authority to declassify information is not absolute, and he must follow established procedures for declassifying sensitive information.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nWhen classified material is lost or compromised, the executive branch has established protocols for reporting and responding to the incident. These protocols include notifying the relevant authorities, conducting an investigation, and taking steps to mitigate any potential harm to national security.\n\n**Events leading to the search**\n\n### NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn February 2022, NARA requested that Trump return all presidential records in his possession. Trump's representatives claimed that all records had been returned, but NARA later discovered that this was not the case.\n\n#### Partial return of records to NARA\n\nIn January 2022, Trump returned 15 boxes of presidential records to NARA. However, NARA later determined that these boxes contained sensitive and classified materials, including documents marked \"top secret.\"\n\n#### Trump's statement regarding return of records\n\nIn February 2022, Trump released a statement claiming that all presidential records had been returned to NARA. However, this statement was later found to be false.\n\n#### NARA makes criminal referral\n\nIn February 2022, NARA referred the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for investigation. The DOJ launched a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records by Trump and his staff.\n\n#### Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to resist efforts by NARA and the DOJ to retrieve presidential records. Fitton claimed that the records were Trump's personal property and that he had the right to keep them.\n\n### FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n\n#### May 2022 subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the DOJ issued a subpoena to Trump's lawyers seeking information about the handling of presidential records.\n\n#### June 2022 subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the DOJ issued a second subpoena seeking additional information about the handling of presidential records.\n\n### FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n\nOn August 5, 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant from a federal court in Florida. The warrant authorized the FBI to search Mar-a-Lago for presidential records and other materials related to the investigation.\n\n**Search of Mar-a-Lago**\n\nOn August 8, 2022, the FBI executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. The search was conducted by a team of FBI agents and DOJ lawyers. The search focused on areas of the property where presidential records were likely to be stored, including Trump's office and a storage room.\n\n### Search of other Trump properties\n\nThe FBI also searched other Trump properties, including Trump Tower in New York City and the Trump National Doral resort in Miami.\n\n**Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit**\n\n### Release of search warrant and property receipt\n\nOn August 12, 2022, the DOJ released the search warrant and property receipt related to the search of Mar-a-Lago. The property receipt listed the items seized by the FBI, including boxes of documents, a safe, and other materials.\n\n#### Seized materials\n\nThe FBI seized a total of 33 boxes of documents, including 11 sets of classified materials. The seized materials included documents marked \"top secret\" and other sensitive information.\n\n#### Missing materials\n\nThe FBI also reported that some materials were missing from the property, including a safe that was supposed to contain presidential records.\n\n### Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n\nTrump's lawyers filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, which outlined the basis for the search. The affidavit was heavily redacted to protect sensitive information.\n\n### Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the DOJ released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit. The affidavit revealed that the FBI had probable cause to believe that Trump had committed a crime by mishandling presidential records.\n\n### Release of detailed property list\n\nOn September 2, 2022, the DOJ released a detailed list of the property seized from Mar-a-Lago. The list included boxes of documents, a safe, and other materials.\n\n**Trump v. United States**\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit against the United States seeking to block the use of the seized materials in the investigation. The lawsuit claimed that the search was politically motivated and that the seized materials were protected by executive privilege.\n\n**Special counsel investigation**\n\n### Indictment\n\nOn August 18, 2022, a grand jury indicted Trump for mishandling presidential records. The indictment charged Trump with three federal crimes, including obstruction of justice.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Congress\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties reacted to the search, with some defending Trump and others criticizing him.\n\n### White House\n\nThe White House released a statement saying that President Biden had not been involved in the decision to search Mar-a-Lago.\n\n### National Archives\n\nNARA released a statement saying that the agency had been working to retrieve presidential records from Trump since 2021.\n\n### Trump, his family, and his attorneys\n\n#### Claims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent\n\nTrump and his lawyers claimed that the search was politically motivated and that the FBI had planted evidence. They also cited a precedent set by former President Barack Obama, who had been allowed to keep presidential records at his home.\n\n#### Claims of declassifying all documents\n\nTrump claimed that he had declassified all of the documents seized by the FBI. However, this claim was disputed by the DOJ.\n\n#### Lawsuit\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit against the United States seeking to block the use of the seized materials in the investigation.\n\n### Trump allies and supporters\n\n#### Threats against government officials\n\nSome Trump allies and supporters made threats against government officials involved in the investigation.\n\n#### FBI field office attack\n\nOn August 11, 2022, a man attacked an FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio. The attacker was later killed by police.\n\n### Republican elected officials and candidates\n\nMany Republican elected officials and candidates defended Trump and criticized the search.\n\n### Congressional Democrats\n\nMany Congressional Democrats criticized Trump and defended the search.\n\n### Scholars and former officials\n\nSome scholars and former officials defended the search and criticized Trump's handling of presidential records.\n\n### Intelligence community\n\nThe intelligence community expressed concerns about the potential risks posed by Trump's mishandling of classified materials.\n\n### Former Trump administration figures\n\nSome former Trump administration figures, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, criticized Trump's handling of presidential records.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FBI_search_of_Mar-a-Lago\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n###Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n###Classified material and the presidency\n####Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n####Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n#Events leading to the search\n##NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n###Partial return of records to NARA\n###Trump's statement regarding return of records\n###NARA makes criminal referral\n###Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n##FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n###May 2022 subpoena\n###June 2022 subpoena\n##FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n#Search of Mar-a-Lago\n##Search of other Trump properties\n#Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit\n##Release of search warrant and property receipt\n###Seized materials\n###Missing materials\n##Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n##Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n##Release of detailed property list\n#Trump v.

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York City and the colonial era of North America. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Fort Amsterdam, from its establishment to its eventual decline.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company was granted a charter by the Dutch government to establish a colony in North America. The company sent a group of settlers to the New World, who arrived on Manhattan Island in 1624. The settlers established a trading post on the southern tip of the island, which they named \"New Amsterdam.\" In 1626, the Dutch West India Company built a fort to protect the trading post and the settlers. The fort was named \"Fort Amsterdam,\" after the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\nFort Amsterdam was a small, wooden fort that was designed to protect the settlers from attacks by Native Americans and other European colonies. The fort was located on a rocky outcropping at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which provided a natural defense against attack. The fort was surrounded by a wooden palisade, and it had several cannon emplacements to defend against ships.\n\nOver time, Fort Amsterdam became the center of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, which included present-day New York City, Long Island, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. The fort served as the seat of government, and it was the location of the colony's council chamber and the residence of the director-general of the colony.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English sent a naval force to New Amsterdam to capture the colony. The Dutch colonists were vastly outnumbered, and they surrendered the fort without a fight. The English renamed the colony \"New York,\" after the Duke of York, who later became King James II.\n\nUnder English rule, Fort Amsterdam was renamed \"Fort James.\" The English made significant changes to the fort, including the addition of new walls and bastions. The fort was also used as a prison, and it was the location of the trial of several high-ranking Dutch officials who were accused of treason.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York and Fort Amsterdam from the English. The Dutch renamed the fort \"Fort Willem Hendrick,\" after the Prince of Orange. However, the Dutch only held the fort for a short time, as the English recaptured it in 1674.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nUnder English rule, Fort Amsterdam was once again renamed \"Fort James.\" The English continued to make changes to the fort, including the addition of new walls and bastions. The fort was also used as a prison, and it was the location of the trial of several high-ranking Dutch officials who were accused of treason.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists rebelled against the English government and took control of Fort Amsterdam. The colonists were led by Jacob Leisler, a German-born merchant who had settled in New York. Leisler and his followers established a new government, which was known as the \"Leislerian government.\"\n\nHowever, the Leislerian government was short-lived, as the English sent a naval force to New York to capture the fort and restore English rule. Leisler was captured and executed, and the English once again took control of Fort Amsterdam.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nUnder British rule, Fort Amsterdam was renamed \"Fort George.\" The British made significant changes to the fort, including the addition of new walls and bastions. The fort was also used as a prison, and it was the location of the trial of several high-ranking colonists who were accused of treason.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the years leading up to the American Revolution, Fort George became a symbol of British oppression. The colonists resented the British government's attempts to control their lives and economy, and they saw the fort as a reminder of British power.\n\nIn 1774, a group of colonists stormed the fort and stole several hundred pounds of gunpowder. The British responded by sending a naval force to New York to capture the fort and restore order.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the Continental Army, led by George Washington, captured Fort George from the British. The colonists renamed the fort \"Fort Washington,\" after the commander-in-chief.\n\nHowever, the colonists only held the fort for a short time, as the British recaptured it in 1776. The British renamed the fort \"Fort Knyphausen,\" after the Hessian general who led the British forces.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nUnder British rule, Fort Knyphausen was used as a prison and a hospital. The fort was also the location of several high-profile military trials, including the trial of American General Charles Lee.\n\nIn 1783, the British evacuated New York City, and the fort was abandoned. The fort was eventually demolished, and the site was used for other purposes.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nAfter the British evacuated New York City, the fort was taken over by the American government. The fort was renamed \"Fort Washington,\" after the commander-in-chief.\n\nHowever, the fort was eventually abandoned, and the site was used for other purposes. Today, the site of Fort Amsterdam is occupied by a park and several buildings.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New Amsterdam\n* New York City\n* American Revolution\n* British Empire\n* Dutch West India Company\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the history of Fort Amsterdam.
