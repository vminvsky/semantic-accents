Constructive set theory aims to provide a foundation for mathematics that is both rigorous and intuitive, by formalizing the notion of \"construction\" and eliminating non-constructive proofs.\n\nConstructive Outlook\n--------------------\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nConstructive set theory relies heavily on intuitionistic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle (LEM) and the law of non-contradiction (LNC). In intuitionistic logic, a statement is only considered true if it can be explicitly proved, rather than simply being assumed to be true or false. This approach to logic has significant implications for the development of set theory.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes several restrictions on the development of set theory, including:\n\n*   The use of intuitionistic logic, which rejects LEM and LNC.\n*   The requirement that all mathematical objects and their properties be explicitly constructible.\n*   The rejection of non-constructive proofs, such as those that rely on the existence of infinite sets.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nConstructive set theory has a distinct metalogic, which is concerned with the study of the logical structure of the theory itself. This includes the study of the relationship between constructive set theory and other branches of mathematics, such as category theory and type theory.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nConstructive set theory is often characterized by the presence of anti-classical principles, which are principles that contradict or undermine classical notions of set theory. Examples of anti-classical principles include the rejection of LEM and LNC, and the requirement that all mathematical objects and their properties be explicitly constructible.\n\nHistory and Overview\n--------------------\n\nConstructive set theory has its roots in the work of mathematicians such as L.E.J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, who developed intuitionistic logic and mathematics in the early 20th century. The development of constructive set theory as a distinct branch of mathematics is more recent, and can be attributed to the work of mathematicians such as Errett Bishop and Per Martin-Löf.\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has several models, which are used to interpret and understand the theory. These models include:\n\n*   The model of constructive sets, which is based on the notion of explicit construction.\n*   The model of intuitionistic sets, which is based on the notion of intuitionistic logic.\n*   The model of category theory, which is based on the notion of categories and functors.\n\nNotation\n--------\n\n### Language\n\nConstructive set theory uses a formal language, which is based on the language of intuitionistic logic. This language includes symbols for logical connectives, such as ∧ and ∨, as well as symbols for set-theoretic operations, such as ∪ and ∩.\n\n### Variables\n\nConstructive set theory uses variables to represent sets and their elements. These variables are often denoted by letters such as x, y, and z.\n\n### Classes\n\nConstructive set theory uses classes to represent collections of sets. These classes are often denoted by capital letters such as A, B, and C.\n\n### Extensional equivalence\n\nConstructive set theory defines extensional equivalence as a relation between sets, which holds if and only if the sets have the same elements.\n\nSubtheories of ZF\n-----------------\n\nConstructive set theory has several subtheories, which are based on the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory.

its elements.\n\n#### No universal set\n\nConstructive set theory rejects the notion of a universal set, which is a set that contains all sets.\n\n#### Predicativity\n\nConstructive set theory defines

The primary is typically held in the form of a caucus or primary election, where voters select their preferred candidate.\n\n# Ballot access\n\nTo appear on the ballot in each state, a candidate must meet the state's ballot access requirements. These requirements typically include filing a certain number of signatures or paying a filing fee.\n\n# Debates\n\nThe Republican National Committee has sanctioned several debates during the primary season. The debates are typically held on television and feature a group of candidates discussing various issues.\n\n# Endorsements\n\nSeveral prominent Republicans have endorsed candidates in the primary. These endorsements can provide a boost to a candidate's campaign and help them gain support from voters.\n\n# Opinion polling\n\nOpinion polls have been conducted throughout the primary season to gauge support for each candidate. The polls are typically conducted by telephone or online and ask voters which candidate they support.\n\n# Maps\n\nMaps have been created to show the results of each primary and caucus. The maps typically show the winner of each contest and the number of delegates awarded to each candidate.\n\n# Campaign finance\n\nCandidates in the primary are required to file financial reports with the Federal Election Commission. The reports show the amount of money raised and spent by each campaign.\n\n# Primaries and caucus calendar\n\nThe primary and caucus calendar is the schedule of contests held in each state. The calendar typically runs from January to June, with the majority of contests held in March and April.\n\n## Timing\n\nThe timing of the primary and caucus calendar can have a significant impact on the outcome of the contest. States that hold their contests early in the calendar, such as Iowa and New Hampshire, can have a disproportionate impact on the nomination process.\n\n### Nevada controversy\n\nThe Nevada caucuses were originally scheduled to be held on February 6, but were moved to February 13 due to a dispute over the state's delegate allocation rules.\n\n### Michigan controversy\n\nThe Michigan primary was originally scheduled to be held on March 10, but was moved to March 17 due to a dispute over the state's voting laws.\n\n## Delegates\n\nDelegates are the party officials who are responsible for casting ballots at the national convention. The number of delegates awarded to each candidate in each primary and caucus is typically determined by the state's delegate allocation rules.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* Republican National Committee\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries\" following this outline:\n\n#Results\n#Candidates\n##Nominee\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew during the primaries\n###Other candidates\n##Withdrew before the primaries\n###Other candidates\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###November 2022\n##2023\n###February 2023\n###March 2023\n###April 2023\n###May 2023\n###June 2023\n###August 2023\n###September 2023\n###October 2023\n###November 2023\n###December 2023\n##2024\n###January 2024\n###February 2024\n###March 2024\n###April 2024\n###May 2024\n###June 2024\n###July 2024\n##Eligibility\n##Overview\n##Ballot access\n#Debates\n#Endorsements\n#Opinion polling\n#Maps\n#Campaign finance\n#Primaries and caucus calendar\n##Timing\n###Nevada controversy\n###Michigan controversy\n##Delegates\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The equipment used can vary depending on the type of climbing, the level of difficulty, and the personal preference of the climber. This article will provide an overview of the various types of rock-climbing equipment, their uses, and other relevant information.\n\n# Use and certification\n\n## Type of climbing\n\nRock-climbing equipment is used in various types of climbing, including sport climbing, traditional climbing, ice climbing, and bouldering. Each type of climbing requires different types of equipment, and the specific gear used can vary depending on the terrain, the level of difficulty, and the personal preference of the climber.\n\n## Certification\n\nMany types of rock-climbing equipment are certified by organizations such as the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations (IFMGA), the Union of International Alpine Associations (UIAA), and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

It is a common and generally benign condition, but can be distressing for parents and caregivers. Febrile seizures are usually brief and self-limiting, but in some cases, they can be a sign of an underlying neurological condition.\n\n# Signs and Symptoms\n\nFebrile seizures typically occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the peak age of occurrence being around 18 months. The symptoms of a febrile seizure can vary, but usually include:\n\n* Sudden onset of seizure activity, often with loss of consciousness\n* Muscle stiffness and rigidity\n* Convulsions or shaking\n* Eye rolling or gaze deviation\n* Loss of bladder or bowel control\n* Changes in breathing patterns\n\n## Types\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures: simple and complex.\n\n* Simple febrile seizures are the most common type and account for about 70-80% of cases. They are characterized by a brief, generalized seizure that lasts less than 15 minutes and does not recur within 24 hours.\n* Complex febrile seizures, on the other hand, are longer-lasting and may recur within 24 hours. They can also be focal, meaning they affect only one part of the body.\n\n# Causes\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the rapid increase in body temperature that occurs during a fever. This can cause changes in the brain's electrical activity, leading to a seizure. Some potential triggers for febrile seizures include:\n\n* Viral infections, such as influenza or roseola\n* Bacterial infections, such as ear infections or urinary tract infections\n* Vaccinations, particularly the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine\n* Family history of febrile seizures\n\n# Mechanism\n\nThe exact mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve changes in the brain's electrical activity and neurotransmitter function. Research suggests that febrile seizures may be related to:\n\n* Abnormalities in the brain's temperature regulation systems\n* Changes in the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate\n* Genetic predisposition\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing a febrile seizure typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history, and laboratory tests. The doctor may:\n\n* Take a detailed medical history, including the child's vaccination history and any previous seizures\n* Perform a physical examination to look for signs of infection or other underlying conditions\n* Order laboratory tests, such as blood work or imaging studies, to rule out other potential causes of the seizure\n\n# Prevention\n\nWhile it is not possible to completely prevent febrile seizures, there are some steps that can be taken to reduce the risk:\n\n* Keeping the child's fever under control with medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\n* Ensuring the child is up-to-date on all vaccinations\n* Practicing good hygiene, such as frequent hand-washing, to reduce the risk of infection\n\n# Treatment\n\nThe treatment for febrile seizures typically involves managing the underlying fever and providing supportive care. This may include:\n\n* Medication to reduce the fever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\n* Fluids to prevent dehydration\n* Rest and quiet time to reduce stress and promote recovery\n* In some cases, anticonvulsant medication may be prescribed to prevent future seizures\n\n# Prognosis\n\nThe prognosis for children with febrile seizures is generally good. Most children outgrow febrile seizures by the time they are 5-6 years old, and the risk of developing epilepsy or other neurological conditions is low. However, some children may be at higher risk for future seizures or developmental delays, particularly if they have:\n\n* A family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy\n* A history of complex febrile seizures\n* Underlying neurological or developmental conditions\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition, affecting an estimated 2-5% of children in the United States. They are more common in children under the age of 5, and the peak age of occurrence is around 18 months. Febrile seizures are also more common in certain populations, such as:\n\n* Children with a family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy\n* Children with underlying neurological or developmental conditions\n* Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds\n\nOverall, febrile seizures are a common and generally benign condition, but can be distressing for parents and caregivers. While the exact cause and mechanism of febrile seizures are not fully understood, research continues to uncover new information about this condition.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The party was founded in 1990 and has been active in California politics for over three decades. The Green Party of California is committed to the principles of ecological sustainability, social justice, and grassroots democracy.\n\n#History\n\nThe Green Party of California was founded in 1990 by a group of activists who were inspired by the European Green movement. The party's early years were marked by struggles to gain recognition and ballot access, but it eventually qualified for the ballot in 1992.\n\n##Qualifying for elections\n\nTo qualify for the ballot in California, a political party must either receive 2% of the vote in a gubernatorial or presidential election or gather signatures from 1% of the state's registered voters. The Green Party of California has qualified for the ballot through both methods, but it has not always been easy. In 2004, the party was forced to gather signatures after failing to receive 2% of the vote in the 2002 gubernatorial election.\n\n##Electoral milestones\n\nThe Green Party of California has achieved several electoral milestones over the years. In 2000, the party's presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, received 4.2% of the vote in California, the highest percentage of any third-party candidate in the state's history. In 2006, the party's candidate for governor, Peter Camejo, received 2.3% of the vote, the highest percentage of any Green Party candidate for governor in the state's history.\n\n##Top-two primaries\n\nIn 2010, California voters approved Proposition 14, which established a top-two primary system for state and federal elections. Under this system, the top two candidates in the primary election, regardless of party, advance to the general election. The Green Party of California has been critical of this system, arguing that it discriminates against third-party candidates and limits voter choice.\n\n#Platform\n\nThe Green Party of California's platform is based on the party's national platform and reflects its commitment to ecological sustainability, social justice, and grassroots democracy. Some of the key planks of the party's platform include:\n\n* A transition to 100% renewable energy and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions\n* A single-payer healthcare system and an end to the privatization of healthcare\n* A living wage and an end to income inequality\n* An end to the war on terror and a reduction in military spending\n* A commitment to social justice and an end to systemic racism\n\n#Organization\n\nThe Green Party of California is organized into several levels, including a state party, county parties, and local chapters.\n\n##Membership\n\nMembership in the Green Party of California is open to anyone who supports the party's platform and principles. Members are encouraged to participate in party activities and to run for office.\n\n#Current elected officials\n\nThe Green Party of California has several elected officials at the local level.\n\n##Mayoral offices\n\n* Gayle McLaughlin, Mayor of Richmond (2007-2015)\n* John Duane, Mayor of Sebastopol (2010-2012)\n\n##Municipal councils\n\n* Jesse Townley, Berkeley City Council (2008-2012)\n* Dan Hamburg, Mendocino County Board of Supervisors (2009-2013)\n\n#Election results\n\n##Presidential\n\n* 1992: Ralph Nader, 1.5% of the vote\n* 1996: Ralph Nader, 2.2% of the vote\n* 2000: Ralph Nader, 4.2% of the vote\n* 2004: David Cobb, 0.9% of the vote\n* 2008: Cynthia McKinney, 0.5% of the vote\n* 2012: Jill Stein, 0.7% of the vote\n* 2016: Jill Stein, 1.1% of the vote\n\n##Gubernatorial\n\n* 1998: Dan Hamburg, 1.3% of the vote\n* 2002: Peter Camejo, 5.3% of the vote\n* 2006: Peter Camejo, 2.3% of the vote\n* 2010: Laura Wells, 1.2% of the vote\n* 2014: Luis Rodriguez, 1.3% of the vote\n* 2018: Josh Jones, 1.1% of the vote\n\n##Election qualifying\n\n* 1992: Qualified for the ballot through petition signatures\n* 1996: Qualified for the ballot through 2% of the vote in the 1994 gubernatorial election\n* 2000: Qualified for the ballot through 2% of the vote in the 1998 gubernatorial election\n* 2004: Did not qualify for the ballot, gathered petition signatures\n* 2006: Qualified for the ballot through 2% of the vote in the 2002 gubernatorial election\n* 2010: Qualified for the ballot through 2% of the vote in the 2006 gubernatorial election\n* 2014: Qualified for the ballot through petition signatures\n* 2018: Qualified for the ballot through 2% of the vote in the 2014 gubernatorial election\n\n#Notable members\n\n* Ralph Nader, presidential candidate and consumer advocate\n* Peter Camejo, gubernatorial candidate and activist\n* Cynthia McKinney, presidential candidate and former U.S. Representative\n* Jill Stein, presidential candidate and physician\n* Laura Wells, gubernatorial candidate and activist\n\n#See also\n\n* Green Party of the United States\n* California Green Party\n* Progressive Alliance\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Green Party of California\", which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"Green Party of California\".

His philosophical system, which he developed through a series of lectures and writings, has had a profound impact on the development of modern thought. Hegel's philosophy encompasses a wide range of topics, including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and aesthetics.\n\n# Life\n\n## Formative years\n\n### Stuttgart, Tübingen, Berne, Frankfurt (1770–1800)\n\nHegel was born on August 27, 1770, in Stuttgart, Germany. His father, Georg Ludwig Hegel, was a civil servant, and his mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa Fromm, died when Hegel was just 13 years old. Hegel's early education took place at the Stuttgart Gymnasium, where he excelled in his studies. In 1788, he enrolled at the University of Tübingen, where he studied philosophy, theology, and philology. During his time at Tübingen, Hegel was heavily influenced by the ideas of Immanuel Kant and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Tübingen, Hegel worked as a tutor in Berne, Switzerland, and later in Frankfurt, Germany. During this period, he developed a deep interest in the French Revolution and its ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Hegel's early writings reflect his enthusiasm for the Revolution and his hopes for a new era of human freedom and progress.\n\n## Career years\n\n### Jena, Bamberg, Nuremberg (1801–1816)\n\nIn 1801, Hegel became a Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer) at the University of Jena, where he taught philosophy and developed his own philosophical system. During this period, he wrote his first major work, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit,\" which was published in 1807. The Phenomenology is a comprehensive and systematic work that explores the nature of consciousness, reality, and knowledge.\n\nIn 1807, Hegel left Jena and took up a position as the editor of a newspaper in Bamberg, Germany. However, he soon became disillusioned with the job and moved to Nuremberg, where he taught philosophy at the local gymnasium.\n\n### Heidelberg, Berlin (1816–1831)\n\nIn 1816, Hegel became a professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, where he taught for two years. In 1818, he was appointed as a professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1831. During his time in Berlin, Hegel developed his philosophical system further and wrote several important works, including \"The Science of Logic\" and \"The Philosophy of Right.\"\n\n# Influences\n\nHegel's philosophy was influenced by a wide range of thinkers, including Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Aristotle. He was also deeply influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution and the German Romantic movement. Hegel's philosophy reflects his engagement with the intellectual and cultural currents of his time, and his work continues to be relevant to contemporary debates in philosophy, politics, and culture.\n\n# The Phenomenology of Spirit\n\nThe Phenomenology of Spirit is Hegel's first major philosophical work, published in 1807. The book is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of the nature of consciousness, reality, and knowledge. Hegel's central argument is that consciousness is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments.\n\nThe Phenomenology is divided into several sections, each of which explores a different stage of consciousness. The book begins with an analysis of sense-certainty, which is the most basic and immediate form of consciousness. Hegel then moves on to explore more complex forms of consciousness, including perception, understanding, and reason.\n\nThroughout the Phenomenology, Hegel employs a dialectical method, which involves the presentation of opposing views or perspectives, followed by a higher level of understanding that synthesizes and reconciles these opposing views. This method is central to Hegel's philosophy and is reflected in his famous dictum that \"the true is the whole.\"\n\n# Philosophical system\n\nHegel's philosophical system is a comprehensive and systematic framework that encompasses a wide range of topics, including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and aesthetics. The system is divided into three main parts: the Science of Logic, the Philosophy of Nature, and the Philosophy of Spirit.\n\n## Science of Logic\n\nThe Science of Logic is the first part of Hegel's philosophical system, published in 1812. The book is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of the nature of logic and reasoning. Hegel's central argument is that logic is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments.\n\nThe Science of Logic is divided into three main sections: the doctrine of being, the doctrine of essence, and the doctrine of the concept. Each section explores a different aspect of logic and reasoning, and together they provide a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding the nature of reality and knowledge.\n\n## Philosophy of the real\n\nThe Philosophy of the real is the second part of Hegel's philosophical system, published in 1817. The book is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of the nature of reality, including the natural world and human society.\n\nThe Philosophy of the real is divided into two main sections: the Philosophy of Nature and the Philosophy of Spirit. The Philosophy of Nature explores the natural world, including the laws of physics and the natural sciences. The Philosophy of Spirit explores human society, including ethics, politics, and culture.\n\n## The Philosophy of Nature\n\nThe Philosophy of Nature is the first section of the Philosophy of the real, published in 1817. The book is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of the natural world, including the laws of physics and the natural sciences.\n\nHegel's central argument is that the natural world is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments. The book is divided into three main sections: mechanics, physics, and organic nature.\n\n## The Philosophy of Spirit\n\nThe Philosophy of Spirit is the second section of the Philosophy of the real, published in 1817. The book is a comprehensive and systematic exploration of human society, including ethics, politics, and culture.\n\nHegel's central argument is that human society is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments. The book is divided into three main sections: subjective spirit, objective spirit, and absolute spirit.\n\n### Subjective spirit\n\nSubjective spirit refers to the individual human being, including their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Hegel's central argument is that the individual human being is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments.\n\n### Objective spirit\n\nObjective spirit refers to human society, including ethics, politics, and culture. Hegel's central argument is that human society is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and dialectical process that unfolds through a series of stages or moments.\n\n### Absolute spirit\n\nAbsolute spirit refers to the highest level of human understanding and knowledge, including art, religion, and philosophy.

The referendums were held from September 23 to 27, 2022, and asked residents whether they supported joining the Russian Federation.\n\n# Background\n\nThe referendums were announced on September 20, 2022, by the Russian-backed authorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, which have been recognized as independent states only by Russia, Syria, and North Korea. The Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts, which have been under Russian occupation since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, also announced plans to hold referendums.\n\nThe referendums were widely seen as a move by Russia to annex the occupied territories, which would allow Moscow to claim that any further Ukrainian attempts to retake the areas would be an attack on Russian territory. The move was also seen as an attempt by Russia to legitimize its occupation of the territories and to create a pretext for further military action.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe referendums were organized by the Russian-backed authorities in the occupied territories, with the support of Russian officials and military personnel. The voting process was overseen by Russian officials, and the ballots were printed in Russia.\n\nThe referendums were held in the midst of an ongoing conflict, with Ukrainian forces attempting to retake the occupied territories. The voting process was disrupted in some areas due to shelling and other security concerns.\n\n# Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\n\n## Questions\n\nThe referendums in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts asked residents whether they supported joining the Russian Federation.

The question on the ballot was: \"Do you support the joining of the Kherson Oblast to the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n## Result\n\nThe result of the referendum in the Kherson Oblast was announced on September 28, 2022. According to the Russian-backed authorities, the turnout was over 80%, with over 87% of voters supporting joining the Russian Federation.\n\n# Zaporizhzhia Oblast\n\n## Question\n\nThe referendum in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast asked residents whether they supported joining the Russian Federation.

According to the Russian-backed authorities, the turnout was over 70%, with over 93% of voters supporting joining the Russian Federation.\n\n# Other planned locations\n\n## Mykolaiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian-backed authorities in the Mykolaiv Oblast had announced plans to hold a referendum on joining the Russian Federation, but the vote was postponed due to security concerns.\n\n## Kharkiv Oblast\n\nThe Russian-backed authorities in the Kharkiv Oblast had announced plans to hold a referendum on joining the Russian Federation, but the vote was postponed due to security concerns.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the occupied territories before the referendums showed that a majority of residents supported joining the Russian Federation. However, the polls were widely seen as unreliable due to the lack of independence and the presence of Russian military personnel in the areas.\n\n# Opinions on the goals of holding referendums\n\nThe goals of holding the referendums were widely seen as a move by Russia to annex the occupied territories and to create a pretext for further military action. Ukrainian officials and international observers saw the referendums as illegitimate and a sham.\n\n# Conduct\n\n## First day\n\nThe referendums began on September 23, 2022, with voters going to the polls in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. The voting process was disrupted in some areas due to shelling and other security concerns.\n\n## Second day\n\nOn the second day of the referendums, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts went to the polls. The voting process was also disrupted in some areas due to security concerns.\n\n## Third day\n\nOn the third day of the referendums, voters in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts continued to cast their ballots. The voting process was disrupted in some areas due to shelling and other security concerns.\n\n## Fourth day\n\nOn the fourth day of the referendums, voters in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts continued to cast their ballots.

President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would respect the results of the referendums.\n\n## International organisations\n\nThe European Union, the United States, and other international organizations condemned the referendums as illegitimate and a sham.

The match was contested between the Geelong Cats and the Sydney Swans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on September 24, 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 AFL season was marked by several significant events, including the return of the competition to a traditional home-and-away format after two years of disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season saw a resurgence in form from several traditional powerhouse clubs, including the Geelong Cats, who ultimately finished the home-and-away season on top of the ladder.\n\nThe Sydney Swans, on the other hand, had a more tumultuous season, marked by injuries to key players and a mid-season slump that saw them drop out of the top eight. However, the Swans rallied in the final rounds of the season, winning several crucial matches to secure a spot in the finals.\n\nThe two teams had a long and storied history, having contested several Grand Finals in the past. The Geelong Cats were seeking their 17th premiership, while the Sydney Swans were aiming for their sixth.\n\n# Ceremonies and entertainment\n\n## Parade\n\nThe traditional Grand Final parade was held on the morning of the match, with both teams making their way through the streets of Melbourne to the MCG. The parade was attended by thousands of fans, who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of their favorite players.\n\n## On-field events\n\nPrior to the match, several on-field events were held, including the traditional Grand Final sprint and the AFL mascots' challenge. The sprint was won by Geelong's Isaac Smith, while the mascots' challenge was taken out by the Sydney Swans' mascot, Cyggy.\n\n# Match summary\n\n## First quarter\n\nThe match began with a flurry of intensity, as both teams applied plenty of pressure and created scoring opportunities. The Geelong Cats drew first blood, with Tom Hawkins kicking the first goal of the match. The Swans responded quickly, with Lance Franklin kicking two goals in quick succession.\n\nThe quarter ended with the Swans leading by a single point, 3.3 (21) to 3.2 (20). The intensity of the quarter was reflected in the possession stats, with both teams accumulating over 90 disposals.\n\n## Second quarter\n\nThe second quarter saw the Geelong Cats take control of the match, with Hawkins and Jeremy Cameron kicking two goals each. The Swans struggled to contain the Cats' forward line, which was well served by the dominant ruck work of Rhys Stanley.\n\nThe quarter ended with the Cats leading by 24 points, 8.5 (53) to 4.5 (29). The Swans were struggling to find a way into the match, with several key players, including Franklin and Isaac Heeney, being well held by the Cats' defenders.\n\n## Third quarter\n\nThe third quarter saw the Swans mount a comeback, with Franklin and Heeney starting to find more of the ball. The Swans kicked three goals for the quarter, with the Cats managing just one.\n\nThe quarter ended with the Cats leading by 19 points, 9.6 (60) to 7.5 (47). The Swans had reduced the margin, but still had a significant amount of work to do to get back into the match.\n\n## Final quarter\n\nThe final quarter saw the Cats seal the match, with Hawkins and Cameron kicking two goals each. The Swans managed just one goal for the quarter, with the Cats' defenders holding firm.\n\nThe match ended with the Geelong Cats winning by 81 points, 20.13 (133) to 8.4 (52). The Cats had dominated the match, with several key players, including Hawkins, Cameron, and Patrick Dangerfield, starring.\n\n## Overall\n\nThe match was marked by a dominant performance from the Geelong Cats, who had won their 17th premiership. The Sydney Swans had fought hard, but were ultimately outclassed by a more experienced and skilled opponent.\n\n## Norm Smith Medal\n\nThe Norm Smith Medal was awarded to Isaac Smith of the Geelong Cats, who had played a crucial role in the match. Smith had gathered 32 disposals and kicked two goals, and was widely regarded as the best player on the ground.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe teams were as follows:\n\nGeelong Cats:\n\n* 1. Rhys Stanley\n* 2.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in American history, and is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his role in drafting and promoting the United States Constitution.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nJames Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to Colonel James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Rose Conway. He was the oldest of twelve children, and his family was considered to be part of the Virginia gentry. Madison's father was a prominent planter and politician, and his mother was from a wealthy family.\n\nMadison received his early education from his mother and a series of tutors, and later attended the Innes Creek School. In 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he studied under the tutelage of President John Witherspoon. Madison graduated in 1771, and then returned to Virginia to pursue a career in politics.\n\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n\nMadison became involved in the American Revolution in 1774, when he was elected to the Orange County Committee of Safety. He later served as a delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he played a key role in drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights.\n\nIn 1780, Madison was elected to the Continental Congress, where he served until 1783. He played a key role in the Congress, serving on several committees and helping to negotiate the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the war, Madison served as a delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates, where he helped to draft the Virginia Plan, which proposed a new form of government for the United States. In 1787, he was elected to the Constitutional Convention, where he played a key role in drafting the United States Constitution.\n\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n\nMadison played a key role in the ratification of the Constitution, serving as a leader of the Federalist Party in Virginia. He wrote several essays, including Federalist No. 10, in which he argued that a strong central government was necessary to protect individual liberties and promote national prosperity.\n\nIn 1788, Madison was elected to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where he helped to secure the state's ratification of the Constitution. He also played a key role in the ratification debates in other states, traveling throughout the country to promote the Constitution.\n\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n\n##Election to Congress\n\nIn 1789, Madison was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1797. He was a key leader of the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party and its policies.\n\n##Bill of Rights\n\nMadison played a key role in the drafting and passage of the Bill of Rights, which guaranteed individual liberties and limited the power of the federal government. He introduced the amendments to the House of Representatives in 1789, and helped to secure their passage in 1791.\n\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n\nIn 1792, Madison and Thomas Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party, which opposed the Federalist Party and its policies. Madison served as a key leader of the party, helping to promote its principles and elect its candidates.\n\n##Marriage and family\n\nIn 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, a wealthy widow from Philadelphia. The couple had no children, but raised Dolley's son from a previous marriage.\n\n##Adams presidency\n\nIn 1797, Madison retired from Congress and returned to Virginia, where he served as a delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates. He opposed the policies of President John Adams, who was a member of the Federalist Party.\n\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n\nIn 1801, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Thomas Jefferson, who was a close friend and ally. Madison served in the position until 1809, helping to negotiate several treaties and promote American foreign policy.\n\n##1808 presidential election\n\nIn 1808, Madison was elected President of the United States, defeating Charles C. Pinckney in the general election. He was inaugurated on March 4, 1809.\n\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n\nMadison was inaugurated as President on March 4, 1809. He appointed a cabinet that included several notable figures, including Secretary of State Robert Smith and Secretary of War William Eustis.\n\n##War of 1812\n\nMadison's presidency was marked by the War of 1812, which was fought against the British Empire. The war was sparked by several factors, including British impressment of American sailors and trade restrictions.\n\n###Prelude to war\n\nMadison and his administration sought to avoid war with the British, but ultimately decided that it was necessary to protect American interests. In June 1812, Madison asked Congress to declare war on the British Empire.\n\n###Military actions\n\nThe War of 1812 was marked by several key military actions, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops and the American victory at the Battle of Lake Erie. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814.\n\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n\nAfter the war, Madison's administration sought to promote American economic development and reduce the national debt. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, declined in influence and eventually disbanded.\n\n##Native American policy\n\nMadison's administration also sought to promote American expansion and settlement, which led to conflicts with Native American tribes. Madison's administration sought to remove Native American tribes from their lands and relocate them to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).\n\n##Election of 1816\n\nIn 1816, Madison declined to run for re-election, and was succeeded by James Monroe. Madison retired to Virginia, where he lived until his death in 1836.\n\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n\n##Death\n\nMadison died on June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. He was buried on his estate, Montpelier, in Virginia.\n\n#Political and religious views\n\n##Federalism\n\nMadison was a strong supporter of federalism, which holds that power should be divided between the federal government and the states. He believed that a strong central government was necessary to protect individual liberties and promote national prosperity.\n\n##Religion\n\nMadison was a member of the Episcopal Church, and believed in the importance of religious freedom. He supported the separation of church and state, and believed that the government should not favor one religion over another.\n\n#Slavery\n\nMadison owned slaves throughout his life, and supported the institution of slavery. However, he also believed that slavery was morally wrong, and sought to limit its expansion.\n\n#Legacy\n\nMadison's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in American history, and is often referred to as the \"Father of the Constitution.\" His presidency was marked by significant challenges, including the War of 1812, but he is also remembered for his commitment to individual liberties and limited government.\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n##Citations\n\n##Sources\n\n#Further reading\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Madison\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n#Ratification of the Constitution\n#Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)\n##Election to Congress\n##Bill of Rights\n##Founding the Democratic–Republican Party\n##Marriage and family\n##Adams presidency\n#Secretary of State (1801–1809)\n##1808 presidential election\n#Presidency (1809–1817)\n##Inauguration and cabinet\n##War of 1812\n###Prelude to war\n###Military actions\n##Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition\n##Native American policy\n##Election of 1816\n#Post-presidency (1817–1836)\n##Death\n#Political and religious views\n##Federalism\n##Religion\n#Slavery\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The area has been a focal point for concerns about homelessness, substance abuse, and public health in the city.\n\nAftermath of Long Island closure\n\nThe area around Mass. and Cass began to attract attention in 2014, after the City of Boston closed the Long Island Shelter, a homeless shelter and treatment center located on Long Island in Boston Harbor. The shelter had provided services to over 700 individuals, including food, shelter, and substance abuse treatment.\n\n### Closure of Long Island services\n\nThe closure of the Long Island Shelter was a result of concerns about the safety of the island's bridge, which was deemed to be in disrepair. The city was unable to find a suitable replacement for the shelter, and many of the individuals who had been receiving services there were forced to seek alternative accommodations. Some of these individuals began to congregate in the area around Mass. and Cass, where they could access methadone clinics, food banks, and other social services.\n\n### Shelter openings at Mass. and Cass\n\nIn response to the growing number of people congregating in the area, the City of Boston and local non-profits opened several new shelters and service centers around Mass. and Cass. These included the Southampton Street Shelter, the New England Center for Homeless Veterans, and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. While these shelters and service centers provided much-needed support to individuals in need, they also contributed to the growing concentration of homeless and substance-abusing individuals in the area.\n\nBusiness concerns\n\nAs the number of homeless and substance-abusing individuals in the area around Mass. and Cass grew, local business owners began to express concerns about the impact on their businesses. Some businesses reported a decline in foot traffic and sales, while others complained about the presence of loiterers, litter, and crime. The area's reputation as a hub for substance abuse and homelessness also made it difficult for businesses to attract and retain employees.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe exact number of people living in the area around Mass. and Cass is difficult to determine, as many individuals are transient or do not participate in official counts. However, estimates suggest that there are several hundred people living in the area, including many who are homeless or struggling with substance abuse.\n\nEfforts to clear out the encampment\n\nIn recent years, the City of Boston has made several efforts to clear out the encampment of homeless and substance-abusing individuals around Mass. and Cass.\n\n### Operation Clean Sweep\n\nIn 2019, the City of Boston launched Operation Clean Sweep, a multi-agency effort to clear out the area around Mass. and Cass. The operation involved the Boston Police Department, the Boston Public Health Commission, and other city agencies, and resulted in the removal of over 100 individuals from the area.\n\n### Sheriff's proposal to force treatment of individuals\n\nIn 2020, Suffolk County Sheriff Steven Tompkins proposed a plan to force individuals struggling with substance abuse into treatment programs. The plan would have allowed law enforcement to involuntarily commit individuals who were deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. However, the plan was met with opposition from civil liberties groups and was ultimately not implemented.\n\n### Executive order to clear encampment\n\nIn 2022, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued an executive order directing city agencies to clear out the encampment of homeless and substance-abusing individuals around Mass. and Cass. The order called for the city to provide alternative housing and services to individuals in need, while also taking steps to address public health and safety concerns in the area.\n\n### Sweep and diversion to low-threshold shelters\n\nIn response to the executive order, the City of Boston conducted a sweep of the area around Mass. and Cass, resulting in the removal of over 200 individuals. Many of these individuals were diverted to low-threshold shelters, which provide housing and services to individuals without requiring them to meet certain conditions, such as sobriety or employment.\n\nCollection of syringes\n\nOne of the ongoing concerns in the area around Mass. and Cass is the presence of discarded syringes. The City of Boston has implemented a syringe collection program, which allows individuals to dispose of used syringes in designated receptacles.

His life and work were marked by periods of turmoil and transformation, reflecting the changing cultural and political landscape of Europe during the early 20th century.\n\n# Biography\n\n## 1883–1908: Upbringing between late Imperial Vienna and countryside\n\n### Bucolic Heimat\n\nWebern was born on December 3, 1883, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. His family moved to the countryside, where he spent most of his childhood. This rural upbringing instilled in him a love for nature and a strong connection to the Austrian folk tradition.\n\n### University\n\nWebern studied musicology at the University of Vienna, where he earned his doctorate in 1906. His dissertation on the Choralis Constantinus of Heinrich Isaac marked the beginning of his lifelong interest in Renaissance music.\n\n### Schoenberg and his circle\n\nIn 1904, Webern met Arnold Schoenberg, who would become his mentor and friend. Schoenberg's innovative and provocative music had a profound impact on Webern, who soon became a member of his inner circle, along with Alban Berg and other like-minded musicians.\n\n## 1908–1918: Early adulthood in Austria-Hungary and German Empire\n\n### Marriage\n\nIn 1911, Webern married Wilhelmine Mörtl, with whom he had a daughter, Amalie, in 1912.\n\n### Early conducting career\n\nWebern began his conducting career in 1908, working with various ensembles and orchestras in Austria and Germany. His early performances were marked by a sense of experimentation and innovation.\n\n### Psychotherapy\n\nIn 1912, Webern underwent psychotherapy with Alfred Adler, a prominent figure in the development of individual psychology. This experience had a lasting impact on Webern's personal and artistic life.\n\n### \"Old song\" of \"lost paradise\"\n\nDuring this period, Webern composed music that reflected his nostalgia for a lost paradise, a longing for a simpler, more innocent time. His music from this era is characterized by a sense of intimacy and lyricism.\n\n### World War I\n\nWebern served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, an experience that profoundly affected him. He was stationed on the Italian front, where he witnessed the devastating consequences of war.\n\n### Austrian defeat and socioeconomic strain\n\nThe defeat of Austria-Hungary in 1918 led to a period of socioeconomic strain, marked by inflation, poverty, and social unrest. Webern's music from this era reflects his anxiety and concern for the future.\n\n## 1918–1933: Rise in Rotes Wien (Interwar Vienna)\n\n### Society for Private Musical Performances\n\nIn 1918, Webern co-founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, an organization dedicated to promoting new and innovative music. The society's concerts became a hub for avant-garde musicians and composers.\n\n### Mature conducting career\n\nWebern's conducting career flourished during this period, marked by performances of his own music and that of his contemporaries.\n\n### Relative success in a destabilizing society\n\nDespite the turmoil and uncertainty of the time, Webern achieved a measure of success, both as a composer and conductor. His music was performed and celebrated by a growing circle of admirers.\n\n## 1933–1938: Perseverance in Schwarzes Wien (Austrofascist Vienna)\n\n### Marginalization at home\n\nThe rise of Austrofascism in 1933 led to Webern's marginalization in his home country. His music was seen as too radical and innovative, and he faced increasing opposition from conservative forces.\n\n### Besieged milieu and political confusion\n\nWebern's circle of friends and colleagues was besieged by the rising tide of fascism. Many of his friends and acquaintances were forced into exile or persecuted.\n\n### Visiting conducting career\n\nWebern continued to conduct abroad, visiting countries such as Switzerland and Czechoslovakia. These performances allowed him to maintain a connection to the international musical community.\n\n## 1938–1939: Inner emigration in Nazi Germany\n\n### Anschluss\n\nIn 1938, Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, marking the beginning of a period of inner emigration for Webern. He remained in Vienna, but his music and artistic activities were severely curtailed.\n\n### Kristallnacht and recoil\n\nThe Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938 marked a turning point for Webern. He was deeply affected by the violence and persecution of Jewish people, and his music from this era reflects his sense of despair and hopelessness.\n\n## 1939–1945: Hope and disillusionment during World War II\n\n### Swiss and Reich prospects\n\nWebern's hopes for a better future were dashed by the outbreak of World War II. He considered fleeing to Switzerland, but ultimately remained in Austria.\n\n### Wartime hopes and reality\n\nWebern's music from this era is marked by a sense of hope and defiance. However, the reality of war and occupation soon became apparent, and his music took on a more somber and introspective tone.\n\n### Refuge and death in Mittersill\n\nIn 1945, Webern fled to the town of Mittersill, where he hoped to find refuge. However, he was accidentally shot by an American soldier on September 15, 1945, while standing in the doorway of his home.\n\n# Music\n\n## 1899–1908: Formative juvenilia and emergence from study\n\nWebern's early music was influenced by the Romantic tradition and the folk music of his native Austria. His juvenilia is characterized by a sense of experimentation and innovation.\n\n## 1908–1914: Atonality and aphorisms\n\nWebern's music from this era is marked by a move towards atonality and a focus on concise, aphoristic forms. His songs and instrumental works from this period are characterized by a sense of intensity and lyricism.\n\n## 1914–1924: Mid-period Lieder\n\nWebern's mid-period Lieder are marked by a sense of intimacy and expressiveness. His use of atonality and twelve-tone technique creates a sense of tension and drama.\n\n## 1924–1945: Formal coherence and expansion\n\nWebern's late music is characterized by a sense of formal coherence and expansion. His use of serial technique and twelve-tone rows creates a sense of unity and integration.\n\n## Arrangements and orchestrations\n\nWebern also arranged and orchestrated the music of other composers, including Bach, Brahms, and Schoenberg. These arrangements demonstrate his versatility and skill as a composer.\n\n# Reception, influence, and legacy\n\n## Performance practice\n\nWebern's music was often performed by his contemporaries, including the pianist Eduard Steuermann and the conductor Hermann Scherchen. His music was also performed by the Vienna Philharmonic and other prominent ensembles.\n\n## Contemporaries\n\n### Artists\n\nWebern's circle of friends and acquaintances included artists such as Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele. These artists shared his interest in innovation and experimentation.\n\n### Musicians\n\nWebern's contemporaries included musicians such as Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Igor Stravinsky. These composers influenced his music and artistic development.\n\n## 1947–1950s: (Re)discovery and post-Webernism\n\nAfter World War II, Webern's music experienced a period of rediscovery and reevaluation. His music influenced a new generation of composers, including Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\n## 1950s onward: Beyond (late) Webern\n\nWebern's music continued to influence composers throughout the 20th century. His use of serial technique and twelve-tone rows paved the way for the development of avant-garde and experimental music.\n\n## Eastern Europe\n\n### Eastern Bloc\n\nWebern's music was also influential in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Czechoslovakia. His music was performed and celebrated by composers such as Witold Lutosławski and Antonín Rejcha.\n\n### Soviet Russia\n\nWebern's music was also influential in Soviet Russia, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s.

His music is now recognized as a key part of the modernist tradition, and his influence can be heard in a wide range of musical genres.\n\n# Recordings by Webern\n\nWebern made several recordings of his music, including performances of his orchestral and chamber works.

The film is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, with a narrative set in the 1960s. Cirkus is scheduled for release in December 2023 and stars Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Jacqueline Fernandez, Varun Sharma, and Johnny Lever in key roles.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film's narrative is set in the 1960s and revolves around two sets of identical twins, who were accidentally separated at birth. The story follows the journey of these twins as they unknowingly cross paths with each other, leading to a series of humorous misunderstandings and unexpected events. As the twins navigate their way through love, friendship, and family, they must also confront their own identities and the consequences of their mistaken identities.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Ranveer Singh as Rohan / Akash\n* Pooja Hegde as Mala\n* Jacqueline Fernandez as Bindu\n* Varun Sharma as Ganguly\n* Johnny Lever as Dr. Gulati\n* Sanjay Mishra as Dilaawar\n* Vrajesh Hirjee as Vishwanath\n* Ashwini Kalsekar as Lily\n* Siddhartha Jadhav as Dattaram Tawde\n* Mukesh Tiwari as Chhota Pandit\n* Vijay Patkar as Pandit\n* Anil Charanjeett as Dr. Verma\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe idea of adapting The Comedy of Errors into a Bollywood film was first conceived by Rohit Shetty, who had previously directed films like Golmaal and Singham. Shetty was fascinated by the Shakespearean play's narrative and saw potential in adapting it into a comedy film set in the 1960s. He collaborated with writers Yunus Sajawal and Farhad Samji to develop the screenplay, which took several months to complete. The film's title, Cirkus, was inspired by the chaos and confusion that ensues when the twins cross paths.\n\n## Casting\n\nRanveer Singh was the first actor to be cast in the film, playing the dual role of Rohan and Akash. Singh was drawn to the project due to the complexity of his characters and the opportunity to play a double role. Pooja Hegde and Jacqueline Fernandez were subsequently cast as the female leads, playing the roles of Mala and Bindu. Varun Sharma, Johnny Lever, and Sanjay Mishra were cast in supporting roles, bringing their comedic expertise to the film.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Cirkus began in November 2021 and took place in various locations across India, including Mumbai, Goa, and Ooty. The film's shooting schedule was extensive, with the cast and crew working tirelessly to complete the project within the given timeframe. Rohit Shetty's direction and the cast's performances were praised by the crew, who were impressed by the energy and enthusiasm on set.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production work on Cirkus began in early 2022, with the editing and visual effects teams working to enhance the film's narrative and aesthetic. The film's music, composed by Pritam, was also recorded during this period. The post-production process took several months to complete, with the team working to ensure that the final product met Rohit Shetty's vision.\n\n# Music\n\nThe music for Cirkus was composed by Pritam, with lyrics written by Kumaar, Shloke Lal, and Arafat Mehmood. The film's soundtrack features several songs, including the title track \"Cirkus\", \"Sun Zara\", and \"Aashiqui\". The music was well-received by fans and critics, who praised the catchy melodies and lyrics.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nCirkus is scheduled for release on December 23, 2023, in theaters across India. The film will be distributed by Reliance Entertainment and T-Series, with a wide release planned to cater to the holiday season.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film's home media release is expected to take place in early 2024, with a digital release on streaming platforms and a DVD release planned for later in the year.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nCirkus has generated significant buzz among critics, who are eagerly awaiting the film's release. The film's trailer and promotional materials have been well-received, with praise for the cast's performances and the film's comedic tone.\n\n## Box office\n\nCirkus is expected to perform well at the box office, given the popularity of Rohit Shetty's previous films and the star-studded cast. The film's release during the holiday season is also expected to boost its box office prospects.\n\n# See also\n\n* The Comedy of Errors\n* Bollywood\n* Indian cinema\n* Rohit Shetty\n* Ranveer Singh\n* Pooja Hegde\n* Jacqueline Fernandez\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cirkus_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The sixth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Fiona caused widespread damage and disruption to multiple countries, resulting in significant loss of life and property.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Fiona originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 6, 2022. The wave gradually organized as it moved westward across the Atlantic, eventually developing into a tropical depression on September 14, approximately 1,500 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fiona later that day, and further intensified into a hurricane on September 16.\n\nFiona continued to intensify as it moved west-northwestward, reaching Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale on September 18. The hurricane then underwent rapid intensification, reaching Category 4 strength on September 19, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and a minimum central pressure of 956 mbar. Fiona maintained this intensity as it approached the Caribbean, eventually making landfall in Guadeloupe on September 20.\n\n#Preparations\n\nIn anticipation of Fiona's arrival, several Caribbean islands and Eastern Canadian provinces issued tropical storm watches and warnings. The French government issued a red alert for Guadeloupe, while the Puerto Rican government declared a state of emergency. The Dominican Republic and Turks and Caicos also issued tropical storm warnings, with the latter evacuating tourists from the islands.\n\nIn Eastern Canada, the Canadian government issued tropical storm watches for Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island also declared states of emergency, with residents advised to stock up on supplies and prepare for power outages.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Guadeloupe\n\nFiona made landfall in Guadeloupe on September 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused widespread damage, including destroyed homes, downed power lines, and flooded roads. The island's airport was also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##Puerto Rico\n\nFiona passed just south of Puerto Rico on September 20, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused significant damage, including power outages, landslides, and flooding. The island's water supply was also disrupted, with several municipalities left without access to clean water.\n\n##Dominican Republic\n\nFiona made landfall in the Dominican Republic on September 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the eastern part of the country. The hurricane caused widespread damage, including destroyed homes, downed power lines, and flooded roads. The country's airport was also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##Turks and Caicos\n\nFiona passed just north of the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 20, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the islands. The hurricane caused significant damage, including power outages, landslides, and flooding. The islands' airport was also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##Antigua\n\nFiona passed just north of Antigua on September 20, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused significant damage, including power outages, landslides, and flooding. The island's airport was also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##Bermuda\n\nFiona passed just east of Bermuda on September 22, bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The hurricane caused significant damage, including power outages, landslides, and flooding. The island's airport was also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n##Eastern Canada\n\nFiona made landfall in Eastern Canada on September 24, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the provinces of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland. The hurricane caused widespread damage, including power outages, landslides, and flooding. The provinces' airports were also closed, with flights suspended until further notice.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Puerto Rico\n\nIn the aftermath of Fiona's passage, Puerto Rico faced significant challenges in restoring power and water services. The island's electrical grid was severely damaged, with over 80% of customers left without power. The water supply was also disrupted, with several municipalities left without access to clean water.\n\n##Dominican Republic\n\nIn the aftermath of Fiona's passage, the Dominican Republic faced significant challenges in restoring power and water services. The country's electrical grid was severely damaged, with over 70% of customers left without power. The water supply was also disrupted, with several municipalities left without access to clean water.\n\n#Retirement\n\nDue to the significant damage and loss of life caused by Fiona, the name was retired from the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 2023. The name will not be used again in the future.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes\n* Hurricane Maria (2017)\n* Hurricane Irma (2017)\n\n#External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC)\n* National Weather Service (NWS)\n* Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Fiona\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n##Guadeloupe\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n##Turks and Caicos\n##Antigua\n##Bermuda\n##Eastern Canada\n#Aftermath\n##Puerto Rico\n##Dominican Republic\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks Swift's first studio release since Evermore (2020) and her fifth album in the past three years.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nIn 2020, Swift released two surprise albums, Folklore and Evermore, which explored indie folk and alternative rock sounds. The albums received critical acclaim and commercial success, with Folklore becoming the best-selling album of 2020. After the release of Evermore, Swift began working on new music, teasing her fans with cryptic messages and social media posts.\n\nConcept and writing\n-------------------\n\nMidnights is a concept album that explores the idea of \"the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\" Swift wrote the album during periods of insomnia, drawing inspiration from her personal experiences, emotions, and observations. The album's themes are deeply personal, with Swift tackling topics such as love, loss, anxiety, and self-discovery.\n\n### Themes\n\nThe album's themes are woven throughout the lyrics, with Swift exploring ideas of identity, relationships, and introspection. The album's opening track, \"Lavender Haze,\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, with Swift describing the feeling of being in a romantic relationship that is both exhilarating and suffocating. Other tracks, such as \"Anti-Hero\" and \"Karma,\" explore themes of self-doubt, guilt, and the consequences of one's actions.\n\nProduction and music\n-------------------\n\nMidnights was produced by Swift, Jack Antonoff, and Aaron Dessner, who also worked on Folklore and Evermore. The album's sound is characterized by its use of electronic and pop elements, with Swift incorporating synthesizers, drum machines, and atmospheric soundscapes into her music. The album's production is more experimental than Swift's previous work, with Swift pushing the boundaries of her songwriting and exploring new sonic textures.\n\nArtwork and aesthetics\n---------------------\n\nThe album's artwork features a photograph of Swift taken by Beth Garrabrant, with Swift appearing in a contemplative pose, surrounded by shadows and dim lighting. The album's aesthetic is minimalist and moody, reflecting the album's themes of introspection and self-discovery. The album's packaging includes a 12-page booklet featuring lyrics, photographs, and illustrations.\n\nRelease and promotion\n--------------------\n\nMidnights was announced on August 28, 2022, with Swift revealing the album's title, release date, and tracklist on social media. The album's lead single, \"Anti-Hero,\" was released on October 21, 2022, and debuted at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Swift performed the song live for the first time at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, and also performed a series of secret shows in New York City and Los Angeles to promote the album.\n\nCommercial performance\n---------------------\n\nMidnights debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling over 1.5 million copies in its first week. The album also reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and Canadian Albums Chart, among others. The album's singles, \"Anti-Hero\" and \"Lavender Haze,\" both reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, with \"Anti-Hero\" becoming Swift's 10th number-one single on the chart.\n\nCritical reception\n-----------------\n\nMidnights received widespread critical acclaim, with many critics praising Swift's songwriting, production, and experimentation. The album holds a Metacritic score of 84 out of 100, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" Rolling Stone described the album as \"her most experimental and introspective album yet,\" while The New York Times praised Swift's \"emotional candor and melodic craftsmanship.\"\n\n### Rankings\n\nMidnights has been included on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2022 and The New York Times' Best Albums of 2022. The album was also included on several decade-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 200 Best Albums of the 2020s.\n\nAwards\n------\n\nMidnights has been nominated for several awards, including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album. The album won the Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album and the MTV Video Music Award for Album of the Year.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nMidnights has had a significant impact on the music industry, with many artists citing Swift as an influence and inspiration.

The cyclone formed in the Coral Sea and intensified into a category 3 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the affected regions.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Gabrielle formed on February 6, 2023, in the Coral Sea, approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of Cairns, Australia. The system initially developed as a tropical low-pressure system and gradually intensified into a tropical cyclone over the next few days. On February 10, Gabrielle reached its peak intensity as a category 3 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale, with maximum sustained winds of 120 kilometers per hour (75 miles per hour) and a central pressure of 965 hectopascals (28.5 inHg).\n\nAs Gabrielle moved southwards, it began to interact with a low-pressure system in the Tasman Sea, resulting in a complex weather pattern that brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the affected regions. On February 12, Gabrielle made landfall in northern New Zealand, bringing widespread damage and disruption to the region.\n\n#Effects\n\n##Melanesia\n\nGabrielle brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several countries in Melanesia, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia. In Vanuatu, the cyclone caused widespread damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the northern provinces of Malampa and Penama. The Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office reported that over 1,000 homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving thousands of people without shelter.\n\nIn the Solomon Islands, Gabrielle caused significant damage to the capital city of Honiara, with reports of downed power lines, fallen trees, and damaged buildings. The Solomon Islands government declared a state of emergency and deployed relief teams to affected areas.\n\n##Norfolk Island\n\nGabrielle brought strong winds and rough seas to Norfolk Island, a small island territory in the Pacific Ocean between Australia and New Zealand. The island experienced power outages, property damage, and disruptions to essential services. The Australian government, which is responsible for the administration of Norfolk Island, deployed relief teams to the island to assist with recovery efforts.\n\n##New Zealand\n\nGabrielle made landfall in northern New Zealand on February 12, bringing widespread damage and disruption to the region. The cyclone caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Northland, Auckland, and Waikato regions.\n\n###Northland\n\nIn Northland, Gabrielle caused widespread damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Whangarei and Kaipara districts. The Northland Regional Council reported that over 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Auckland\n\nIn Auckland, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the northern suburbs. The Auckland Council reported that over 500 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Waikato\n\nIn Waikato, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Hamilton and Waikato districts. The Waikato Regional Council reported that over 200 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving hundreds of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Gisborne\n\nIn Gisborne, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Gisborne district. The Gisborne District Council reported that over 100 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving hundreds of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Hawke's Bay\n\nIn Hawke's Bay, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Napier and Hastings districts. The Hawke's Bay Regional Council reported that over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving hundreds of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Manawatū-Whanganui\n\nIn Manawatū-Whanganui, Gabrielle caused significant damage to homes, schools, and infrastructure, particularly in the Palmerston North and Manawatū districts. The Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council reported that over 20 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving hundreds of people without shelter. The council also reported that several major roads were closed due to flooding and landslides.\n\n###Other regions\n\nGabrielle also caused damage and disruption in other regions of New Zealand, including the Bay of Plenty, Coromandel, and the South Island. However, the damage was less severe in these regions compared to the Northland, Auckland, and Waikato regions.\n\n#Responses\n\n##New Zealand\n\nThe New Zealand government and emergency services responded quickly to the disaster, with relief efforts focusing on search and rescue, provision of food and shelter, and restoration of essential services.\n\n###Relief\n\nThe New Zealand Red Cross and other non-governmental organizations provided relief to affected communities, including food, shelter, and emotional support. The government also established a relief fund to support affected individuals and families.\n\n###Government\n\nThe New Zealand government declared a state of emergency and deployed military personnel to assist with relief efforts. The government also established a national emergency management agency to coordinate relief efforts and provide support to affected regions.\n\n###Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations, including community groups and volunteer organizations, played a significant role in responding to the disaster. Many organizations provided relief services, including food, shelter, and emotional support, to affected communities.\n\n###Inquiries\n\nThe New Zealand government established an independent inquiry to investigate the causes of the disaster and the response to it. The inquiry aimed to identify lessons learned and make recommendations for improving disaster preparedness and response in the future.\n\n###Managed retreat\n\nThe New Zealand government also announced plans for a managed retreat from high-risk areas, particularly in the Northland and Auckland regions. The plan aimed to relocate communities and infrastructure to safer areas, reducing the risk of future disasters.\n\n#Retirement\n\nCyclone Gabrielle was retired from the Australian cyclone naming list in 2023, due to the significant damage and disruption it caused in the Pacific region. The name Gabrielle will not be used again for a tropical cyclone in the Australian region.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Category 3 Australian region tropical cyclones\n* List of retired Australian cyclone names\n* 2022-23 Australian region cyclone season\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Gabrielle\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Effects\n##Melanesia\n##Norfolk Island\n##New Zealand\n###Northland\n###Auckland\n###Waikato\n###Gisborne\n###Hawke's Bay\n###Manawatū-Whanganui\n###Other regions\n#Responses\n##New Zealand\n###Relief\n###Government\n###Civil society\n###Inquiries\n###Managed retreat\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case stems from allegations of electoral fraud and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nBackground\n\n### Accusations of Electoral Fraud and Attempts to Overturn the Election\n\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, then-President Trump and his campaign made numerous claims of widespread electoral fraud and irregularities. Despite a lack of credible evidence to support these claims, Trump and his allies continued to push for the overturning of the election results. This led to a series of challenges to the election results in various state and federal courts, all of which were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n### January 6 Capitol Attack and Investigations\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The attack resulted in five deaths and numerous injuries. In the aftermath of the attack, several investigations were launched, including a House select committee investigation and a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.\n\nOriginal Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn June 8, 2023, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an indictment against Donald Trump, charging him with four felony counts related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The indictment was unsealed on June 9, 2023, and Trump was arraigned on June 13, 2023. During the arraignment, Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nSuperseding Indictment and Arraignment\n\nOn July 18, 2023, a superseding indictment was filed against Trump, adding new charges and details to the original indictment. The superseding indictment was unsealed on July 19, 2023, and Trump was re-arraigned on July 24, 2023. During the re-arraignment, Trump again pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nStatements in the Indictment\n\nThe superseding indictment contains numerous statements and allegations against Trump, including:\n\n### Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The indictment also alleges that Trump made numerous false statements and representations to state and federal officials in an effort to overturn the election results.\n\n### Count One: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States\n\nCount One of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. The indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States by attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through false and misleading statements and representations.\n\n### Further Allegations and Statements\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Trump engaged in numerous other efforts to overturn the election results, including:\n\n* Pressuring state officials to change the outcome of the election\n* Filing frivolous lawsuits to challenge the election results\n* Making false statements to the public about the integrity of the election\n\n### Count Two: Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding\n\nCount Two of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. The indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\n### Count Three: Obstruction of an Official Proceeding\n\nCount Three of the indictment charges Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1505. The indictment alleges that Trump engaged in efforts to obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\n### Count Four: Conspiracy against Rights\n\nCount Four of the indictment charges Trump with conspiracy against rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241. The indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to deprive citizens of their right to a fair and honest election.\n\nCo-Conspirators\n\nThe superseding indictment names several co-conspirators, including:\n\n* Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former personal attorney\n* John Eastman, a former Trump campaign advisor\n* Jeffrey Clark, a former Department of Justice official\n\nPretrial Proceedings\n\n### Initial Timetable\n\nThe initial timetable for the trial was set during the re-arraignment on July 24, 2023. The trial was set to begin on January 2, 2024.\n\n### Protective Orders and Security Measures\n\nThe court has issued several protective orders and security measures to ensure the safety and security of the trial. These measures include:\n\n* Limiting access to the courtroom\n* Prohibiting the use of electronic devices in the courtroom\n* Providing security for the judge, jurors, and witnesses\n\n### Other Pre-Trial Motions\n\nSeveral other pre-trial motions have been filed, including:\n\n* A motion to dismiss the indictment\n* A motion to suppress evidence\n* A motion to exclude certain witnesses\n\n### Immunity Dispute\n\nA dispute has arisen over the issue of immunity for certain witnesses. The prosecution has sought to grant immunity to several witnesses, including former Trump aides and officials. However, the defense has objected to the granting of immunity, arguing that it would be unfair to the defendant.\n\n#### Appeals\n\nThe defense has appealed the court's decision to grant immunity to several witnesses. The appeal is currently pending before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n#### Proceedings Resulting from the Immunity Decision\n\nAs a result of the immunity decision, several witnesses have been granted immunity and have testified before the grand jury.

Bagley is a retired CIA operations officer and author, best known for his work on counterintelligence and his analysis of the KGB-CIA war during the Cold War era. Bagley's career in the CIA spanned over two decades, during which he played a crucial role in uncovering several high-profile espionage cases.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nTennent Bagley was born on July 17, 1925, in Danbury, Connecticut. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed an interest in languages and international affairs from an early age. Bagley graduated from Yale University in 1948, where he studied Russian language and literature. After completing his undergraduate degree, he went on to earn a master's degree in international relations from Yale's Graduate School.\n\n#Career\n\nBagley joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1950, shortly after its creation. He began his career as a junior officer in the CIA's Clandestine Service, where he worked on various operations, including espionage and counterintelligence. Over the years, Bagley rose through the ranks, becoming a senior operations officer and eventually, a chief of station.\n\nDuring his tenure at the CIA, Bagley worked on several high-profile cases, including the Popov, Golienewski, and Nosenko cases. He also played a key role in the KITTY HAWK/Shadrin case, which involved a KGB defector who provided valuable intelligence to the CIA.\n\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nBagley's work on counterintelligence led him to develop a unique perspective on the KGB-CIA war. He believed that the KGB had infiltrated the CIA at the highest levels, and that the agency's counterintelligence efforts were compromised as a result. Bagley's analysis was based on his own experiences, as well as his study of the various espionage cases he had worked on.\n\nAccording to Bagley, the KGB's infiltration of the CIA was a deliberate and systematic effort to undermine the agency's operations. He believed that the KGB had planted moles within the CIA, who provided the Soviets with valuable intelligence and compromised the agency's counterintelligence efforts.\n\n#The Popov Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley worked on was the Popov case. Pyotr Popov was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in the 1950s. Popov provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the KGB's operations, including the identity of several KGB agents.\n\nHowever, Bagley later discovered that Popov had been a double agent, working for the KGB while pretending to work for the CIA. Bagley's analysis of the Popov case led him to believe that the KGB had infiltrated the CIA at the highest levels, and that the agency's counterintelligence efforts were compromised as a result.\n\n#The Golienewski Case\n\nAnother significant case Bagley worked on was the Golienewski case. Michal Golienewski was a Polish intelligence officer who defected to the CIA in the 1960s. Golienewski provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the KGB's operations, including the identity of several KGB agents.\n\nHowever, Bagley later discovered that Golienewski had been a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the Polish intelligence service and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence. Bagley's analysis of the Golienewski case further supported his theory that the KGB had infiltrated the CIA at the highest levels.\n\n#The Nosenko Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley worked on was the Nosenko case. Yuri Nosenko was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in the 1960s. Nosenko provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the KGB's operations, including the identity of several KGB agents.\n\nHowever, Bagley later discovered that Nosenko had been a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the CIA and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence. Bagley's analysis of the Nosenko case further supported his theory that the KGB had infiltrated the CIA at the highest levels.\n\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most significant incidents involving Nosenko was the \"Zepp\" incident. In 1964, Nosenko provided the CIA with information about a KGB agent who was operating in the United States. The agent, who was code-named \"Zepp,\" was believed to be a high-ranking KGB officer.\n\nHowever, Bagley later discovered that Nosenko had fabricated the information about Zepp, and that the agent did not exist. The incident further supported Bagley's theory that Nosenko was a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the CIA and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence.\n\n#More Nosenko\n\nBagley's analysis of the Nosenko case led him to believe that Nosenko had been a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the CIA and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence. Bagley's theory was supported by several pieces of evidence, including Nosenko's inconsistent stories and his suspicious behavior.\n\nDespite the evidence, the CIA's leadership was divided on the issue of Nosenko's loyalty. Some officials believed that Nosenko was a genuine defector, who had provided the CIA with valuable intelligence. Others believed that Nosenko was a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the CIA and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence.\n\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley worked on was the KITTY HAWK/Shadrin case. Nikolai Shadrin was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in the 1960s. Shadrin provided the CIA with valuable intelligence on the KGB's operations, including the identity of several KGB agents.\n\nHowever, Bagley later discovered that Shadrin had been a KGB agent, who had infiltrated the CIA and provided the KGB with valuable intelligence. Bagley's analysis of the Shadrin case further supported his theory that the KGB had infiltrated the CIA at the highest levels.\n\n#Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn 1978, John L. Hart, a former CIA officer, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) that the CIA had been infiltrated by the KGB. Hart's testimony was based on his own experiences, as well as his analysis of the various espionage cases he had worked on.\n\nBagley rebutted Hart's testimony, arguing that the CIA had not been infiltrated by the KGB. Bagley's rebuttal was based on his own experiences, as well as his analysis of the various espionage cases he had worked on.\n\n#Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nIn 2007, Bagley published his book, Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games. The book was a critical analysis of the CIA's counterintelligence efforts, and it included several high-profile espionage cases.\n\nThe book received mixed reviews from the intelligence community. Some officials praised Bagley's analysis, arguing that it was a valuable contribution to the field of counterintelligence. Others criticized Bagley's analysis, arguing that it was flawed and based on incomplete information.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nBagley's work has been referenced in several books and films. In 2008, the film, \"The Lives of Others,\" referenced Bagley's analysis of the KGB's infiltration of the CIA.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBagley is married and has two children. He lives in the United States and is retired from the CIA.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennent_H._Bagley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n#The Popov Case\n#The Golienewski Case\n#The Nosenko Case\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n#More Nosenko\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n#Rebuttal to John L.

The film stars Mammootty and Bindu Panicker in the lead roles. The movie follows the story of a brooding and introverted character, Luke Anthony, played by Mammootty, who is haunted by his dark past.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film revolves around Luke Anthony, a mysterious and reclusive character who lives in a remote area. He is a loner who keeps to himself, and the locals are wary of him due to his strange behavior. Luke's life takes a drastic turn when he meets a young boy, and their interactions force him to confront his troubled past. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Luke is struggling with his own demons and is trying to redeem himself.\n\nThe film's narrative is layered, and the story is revealed through a series of flashbacks and dream sequences. The title \"Rorschach\" refers to the famous psychological test that uses inkblots to reveal a person's subconscious thoughts. The film's use of this concept is a metaphor for Luke's inner turmoil and his struggle to come to terms with his past.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, with Mammootty playing the lead role of Luke Anthony. Bindu Panicker plays the role of a woman who is somehow connected to Luke's past. The supporting cast includes Jagadish, Asif Ali, and Kottayam Nazeer.\n\nMammootty's performance as Luke Anthony is a highlight of the film.

Over the centuries, the college underwent several transformations, eventually becoming a renowned institution for agricultural education and research. Although the college closed its doors in 2009, its legacy continues to be felt through various activities, research, and alumni networks.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Chantry\nWye College was founded in 1447 by John Kempe, Archbishop of York, as a chantry school. The school was established to provide education to the local population and to support the local church. During the Middle Ages, the college was a thriving institution, with a strong focus on theology and classical studies.\n\n### After abolition\nFollowing the dissolution of the monasteries in 1547, Wye College was abolished, and its assets were seized by the Crown. However, the college was later re-established as a grammar school, with a focus on classical education.\n\n### Lady Joanna Thornhill School\nIn 1647, Lady Joanna Thornhill, the wife of Sir Thomas Thornhill, a local landowner, bequeathed a significant sum of money to the college to establish a school for the education of local children. The Lady Joanna Thornhill School was established, and it continued to operate until the late 19th century.\n\n### South Eastern Agricultural College\nIn 1894, the college was re-established as the South Eastern Agricultural College, with a focus on providing education and training in agriculture. The college was designed to meet the needs of the local farming community, and it quickly gained a reputation for excellence in agricultural education.\n\n### Wye College\nIn 1948, the college was renamed Wye College, and it continued to expand its programs and facilities. During the 1950s and 1960s, the college underwent significant modernization, with the introduction of new academic programs and research initiatives.\n\n### Imperial College at Wye\nIn 2000, Wye College merged with Imperial College London, becoming Imperial College at Wye.

It took place on September 2, 2023, at the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The event was the 15th event under the Payback chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\n\n# Production\n\n## Background\n\nIn 2009, WWE introduced the Payback pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network event, which was originally held as a replacement for the No Way Out event. The event was established to be held annually in June, but in 2023, it was rescheduled for September. The event's concept revolves around wrestlers seeking revenge against their opponents, often due to past rivalries and unresolved issues.\n\n## Storylines\n\nThe event featured several storylines from both the Raw and SmackDown brands. On the Raw brand, one of the main storylines was between Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor, who had been feuding for several weeks. The two had previously clashed at the SummerSlam event, where Rollins emerged victorious. However, Bálor sought revenge and challenged Rollins to a rematch at Payback.\n\nOn the SmackDown brand, a notable storyline was between Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn. The two had been at odds for several months, with Zayn accusing Reigns of being an unfair leader of The Bloodline faction. The tension between the two eventually led to a match at Payback, where Reigns put his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship on the line.\n\n# Event\n\n## Pre-show\n\nThe Payback pre-show featured a match between the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler, against the team of Raquel Rodriguez and Aliyah.

The match saw Belair successfully defend her title, as she pinned Lynch after delivering the KOD.\n\n## Main event\n\nThe main event of Payback saw Roman Reigns defend his Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Sami Zayn. The match was highly contested, with both men delivering several near-falls. However, in the end, Reigns emerged victorious, as he pinned Zayn after delivering the spear.\n\n# Reception\n\nPayback received generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Many praised the event's match card, which featured several highly competitive and entertaining matches. The event's main event was particularly praised, with many considering it one of the best matches of the year.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Raw\n\nThe following night on Raw, Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor had a rematch from their Payback match. The match saw Rollins emerge victorious once again, as he pinned Bálor after delivering the curb stomp.\n\nThe Raw Women's Champion, Bianca Belair, also appeared on the show, as she celebrated her successful title defense at Payback. However, she was confronted by a new challenger, the returning Bayley, who expressed her interest in facing Belair for the title.\n\n## SmackDown\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Roman Reigns celebrated his successful title defense at Payback.

The monument is inscribed with a set of ten guidelines, or principles, intended to provide a moral framework for the people of the world. The Guidestones have become a popular tourist attraction and a source of fascination for many, while also sparking controversy and debate.\n\n# History\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were commissioned by a mysterious individual or group, identified only as \"R.C. Christian,\" who approached Joe Fendley, the president of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company, in June 1979 with a proposal to build the monument. Christian provided Fendley with a detailed plan and specifications for the Guidestones, including the text to be inscribed on the stones. Fendley accepted the project and assembled a team of skilled craftsmen to construct the monument. The Guidestones took several months to complete and were unveiled on March 22, 1980.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe unveiling of the Georgia Guidestones was met with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. Many local residents were unaware of the project until its completion, and some expressed concerns about the monument's cryptic message and mysterious origins. The Guidestones were initially seen as a novelty, but over time, they have become a source of fascination and speculation, attracting visitors from around the world.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were vandalized with graffiti, and a few days later, on July 10, 2022, one of the Guidestones was destroyed in a bombing. The incident sparked widespread media attention and public outcry.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Guidestone, local authorities launched an investigation into the incident. The site was cordoned off, and visitors were temporarily prohibited from accessing the area. In the aftermath of the bombing, the remaining Guidestones were removed from the site for repair and protection. The incident has sparked renewed debate about the significance and meaning of the Georgia Guidestones.\n\n# Description\n\n## Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are inscribed with a set of ten guidelines, or principles, in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese. The inscriptions are arranged on the four sides of the monument, with each side containing a different set of guidelines.\n\n## Explanatory tablet\n\nA small explanatory tablet is located near the base of the Guidestones, providing information about the monument's origins and purpose. The tablet reads: \"Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason.\"\n\n## Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are constructed from four granite slabs, each weighing approximately 20 tons. The monument stands 19 feet 3 inches tall, and its base is 7 feet 4 inches square. The Guidestones are aligned with the rising and setting of the sun on the summer and winter solstices.\n\n## Guidestone languages\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are inscribed in eight different languages, reflecting the diversity of human languages and cultures. The languages were chosen for their widespread use and influence, representing different regions and civilizations around the world.\n\n## Astronomical features\n\nThe Guidestones are designed to track the movement of the stars and planets. A hole drilled through the center of the capstone allows a beam of sunlight to illuminate the North Star (Polaris) at noon on the summer solstice. The monument is also aligned with the rising and setting of the sun on the equinoxes.\n\n# Interpretations\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, ranging from claims that they represent a blueprint for a New World Order to assertions that they are a monument to Satanism or occultism. Other theories suggest that the Guidestones are a cryptic message from an extraterrestrial civilization or a warning about an impending apocalypse. While these theories are intriguing, there is no concrete evidence to support them, and the true meaning and purpose of the Guidestones remain a topic of debate and speculation.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mysterious monuments and structures\n* New World Order conspiracy theories\n* The Rosicrucian Manifestos\n* The Pyramid of Kukulkan\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Fendley, Joe.

{"title": "Anantarika-karma", "content": "#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anantarika-karma\n\nAnantarika-karma is a Sanskrit term that originates from ancient Indian philosophy, particularly in the context of karma and reincarnation. It refers to a specific type of karma that has a direct and immediate impact on an individual's next birth or existence. In this article, we will explore the concept of Anantarika-karma, its significance, and its implications in various Eastern philosophical traditions.\n\n# Definition and Explanation\n\nAnantarika-karma is a compound term consisting of two Sanskrit words: \"anantarika\" and \"karma.\" \"Anantarika\" means \"immediately subsequent\" or \"next in succession,\" while \"karma\" refers to the universal principle of cause and effect, where every action has consequences. Together, Anantarika-karma denotes a type of karma that determines an individual's immediate afterlife or next birth.\n\nIn the context of karma and reincarnation, Anantarika-karma is considered a crucial concept. It suggests that an individual's actions in their current life have a direct bearing on their next existence. This concept is often seen as a way to explain the diversity of human experiences, where individuals are born into different circumstances, with varying degrees of privilege, suffering, or opportunities.\n\n## Types of Anantarika-karma\n\nThere are several types of Anantarika-karma, which are often classified based on their intensity and impact. Some of the most common types include:\n\n* **Garuka-karma**: This type of Anantarika-karma is considered the most severe and has a direct impact on an individual's next birth. Garuka-karma is often associated with extreme acts of violence, cruelty, or harm caused to others.\n* **Dridha-karma**: This type of Anantarika-karma is considered moderately severe and has a significant impact on an individual's next birth. Dridha-karma is often associated with intentional harm or injury caused to others.\n* **Adridha-karma**: This type of Anantarika-karma is considered mild and has a relatively minor impact on an individual's next birth. Adridha-karma is often associated with unintentional harm or injury caused to others.\n\n# Significance in Eastern Philosophical Traditions\n\nAnantarika-karma plays a significant role in various Eastern philosophical traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In these traditions, Anantarika-karma is often seen as a way to explain the concept of karma and reincarnation.\n\n## Hinduism\n\nIn Hinduism, Anantarika-karma is considered one of the three types of karma, along with Sanchita-karma and Kriyamana-karma. Anantarika-karma is seen as a way to explain the immediate consequences of an individual's actions in their next birth.\n\n## Buddhism\n\nIn Buddhism, Anantarika-karma is considered one of the five types of karma, along with Akusala-karma, Kusala-karma, Anantara-karma, and Avyakata-karma. Anantarika-karma is seen as a way to explain the immediate consequences of an individual's actions in their next birth.\n\n## Jainism\n\nIn Jainism, Anantarika-karma is considered one of the eight types of karma, along with Gyanavarana-karma, Darshanavarana-karma, Vedaniya-karma, Mohaniya-karma, Ayu-karma, Naama-karma, and Gotra-karma. Anantarika-karma is seen as a way to explain the immediate consequences of an individual's actions in their next birth.\n\n# Implications and Applications\n\nAnantarika-karma has significant implications and applications in various aspects of life, including ethics, morality, and personal growth.\n\n## Ethics and Morality\n\nAnantarika-karma suggests that an individual's actions have immediate consequences in their next birth. This concept can be used to promote ethics and morality, as individuals are more likely to act in a way that is beneficial to themselves and others.\n\n## Personal Growth\n\nAnantarika-karma can be used as a tool for personal growth and self-improvement. By understanding the concept of Anantarika-karma, individuals can take responsibility for their actions and work towards creating a better future for themselves.\n\n# Criticisms and Controversies\n\nAnantarika-karma has been subject to various criticisms and controversies, particularly in the context of karma and reincarnation.\n\n## Determinism vs. Free Will\n\nOne of the main criticisms of Anantarika-karma is that it suggests a form of determinism, where an individual's actions are predetermined by their past karma. This raises questions about the concept of free will and whether individuals have the ability to change their fate.\n\n## Social Justice\n\nAnother criticism of Anantarika-karma is that it can be used to justify social injustices, such as poverty, inequality, and suffering. If an individual's circumstances are seen as a result of their past karma, it can be argued that they deserve their fate, rather than being a victim of circumstance.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAnantarika-karma is a complex and multifaceted concept that plays a significant role in various Eastern philosophical traditions. While it has significant implications and applications, it is also subject to various criticisms and controversies. Ultimately, the concept of Anantarika-karma serves as a reminder of the importance of ethics, morality, and personal growth, and encourages individuals to take responsibility for their actions and work towards creating a better future for themselves.\n\n# See also\n\n* Karma\n* Reincarnation\n* Eastern philosophy\n* Hinduism\n* Buddhism\n* Jainism\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Concept of Anantarika-karma in Hinduism\" by K.

Landmasses can be further divided into smaller land areas, such as countries, states, and regions.\n\n## Terrain\n\nTerrain refers to the physical features of an area of land, including its shape, elevation, and relief. Terrain can be classified into different types, such as mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. The terrain of an area can be influenced by various factors, including geological processes, climate, and human activities.\n\n## Geomorphology\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the shape and features of the Earth's surface. It involves the examination of landforms, such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus, and the processes that shape them. Geomorphologists use various techniques, including field observations, remote sensing, and laboratory analysis, to understand the complex relationships between landforms and the environment.\n\n## Climate\n\nClimate plays a significant role in shaping the physical characteristics of land. Different climates can create unique landforms, such as glaciers in cold climates and sand dunes in arid climates. Climate also influences the distribution of vegetation, soil, and other natural resources.\n\n# Features\n\n## Coasts and islands\n\nCoasts are the areas where land meets the ocean or sea. They can be classified into different types, such as rocky coasts, sandy coasts, and deltaic coasts. Islands are land areas that are surrounded by water and are not connected to the mainland. Islands can be formed by various geological processes, including volcanic activity and erosion.\n\n## Mountains and plateaus\n\nMountains are natural elevations of the Earth's surface that are formed by geological processes such as folding, faulting, and volcanic activity. Plateaus are areas of high ground that are relatively flat and are often formed by erosion. Mountains and plateaus can be classified into different types, such as fold mountains, volcanic mountains, and block mountains.\n\n## Plains and valleys\n\nPlains are areas of low ground that are relatively flat and are often formed by erosion. Valleys are low areas of land that are surrounded by hills or mountains and are often formed by rivers. Plains and valleys can be classified into different types, such as alluvial plains, glacial plains, and river valleys.\n\n## Caves and craters\n\nCaves are natural openings in the ground that are formed by geological processes such as erosion and volcanic activity. Craters are depressions in the ground that are formed by volcanic activity or meteorite impacts. Caves and craters can be classified into different types, such as limestone caves, volcanic caves, and impact craters.\n\n# Layers\n\n## Land cover\n\nLand cover refers to the natural or human-induced features that cover the Earth's surface, such as vegetation, water, and urban areas. Land cover can be classified into different types, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. Land cover plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's climate and providing ecosystem services.\n\n## Soil\n\nSoil is the upper layer of the Earth's surface that is composed of mineral and organic particles. Soil is formed by the weathering of rocks and the decomposition of organic matter. Soil can be classified into different types, such as clay soils, sandy soils, and loamy soils. Soil plays a critical role in supporting plant growth and filtering water.\n\n## Continental crust\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth that makes up the continents. It is composed of a variety of rocks, including granite, basalt, and sedimentary rocks. The continental crust is thicker than the oceanic crust and is formed by a combination of geological processes, including plate tectonics and volcanic activity.\n\n# Life science\n\n## Land biomes\n\nA biome is a large area of land that is characterized by a specific type of vegetation and climate. Land biomes can be classified into different types, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. Biomes play a critical role in supporting biodiversity and regulating the Earth's climate.\n\n## Fauna and flora\n\nFauna refers to the animals that live on land, while flora refers to the plants that live on land. Fauna and flora can be classified into different types, such as mammals, birds, and insects. Fauna and flora play a significant role in regulating the Earth's ecosystems and providing ecosystem services.\n\n# Humans and land\n\n## Culture\n\nLand has played a significant role in shaping human culture and identity. Different cultures have developed unique relationships with land, including spiritual, economic, and social relationships. Land has also been a source of conflict and competition throughout human history.\n\n## Travel\n\nTravel has played a significant role in human history, with many cultures developing unique forms of transportation and exploration. Travel has allowed humans to explore new lands, establish trade routes, and exchange ideas and cultures.\n\n## Trade\n\nTrade has played a significant role in human history, with many cultures developing unique forms of trade and commerce. Trade has allowed humans to exchange goods and services, establish economic relationships, and build global connections.\n\n## Land use\n\nLand use refers to the way in which humans use land for various purposes, such as agriculture, urbanization, and conservation. Land use can have significant impacts on the environment, including deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n## Law\n\nLand law refers to the legal frameworks that govern the use and ownership of land. Land law can be complex and varies widely between countries and cultures. Land law plays a critical role in regulating land use, resolving conflicts, and protecting human rights.\n\n## Geopolitics\n\nGeopolitics refers to the study of the relationships between politics, geography, and economics. Geopolitics plays a significant role in shaping global relationships, conflicts, and cooperation. Land has been a key factor in many geopolitical conflicts throughout history.\n\n# Environmental issues\n\n## Soil degradation\n\nSoil degradation refers to the loss of soil quality and fertility due to human activities such as deforestation, overgrazing, and intensive agriculture. Soil degradation can have significant impacts on the environment, including reduced crop yields, increased erosion, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n## Pollution\n\nPollution refers to the contamination of the environment with pollutants such as chemicals, heavy metals, and plastics.

The device, initially met with skepticism, soon gained popularity and became an essential tool for personal and business communication. This article explores the history of the telephone in the United States, covering the development of the technology, its impact on society, and the evolution of the industry.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\nThe early history of the telephone in the United States is closely tied to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and its predecessors. In 1877, Bell formed the Bell Telephone Company, which later became the American Bell Telephone Company.\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nIn 1881, American Bell Telephone Company was formed, with Thomas Watson, Bell's assistant, as its first president. The company's primary goal was to commercialize the telephone and establish a network of telephone exchanges. During this period, the company faced significant challenges, including patent disputes and competition from other telephone manufacturers. Despite these challenges, American Bell continued to grow, and by the late 1880s, it had established a network of telephone exchanges across the United States.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell Telephone Company was renamed AT&T, and the company began to expand its operations. During the early 20th century, AT&T became the dominant player in the US telephone industry, and its network of telephone exchanges and long-distance lines became the backbone of the US communication infrastructure. AT&T's growth was fueled by its research and development efforts, which led to significant improvements in telephone technology.\n\n## Research priority\n\nAT&T's research and development efforts were a key factor in the company's success. In the early 20th century, AT&T established Bell Labs, a research and development facility that became one of the most prestigious research institutions in the world. Bell Labs was responsible for numerous innovations, including the development of the transistor, the first commercial computer, and the first satellite communications system.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T's marketing efforts also played a crucial role in the company's success. The company targeted specific audiences, including urban and rural communities, to promote its services.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T began installing public telephones in urban areas. These telephones, often located in phone booths or on street corners, provided people with access to telephone services, even if they did not have a phone at home. Urban public telephones became a common feature of city landscapes and played a significant role in the development of urban communication networks.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also targeted rural communities, where telephone services were often limited or non-existent. The company's rural telephone service program, launched in the 1920s, aimed to bring telephone services to rural areas. The program was successful, and by the mid-20th century, telephone services were available in many rural communities.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, the US government broke up AT&T, citing antitrust concerns. The company was divided into seven regional Bell operating companies, which were later rebranded as the Baby Bells. The breakup of AT&T marked a significant turning point in the history of the US telephone industry, leading to increased competition and innovation.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones revolutionized the US telephone industry. The first cellphone call was made in 1973, and the first commercial cellphone service was launched in 1983. Since then, cellphones have become ubiquitous, and smartphones have transformed the way people communicate and access information.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe telephone industry has employed millions of people throughout its history. From switchboard operators to technicians and engineers, the industry has relied on a diverse workforce to maintain and operate its networks.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nIn the early days of the telephone industry, switchboard operators played a crucial role in connecting calls. These operators, often women, worked in central offices, connecting calls and providing directory assistance. The work was demanding, requiring operators to work long hours and handle high volumes of calls.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry has a complex history of labor relations. In the early 20th century, women were often preferred for switchboard operator positions, as they were seen as more patient and detail-oriented. However, women were also subject to discriminatory practices, including lower wages and limited career advancement opportunities.\n\n### Strikes\n\nThroughout the 20th century, telephone workers, including switchboard operators and technicians, went on strike to protest working conditions and wages. These strikes often resulted in significant improvements in working conditions and labor relations.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, AT&T conducted a series of studies on worker productivity and motivation, known as the Hawthorne studies. These studies, conducted at the Hawthorne Works in Illinois, aimed to improve worker productivity and job satisfaction. The studies found that worker motivation and productivity were influenced by a range of factors, including working conditions, supervision, and social relationships.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry has also provided its employees with a range of benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and training programs. These benefits have contributed to the industry's reputation as a desirable employer.\n\n# Users\n\nThe telephone has had a profound impact on US society, transforming the way people communicate and interact.\n\n## Business\n\nThe telephone has been a crucial tool for businesses, enabling them to communicate with customers, suppliers, and employees. The telephone has also facilitated the growth of global trade and commerce, connecting businesses across the world.\n\n## Housewives\n\nThe telephone has also had a significant impact on the lives of housewives, providing them with a means of communication and social connection. The telephone has enabled housewives to stay in touch with family and friends, access services and information, and participate in social activities.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone has also reflected and reinforced social and cultural norms, including gender roles. In the early 20th century, the telephone was seen as a tool for women, who were expected to manage the household and care for children. Men, on the other hand, were often seen as the primary breadwinners, using the telephone for business purposes.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nThe telephone has also been used for telemarketing, which has become a significant industry in the United States. Telemarketing has provided businesses with a means of reaching customers and promoting products and services.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe telephone has also played a critical role in emergency services, including the 9-1-1 system. Introduced in the 1960s, the 9-1-1 system has provided people with a quick and easy way to access emergency services, including police, fire, and ambulance services.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone has also been used for harassing calls, which have become a significant problem in the United States. Harassing calls have been used to intimidate, threaten, and annoy people, often with serious consequences.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has also been the subject of literary fears, including concerns about surveillance and control. In works such as George Orwell's \"1984,\" the telephone has been depicted as a tool of government control and surveillance.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* Telephone exchange\n* Switchboard\n* Operator (telecommunications)\n* AT&T\n* Bell Labs\n* Cellphone\n* Smartphone\n\n# References\n\n* None cited\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Social and cultural studies\n\n* Claude S.

He is a member of the Shiv Sena party and has been a key figure in the state's politics for over two decades. Shinde has held various ministerial portfolios and has been instrumental in shaping the party's policies and decisions.\n\n#Early life\n\nEknath Shinde was born on February 9, 1964, in the village of Pare, located in the Thane district of Maharashtra. He comes from a family of farmers and was raised in a modest environment. Shinde completed his primary education in his village and later moved to Thane for higher studies. He graduated from the Yashwantrao Chavan Open University with a degree in commerce.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##Entry into politics\n\nShinde's entry into politics was influenced by his family's association with the Shiv Sena party. His father, Sambhaji Shinde, was an active member of the party and had participated in various agitations and movements led by the party's founder, Bal Thackeray. Eknath Shinde joined the party in the 1980s and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent leader in the Thane district.\n\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nShinde was first elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly in 2004 from the Thane constituency. He has since been re-elected four times, representing the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency. During his tenure, Shinde has held various ministerial portfolios, including Public Works Department, Urban Development, and Labour. He has been credited with implementing several infrastructure projects and welfare schemes in the state.\n\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n\nIn June 2022, Shinde was instrumental in orchestrating a rebellion within the Shiv Sena party, which led to the collapse of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra. He, along with several other MLAs, defected from the party and formed a new faction, which later merged with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The rebellion led to the resignation of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, and Shinde was subsequently sworn in as the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra.\n\n#Chief Minister\n\nAs Chief Minister, Shinde has focused on implementing several development projects and welfare schemes in the state. He has prioritized infrastructure development, including the expansion of roads, airports, and seaports. Shinde has also announced several initiatives aimed at promoting agriculture, industry, and tourism in the state.\n\n##Electoral performance\n\nShinde has been elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly five times, winning from the Thane and Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituencies. He has consistently maintained a strong electoral presence in the Thane district and has been instrumental in securing victories for the Shiv Sena party in the region.\n\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nFollowing the rebellion in 2022, Shinde's faction of the Shiv Sena party was recognized as the official party by the Election Commission of India. However, the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction has disputed this decision, leading to a leadership crisis within the party. Shinde has been recognized as the leader of the Shiv Sena party by the BJP and other allies, but the dispute remains unresolved.\n\n##Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's leadership of the Shiv Sena party has been questioned by several opposition leaders and critics, who have accused him of betraying the party's ideology and principles. However, Shinde has maintained that his actions were necessary to ensure the stability and growth of the party, and that he remains committed to the party's core values.\n\n#Personal life\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has three children, two sons, and a daughter. He is known to be a devout Hindu and is often seen participating in various religious ceremonies and events. Shinde is also a strong advocate for social welfare and has been involved in several charitable initiatives and programs.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nShinde has been the subject of several news articles, opinion pieces, and editorials in the Indian media. He has been portrayed as a key figure in the Maharashtra political landscape, and his actions have been closely watched and analyzed by commentators and analysts. Shinde has also been the subject of several social media memes and trolls, particularly during the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: References will be included in the final version of the article)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: External links will be included in the final version of the article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the sequel to the 2018 blockbuster KGF: Chapter 1, and stars Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Srinidhi Shetty, Raveena Tandon, and Prakash Raj in key roles.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes off from where the first chapter ended, with Rocky (Yash) having killed Garuda and taken over the Kolar Gold Fields. However, his reign is short-lived, as a new enemy emerges in the form of Adheera (Sanjay Dutt), a ruthless and cunning mercenary who seeks to avenge his brother's death. As Rocky tries to defend his kingdom, he must also contend with the government, which is determined to take control of the gold mines.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky's relationship with Reena (Srinidhi Shetty) deepens, but their love is put to the test as the stakes grow higher. The film's narrative is a complex web of power struggles, loyalty, and betrayal, with Rocky facing off against formidable foes at every turn.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Yash as Raja Krishnappa Bairya \"Rocky\"\n* Sanjay Dutt as Adheera\n* Srinidhi Shetty as Reena Desai\n* Raveena Tandon as Ramika Sen\n* Prakash Raj as Vijendra Ingalagi\n* Archana Jois as Shanthamma\n* Anant Nag as Anand Ingalagi\n* Malavika Avinash as Deepa Hegde\n* Achyuth Kumar as Guru Pandian\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for KGF: Chapter 2 was conceived during the production of the first film. Director Prashanth Neel had always envisioned KGF as a two-part story, and the success of the first chapter gave him the confidence to move forward with the sequel. The script was written over a period of several months, with Neel working closely with the cast and crew to develop the story and characters.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe cast of KGF: Chapter 2 includes several new additions, including Sanjay Dutt, who was cast as the main antagonist Adheera. Dutt's involvement in the project was a major coup for the filmmakers, and his presence helped to generate buzz around the film. Raveena Tandon was also cast in a key role, marking her return to Kannada cinema after a long absence.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for KGF: Chapter 2 began in March 2020, but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming resumed in October 2020, with the cast and crew adhering to strict safety protocols. The film was shot on location in Karnataka, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, with a team of over 100 technicians working on the production.\n\n#Music\n\nThe soundtrack for KGF: Chapter 2 was composed by Ravi Basrur, who also scored the music for the first film. The album features five tracks, including the hit single \"Toofan\", which was released in February 2022. The music received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the composer's use of folk and rock elements to create a unique sound.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for KGF: Chapter 2 was one of the most extensive and expensive in Indian cinema history.
