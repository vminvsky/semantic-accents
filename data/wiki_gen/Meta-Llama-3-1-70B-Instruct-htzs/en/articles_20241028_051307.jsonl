The work is a seminal example of American pop art, a movement that emerged in the late 1950s and 60s, characterized by its focus on popular culture, consumerism, and mass production. Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans is a landmark work that both celebrated and critiqued the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture.\n\nEarly Career\n------------\n\n### New York art scene\n\nAndy Warhol arrived in New York City in 1949, armed with a degree in pictorial design from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). He quickly established himself as a successful commercial illustrator, producing work for major magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Warhol's early work was influenced by the abstract expressionist movement, but he soon became dissatisfied with the emphasis on originality and emotional expression.\n\n### Pop art\n\nIn the late 1950s, Warhol began to explore the possibilities of pop art, a movement that celebrated the mundane and the mass-produced. He was drawn to the bright colors and graphic forms of advertising and consumer culture, and he began to experiment with techniques such as silkscreen printing and photo-realism. Warhol's pop art works, including Campbell's Soup Cans, were characterized by their use of everyday images, bold colors, and a sense of detachment and irony.\n\nPremiere\n---------\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in July 1962. The exhibition caused a stir in the art world, with some critics hailing Warhol as a genius and others dismissing him as a prankster. The work was seen as a bold and irreverent challenge to the conventions of fine art, and it helped to establish Warhol as a leading figure in the pop art movement.\n\n### Subsequent publicity\n\nThe success of Campbell's Soup Cans was fueled by a series of high-profile exhibitions and media appearances. Warhol's work was featured in major museums and galleries, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Gallery in London. He also appeared on television and in print media, charming audiences with his deadpan wit and eccentric persona. As Warhol's fame grew, so did the demand for his work, and Campbell's Soup Cans became one of the most iconic and sought-after images of the 1960s.\n\nCampbell's Soup Company\n----------------------\n\n### Can and label history\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell, a fruit merchant from Bridgeton, New Jersey. The company's early success was based on its innovative use of condensed soups, which were lighter, cheaper, and more convenient than traditional soups. Campbell's soup cans, with their distinctive red and white labels, became a ubiquitous feature of American kitchens, and the company's products were marketed as a symbol of American values such as thriftiness and practicality.\n\n### Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as a subject was a deliberate challenge to the conventions of fine art. By elevating a mundane consumer product to the status of art, Warhol was commenting on the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. At the same time, Warhol was drawn to the graphic simplicity and bold colors of the Campbell's soup cans, which he saw as a perfect example of the kind of everyday image that could be transformed into art.\n\nInspiration\n------------\n\n### Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol's work on Campbell's Soup Cans was influenced by his relationships with other artists, including Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. These artists were also experimenting with pop art and the use of everyday images in their work. Warhol's use of silkscreen printing, in particular, was influenced by his collaboration with Rauschenberg, who had been using the technique to produce bold and colorful prints.\n\nInterpretation\n--------------\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans can be interpreted in a number of ways, depending on the viewer's perspective. Some see the work as a celebration of American consumer culture, with its emphasis on convenience, practicality, and mass production. Others see it as a critique of that culture, with its emphasis on the banality and ubiquity of consumer products. Warhol's use of everyday images and his emphasis on the surface qualities of the soup cans can also be seen as a commentary on the superficiality of modern life.\n\nVariations\n------------\n\n### Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nWarhol produced two series of Campbell's Soup Cans, known as Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. The first series, produced in 1962, consisted of 32 silkscreen prints, each featuring a different variety of Campbell's soup. The second series, produced in 1963, consisted of 200 silkscreen prints, each featuring a different variety of soup. The two series differ in their color palette and composition, with the second series featuring bolder colors and more complex arrangements of the soup cans.\n\n### Colored soup cans\n\nIn addition to the original black and white series, Warhol also produced a series of colored soup cans, featuring the same varieties of soup as the original series. The colored soup cans were produced using a different silkscreen technique, which allowed Warhol to achieve a wider range of colors and textures.\n\n### Unauthorized versions\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans have been the subject of numerous unauthorized versions and parodies, including T-shirts, posters, and other consumer products. These versions often feature the same graphic simplicity and bold colors as the original work, but they lack the irony and detachment that characterize Warhol's art.\n\n### Other variations\n\nWarhol's Campbell's Soup Cans have also been reinterpreted and recontextualized in a number of other ways, including in advertising, fashion, and music. The image of the soup can has become a cultural icon, symbolizing American consumer culture and the banality of everyday life.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a landmark work of American pop art, a movement that celebrated the mundane and the mass-produced. Warhol's use of everyday images and his emphasis on the surface qualities of the soup cans can be seen as a commentary on the superficiality of modern life. The work's enduring popularity is a testament to its power and relevance, and it continues to be celebrated and reinterpreted by artists, designers, and audiences around the world.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Andy Warhol\n* Pop art\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Silkscreen printing\n* Consumer culture\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Campbell's_Soup_Cans\" following this outline:\n\n#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mission was eventually rescheduled for November 16, 2022.\n\n# Flight\n\nArtemis I launched on November 16, 2022, at 1:47 AM EST from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B.\n\n## Launch\n\nThe SLS rocket lifted off from the launch pad, carrying the Orion spacecraft on a trajectory towards the Moon. The rocket's core stage and solid rocket boosters performed as expected, providing the necessary thrust to reach orbit.\n\n## Outbound flight\n\nAfter reaching orbit, the ICPS upper stage separated from the SLS rocket's core stage and continued the journey towards the Moon. The Orion spacecraft separated from the ICPS upper stage, beginning its trans-lunar injection.\n\n## Lunar orbit\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered into a lunar flyby, passing within 4,000 miles of the Moon's surface. The spacecraft's cameras captured stunning images of the Moon's surface, while its instruments collected data on the lunar environment.\n\n## Return flight\n\nAfter completing its lunar flyby, the Orion spacecraft began its return journey to Earth. The spacecraft performed a series of engine burns to slow down and enter Earth's atmosphere.\n\n## Reentry and splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere, with its heat shield protecting it from temperatures of up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, where it was recovered by NASA's recovery team.\n\n# Payloads\n\nArtemis I carried a range of payloads, including cubesats, to test the spacecraft's systems and demonstrate new technologies.\n\n## Cubesats\n\nTen cubesats were launched on Artemis I, including the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAS), the Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map), and the Space Weather CubeSat (SWFO-L1). These cubesats will study the lunar environment, test new propulsion systems, and demonstrate advanced communication technologies.\n\n# Media outreach\n\nNASA conducted extensive media outreach for the Artemis I mission, including press conferences, social media updates, and live coverage of the launch and splashdown.\n\n# See also\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Lunar Gateway\n* Constellation program\n\n# External links\n\n* NASA's Artemis I mission page\n* NASA's Artemis program page\n* Orion spacecraft page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These clocks are the most accurate type of clock in the world, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. Atomic clocks serve as the basis for modern timekeeping and have numerous applications in science, technology, and society.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Definition of the second\n\nThe concept of an atomic clock dates back to the 1940s, when physicist Isidor Rabi proposed using the energy released by atoms to drive a clock. The first atomic clock was built in 1949 by Louis Essen and Jack Parry at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom. However, it wasn't until 1967 that the first practical atomic clock was developed, using the caesium-133 atom.\n\nThe definition of the second, the fundamental unit of time, was revised in 1967 to be based on the atomic clock. The second is now defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\n### Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of optical clocks, which use visible light to measure time, led to significant advancements in atomic clock technology. Optical clocks are more accurate than traditional atomic clocks, with some having an error of only one second over 100 million years.\n\nRecent advancements in metrology, the science of measurement, have enabled the development of even more accurate atomic clocks. For example, the use of laser-cooled atoms has improved the accuracy of atomic clocks by reducing the effects of thermal noise.\n\n### Chip-scale atomic clocks\n\nIn recent years, researchers have developed chip-scale atomic clocks, which are small enough to be integrated into portable devices. These clocks use a miniature version of the traditional atomic clock design and are powered by a battery.\n\nChip-scale atomic clocks have numerous applications, including in telecommunications, navigation, and spectroscopy. They are also being explored for use in future generations of global navigation satellite systems.\n\nMeasuring time with atomic clocks\n--------------------------------\n\n### Clock mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock consists of a few key components: a gas cell containing the active atoms, a microwave generator, a detector, and a counter. The gas cell is typically filled with a small amount of the active atom, such as caesium or rubidium.\n\nThe microwave generator produces a beam of microwave radiation, which is tuned to the resonant frequency of the active atom. The microwave radiation causes the atoms to vibrate, and the detector measures the resulting signal.\n\nThe counter is used to measure the frequency of the signal, which is proportional to the number of atoms that have been excited. The counter is typically a digital device that increments by one each time a signal is detected.\n\n### Tuning and optimization\n\nThe accuracy of an atomic clock depends on the ability to tune and optimize the clock mechanism. This involves adjusting the frequency of the microwave generator to match the resonant frequency of the active atom.\n\nThe clock is typically optimized by adjusting the temperature and pressure of the gas cell, as well as the power of the microwave generator. The goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, which is the ratio of the signal strength to the background noise.\n\nAccuracy\n--------\n\nAtomic clocks are the most accurate type of clock in the world, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. The accuracy of an atomic clock is typically measured in terms of its fractional frequency stability, which is the ratio of the clock's frequency to its uncertainty.\n\nThe fractional frequency stability of an atomic clock is typically on the order of 10^-18, which means that the clock's frequency is accurate to within one part in 10^18. This is equivalent to an error of only one second over 100 million years.\n\nComparing atomic clocks\n-----------------------\n\n### Time standards\n\nAtomic clocks serve as the basis for modern timekeeping and are used to establish time standards. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\nThe SI second is realized using a network of atomic clocks located around the world. These clocks are compared to each other using a variety of techniques, including satellite-based comparisons and fiber-optic links.\n\n### Synchronization with satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are used to synchronize the clocks on satellites, including those used for global navigation. The clocks on the satellites are synchronized with the atomic clocks on the ground using a variety of techniques, including radio signals and laser ranging.\n\nThe synchronization of clocks on satellites is critical for a variety of applications, including navigation and telecommunications. The accuracy of the clocks on the satellites determines the accuracy of the navigation signals, which are used by a wide range of applications, including GPS and aviation.\n\n### International timekeeping\n\nAtomic clocks are used to establish international time standards, which are used to coordinate clocks around the world. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is responsible for maintaining the international time standard, which is known as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nUTC is based on the SI second and is realized using a network of atomic clocks located around the world. The clocks are compared to each other using a variety of techniques, including satellite-based comparisons and fiber-optic links.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nFiber-optic links are used to compare atomic clocks located in different parts of the world. The links use optical fibers to transmit signals between the clocks, which are then compared using a variety of techniques.\n\nThe use of fiber-optic links has improved the accuracy of international timekeeping by reducing the effects of latency and noise. The links are also more secure than traditional radio signals, which are vulnerable to interference and jamming.\n\nMicrowave atomic clocks\n----------------------\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium is one of the most commonly used atoms in atomic clocks. The caesium-133 atom has a resonant frequency of 9,192,631,770 Hz, which is used to define the SI second.\n\nCaesium clocks are widely used in a variety of applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy. They are also used in scientific research, including the study of general relativity and the behavior of atomic particles.\n\n#### Block diagram\n\nA caesium clock consists of several key components: a gas cell containing the caesium-133 atoms, a microwave generator, a detector, and a counter. The gas cell is typically filled with a small amount of the caesium-133 atoms, which are excited by the microwave radiation.\n\nThe microwave generator produces a beam of microwave radiation, which is tuned to the resonant frequency of the caesium-133 atom. The detector measures the resulting signal, which is then counted using a digital counter.\n\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium is another commonly used atom in atomic clocks. The rubidium-87 atom has a resonant frequency of 6,834,682,611 Hz, which is used in a variety of applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\nRubidium clocks are widely used in a variety of applications, including telecommunications and navigation. They are also used in scientific research, including the study of general relativity and the behavior of atomic particles.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is also used in atomic clocks, although it is less commonly used than caesium or rubidium. The hydrogen-1 atom has a resonant frequency of 1,420,405,751 Hz, which is used in a variety of applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\nHydrogen clocks are widely used in a variety of applications, including telecommunications and navigation. They are also used in scientific research, including the study of general relativity and the behavior of atomic particles.\n\nOther types of atomic clocks\n-----------------------------\n\n### Quantum clocks\n\nQuantum clocks are a type of atomic clock that uses quantum mechanics to measure time. These clocks are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to measure time, including the use of entanglement and superposition. They are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\n### Nuclear clock concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept is a type of atomic clock that uses the nucleus of an atom to measure time. These clocks are still in the early stages of development, but they have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\nThe nuclear clock concept uses the nucleus of an atom to measure time, rather than the electrons. This allows for even more accurate measurements, as the nucleus is less susceptible to external influences.\n\nPotential for redefining the second\n---------------------------------\n\n### Rydberg constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that is used to define the SI second. However, recent measurements have shown that the Rydberg constant may be more accurately defined using optical clocks.\n\nThe use of optical clocks to redefine the Rydberg constant has the potential to improve the accuracy of the SI second. This could have a wide range of implications, including in fields such as timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe redefinition of the second using optical clocks would require a number of changes to the current definition. This would include changes to the way that the second is defined, as well as changes to the way that clocks are compared.\n\nThe requirements for redefining the second using optical clocks are still being developed. However, it is clear that this would require significant changes to the current definition of the second.\n\n### Secondary representations of the second\n\nSecondary representations of the second are alternative ways of defining the second. These representations are used in a variety of applications, including timekeeping and spectroscopy.\n\nThe use of secondary representations of the second has the potential to improve the accuracy of timekeeping.

She is the first person from the tribal community to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India. Murmu has had a distinguished career in politics, serving as the Governor of Jharkhand from 2015 to 2021 and being a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n# Personal life\n\nMurmu was born on June 20, 1958, in Uparbeda, a small village in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, India. She belongs to the Santhal tribe, one of the largest tribal communities in India. Her father, Biranchi Narayan Tudu, was a farmer, and her mother, Niranjan Rani Tudu, was a homemaker. Murmu's early life was marked by simplicity and hard work. She grew up in a rural area with limited access to basic amenities, but her parents valued education and encouraged her to pursue her studies.\n\nMurmu received her primary education from the local government school in Uparbeda. She later attended the Rama Devi Women's University in Bhubaneswar, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. After completing her education, Murmu worked as a clerk at the State Electricity Board in Odisha. She married Shyam Charan Murmu, a bank employee, in 1980, and the couple had two sons, Laxman Murmu and Sipun Murmu. Tragedy struck the family when Murmu's husband and two sons died in a short span of time, leaving her alone.\n\n# Early career\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was unexpected. She was working as a teacher at a government school in Odisha when she joined the BJP in 1997. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly in 2000. During her tenure as an MLA, Murmu served as the Minister of State for Transport and Commerce.

During her tenure, she worked to promote development and social welfare in the state. She focused on improving education, healthcare, and rural infrastructure in Jharkhand. Murmu also worked to empower women and promote the welfare of marginalized communities.\n\n### Pathalgadi movement\n\nIn 2018, Murmu faced a major challenge when the Pathalgadi movement gained momentum in Jharkhand. The movement, which aimed to promote tribal rights and self-governance, led to widespread protests and violence in the state. Murmu worked closely with the state government to resolve the issue, and her efforts helped to restore peace and normalcy in Jharkhand.\n\n### Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2016, Murmu sparked controversy when she signed the Jharkhand Religious Freedom Bill, which aimed to regulate conversions in the state. The bill was opposed by opposition parties and Christian groups, who argued that it would promote forced conversions. Murmu also faced criticism for signing the Jharkhand Land Acquisition Bill, which aimed to amend the existing land acquisition laws in the state. The bill was opposed by opposition parties and tribal groups, who argued that it would dispossess tribals of their land.\n\n# Presidential campaign\n\nIn 2022, Murmu was nominated as the BJP's candidate for the presidential election. Her nomination was seen as a surprise, but it was widely welcomed by the party and its allies. Murmu's campaign focused on her humble background, her commitment to social welfare, and her experience as a Governor.\n\n# Presidency (2022–present)\n\nMurmu won the presidential election on July 21, 2022, and took office as the 15th President of India on July 25, 2022. She became the first person from the tribal community to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India.

Born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis is one of the most influential and iconic figures in the history of popular music. With a career spanning over six decades, Lewis has released numerous chart-topping hits, collaborated with renowned artists, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born to Elmo and Mamie Lewis in Ferriday, Louisiana. He was the third of four children, and his family lived in a small house near the Mississippi River. Lewis's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, with his family relying on the farm for income. However, music played a vital role in the Lewis household, with his mother encouraging his love for music from an early age. Lewis began playing the piano at the age of nine and was heavily influenced by gospel music, which he sang in church choirs.\n\nLewis's father, Elmo, was a bootlegger and a heavy drinker, which led to a tumultuous home life. Lewis has often spoken about the difficulties he faced during his childhood, including witnessing his father's violent outbursts and struggling in school. Despite these challenges, Lewis found solace in music, which became his escape and passion.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### J&M Studio\n\nIn 1954, Lewis traveled to Cosimo Matassa's J&M Studio in New Orleans, where he recorded his first single, \"Crazy Arms.\" Although the song didn't gain much traction, it marked the beginning of Lewis's professional music career. Lewis continued to record at J&M Studio, releasing several more singles, including \"End of the Road\" and \"Lewis Boogie.\"\n\n### Sun Records\n\nIn 1956, Lewis signed with Sun Records, a renowned label founded by Sam Phillips. Sun Records was home to other influential artists, including Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins. Lewis's first single with Sun Records, \"Crazy Arms,\" became a moderate success, but it was his second single, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" that catapulted him to stardom. The song's success was followed by another hit, \"Great Balls of Fire,\" which solidified Lewis's position as a rock and roll icon.\n\n### Marriage Controversy\n\nIn 1957, Lewis's career was marred by controversy when he married his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The marriage was met with public outrage, and Lewis's popularity began to wane. The scandal led to Lewis being blacklisted from radio airplay, and his concert bookings dwindled. Despite the backlash, Lewis continued to tour and record music, but his career never fully recovered from the scandal.\n\n### Smash Records\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, where he released several successful singles, including \"What'd I Say\" and \"I'm on Fire.\" Lewis's time with Smash Records marked a creative resurgence, with him exploring new sounds and styles.\n\n### Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis recorded a live album at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. The album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg,\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest live albums in rock history. The album captures Lewis's raw energy and virtuosity, with him performing hits like \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.\"\n\n### Country Comeback\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lewis began to transition towards country music, releasing several successful country singles, including \"Another Place, Another Time\" and \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me).\" Lewis's country comeback was marked by a more subdued and introspective sound, with him exploring themes of love, heartache, and redemption.\n\n### Grand Ole Opry Appearance\n\nIn 1973, Lewis made a historic appearance at the Grand Ole Opry, where he performed alongside other country legends. Lewis's appearance marked a significant milestone in his career, with him being recognized as a country music icon.\n\n### The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn the 1970s, Lewis released two critically acclaimed albums, \"The Session\" and \"Southern Roots.\" Both albums marked a creative resurgence, with Lewis exploring new sounds and styles. \"The Session\" features Lewis's soulful vocals and masterful piano playing, while \"Southern Roots\" is a tribute to Lewis's southern heritage.\n\n### Later Career\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Lewis continued to tour and record music, releasing several successful albums, including \"Young Blood\" and \"Last Man Standing.\" Lewis's later career was marked by collaborations with renowned artists, including Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Jimmy Page.\n\nMusic Legacy\n--------------\n\n### Accolades\n\nLewis has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Lewis has also received numerous awards, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\n### Piano Style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by his virtuosic technique and eclectic blend of rock and roll, country, and gospel influences. Lewis's playing is marked by his use of boogie-woogie patterns, stride piano, and gospel-inspired chord progressions.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\n### Relationships and Children\n\nLewis has been married seven times, with his longest marriage being to Kerrie McCarver, whom he married in 2012. Lewis has six children, including Steve Allen Lewis, who died in 1962 at the age of three. Lewis's family life has been marked by turmoil and tragedy, with him experiencing multiple divorces and losing a child.\n\n### Religious Beliefs\n\nLewis is a devout Christian, with his faith playing a significant role in his life and music. Lewis has often spoken about the importance of his faith, with him citing it as a source of strength and inspiration.\n\n### Graceland Arrest\n\nIn 1976, Lewis was arrested at Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion, where he was found waving a pistol and threatening to kill Presley. The incident was a result of Lewis's long-standing feud with Presley, with whom he had a complicated and often tumultuous relationship.\n\n### Debt\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis filed for bankruptcy, citing debts of over $2.6 million. Lewis's financial struggles were a result of his lavish lifestyle and poor financial management.\n\n### Health and Death\n\nLewis has struggled with various health issues throughout his life, including heart problems, kidney disease, and pneumonia. In 2019, Lewis suffered a stroke, which left him hospitalized for several weeks. Despite his health struggles, Lewis remains active, with him continuing to tour and perform music.\n\nSelected Discography\n-------------------\n\n### Compositions\n\n* \"Crazy Arms\"\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\"\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\"\n* \"What'd I Say\"\n* \"I'm on Fire\"\n* \"Another Place, Another Time\"\n* \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)\"\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Sources Cited\n\n* Lewis, Jerry Lee. \"Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story.\" Da Capo Press, 2014.\n* Tosches, Nick. \"Hellfire: The Jerry Lee Lewis Story.\" Grove Press, 1982.\n* Guralnick, Peter. \"Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley.\" Little, Brown and Company, 1994.\n\nFurther Reading\n----------------\n\n* \"Jerry Lee Lewis: A Biography\" by Jimmy Guterman\n* \"The Jerry Lee Lewis Story\" by Nick Tosches\n* \"Hellfire: The Jerry Lee Lewis Story\" by Nick Tosches\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Jerry Lee Lewis official website\n* Jerry Lee Lewis on Facebook\n* Jerry Lee Lewis on Twitter\n* Jerry Lee Lewis on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jerry_Lee_Lewis\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##J&M Studio\n##Sun Records\n##Marriage controversy\n##Smash Records\n##Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n##Country comeback\n##Grand Ole Opry appearance\n##The Session and Southern Roots\n##Later career\n#Music legacy\n##Accolades\n##Piano style\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and children\n##Religious beliefs\n##Graceland arrest\n##Debt\n##Health and death\n#Selected discography\n##Compositions\n#References\n##Sources cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She initially gained attention for her explicit and provocative lyrics, as well as her claims of being a wealthy and successful artist. However, her career was marred by controversy, including allegations of coaching and manipulation by her family members.\n\n#Early and personal life\n\nLil Tay was born Claire Hope on July 29, 2007, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her early life was marked by a relatively normal upbringing, with her parents, Angela and Christopher Hope, supporting her interests in music and the arts. However, as she entered her pre-teen years, Lil Tay began to develop a fascination with hip-hop and rap music, which would eventually become the foundation of her career.\n\n#Career\n\n##Social media beginning\n\nLil Tay's rise to fame began on social media platforms such as Instagram and YouTube. She created her Instagram account in 2017, initially posting videos and photos of herself lip-syncing to popular rap songs. However, it wasn't until 2018 that she began to gain traction, posting videos of herself rapping and performing original songs. Her explicit and provocative lyrics, combined with her young age and charismatic personality, quickly made her an internet sensation.\n\n##Coaching allegations and silence\n\nAs Lil Tay's popularity grew, so did allegations of coaching and manipulation by her family members. Many critics accused her parents of writing her lyrics and manipulating her online presence to create a false narrative of wealth and success. Lil Tay's parents denied these allegations, stating that they were simply supporting their daughter's passion for music. However, the controversy surrounding her authenticity led to a significant backlash against her, with many fans and critics calling for her to be more transparent about her creative process.\n\n##Familial conflict\n\nIn 2019, Lil Tay's family life became increasingly tumultuous. Her parents, Angela and Christopher Hope, began to feud on social media, with each side accusing the other of manipulating Lil Tay for financial gain. The conflict escalated to the point where Lil Tay's parents stopped managing her career, and she was left to navigate the music industry on her own. The ordeal took a significant toll on Lil Tay's mental health, leading her to take a hiatus from social media and music.\n\n#Reception and influence\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding her career, Lil Tay's impact on the music industry cannot be denied. She helped to popularize the \" SoundCloud rap\" genre, which emphasizes DIY production and explicit lyrics. Her influence can be seen in many young rappers who have followed in her footsteps, including artists such as Lil Pump and XXXTENTACION.\n\nHowever, Lil Tay's reception has been largely negative among music critics and fans. Many have criticized her lyrics for being shallow and misogynistic, as well as her tendency to glorify wealth and materialism. Additionally, the controversy surrounding her authenticity has led many to question her legitimacy as an artist.\n\n#Death hoax\n\nIn 2020, Lil Tay was the subject of a death hoax that spread rapidly on social media. The rumor claimed that she had died in a car accident, and many of her fans and followers mourned her passing on social media. However, the rumor was quickly debunked, and Lil Tay herself confirmed that she was alive and well.\n\n#Discography\n\n##Singles\n\n* \"Money Way\" (2018)\n* \"Richest Kid\" (2018)\n* \"Gucci Gang\" (2019)\n* \" Designer\" (2020)\n\n##Promotional singles\n\n* \"Flexin\" (2018)\n* \"Ice Cream\" (2019)\n* \"Flawless\" (2020)\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lil_Tay\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and personal life\n#Career\n##Social media beginning\n##Coaching allegations and silence\n##Familial conflict\n#Reception and influence\n#Death hoax\n#Discography\n##Singles\n##Promotional singles\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life was marked by his involvement in espionage, his connections to high-ranking Nazi officials, and his post-war activities with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This article explores von Bolschwing's life, from his early days in Germany to his later years in the United States.\n\nEarly life and Nazi career\n---------------------------\n\n### Early life and business ventures\n\nOtto von Bolschwing was born on October 15, 1909, in Schönbruch, East Prussia, German Empire (now Poland). He came from a noble family and was the youngest of three children. After completing his secondary education, von Bolschwing went on to study law and economics at the University of Berlin. During his university years, he became involved with the Nazi Party and joined the SA (Sturmabteilung) in 1930.\n\nIn 1931, von Bolschwing founded his own business venture, a textile company in Berlin. However, his business failed, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1933. It was during this time that von Bolschwing began to focus on his Nazi career, joining the SS (Schutzstaffel) in 1934.\n\n### Mandatory Palestine\n\nIn 1934, von Bolschwing traveled to Mandatory Palestine, where he became involved with the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization. He worked as a spy for the Haganah, gathering intelligence on Arab movements and reporting back to the organization. Von Bolschwing's experiences in Palestine would later influence his views on the Jewish people and shape his role in the Nazi regime.\n\n### Office of Jewish Affairs\n\nUpon his return to Germany, von Bolschwing was appointed to the Office of Jewish Affairs, a department within the SS responsible for handling Jewish matters. He worked closely with Adolf Eichmann, who would later become the architect of the Holocaust. Von Bolschwing's role in the Office of Jewish Affairs was to gather intelligence on Jewish communities and organizations, both within Germany and abroad.\n\nWorld War II\n------------\n\n### Romania\n\nIn 1940, von Bolschwing was sent to Romania, where he worked as a liaison officer between the German military and the Romanian government. He played a key role in negotiating the transfer of Romanian Jews to German-controlled territories. Von Bolschwing's actions in Romania were marked by his brutality and anti-Semitism, earning him the nickname \"The Butcher of Bucharest.\"\n\n### Downfall and imprisonment\n\nAs the war turned against Germany, von Bolschwing's star began to fall. He was arrested by the Allies in 1945 and imprisoned for his role in the Nazi regime. However, von Bolschwing's connections to high-ranking Nazi officials and his knowledge of the inner workings of the Nazi regime made him a valuable asset to the Allies.\n\n### Austria\n\nAfter his imprisonment, von Bolschwing was transferred to Austria, where he worked as a liaison officer between the Austrian government and the United States military. It was during this time that von Bolschwing began to build connections with American intelligence officials, which would later aid him in his post-war espionage career.\n\nPostwar espionage\n-----------------\n\n### Gehlen Organization\n\nIn 1947, von Bolschwing joined the Gehlen Organization, a German intelligence agency founded by Reinhard Gehlen, a former Nazi general. The Gehlen Organization worked closely with the CIA, providing intelligence on Soviet activities in Eastern Europe. Von Bolschwing's role in the Gehlen Organization was to gather intelligence on Soviet spies and to coordinate operations with American intelligence officials.\n\n### Central Intelligence Agency\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing was hired by the CIA, where he worked as a contract agent. He was responsible for gathering intelligence on Soviet activities in Eastern Europe and for coordinating operations with other CIA agents. Von Bolschwing's connections to high-ranking Nazi officials and his knowledge of the inner workings of the Nazi regime made him a valuable asset to the CIA.\n\n### Cover-up\n\nHowever, von Bolschwing's past as a Nazi officer and his involvement in the Holocaust were not without controversy. In the 1960s, von Bolschwing's CIA connections were exposed, and he became the subject of a congressional investigation. The CIA was forced to admit that it had hired von Bolschwing and had covered up his past.\n\n### Emigration to the United States\n\nIn 1954, von Bolschwing emigrated to the United States, where he settled in California. He worked as a businessman and consultant, using his connections with the CIA to further his career.\n\nLife in the United States\n-------------------------\n\n### Business career\n\nVon Bolschwing's business career in the United States was marked by controversy and scandal. He was involved in several business ventures, including a textile company and a real estate firm. However, von Bolschwing's business dealings were often shrouded in secrecy, and he was accused of using his CIA connections to further his business interests.\n\n### TCI scandal\n\nIn the 1970s, von Bolschwing became embroiled in the TCI (Transcontinental Investment Corporation) scandal, a real estate scandal that involved several high-ranking government officials. Von Bolschwing was accused of using his CIA connections to secure government contracts and to further his business interests.\n\n### Later life and investigations\n\nIn his later years, von Bolschwing was the subject of several investigations, including a congressional investigation into his CIA connections and a Justice Department investigation into his business dealings. However, von Bolschwing was never prosecuted for his past as a Nazi officer or for his involvement in the Holocaust.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[Insert references]\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n[Insert external links]\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n[Insert bibliography]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Otto_von_Bolschwing\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and Nazi career\n##Early life and business ventures\n##Mandatory Palestine\n##Office of Jewish Affairs\n#World War II\n##Romania\n##Downfall and imprisonment\n##Austria\n#Postwar espionage\n##Gehlen Organization\n##Central Intelligence Agency\n##Cover-up\n##Emigration to the United States\n#Life in the United States\n##Business career\n##TCI scandal\n##Later life and investigations\n#References\n#External links\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The inquiry was initiated in September 2022, and it has been the subject of intense debate and controversy in the United States.\n\n#Background\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was sparked by allegations of misconduct related to his handling of foreign policy, particularly with regards to Ukraine. In August 2022, a whistleblower complaint was filed with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, alleging that President Biden had improperly used his authority to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate a political rival. The complaint also alleged that the President had withheld military aid to Ukraine in order to coerce the Ukrainian government into investigating the rival.\n\nThe allegations against President Biden were initially made public in September 2022, and they quickly gained widespread attention in the media. The allegations were denied by the President and his administration, but they were seen as potentially serious enough to warrant an investigation by Congress.\n\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was formally initiated on September 24, 2022, when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would be launching an investigation into the allegations against the President. The inquiry was to be led by the House Intelligence Committee, with assistance from the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe initiation of the inquiry was met with intense debate and controversy, with Republicans arguing that the inquiry was an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and Democrats arguing that it was necessary to hold the President accountable for his actions.\n\n#House committee investigations\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Adam Schiff, took the lead in investigating the allegations against President Biden. The committee conducted a series of closed-door depositions with witnesses, including officials from the State Department, the Defense Department, and the National Security Council.\n\nThe committee also conducted a series of public hearings, featuring testimony from witnesses such as Alexander Smirnov, a former National Security Council staffer. The hearings were widely covered in the media and were seen as a key part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n##Witness credibility\n\nOne of the key issues in the impeachment inquiry was the credibility of the witnesses who testified before the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans argued that many of the witnesses were biased against the President and had a personal stake in the outcome of the inquiry.\n\nOne witness who came under particular scrutiny was Alexander Smirnov, a former National Security Council staffer who had worked on Ukraine policy. Smirnov testified before the committee in November 2022, and his testimony was seen as potentially damaging to the President.\n\nSmirnov testified that he had been present at a meeting between the President and Ukrainian officials, and that the President had explicitly linked military aid to Ukraine to the Ukrainian government's willingness to investigate a political rival. Smirnov's testimony was corroborated by other witnesses, but it was disputed by the President and his administration.\n\n#Responses\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was met with a range of responses from different groups and individuals.\n\n##Republican reaction\n\nRepublicans were strongly opposed to the impeachment inquiry, arguing that it was an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Many Republicans argued that the allegations against the President were unfounded and that the inquiry was a waste of time and resources.\n\n##Democratic reaction\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, were strongly supportive of the impeachment inquiry, arguing that it was necessary to hold the President accountable for his actions. Many Democrats argued that the allegations against the President were serious and deserved to be investigated.\n\n##Reaction from academics\n\nAcademics and legal experts were also divided on the impeachment inquiry, with some arguing that it was justified and others arguing that it was not.\n\nSome academics argued that the allegations against the President were serious enough to warrant an impeachment inquiry, and that the inquiry was necessary to uphold the rule of law and protect the Constitution.\n\nOthers argued that the impeachment inquiry was an attempt to politicize the impeachment process, and that it was not justified by the evidence.\n\n#Analysis\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was a complex and multifaceted process, and it raised a range of legal and constitutional issues.\n\n##Legal standing\n\nOne of the key issues in the impeachment inquiry was the question of whether the President had committed an impeachable offense. The Constitution provides that the President can be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\" but it does not define what these terms mean.\n\nSome legal experts argued that the allegations against the President were serious enough to warrant impeachment, while others argued that they did not meet the constitutional standard for an impeachable offense.\n\n#Opinion polling\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden was also the subject of intense public interest and debate, with many Americans following the inquiry closely.\n\n##Support for inquiry\n\nOpinion polls showed that a majority of Americans supported the impeachment inquiry, with many arguing that it was necessary to hold the President accountable for his actions.\n\n##Support for impeachment\n\nHowever, opinion polls also showed that a majority of Americans did not support impeaching the President, with many arguing that the allegations against him were not serious enough to warrant removal from office.\n\n#Outcome\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden is ongoing, and it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be. The House Intelligence Committee has completed its investigation, and the next step will be for the House Judiciary Committee to consider articles of impeachment.\n\nIt is unclear whether the House will ultimately vote to impeach the President, or whether the inquiry will ultimately lead to the President's removal from office.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_inquiry_into_Joe_Biden\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initiation of the inquiry\n#House committee investigations\n#Witness credibility\n##Alexander Smirnov\n#Responses\n##Republican reaction\n##Democratic reaction\n##Reaction from academics\n#Analysis\n##Legal standing\n#Opinion polling\n##Support for inquiry\n##Support for impeachment\n#Outcome\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a series of intense tornadoes that touched down across multiple states, including Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, and the aftermath of the event.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\n## March 24–25\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains on March 24, bringing with it a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a cold front that was pushing southward from Canada, creating a volatile mix of warm and cold air that fueled the development of thunderstorms. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) had issued a moderate risk (4/5) for severe thunderstorms across parts of the Southeast, including Mississippi and Alabama. As the storms developed, they quickly became supercellular, producing large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.\n\n## March 26–27\n\nThe low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing the associated cold front into the Southeast. The SPC had issued a high risk (5/5) for severe thunderstorms across parts of Georgia and Tennessee, including the Atlanta metropolitan area. The storms that developed on March 26 and 27 were more intense than those on March 24 and 25, producing multiple long-lived tornadoes that caused significant damage and loss of life.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## March 24 Event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed on March 24, with the majority of them touching down in Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 that touched down in Winston County, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## March 25 Event\n\nA total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed on March 25, with the majority of them touching down in Alabama. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2 that touched down in Cullman County, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## March 26 Event\n\nA total of 20 tornadoes were confirmed on March 26, with the majority of them touching down in Georgia. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF4 that touched down in Meriwether County, causing catastrophic damage and killing several people.\n\n## March 27 Event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed on March 27, with the majority of them touching down in Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3 that touched down in Putnam County, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## Rolling Fork–Midnight–Silver City, Mississippi\n\nA devastating EF4 tornado touched down in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, on March 24, causing catastrophic damage and killing several people. The tornado was on the ground for over 60 miles, affecting multiple communities in Sharkey and Humphreys counties. The tornado was particularly destructive in the town of Rolling Fork, where entire city blocks were reduced to rubble.\n\n## Black Hawk–Winona, Mississippi\n\nA long-lived EF3 tornado touched down in Black Hawk, Mississippi, on March 24, causing significant damage and injuring several people. The tornado was on the ground for over 40 miles, affecting multiple communities in Carroll and Montgomery counties.\n\n## Egypt–New Wren–Amory–Smithville, Mississippi\n\nA devastating EF4 tornado touched down in Egypt, Mississippi, on March 24, causing catastrophic damage and killing several people. The tornado was on the ground for over 50 miles, affecting multiple communities in Monroe and Itawamba counties.

The tornado was on the ground for over 60 miles, affecting multiple communities in Troup and Harris counties. The tornado was particularly destructive in the town of Pine Mountain, where entire city blocks were reduced to rubble.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. The storms that developed on March 24 and 25 produced large hail that caused significant damage to vehicles and buildings. The storms that developed on March 26 and 27 produced damaging winds that caused widespread power outages and property damage. Flash flooding was also a significant concern, particularly in areas where the storms produced heavy rainfall.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak was marked by a massive response effort from emergency management officials, first responders, and volunteers. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) deployed teams to the affected areas to assess the damage and provide support to those affected.\n\n## Political Response\n\nThe governor of Mississippi declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak, mobilizing the state's National Guard to assist with response efforts. The governor of Alabama also declared a state of emergency, deploying state resources to support affected communities. The governor of Georgia declared a state of emergency, mobilizing state resources to support affected communities.\n\n## Mississippi\n\nThe state of Mississippi was particularly hard hit by the outbreak, with multiple communities affected by tornadoes.

The Moderate Party campaigned on a platform of tax cuts and increased spending on defense and law enforcement. The Sweden Democrats focused on immigration and crime, while the Centre Party and Liberals emphasized their commitment to environmental protection and social justice.\n\n### Slogans\n\n* Social Democratic Party: \"A Sweden for All\"\n* Moderate Party: \"Sweden's Future Begins Now\"\n* Sweden Democrats: \"Sweden First\"\n* Centre Party: \"For a Greener and More Equal Sweden\"\n* Left Party: \"Not for Sale\"\n* Green Party: \"The Climate Party\"\n* Liberals: \"For a Free and Open Society\"\n* Christian Democrats: \"Faith in the Future\"\n\n### Debates\n\nSeveral televised debates were held during the campaign, featuring the leaders of the eight participating parties.

He previously served as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1993 to 1994, 2001 to 2004, and 2015 to 2019. Wickremesinghe has been a member of the United National Party (UNP) since 1977 and has held various leadership positions within the party.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He comes from a prominent family of politicians and lawyers. His father, Esmond Wickremesinghe, was a lawyer and a member of the State Council of Ceylon. Wickremesinghe's maternal grandfather, D.R. Wijewardena, was a wealthy businessman and the founder of the Lake House newspaper group.\n\nWickremesinghe received his primary education at the Royal College, Colombo. He later attended the University of Ceylon, where he earned a degree in law. Wickremesinghe was called to the bar in 1972 and began his career as a lawyer.\n\n#Political career\n\nWickremesinghe entered politics in 1977, when he joined the United National Party (UNP). He quickly rose through the ranks of the party and became a key advisor to President J.R. Jayewardene.\n\n##Batalanda incident\n\nIn 1991, Wickremesinghe was involved in a controversy surrounding the Batalanda detention center, where several opposition politicians and activists were detained and allegedly tortured. Wickremesinghe, who was then the Minister of Education, was accused of having knowledge of the torture and failing to take action to stop it. The incident damaged Wickremesinghe's reputation and led to widespread criticism of the UNP government.\n\n##First premiership (1993–1994)\n\nIn 1993, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, following the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Wickremesinghe's premiership was marked by a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy and attracting foreign investment.\n\n##Opposition (1994–2001)\n\n###1999 presidential election\n\nIn 1999, Wickremesinghe ran for president but lost to Chandrika Kumaratunga of the People's Alliance.

Wickremesinghe's second premiership was marked by a series of peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which had been fighting a separatist war against the government.\n\n###Peace talks\n\nWickremesinghe's government signed a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE in 2002, which led to a period of relative peace in the country. However, the peace talks ultimately failed, and fighting resumed in 2006.\n\n##Opposition (2004–2015)\n\n###2005 presidential election\n\nIn 2005, Wickremesinghe ran for president again but lost to Mahinda Rajapaksa of the United People's Freedom Alliance. Wickremesinghe's defeat was seen as a major setback for the UNP, and he faced criticism from within the party for his leadership style.\n\n###Dissent within the UNP\n\nIn 2011, Wickremesinghe faced a leadership challenge from within the UNP, when a group of party members led by Karu Jayasuriya attempted to oust him as party leader. Wickremesinghe ultimately prevailed, but the incident damaged the party's unity.\n\n###End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2009, the civil war between the government and the LTTE came to an end, with the government emerging victorious. In 2010, Wickremesinghe ran for president again but lost to Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe's defeat was seen as a major setback for the UNP, and he faced criticism from within the party for his leadership style.\n\n##Third, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019)\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe became prime minister again, following the UNP's victory in the parliamentary elections. Wickremesinghe's third premiership was marked by a series of economic reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy and attracting foreign investment.\n\n###Foreign policy\n\nWickremesinghe's government pursued a foreign policy aimed at strengthening relations with Western countries and improving relations with India. Wickremesinghe also played a key role in Sri Lanka's accession to the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led infrastructure development project.\n\n###Government bonds controversy\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe's government was embroiled in a controversy surrounding the issuance of government bonds, which led to allegations of corruption and cronyism. The incident damaged Wickremesinghe's reputation and led to widespread criticism of the UNP government.\n\n##Opposition (2019–2022)\n\nIn 2019, Wickremesinghe's government was defeated in the presidential election, and he was succeeded as prime minister by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe became the leader of the opposition and led the UNP in parliament.\n\n##Sixth premiership (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became prime minister again, following the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe's sixth premiership was marked by a series of economic reforms aimed at addressing the country's economic crisis.\n\n#Presidency (2022–2024)\n\nIn July 2022, Wickremesinghe was elected as the President of Sri Lanka, following the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\n##Crackdown on anti-government protests\n\nWickremesinghe's government has been criticized for its crackdown on anti-government protests, which have been taking place across the country since 2022. Wickremesinghe has been accused of using excessive force to suppress the protests and of violating human rights.\n\n##Handling of economic crisis\n\nWickremesinghe's government has been criticized for its handling of the economic crisis, which has led to widespread poverty and unemployment. Wickremesinghe has been accused of failing to take adequate measures to address the crisis and of pursuing policies that have exacerbated the problem.\n\n##2023 local government elections\n\nIn 2023, Wickremesinghe's government faced a major setback in the local government elections, which were won by the opposition. The incident was seen as a major blow to Wickremesinghe's presidency and led to widespread criticism of his leadership.\n\n##2024 presidential election\n\nIn 2024, Wickremesinghe will face a presidential election, which is expected to be a major challenge for his presidency. Wickremesinghe's opponent is likely to be a candidate from the opposition, who will seek to capitalize on the government's unpopularity and the economic crisis.\n\n#Family and personal life\n\nWickremesinghe is married to Maitree Wickremesinghe, a lawyer and a former judge. The couple has one daughter, Shanika Wickremesinghe, who is a doctor.\n\n#Honours\n\nWickremesinghe has received several honors and awards for his service to the country.

{"title": "Killing_of_Jayland_Walker", "content": "#Background\n#Incident\n#Investigation\n#Body camera footage\n#Reactions\n##Family reaction to grand jury decision\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Killing of Jayland Walker\n\nThe killing of Jayland Walker occurred on June 27, 2022, in Akron, Ohio, United States. Walker, a 25-year-old African American man, was shot and killed by eight police officers from the Akron Police Department after a high-speed car chase. The incident sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform, and it remains a significant event in the ongoing national conversation about police brutality and racial justice.\n\n# Background\n\nJayland Walker was a 25-year-old man from Akron, Ohio. He grew up in the city and attended Buchtel High School. After high school, Walker worked as a DoorDash delivery driver and was an avid skateboarder. Walker's family described him as a kind and gentle person who loved his community and was committed to making a positive impact.\n\nThe Akron Police Department has a history of controversy and allegations of police brutality. In 2020, the department was sued by the family of a man who was killed by police during a traffic stop. The lawsuit alleged that the police used excessive force and that the department had a culture of racism and misconduct.\n\n# Incident\n\nOn the evening of June 27, 2022, Jayland Walker was driving his car in Akron when he was pulled over by police. According to the police, Walker was stopped for a traffic violation, but Walker's family disputes this account. The police claim that Walker attempted to flee the scene, leading to a high-speed car chase through the city.\n\nThe chase ended in a parking lot, where Walker exited his car and began to run. The police claim that Walker posed a threat to the officers, but the exact circumstances of the shooting are disputed. Eight police officers fired a total of 90 shots at Walker, striking him multiple times.\n\nWalker was pronounced dead at the scene. The police department initially released a statement claiming that Walker had been shot after a \"confrontation\" with officers, but this account has been widely disputed.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Ohio Bureau of Investigation (BBI) launched an investigation into the shooting, which is ongoing. The BBI has released few details about the investigation, but it is reported to be reviewing body camera footage and interviewing witnesses.\n\nThe Akron Police Department has also launched an internal investigation into the shooting. The department has placed the eight officers involved in the shooting on paid administrative leave.\n\n# Body camera footage\n\nBody camera footage of the shooting was released in July 2022. The footage shows the police chasing Walker's car through the city and eventually cornering him in a parking lot. The footage is grainy and difficult to make out, but it appears to show Walker exiting his car and beginning to run.\n\nThe footage does not clearly show what happened next, but it appears to show the police firing multiple shots at Walker. The footage is disturbing and has been widely criticized as an example of police brutality.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe killing of Jayland Walker sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform in Akron and across the country. Walker's family and supporters have demanded justice and accountability for the police officers involved in the shooting.\n\nThe city of Akron has implemented a number of reforms in response to the shooting, including the creation of a civilian review board to oversee the police department. The city has also increased funding for community programs aimed at reducing violence and improving police-community relations.\n\n## Family reaction to grand jury decision\n\nIn January 2023, a grand jury declined to indict the eight police officers involved in the shooting. Walker's family was outraged by the decision, which they described as a \" miscarriage of justice\".\n\nWalker's mother, Pamela Walker, stated that the family was \"heartbroken\" by the decision and vowed to continue fighting for justice.

It is situated on the west coast of Maui, approximately 22 miles northwest of Kahului, the island's largest city. Lahaina is a popular tourist destination known for its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and vibrant arts scene. The town has a population of around 12,000 people and is a significant economic hub for the island.\n\n# History\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian words \"la\" meaning \"sun\" and \"haina\" meaning \"cruel\" or \"relentless\". The name is often translated as \"relentless sun\" or \"cruel sun\". The pronunciation of the name is often anglicized as \"lah-HY-nah\", although the traditional Hawaiian pronunciation is closer to \"lah-HAH-nah\".\n\n### Ancient names\n\nIn ancient times, Lahaina was known by several names, including \"Lele\" and \"Mokuhinia\". Lele was the name of a small island located off the coast of Lahaina, which was later connected to the mainland by a canal. Mokuhinia was the name of a nearby island that was once the site of a royal palace.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was an important location for the ancient Hawaiian kingdom, and it was ruled by a series of powerful chiefs and kings. One of the earliest recorded rulers of Lahaina was King Pi'ilani, who ruled Maui in the 16th century. Pi'ilani was a wise and just ruler who established Lahaina as a major center of trade and commerce.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nThe first European to visit Lahaina was the British explorer Captain James Cook, who arrived in 1778. However, it was not until the arrival of King Kahekili II in the late 18th century that Lahaina began to establish significant trade relationships with European powers. Kahekili II was a powerful and ambitious ruler who sought to modernize and strengthen his kingdom through trade and diplomacy.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn 1810, King Kamehameha I, also known as Kamehameha the Great, conquered Maui and established Lahaina as his capital. Kamehameha I was a brilliant military strategist and statesman who unified the Hawaiian Islands under one rule. His son, Kamehameha II, succeeded him and continued to rule from Lahaina.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn 1820, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, led by Reverend Hiram Bingham. The missionaries had a significant impact on Hawaiian culture, introducing Christianity and Western values to the islands. They also established the first schools and hospitals in Lahaina.\n\n### Whaling\n\nDuring the 19th century, Lahaina became a major center for the whaling industry. Whalers from around the world came to Lahaina to provision and repair their ships, and the town became a bustling center of commerce and trade.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nIn 1825, King Kamehameha III ascended to the throne and established a constitutional monarchy in Hawaii. Kamehameha III was a wise and progressive ruler who sought to modernize and strengthen his kingdom through education, economic development, and diplomacy.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina continued to grow and develop as a major tourist destination. The town's rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty made it a popular destination for visitors from around the world.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nOn August 8, 2023, a devastating wildfire swept through Lahaina, burning thousands of acres of land and forcing the evacuation of thousands of people. The fire was sparked by a combination of strong winds and dry conditions, and it quickly spread through the town, destroying homes, businesses, and historic landmarks. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before it had caused widespread destruction and displacement.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with warm temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The average temperature in Lahaina is around 78°F (25°C), with average highs of 85°F (30°C) in the summer and average lows of 70°F (21°C) in the winter. Lahaina receives most of its rainfall during the winter months, with an average annual rainfall of around 20 inches (500 mm).\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 census, the population of Lahaina was approximately 12,000 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and other ethnic groups. The median age in Lahaina is around 40 years old, and the median household income is around $60,000.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina is known for its vibrant arts scene, with numerous galleries, museums, and performance venues. The town is home to the Lahaina Arts Society, which promotes and supports local artists and arts programs. Lahaina is also home to the Maui Theatre, which hosts a variety of performances, including concerts, plays, and musicals.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with numerous opportunities for surfing, snorkeling, and other water sports. The town is also home to the Lahaina Civic Center, which hosts a variety of sports events, including basketball, volleyball, and soccer.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in numerous films and television shows, including \"The Descendants\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", and \"Hawaii Five-0\". The town's rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty make it a popular location for film and television productions.\n\n# Gallery\n\n* Lahaina Banyan Court Park\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Maui Museum\n* Lahaina Arts Society\n* Maui Theatre\n\n# See also\n\n* Maui\n* Hawaii\n* Lahaina Historic Trail\n* Lahaina Banyan Tree\n* Lahaina Heritage Museum\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on information available up to 2023 and may not reflect subsequent events or developments.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of Lahaina, Hawaii, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive work on the subject.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website of the County of Maui\n* Official website of the Lahaina Arts Society\n* Official website of the Maui Theatre", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lahaina,_Hawaii\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Name\n###Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n###Ancient names\n##Early rulers\n##Western contact\n###Kahekili II\n###Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n###Christian missionaries\n###Whaling\n###Kamehameha III\n###20th century\n##2023 wildfire\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n#Arts and culture\n#Sports\n#Popular culture\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a complex series of severe thunderstorms that produced multiple tornadoes, including several intense and long-lived ones. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological conditions, confirmed tornadoes, non-tornadic effects, preparations, impacts, and aftermath of the outbreak.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\n## March 21\n\nOn March 21, a strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains, leading to the formation of a dry line that stretched from Texas to Kansas. As the dry line interacted with a warm front, it created a focal point for thunderstorm development. The storms rapidly intensified, producing large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. The environment was conducive to supercell formation, with strong wind shear and instability present.\n\n## March 22\n\nOn March 22, the low-pressure system moved eastward, bringing the dry line and warm front with it. The storms that developed along the dry line were even more intense than those on March 21, with multiple tornadoes reported across the southern states. The storms were fueled by a strong jet stream and a deepening trough, which provided the necessary lift and instability for sustained supercell activity.\n\n## March 23\n\nOn March 23, the low-pressure system continued to move eastward, bringing the severe weather threat to the eastern United States. Although the storms were not as intense as those on March 22, they still produced several tornadoes, particularly in the Carolinas and Georgia. The environment was still conducive to supercell formation, with strong wind shear and instability present.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\n## March 21 Event\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were reported on March 21, with the majority occurring in Texas and Oklahoma. The strongest tornado was an EF3 that occurred in Grayson County, Texas, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## March 22 Event\n\nA total of 30 tornadoes were reported on March 22, with the majority occurring in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The strongest tornado was an EF4 that occurred in Gretna, Louisiana, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\n## March 23 Event\n\nA total of 10 tornadoes were reported on March 23, with the majority occurring in the Carolinas and Georgia. The strongest tornado was an EF2 that occurred in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred in Gretna, Louisiana, where an EF4 tornado caused catastrophic damage and loss of life. The tornado touched down in Gretna at approximately 7:30 pm local time and moved northeastward through Arabi and New Orleans East, causing widespread destruction. The tornado was on the ground for approximately 10 miles and reached winds of up to 170 mph. Several people were killed, and many more were injured in the tornado.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the severe thunderstorms produced large hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall. Several reports of hail exceeding 2 inches in diameter were received, and winds gusting up to 80 mph were reported in several areas. The heavy rainfall caused flash flooding in several areas, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\n# Preparations and Impacts\n\nThe National Weather Service issued several tornado watches and warnings throughout the outbreak, providing critical warnings to those in the affected areas. Emergency management officials and first responders were on high alert, with many shelters and emergency operations centers activated. The outbreak caused significant disruptions to daily life, with several schools and businesses closed due to the severe weather.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the outbreak saw a massive response and recovery effort, with emergency management officials, first responders, and volunteers working tirelessly to provide aid to those affected. The American Red Cross and other relief organizations provided shelter, food, and emotional support to those in need. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared several counties disaster areas, providing federal funding for recovery efforts.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* Tornado alley\n* Severe thunderstorm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on preliminary data and is subject to revision as more information becomes available.\n\n# References\n\n(To be added)\n\n# External Links\n\n(To be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tornado_outbreak_of_March_21–23,_2022\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n##March 21\n##March 22\n##March 23\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n##March 21 event\n##March 22 event\n##March 23 event\n##Gretna–Arabi–New Orleans East, Louisiana\n#Non-tornadic effects\n#Preparations and impacts\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident marked a significant escalation of violence in the country's already tense political landscape.\n\n# Background\n\n## Ousting of Imran Khan\n\nImran Khan was ousted as Prime Minister of Pakistan on April 10, 2022, through a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The motion was brought by the opposition parties, led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), who accused Khan of mismanaging the economy and failing to address the country's pressing issues. The vote was seen as a culmination of a long-standing power struggle between Khan and the opposition parties, which had been accusing him of authoritarianism and attempting to undermine the country's democratic institutions.\n\n## 2022 Azadi March-II\n\nFollowing his ouster, Imran Khan announced plans to lead a massive protest march, dubbed the \"Azadi March-II\", from Lahore to Islamabad, with the aim of pressuring the government to call fresh elections. The march began on October 28, 2022, and was met with widespread support from Khan's supporters, who saw him as a champion of democracy and justice. However, the government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, responded by imposing strict security measures, including roadblocks and arrests of Khan's supporters.\n\n# Shooting\n\nOn November 3, 2022, Imran Khan was shot and injured during a rally in Wazirabad, a city in Punjab province. The incident occurred when Khan was standing on a container, addressing a crowd of supporters, when a gunman opened fire. Khan was hit in the leg and was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Several others, including Khan's supporters and security personnel, were also injured in the attack.\n\n# Suspects\n\nThe police arrested several suspects in connection with the attack, including a man who was identified as the primary suspect. The suspect, who was allegedly affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right Islamist party, was arrested after a video emerged showing him confessing to the crime. However, the TLP denied any involvement in the attack.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe attempted assassination of Imran Khan sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Pakistan. Khan's supporters took to the streets, protesting against the government and demanding justice for their leader. Opposition parties, including the PML-N and the PPP, also condemned the attack, with some leaders calling for a thorough investigation.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and ordered an immediate investigation. The government also announced a high-level inquiry into the incident, which was to be led by the Punjab government.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community also condemned the attack, with several countries and organizations expressing solidarity with Imran Khan and the people of Pakistan. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union were among the countries that condemned the attack and called for a thorough investigation.\n\nThe United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, also condemned the attack, saying that \"violence has no place in politics\" and calling for a thorough investigation.\n\n# See also\n\n* Assassination of Benazir Bhutto\n* Assassination of Salman Taseer\n* 2022 Pakistani constitutional crisis", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Attempted_assassination_of_Imran_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Ousting of Imran Khan\n##2022 Azadi March-II\n#Shooting\n#Suspects\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was located in present-day southwestern Romania and northeastern Serbia, and its brief existence had a lasting impact on the region's history and culture.\n\n# History\n\n## Austrian conquest\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was created as a result of the Austro-Ottoman War of 1716-1718, in which the Habsburg Monarchy, led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, defeated the Ottoman Empire and gained control of a significant portion of its territories in Southeastern Europe. The Treaty of Passarowitz, signed on July 21, 1718, marked the end of the war and established the border between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. The treaty also led to the creation of the Banat of Craiova, which was formed from the territories that had been under Ottoman control.\n\n## Government creation\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Banat of Craiova, the Habsburg Monarchy began to organize its administration. The province was divided into several districts, each governed by a prefect appointed by the Habsburg authorities. The capital of the province was established in the city of Craiova, which became an important center of administration, trade, and culture. The Habsburg authorities also established a council to govern the province, which was composed of local boyars and representatives of the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\n## Boyar and peasant resistance\n\nDespite the establishment of the Banat of Craiova, the local boyars and peasants were not enthusiastic about the new administration. Many of them had been loyal to the Ottoman Empire and resented the imposition of Habsburg rule. As a result, there were several rebellions and uprisings against the Habsburg authorities, which were eventually put down. The boyars and peasants also resisted the efforts of the Habsburg authorities to collect taxes and recruit soldiers for the Habsburg army.\n\n## Austrian consolidation\n\nDespite the resistance, the Habsburg authorities were able to consolidate their control over the Banat of Craiova. They established a strong military presence in the province and took steps to modernize its administration and economy. The Habsburg authorities also encouraged the settlement of colonists from other parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, which helped to establish a more stable and loyal population.\n\n## Ottoman reconquest\n\nThe Banat of Craiova was eventually reconquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1739, during the Austro-Ottoman War of 1735-1739. The war marked a significant turning point in the history of the region, as the Ottoman Empire was able to regain control of many of the territories that it had lost to the Habsburg Monarchy. The Banat of Craiova was dissolved, and its territories were reincorporated into the Ottoman Empire.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## \"Colonial\" precedent\n\nThe Banat of Craiova established an important precedent for the Habsburg Monarchy's colonial policies in Southeastern Europe. The province was seen as a model for the administration of other territories that were gained by the Habsburg Monarchy through conquest or treaty. The Banat of Craiova also served as a testing ground for the Habsburg authorities' policies towards the local population, including the boyars and peasants who had been loyal to the Ottoman Empire.\n\n## Cultural survivals\n\nDespite the brief existence of the Banat of Craiova, its legacy can still be seen in the culture and traditions of the region. The province played an important role in the development of the local boyar class, which continued to play a significant role in the region's politics and society after the Ottoman reconquest. The Banat of Craiova also helped to establish a distinct cultural identity for the region, which was shaped by the interactions between the Habsburg authorities and the local population.\n\n# Symbols\n\nThe Banat of Craiova had its own coat of arms, which featured a shield with a crown and a banner with the Habsburg eagle. The coat of arms was used by the Habsburg authorities to represent the province and its administration.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe history of the Banat of Craiova is a complex and fascinating topic that has been the subject of much research and debate. Despite its brief existence, the province played an important role in the history of Southeastern Europe and the Habsburg Monarchy. Its legacy can still be seen in the culture and traditions of the region, and its impact on the development of the local boyar class and the Habsburg colonial policies continues to be felt to this day.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banat_of_Craiova\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Austrian conquest\n##Government creation\n##Boyar and peasant resistance\n##Austrian consolidation\n##Ottoman reconquest\n#Legacy\n##\"Colonial\" precedent\n##Cultural survivals\n#Symbols\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held on November 19, 2022, to elect members of the 15th Parliament of Malaysia, the unicameral federal legislature of Malaysia. The election saw the participation of various political parties and coalitions, with the outcome determining the composition of the federal government and state assemblies.\n\n# Background\n\n## Previous Election\n\nThe 2018 Malaysian general election saw the defeat of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which had been in power since independence, by the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition led by Mahathir Mohamad. The PH government, however, was short-lived, and the coalition collapsed in February 2020 due to internal conflicts.\n\n## Significant Events\n\nSeveral significant events took place in the lead-up to the 2022 general election. The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on Malaysia's economy and politics, with the government imposing various lockdowns and restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. The pandemic also led to the resignation of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin in August 2021, who was replaced by Ismail Sabri Yaakob.\n\n## 2020–22 Political Crisis\n\nThe 2020–22 Malaysian political crisis began in February 2020 when a group of PH MPs defected to BN, leading to the collapse of the PH government. Muhyiddin Yassin, who was the PH chairman, formed a new coalition called Perikatan Nasional (PN) with the support of BN and other parties.

The scandal centers around accusations that several high-ranking officials and politicians within the EP accepted bribes from Qatar in exchange for favorable treatment and influence within the European Union (EU).\n\n#Allegations and events leading up to the arrests\n\nThe Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament began to unfold in the summer of 2022, when allegations of corruption and bribery surfaced within the EP. It was alleged that several members of the EP, including Vice-President Eva Kaili, had accepted large sums of money from Qatar in exchange for favorable treatment and influence within the EU. The allegations also implicated several other high-ranking officials and politicians, including Antonio Panzeri, a former member of the EP, and Niccolò Figà-Talamanca, a former staffer.\n\nAs the allegations gained traction, the EP launched an internal investigation into the matter. The investigation, led by the EP's ethics committee, aimed to determine the extent of the corruption and identify those involved. In the months leading up to the arrests, several EP members and staff were questioned by investigators, and evidence was gathered.\n\n#Investigation, raids and arrests\n\nOn December 9, 2022, the investigation into the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament culminated in a series of raids and arrests. Belgian police, working in conjunction with EU authorities, conducted a series of raids on the homes and offices of several EP members and staff, including Eva Kaili and Antonio Panzeri. The raids resulted in the seizure of large sums of cash, documents, and other evidence.\n\nFollowing the raids, several individuals were arrested and charged with corruption and money laundering. Those arrested included Eva Kaili, Antonio Panzeri, Niccolò Figà-Talamanca, and several others. The arrests sent shockwaves through the EP and the EU, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability within the EU's institutions.\n\n#Connections with Morocco\n\nAs the investigation into the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament continued, connections between the scandal and Morocco began to emerge. It was alleged that Morocco had also been involved in bribing EP members and staff in exchange for favorable treatment and influence within the EU. The allegations implicated several high-ranking Moroccan officials, including the country's ambassador to the EU.\n\nThe connections between the Qatar corruption scandal and Morocco added a new layer of complexity to the investigation. EU authorities were forced to expand their investigation to include Morocco, and several Moroccan officials were questioned by investigators.\n\n#Connections with Mauritania\n\nIn addition to connections with Morocco, the investigation into the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament also revealed connections with Mauritania. It was alleged that Mauritania had also been involved in bribing EP members and staff in exchange for favorable treatment and influence within the EU. The allegations implicated several high-ranking Mauritanian officials, including the country's president.\n\nThe connections between the Qatar corruption scandal and Mauritania further highlighted the extent of the corruption and the need for greater transparency and accountability within the EU's institutions.\n\n#Trial and prosecution\n\nThe trial of those arrested in connection with the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament is ongoing. The defendants face charges of corruption, money laundering, and other crimes, and could face lengthy prison sentences if convicted.\n\nThe prosecution of the defendants is being led by EU authorities, with the assistance of Belgian and other national authorities. The trial is expected to be complex and lengthy, with many witnesses and large amounts of evidence to be presented.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Political\n\nThe Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from politicians across the EU. Many have called for greater transparency and accountability within the EU's institutions, and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nThe EP itself has come under fire for its handling of the scandal, with many criticizing the institution for not doing enough to prevent corruption and for not acting quickly enough to address the allegations. The EP's leadership has promised to take action to address the scandal and to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n##Civil society\n\nCivil society organizations have also been critical of the Qatar corruption scandal at the European Parliament. Many have called for greater transparency and accountability within the EU's institutions, and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nTransparency International, a leading anti-corruption organization, has been critical of the EP's handling of the scandal and has called for greater action to be taken to address corruption within the EU's institutions.\n\n##Government of Qatar\n\nThe Government of Qatar has denied any involvement in the corruption scandal, stating that it is committed to transparency and accountability. However, many have questioned Qatar's denials, given the country's history of corruption and human rights abuses.\n\n##Defendants\n\n###Eva Kaili\n\nEva Kaili, a Greek MEP and former Vice-President of the EP, is one of the main defendants in the Qatar corruption scandal. She has denied any wrongdoing, stating that she is innocent and that the allegations against her are baseless.\n\n###Francesco Giorgi\n\nFrancesco Giorgi, an Italian MEP, is also a defendant in the Qatar corruption scandal.

The film is a standalone sequel to the 2007 film Bhool Bhulaiyaa and stars Kartik Aaryan, Kiara Advani, Tabu, and Rajpal Yadav.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of Ruhaan Randhawa (Kartik Aaryan), a charming and clever boy who falls in love with Reet Thakur (Kiara Advani) at a friend's wedding. The two decide to run away together and get married, but their plans are foiled when they are caught by Reet's father. To avoid the consequences, Ruhaan comes up with a plan to pretend to be possessed by the spirit of Manjulika, a vengeful spirit who was wronged by the Thakur family in the past.\n\nAs Ruhaan's plan works, the Thakur family believes that he is indeed possessed by Manjulika's spirit. However, things take a turn when the real Manjulika's spirit starts to haunt the family. The family seeks the help of a renowned exorcist, but Ruhaan's plan is soon exposed. The film then takes a series of twists and turns as Ruhaan and Reet try to find a way to calm down Manjulika's spirit and restore peace to the family.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Kartik Aaryan as Ruhaan Randhawa / Rooh Baba\n* Kiara Advani as Reet Thakur Randhawa\n* Tabu as Anjulika / Manjulika\n* Rajpal Yadav as Chhote Pandit\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe film was first announced in 2019, with Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani starring in the lead roles.

Gupta, who had previously worked on films like Judwaa 2 and Baaghi 3.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nBhool Bhulaiyaa 2 was initially scheduled to release on July 31, 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was later scheduled to release on November 19, 2021, but was again postponed due to the pandemic.
