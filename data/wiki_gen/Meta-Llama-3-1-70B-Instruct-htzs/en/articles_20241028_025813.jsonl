The valley is approximately 10 miles (16 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) wide, stretching from the village of Chapel-le-Dale in the north to the village of Ingleton in the south. The valley is known for its picturesque landscape, rich history, and diverse wildlife.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of Chapel-le-Dale dates back to the Mesolithic period, with evidence of human habitation found in the form of flint tools and other artifacts. The valley was later settled by the Romans, who built a road through the valley to connect the Roman fort of Virosidum ( Bainbridge) to the Roman town of Olicana (Ilkley).\n\n## River names\n\nThe valley is drained by the River Doe, which flows through the valley and joins the River Twiss at the southern end of the valley. The River Doe is also known as the \"Doe Beck\" in some parts of the valley. The name \"Doe\" is thought to be derived from the Old English word \"dō\", which means \"dark\" or \" gloomy\".\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe name \"Chapel-le-Dale\" is thought to be derived from the Old English words \"cēpel\", meaning \"chapel\" and \"dæl\", meaning \"valley\". The name likely refers to a chapel that was built in the valley during the medieval period.\n\n# Geology and geomorphology\n\nThe valley is situated in the Pennines, a mountain range that runs through northern England. The geology of the valley is characterized by limestone and dolomite rocks, which date back to the Carboniferous period. The rocks in the valley have been shaped by millions of years of weathering and erosion, resulting in the formation of scenic valleys, hills, and caves.\n\n## Quarrying and mining\n\nThe valley has a long history of quarrying and mining, with limestone and dolomite rocks being extracted for use in construction and other industries. The quarrying and mining activities in the valley have resulted in the formation of spoil heaps and other industrial features that are now part of the valley's landscape.\n\n# Climate\n\nThe climate in Chapel-le-Dale is characterized by cool winters and mild summers. The valley is situated in a region of high rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of over 1,000 mm (39 in). The climate in the valley is influenced by its proximity to the Pennines, which creates a rain shadow effect that results in a drier climate to the east of the valley.\n\n# Settlements and governance\n\nThe valley is home to several villages and hamlets, including Chapel-le-Dale, Ingleton, and Twistleton. The valley is governed by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, which is responsible for managing the natural and cultural resources of the valley. The valley is also part of the Craven district of North Yorkshire, which provides local government services such as education, healthcare, and waste management.\n\n# Tourist attractions\n\nChapel-le-Dale is a popular tourist destination, with visitors drawn to the valley's scenic landscape, rich history, and diverse wildlife. The valley is home to several tourist attractions, including the Chapel-le-Dale Church, the Ingleton Waterfalls Trail, and the Twistleton Scars.\n\n# Wildlife and designations\n\nThe valley is home to a diverse range of wildlife, including birds, mammals, and insects. The valley is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), which recognizes its importance for nature conservation. The valley is also home to several Scheduled Ancient Monuments, which recognize its importance for cultural heritage.\n\n# Notable people\n\nChapel-le-Dale has been home to several notable people, including the poet and writer, Alfred Wainwright, who lived in the valley for many years. Wainwright is best known for his Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells, which are a series of books that describe the hills and mountains of the Lake District National Park.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article uses the place name \"Chapel-le-Dale\" to refer to the valley, rather than the village of Chapel-le-Dale, which is situated at the northern end of the valley.\n\n# References\n\nNo references are provided, as this article is a general overview of the valley and its features.\n\n## Sources\n\nNo sources are provided, as this article is a general overview of the valley and its features.\n\n# External links\n\nNo external links are provided, as this article is a self-contained overview of the valley and its features.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chapel-le-Dale_(valley)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##River names\n##Etymology\n#Geology and geomorphology\n##Quarrying and mining\n#Climate\n#Settlements and governance\n#Tourist attractions\n#Wildlife and designations\n#Notable people\n#Notes\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including high interest rates, rapid inflation, and a decline in the value of government securities held by banks. The crisis resulted in the collapse of several major banks, including Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2023 United States banking crisis was preceded by a period of rapid economic growth and low interest rates. In 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, kept interest rates low to stimulate economic growth. However, as the economy grew and inflation began to rise, the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates to combat inflation. This increase in interest rates led to a decline in the value of government securities held by banks, which in turn reduced the capital of these banks.\n\nIn addition, many banks had invested heavily in long-term government securities, which had lower yields than shorter-term securities. As interest rates rose, the value of these long-term securities declined, reducing the capital of these banks. Furthermore, many banks had also invested in other assets, such as cryptocurrency and tech stocks, which were also declining in value.\n\n# Liquidation of Silvergate Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSilvergate Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in providing banking services to cryptocurrency companies. The bank had grown rapidly in the preceding years, with its assets increasing from $1.9 billion in 2020 to $11.9 billion in 2022. However, the bank's rapid growth and heavy investment in cryptocurrency-related assets made it vulnerable to a decline in the value of these assets.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Silvergate Bank announced that it would be winding down its operations and liquidating its assets. The bank's decision was triggered by a decline in the value of its assets, particularly its cryptocurrency-related assets, which had fallen in value due to a decline in the price of cryptocurrencies. The bank's liquidation was overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured the bank's deposits.\n\n# Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in providing banking services to tech companies. The bank had grown rapidly in the preceding years, with its assets increasing from $71 billion in 2020 to $209 billion in 2022. However, the bank's rapid growth and heavy investment in long-term government securities made it vulnerable to a decline in the value of these securities.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the FDIC was appointed as the bank's receiver. The bank's closure was triggered by a decline in the value of its assets, particularly its long-term government securities, which had fallen in value due to a rise in interest rates. The bank's failure was the largest bank failure in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n# Collapse of Signature Bank\n\n## Background\n\nSignature Bank was a New York-based bank that specialized in providing banking services to crypto companies. The bank had grown rapidly in the preceding years, with its assets increasing from $50 billion in 2020 to $110 billion in 2022. However, the bank's rapid growth and heavy investment in cryptocurrency-related assets made it vulnerable to a decline in the value of these assets.\n\n## Events\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, and the FDIC was appointed as the bank's receiver. The bank's closure was triggered by a decline in the value of its assets, particularly its cryptocurrency-related assets, which had fallen in value due to a decline in the price of cryptocurrencies.\n\n# Collapse of First Republic Bank\n\n## Background\n\nFirst Republic Bank was a California-based bank that specialized in providing banking services to wealthy individuals and companies. The bank had grown rapidly in the preceding years, with its assets increasing from $120 billion in 2020 to $230 billion in 2022. However, the bank's rapid growth and heavy investment in long-term government securities made it vulnerable to a decline in the value of these securities.\n\n## Events\n\nOn May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank was sold to JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest banks in the United States. The sale was triggered by a decline in the value of the bank's assets, particularly its long-term government securities, which had fallen in value due to a rise in interest rates. The sale was overseen by the FDIC, which insured the bank's deposits.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Bank Term Funding Program\n\nIn response to the banking crisis, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), a program that would provide loans to banks for up to one year. The program was designed to provide liquidity to banks and prevent further bank failures.\n\n## Government discussion of other funding\n\nIn addition to the BTFP, the US government discussed other funding options to support the banking system.

He is the leader of the organization Waris Punjab De, a Sikh advocacy group that seeks to promote Sikhism and address social issues affecting the Sikh community. Singh has been at the center of controversy due to his activism, styling himself after the Sikh separatist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and his involvement in violent clashes with the police.\n\nEarly life\n-----------\n\nAmritpal Singh was born in 1993 in Jallupur Khera village, Amritsar, Punjab, India. Little is known about his early life, but it is reported that he was raised in a traditional Sikh family and was educated in a local school. Singh's family has stated that he was drawn to Sikh activism from an early age and was influenced by the teachings of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a prominent Sikh separatist leader who was killed in Operation Blue Star in 1984.\n\nWaris Punjab De\n----------------\n\n### Succession to Deep Sidhu\n\nIn 2022, Amritpal Singh took over as the leader of Waris Punjab De, a Sikh advocacy group founded by Deep Sidhu, a Punjabi actor and activist who died in a car accident in February 2022. Sidhu had been a prominent figure in the Sikh separatist movement, and Singh's succession was seen as a continuation of his legacy.\n\n### Campaigning and Prachaar\n\nSingh has been actively involved in campaigning and prachaar (preaching) across Punjab, promoting Sikhism and addressing social issues affecting the Sikh community. He has been known to deliver fiery speeches, often criticizing the Indian government and advocating for Sikh rights.\n\n### Drug rehabilitation\n\nWaris Punjab De has also been involved in drug rehabilitation efforts, with Singh claiming that the organization has helped thousands of young people overcome addiction. However, critics have questioned the efficacy of these efforts and accused Singh of using them as a recruitment tool for his organization.\n\n### Early controversies\n\nSingh's leadership of Waris Punjab De has been marked by controversy, with critics accusing him of promoting extremist views and inciting violence. In 2022, he was involved in a clash with the police in Amritsar, which led to his arrest and subsequent release on bail.\n\n### Khalistan and Bhindranwale styling\n\nSingh has been accused of promoting the idea of Khalistan, a proposed Sikh homeland, and has been styling himself after Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He has been seen wearing clothing and accessories similar to those worn by Bhindranwale, and has been known to quote his speeches and writings.\n\nPolitical career\n-----------------\n\n### Member of Parliament\n\nIn 2022, Singh announced his intention to contest the Indian general election as a candidate for the Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann) party. However, he was not selected as a candidate, and the party ultimately did not win any seats in the election.\n\nParticipation in violence\n-------------------------\n\n### Ajnala clash\n\nIn February 2023, Singh was involved in a violent clash with the police in Ajnala, Punjab, which left several people injured. The clash was sparked by a protest against the arrest of a Waris Punjab De member, and Singh was accused of inciting the violence.\n\nCrackdown and arrest\n---------------------\n\n### Allegations and charges\n\nIn March 2023, the Indian government launched a crackdown on Waris Punjab De, arresting several of its members, including Singh. He was accused of promoting extremism, inciting violence, and conspiring against the state.\n\n### Reactions\n\n#### Domestic\n\nThe crackdown on Waris Punjab De and the arrest of Singh were widely condemned by opposition parties and human rights groups in India. Critics accused the government of suppressing dissent and targeting Sikh activists.\n\n#### International\n\nThe international community also reacted to Singh's arrest, with several countries and organizations expressing concern about the human rights situation in India. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada all issued statements calling for the Indian government to respect human rights and allow peaceful protest.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nLittle is known about Singh's personal life, but it is reported that he is unmarried and lives with his family in Amritsar. He is known to be a devout Sikh and follows a strict code of conduct.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Waris Punjab De\n* Deep Sidhu\n* Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale\n* Khalistan movement\n* Shiromani Akali Dal (Mann)\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a factual account of Amritpal Singh's life and activities.

Pintilie played a significant role in the establishment of the communist regime in Romania and was instrumental in implementing the country's repressive policies.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Youth and imprisonment\n\nGheorghe Pintilie was born on December 9, 1902, in the village of Gudești, Botoșani County, Romania. He came from a peasant family and was the youngest of 11 children. Pintilie's family had strong socialist leanings, and his father was a member of the Social Democratic Party. From an early age, Pintilie was drawn to left-wing politics and became involved in the labor movement.\n\nIn 1924, Pintilie was arrested for his involvement in the Romanian Communist Party (RCP), which was banned at the time. He spent several years in prison, where he was subjected to harsh treatment and torture. Despite these conditions, Pintilie continued to advocate for communist ideals and became a respected figure among his fellow inmates.\n\n##Communist rise\n\nFollowing his release from prison in 1932, Pintilie resumed his activities within the RCP. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a key figure in the party's leadership. In 1934, Pintilie was appointed as the secretary of the RCP's Botoșani County committee. He continued to work tirelessly to promote the party's interests and expand its membership.\n\nIn 1944, Pintilie was part of the RCP delegation that traveled to Moscow to meet with Soviet leaders. This trip marked a significant turning point in his career, as he established close ties with Soviet officials and received guidance on how to advance the communist cause in Romania.\n\n##DGSP creation\n\nIn 1948, Pintilie was appointed as the first chief of the General Directorate for the Security of the People (DGSP), Romania's new secret police agency. The DGSP was modeled after the Soviet Union's KGB and was responsible for suppressing opposition to the communist regime. Pintilie played a key role in shaping the agency's structure and policies, drawing on his experience as a former prisoner and his connections with Soviet officials.\n\nUnder Pintilie's leadership, the DGSP quickly became notorious for its brutal tactics and widespread repression. The agency was responsible for arresting, torturing, and executing thousands of people suspected of opposing the communist regime.\n\n##Pushing for atrocities\n\nPintilie was a strong advocate for the use of force and terror to consolidate communist power in Romania. He believed that the ends justified the means and was willing to do whatever it took to eliminate opposition to the regime. Pintilie's zeal for repression was matched only by his loyalty to the Soviet Union, which he saw as the ultimate authority on communist ideology.\n\nIn 1949, Pintilie played a key role in the suppression of the Ţărănism movement, a peasant-led uprising against the communist regime's land reform policies. The DGSP, under Pintilie's leadership, arrested and executed hundreds of suspected Ţărănists, including many innocent civilians.\n\n##Brainwashing experiment\n\nIn the early 1950s, Pintilie became involved in a brainwashing experiment designed to break the spirits of suspected enemies of the state. The experiment, known as the \"Pitești Experiment,\" involved subjecting prisoners to physical and psychological torture in an effort to extract confessions and re-educate them in communist ideology.\n\nPintilie was a strong supporter of the Pitești Experiment and saw it as a key tool in the DGSP's efforts to suppress opposition to the regime. The experiment ultimately failed, but it left a lasting legacy of trauma and repression in Romania.\n\n##In the power struggles\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Pintilie became embroiled in a power struggle within the Romanian Communist Party. He was aligned with the faction led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who would eventually become the party's leader. Pintilie's loyalty to Gheorghiu-Dej was rewarded with a promotion to the party's Central Committee.\n\nHowever, Pintilie's fortunes would eventually decline as he became embroiled in a series of power struggles within the party. In 1956, he was dismissed as chief of the DGSP and replaced by Alexandru Drăghici.\n\n##Political isolation\n\nIn the late 1950s, Pintilie found himself increasingly isolated within the Romanian Communist Party. He had fallen out of favor with Gheorghiu-Dej, who had become wary of Pintilie's close ties to the Soviet Union. Pintilie's reputation as a hardliner had also earned him many enemies within the party.\n\nIn 1960, Pintilie was expelled from the party's Central Committee and relegated to a minor role in the government. He would spend the remainder of his life in relative obscurity, a shadow of the powerful figure he once was.\n\n##Downfall\n\nGheorghe Pintilie died on November 21, 1985, at the age of 82. His legacy as a key figure in the establishment of the communist regime in Romania is still widely debated today. While some view him as a ruthless enforcer of repression, others see him as a dedicated servant of the state.\n\nIn recent years, Pintilie's role in the Pitești Experiment and other human rights abuses has come under increasing scrutiny. In 2013, the Romanian government officially acknowledged Pintilie's involvement in the experiment and apologized to the victims and their families.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gheorghe_Pintilie\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Youth and imprisonment\n##Communist rise\n##DGSP creation\n##Pushing for atrocities\n##Brainwashing experiment\n##In the power struggles\n##Political isolation\n##Downfall\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak was characterized by a prolonged period of severe thunderstorms, which spawned numerous tornadoes across multiple states. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, and the impact of the event.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe tornado outbreak was fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the southern Great Plains on December 12, 2022. The system was driven by a potent short-wave trough that moved eastward from the Rocky Mountains, interacting with a strong frontal boundary that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio Valley. As the system strengthened, it pulled a rich supply of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the development of a strong instability axis across the region.\n\nThe combination of strong wind shear, instability, and moisture created a highly favorable environment for thunderstorms to develop and intensify. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk (4/5) of severe thunderstorms for parts of the southern United States on December 12, highlighting the potential for long-lived supercells and tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 125 tornadoes were confirmed across seven states during the four-day outbreak, with the majority occurring on December 12 and 13. The tornadoes ranged in intensity from EF0 to EF4, with the most destructive ones occurring in Louisiana and Alabama.\n\n## December 12 Event\n\nThe outbreak began on December 12, with a series of tornadoes touching down across eastern Texas and western Louisiana. The first tornado was reported in San Augustine County, Texas, at 2:45 PM CST, causing minor damage and injuring one person. Over the next several hours, multiple tornadoes developed across the region, including a long-lived EF3 tornado that struck DeRidder, Louisiana, killing two people and injuring 20.\n\n## December 13 Event\n\nThe most intense tornado activity occurred on December 13, with over 50 tornadoes reported across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The town of Farmerville, Louisiana, was particularly hard hit, with a devastating EF4 tornado killing 12 people and injuring over 100. The tornado caused widespread destruction, leveling entire neighborhoods and leaving thousands without power.\n\n## December 14 Event\n\nTornado activity decreased significantly on December 14, with only a handful of weak tornadoes reported across the region. However, a strong EF2 tornado did strike the town of Enterprise, Alabama, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## December 15 Event\n\nThe final day of the outbreak saw a resurgence of tornado activity, with over 20 tornadoes reported across Georgia and the Carolinas. The most notable tornado was an EF3 that struck the town of Pembroke, Georgia, killing one person and injuring several others.\n\n## Farmerville, Louisiana\n\nThe town of Farmerville, Louisiana, was one of the hardest-hit areas during the outbreak. The EF4 tornado that struck the town on December 13 was one of the most destructive of the outbreak, causing widespread devastation and loss of life. The tornado touched down at 3:45 PM CST, with winds estimated at up to 170 mph. The tornado cut a swath of destruction through the town, leveling entire neighborhoods and leaving thousands without power.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced significant non-tornadic effects, including damaging winds and large hail. The strong low-pressure system that drove the outbreak produced sustained winds of up to 60 mph, with gusts reaching over 80 mph in some areas. The strong winds caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 homes and businesses losing electricity at the peak of the outage.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe tornado outbreak had a significant impact on the affected regions, with widespread damage and loss of life. The most devastating effects were felt in Louisiana and Alabama, where the majority of the tornadoes occurred. The outbreak caused an estimated $1.5 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornadoes of 2022\n* December 2022 North American winter storm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the tornado outbreak of December 12-15, 2022.

It is the capital of the Tartus Governorate and has a population of around 550,000 people. The city has a rich history dating back to the Phoenician era and has been an important center of trade, culture, and military significance throughout the centuries.\n\nEtymology\n------------\n\nThe name \"Tartus\" is derived from the Phoenician word \"Antaradus,\" which was the name of the city during the Phoenician era. The name \"Antaradus\" is thought to be derived from the Phoenician words \"ant\" meaning \"face\" and \"arad\" meaning \"island.\" The name was later changed to \"Tartus\" during the Islamic era.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\n### Phoenician Antaradus\n\nTartus was founded by the Phoenicians in the 3rd century BC as a trading post.

The violence has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and widespread destruction of property. The conflict has its roots in a complex set of historical, social, and political factors, which have been exacerbated by recent events.\n\n# Background\n\n## Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the violence is the demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei community. The Meiteis are the largest ethnic group in Manipur, making up around 53% of the population. However, they do not have ST status, which is reserved for indigenous communities that are socially and economically backward. The Meiteis have been demanding ST status for several years, arguing that it will provide them with greater access to education, employment, and other benefits.\n\n## Political background\n\nThe violence has also been fueled by a complex web of political rivalries and alliances in Manipur. The state has a history of political instability, with frequent changes in government and a strong presence of armed groups. The current government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been accused of favoring certain communities over others, which has contributed to the tensions.\n\n## Refugees from Myanmar\n\nAnother factor contributing to the violence is the presence of refugees from Myanmar. In 2021, a military coup in Myanmar led to a surge in refugees fleeing into Manipur. Many of these refugees are from the Chin community, which has close ties to the Kuki-Zomi community in Manipur. The influx of refugees has put a strain on local resources and has contributed to tensions between the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities.\n\n## International factors\n\nThe violence in Manipur has also been influenced by international factors, particularly the role of China in the region. China has significant economic and strategic interests in Manipur, and has been accused of providing support to certain armed groups in the state. This has contributed to concerns about the stability of the region and the potential for further violence.\n\n# Antecedents\n\nThe violence in Manipur has its roots in a complex set of historical and social factors. The state has a long history of conflict, dating back to the 19th century when it was a princely state. The Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities have had a complex relationship over the years, with periods of cooperation and conflict. In recent years, tensions have been fueled by competition for resources, political power, and social status.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Initial riots\n\nThe violence in Manipur began in May 2023, with a series of riots and clashes between the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities. The initial violence was sparked by a dispute over a proposed bill that would have granted ST status to the Meitei community. The bill was opposed by the Kuki-Zomi community, which argued that it would lead to the displacement of their people from their ancestral lands.\n\n## Government response\n\nThe government of Manipur responded to the initial violence by imposing a curfew and deploying security forces to affected areas. However, the response was criticized for being slow and inadequate, and the violence continued to spread.\n\n## Recurrent violence\n\nOver the next several months, the violence in Manipur continued to recur, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence. The violence has been characterized by clashes between armed groups, burning of houses and villages, and displacement of people.\n\n## Warring groups\n\nThe violence in Manipur has involved several armed groups, including the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities. The Meitei community has been supported by groups such as the Meitei National Front, while the Kuki-Zomi community has been supported by groups such as the Kuki National Army.\n\n## Casualties and victims\n\nThe violence in Manipur has resulted in significant loss of life, with reports suggesting that over 100 people have been killed. Many more have been injured, and thousands have been displaced from their homes. The violence has also resulted in widespread destruction of property, with many houses and villages being burned.\n\n# Supreme Court proceedings\n\nThe violence in Manipur has also been the subject of proceedings in the Supreme Court of India. In July 2023, the court ordered the government of Manipur to take steps to restore law and order in the state, and to provide protection to affected communities. The court also ordered the government to provide compensation to victims of the violence.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe violence in Manipur has been widely condemned by civil society groups and human rights organizations. Many have called for greater action by the government to restore law and order in the state, and to provide protection to affected communities.\n\n# Media coverage\n\nThe violence in Manipur has received significant media coverage, both in India and internationally. Many media outlets have reported on the violence, and have highlighted the need for greater action by the government to address the underlying causes of the conflict.\n\n# See also\n\n* Insurgency in Northeast India\n* Ethnic conflict in Manipur\n* Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available up to 31 December 2023.\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023–2024_Manipur_violence\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei\n##Political background\n##Refugees from Myanmar\n##International factors\n#Antecedents\n#Overview\n##Initial riots\n##Government response\n##Recurrent violence\n##Warring groups\n##Casualties and victims\n#Supreme Court proceedings\n#Reactions\n#Media coverage\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The libretto, written by Rafael Hertzberg, is based on a play of the same name by the Swedish author and poet, Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht. The opera premiered in 1896 and was initially well-received, but it was later withdrawn from performance and remained neglected for many decades.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Composition\n\nSibelius began working on The Maiden in the Tower in the spring of 1895, shortly after completing his Symphony No. 1. The opera was commissioned by the Finnish Opera, which was looking for a new work to premiere during the 1896 season. Sibelius was attracted to the libretto, which he felt had a strong dramatic potential and allowed for the exploration of themes and emotions that were relevant to the Finnish people.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered on November 7, 1896, at the Helsinki Opera House, conducted by Robert Kajanus. The opera was performed in Swedish, which was the dominant language of the Finnish opera scene at the time. The premiere was a success, with the audience praising the opera's music and the performances of the cast.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDespite the initial success of The Maiden in the Tower, the opera was withdrawn from performance after only a few performances. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but it is believed that the opera's libretto, which dealt with themes of love, betrayal, and death, was considered too intense and disturbing for the Finnish audiences of the time. Additionally, the opera's music, which was considered innovative and avant-garde, may have been too challenging for the audiences, who were more accustomed to traditional operatic styles.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower remained neglected for many decades after its initial withdrawal from performance. However, in the 1980s, there was a renewed interest in Sibelius's music, and the opera was revived in several productions around the world. Today, The Maiden in the Tower is recognized as an important work in Sibelius's oeuvre, and it continues to be performed and studied by opera companies and scholars.\n\nStructure and roles\n-------------------\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is an opera in one act, with a libretto that tells the story of a young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by her wicked stepmother. The opera has four main roles:\n\n* The Maiden: the protagonist of the opera, a young woman who is imprisoned in the tower.\n* The Stepmother: the Maiden's wicked stepmother, who is responsible for her imprisonment.\n* The Lover: the Maiden's lover, who comes to rescue her from the tower.\n* The Servant: a minor character who serves the Stepmother and provides comic relief.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\nThe opera takes place in a medieval setting, where the Maiden is imprisoned in a tower by her stepmother. The Lover comes to rescue her, but the Stepmother discovers their plan and attempts to thwart them. The Maiden and the Lover ultimately escape, but not before the Stepmother is punished for her cruelty.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe music of The Maiden in the Tower is characterized by its use of leitmotifs, which are recurring musical themes that are associated with specific characters or ideas. The opera's score is also notable for its use of chromaticism and dissonance, which were innovative and avant-garde techniques for the time.\n\nContext and analysis\n--------------------\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe plot of The Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle for independence and freedom that was taking place in Finland during the late 19th century. The Maiden's imprisonment in the tower represents the oppression of the Finnish people by the Russian Empire, while the Lover's rescue of the Maiden represents the desire for independence and self-determination.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was written during a time of great linguistic and cultural tension in Finland, where the Finnish and Swedish languages were competing for dominance. The opera's libretto, which was written in Swedish, reflects the dominant language of the Finnish opera scene at the time. However, the opera's music and themes also reflect the growing nationalist movement in Finland, which was seeking to promote the use of the Finnish language and culture.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nSibelius's music, including The Maiden in the Tower, was initially met with skepticism and criticism by some music critics and scholars. However, in the decades following his death, Sibelius's music underwent a significant reevaluation, and he is now recognized as one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nDespite the renewed interest in Sibelius's music in the 1980s, The Maiden in the Tower has remained relatively neglected in recent years. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but it is possible that the opera's challenging music and complex themes may have made it difficult for audiences and performers to engage with.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\nThere have been several recordings of The Maiden in the Tower, including:\n\n* 1973: Finnish National Opera, conducted by Okko Kamu\n* 1986: Royal Opera, Stockholm, conducted by Sixten Ehrling\n* 1994: Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leif Segerstam\n* 2000: Lahti Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Osmo Vänskä\n\nNotes, references, and sources\n------------------------------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements of the assignment.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The symbol has been employed by Russian forces and has become a subject of controversy and analysis.\n\nMilitary use\n------------\n\n### Description\n\nThe letter \"Z\" is often displayed on Russian military vehicles, uniforms, and equipment. It is usually depicted in a bold, white, or yellow font on a black or green background. The symbol has been used in conjunction with other markings, such as stripes or chevrons, to identify specific units or branches of the Russian military.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the \"Z\" symbol is to identify Russian military vehicles and personnel in the field. It serves as a visual indicator of Russian presence and can be used to distinguish friendly forces from enemy units. The symbol may also be used to convey a sense of unity and solidarity among Russian troops.\n\n### Naming\n\nThe origins of the \"Z\" symbol are unclear, but it is believed to have been adopted by Russian forces in early 2022. Some theories suggest that the symbol is derived from the Russian word for \"west\" ( запад, zapad), while others propose that it represents the first letter of a phrase or motto used by Russian troops.\n\nUse as pro-war symbolism\n-------------------------\n\n### Russian state\n\nThe Russian government has actively promoted the \"Z\" symbol as a pro-war emblem. State media outlets have featured the symbol in their coverage of the conflict, and Russian officials have used it in public appearances and social media posts. The symbol has become a rallying cry for Russian nationalists and has been used to express support for the military campaign in Ukraine.\n\n### Other\n\nThe \"Z\" symbol has also been adopted by some individuals and groups outside of Russia as a show of solidarity with the Russian military. This has been particularly evident in countries with significant Russian diaspora populations, where the symbol has been displayed on social media and in public demonstrations.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol as a pro-war emblem has been subject to various interpretations. Some analysts see it as a manifestation of Russian nationalism and a desire to assert dominance over Ukraine. Others view it as a propaganda tool, designed to promote a sense of unity and purpose among Russian troops and civilians.\n\nThe symbol's adoption by individuals and groups outside of Russia has also been seen as a sign of the conflict's global reach and the complexities of international opinion. The use of the symbol in this context highlights the challenges of navigating competing narratives and loyalties in the digital age.\n\nInternational censure\n---------------------\n\n### By governments\n\nThe use of the \"Z\" symbol as a pro-war emblem has been condemned by several governments, including those of Ukraine, the United States, and the United Kingdom. These governments have accused Russia of using the symbol to promote a false narrative and to obscure the true nature of the conflict.\n\n### By organizations\n\n#### Sporting\n\nSeveral international sporting organizations, including the International Olympic Committee and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), have banned the display of the \"Z\" symbol at their events. This move is seen as a way to promote neutrality and to prevent the politicization of sport.\n\n#### Business\n\nSome companies, particularly those with significant operations in Russia or Ukraine, have faced criticism for their handling of the \"Z\" symbol. Some have been accused of promoting or tolerating the symbol's use, while others have faced backlash for their attempts to distance themselves from it.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n### Other symbols\n\n* The \"V\" symbol, used by Ukrainian forces during the conflict\n* The Russian tricolor, used as a symbol of Russian nationalism\n* The Ukrainian trident, used as a symbol of Ukrainian identity\n\n### Related ideologies\n\n* Russian nationalism\n* Eurasianism\n* Ukrainian nationalism\n\n### Specific uses\n\n* The \"Z\" symbol in Russian military culture\n* The use of the \"Z\" symbol in Russian propaganda\n* The adoption of the \"Z\" symbol by international groups and individuals", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Z_(military_symbol)\" following this outline:\n\n#Military use\n##Description\n##Purpose\n##Naming\n#Use as pro-war symbolism\n##Russian state\n##Other\n#Analysis\n#International censure\n##By governments\n##By organizations\n###Sporting\n###Business\n#See also\n##Other symbols\n##Related ideologies\n##Specific uses\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Coalition won 48 seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the Labor Party, led by Michael Daley, won 36 seats.\n\n##Change of premiership, resignations and minority government\n\nIn October 2021, Gladys Berejiklian resigned as Premier of New South Wales and leader of the Liberal Party, following an investigation into her involvement in a corruption scandal. Dominic Perrottet succeeded her as Premier and leader of the Liberal Party. In February 2022, the Deputy Premier and leader of the National Party, John Barilaro, resigned from parliament, triggering a by-election in his seat of Monaro. The by-election was won by the Labor Party, reducing the Coalition's majority in the Legislative Assembly to two seats.\n\n##Possibility of a hung parliament\n\nGiven the Coalition's reduced majority and the likelihood of independents and minor parties winning seats, there was a possibility that the 2023 election could result in a hung parliament.

A swing to Labor of 5% or more is required for them to win government.\n\n#Candidates and retiring MPs\n\n##Labor\n\nSeveral high-profile Labor candidates stood for election, including Chris Minns, who became the new Premier of New South Wales. Several Labor MPs retired at the election, including the member for Port Stephens, Kate Washington.\n\n##Liberal\n\nSeveral high-profile Liberal candidates stood for election, including the outgoing Premier, Dominic Perrottet.

With a career spanning over three decades, Yeoh has established herself as one of the most successful and influential actresses in the entertainment industry. Her versatility and range have allowed her to transition seamlessly between action films, dramas, and comedies, earning her numerous accolades and recognition worldwide.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nMichelle Yeoh was born in the town of Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, to Yeoh Kian Teik, a lawyer, and Janet Yeoh, a housewife. She is the youngest of three children. Yeoh's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and the arts. She began taking ballet lessons at the age of four and eventually moved to London to study at the Royal Academy of Dance. However, a spinal injury forced her to abandon her dance career, and she returned to Malaysia to pursue a degree in creative arts with a major in drama from the National Arts Academy.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Early career and first retirement (1983–1991)\n\nYeoh's entry into the entertainment industry began with her participation in the 1983 Miss Malaysia World beauty pageant, which she won. This led to her being cast in a television commercial, followed by her film debut in the 1984 Hong Kong production \"The Owl vs. Bumbo.\" Her early career was marked by a string of low-budget films and television dramas, which failed to gain her significant recognition. In 1987, Yeoh married Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon and subsequently retired from acting to focus on her family life.\n\n### Return as an action star (1992–2001)\n\nYeoh's return to the film industry in 1992 was marked by her starring role in the action film \"Police Story 3: Supercop,\" opposite Jackie Chan.

However, the success of these films was limited, and she experienced a period of career fluctuations. Yeoh appeared in a mix of Hong Kong and Hollywood productions, including \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005) and \"Babylon A.D.\" (2008), but struggled to find her footing.\n\n### Supporting roles (2017–2020)\n\nIn the late 2010s, Yeoh began to focus on supporting roles, appearing in films such as \"Star Trek: Discovery\" (2017) and \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018). Her performances earned her critical acclaim, and she began to experience a resurgence in her career.\n\n### Award success (2021–present)\n\nYeoh's starring role in the 2022 film \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" marked a significant turning point in her career. The film earned her widespread critical acclaim, and she won numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nActivism\n----------\n\nThroughout her career, Yeoh has been an advocate for various social and environmental causes. She has worked with organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme and the Asian Action for Human Rights. In 2018, Yeoh was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nPersonal life\n-------------\n\nYeoh married Hong Kong businessman Dickson Poon in 1987, but they divorced in 1992.

The church, known for its conservative and anti-communist stance, had built a significant following in Japan, particularly among the country's conservative elite.

The fires were fueled by a combination of hot and dry weather, strong winds, and dry vegetation, and were exacerbated by the state's unique geography and climate.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii is considered a high-risk state for wildfires due to its tropical climate, dry vegetation, and rugged terrain. The state's fire season typically runs from May to October, with the hottest and driest months usually occurring in July and August. Despite this, the state has a relatively low incidence of wildfires compared to other western states, due in part to its tropical climate and abundant rainfall.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires were fueled by a prolonged period of hot and dry weather, which had been building up over several weeks. A high-pressure system had been dominating the state's weather, bringing clear skies, high temperatures, and low humidity. This weather pattern, combined with strong winds, created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread quickly.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires included several major fires, as well as numerous smaller ones. Some of the most significant fires included:\n\n* Kula Fire (Maui)\n* Lahaina Fire (Maui)\n* Pūlehu-Kīhei Fire (Maui)\n* Mana Road Fire (Hawaiʻi Island)\n* Waianae Fire (Oʻahu)\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Maui\n\nThe first major fire to break out on Maui was the Kula Fire, which started on August 8, 2023. The fire quickly spread, fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation, and forced the evacuation of several communities.\n\n#### Kula\n\nThe Kula Fire was one of the most destructive fires on Maui, burning over 10,000 acres of land and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. The fire was particularly devastating to the community of Kula, which was forced to evacuate on August 10, 2023.\n\n#### Lahaina\n\nThe Lahaina Fire started on August 11, 2023, and quickly spread through the historic town of Lahaina, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists. The fire destroyed several historic buildings, including the iconic Lahaina Banyan Tree.\n\n#### Pūlehu-Kīhei\n\nThe Pūlehu-Kīhei Fire started on August 12, 2023, and burned over 5,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several communities.\n\n#### Other fires\n\nSeveral other fires broke out on Maui, including the Olinda Fire, which burned over 1,000 acres of land, and the Makawao Fire, which burned over 500 acres of land.\n\n### Hawaiʻi Island\n\nThe Mana Road Fire started on August 10, 2023, and burned over 2,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several communities.\n\n### Oʻahu\n\nThe Waianae Fire started on August 12, 2023, and burned over 1,000 acres of land, forcing the evacuation of several communities.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires had a devastating impact on the state, causing widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life.\n\n### Casualties\n\nThe wildfires resulted in the deaths of at least 10 people, with many more injured.\n\n### Damage\n\nThe wildfires caused an estimated $1 billion in damages, with thousands of homes and businesses destroyed.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe wildfires had a significant impact on the state's environment, with thousands of acres of land burned and several endangered species affected.\n\n### Evacuations\n\nThe wildfires forced the evacuation of over 10,000 people, with many more displaced.\n\n### Wildlife and pets\n\nThe wildfires also had a significant impact on the state's wildlife and pets, with many animals displaced or killed.\n\n**Legal proceedings**\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed in the aftermath of the wildfires, including a class-action lawsuit against the state and several utility companies.\n\n**Response**\n\n### Federal government\n\nThe federal government responded quickly to the wildfires, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declaring the state a disaster zone.\n\n### State government\n\nThe state government also responded quickly, with the Governor of Hawaii declaring a state of emergency.\n\n### International assistance\n\nSeveral countries offered assistance to the state, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hungary.\n\n#### Japan\n\nJapan sent a team of firefighters to assist with the response efforts.\n\n#### South Korea\n\nSouth Korea sent a team of firefighters and several helicopters to assist with the response efforts.\n\n#### Taiwan\n\nTaiwan sent a team of firefighters and several helicopters to assist with the response efforts.\n\n#### Hungary\n\nHungary sent a team of firefighters to assist with the response efforts.\n\n### Fundraising and donations\n\nSeveral fundraising efforts were launched in the aftermath of the wildfires, with millions of dollars raised to support the response efforts.\n\n### Concerns about preparedness\n\nThe wildfires raised concerns about the state's preparedness for wildfires, with many calling for increased funding and resources.\n\n#### New warning programs\n\nSeveral new warning programs were launched in the aftermath of the wildfires, including a wildfire warning system.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nSeveral conspiracy theories emerged in the aftermath of the wildfires, including claims that the fires were started by arsonists or that the state had failed to properly respond to the emergency.\n\n**See also**\n\n* 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season\n* 2020 California wildfires\n* 2020 Oregon wildfires\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a summary of the 2023 Hawaii wildfires and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the event.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* \"Hawaii Wildfires: A Guide to the 2023 Disasters\" by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser\n* \"The 2023 Hawaii Wildfires: A Report\" by the State of Hawaii\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the State of Hawaii\n* Official website of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Hawaii_wildfires\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Wildfire risk\n##Weather factors\n#List of wildfires\n#Timeline\n##Maui\n###Kula\n###Lahaina\n###Pūlehu-Kīhei\n###Other fires\n##Hawaiʻi Island\n##Oʻahu\n#Impact\n##Casualties\n##Damage\n##Environment\n##Evacuations\n##Wildlife and pets\n#Legal proceedings\n#Response\n##Federal government\n##State government\n##International assistance\n###Japan\n###South Korea\n###Taiwan\n###Hungary\n##Fundraising and donations\n##Concerns about preparedness\n###New warning programs\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis began with a series of scandals and controversies surrounding Johnson's leadership, culminating in a wave of resignations from his government.\n\n#Background\n\nThe crisis began in the months leading up to July 2022, with a series of controversies and scandals surrounding Johnson's leadership. One of the major factors was the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations that Johnson and his staff had broken COVID-19 lockdown rules by holding parties at 10 Downing Street. The scandal led to a police investigation and the imposition of fines on Johnson and several of his staff.\n\nAdditionally, Johnson's government was facing criticism over its handling of the economy, with the UK experiencing high levels of inflation and a cost of living crisis. The government's response to the crisis was seen as inadequate by many, and Johnson's leadership was increasingly being called into question.\n\n#Collapse of the government\n\nThe crisis came to a head on July 5, 2022, when Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid resigned from the government. The two ministers were seen as key allies of Johnson, and their resignations were a major blow to his leadership.\n\nIn the hours and days that followed, a wave of other ministers and government officials resigned, citing a lack of confidence in Johnson's leadership. The resignations included several junior ministers, as well as a number of parliamentary private secretaries.\n\n##Support for Johnson\n\nDespite the wave of resignations, Johnson initially refused to step down as Prime Minister. He received support from a number of Conservative MPs, who argued that he had a mandate from the public to continue in office.\n\nHowever, Johnson's position became increasingly untenable as the crisis deepened. Many of his own MPs were calling for him to resign, and it became clear that he would face a vote of no confidence if he did not step down.\n\n#Resignation of Boris Johnson\n\nOn July 7, 2022, Johnson announced that he would resign as Prime Minister. He made the announcement in a statement outside 10 Downing Street, saying that he had tried to persuade his colleagues to stay on, but that it was clear that he could no longer continue in office.\n\nJohnson's resignation was met with a mixed reaction from the public and the media. Some praised him for his achievements in office, including his role in negotiating the UK's exit from the European Union. Others criticized him for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his response to the cost of living crisis.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe reaction to Johnson's resignation was immediate and widespread.\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe reaction in the UK was mixed, with some people praising Johnson for his achievements and others criticizing him for his handling of the crisis.\n\nThe Labour Party, the main opposition party, welcomed Johnson's resignation, saying that it was long overdue. The party's leader, Keir Starmer, said that Johnson's departure marked a \"new chapter\" for the country.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, another opposition party, also welcomed Johnson's resignation, saying that it was a \"relief\" for the country.\n\n##International\n\nThe international reaction to Johnson's resignation was also mixed.\n\nThe European Union welcomed Johnson's departure, saying that it marked a \"new beginning\" for relations between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe United States also welcomed Johnson's resignation, with President Joe Biden saying that he looked forward to working with Johnson's successor.\n\n#List of departures\n\nThe following ministers and government officials resigned during the crisis:\n\n* Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n* Sajid Javid, Health Secretary\n* Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary\n* Dominic Raab, Deputy Prime Minister\n* Priti Patel, Home Secretary\n* Liz Truss, Foreign Secretary\n* Kwasi Kwarteng, Business Secretary\n* Nadine Dorries, Culture Secretary\n* Brandon Lewis, Northern Ireland Secretary\n* Jake Berry, Minister without Portfolio\n\n#See also\n\n* Partygate scandal\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom\n* Boris Johnson\n* Conservative Party (UK)\n\n#Notes\n\nThe article is based on publicly available information and does not include any original research or analysis.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"July_2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse of the government\n##Support for Johnson\n#Resignation of Boris Johnson\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#List of departures\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

On June 6, 2023, the dam was destroyed, causing widespread flooding, displacement of people, and significant economic losses. This article provides an overview of the events leading up to the destruction, the circumstances surrounding the incident, and the consequences that followed.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was constructed in the 1950s as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant project. The dam was designed to provide hydroelectric power, irrigate agricultural lands, and regulate the water level of the Dnieper River. Over the years, the dam became a crucial component of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, supplying electricity to millions of households and businesses.\n\nIn 2022, the Kakhovka Dam became a focal point in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Russian forces occupied the dam and the surrounding area, and the facility was reportedly used as a military base. The dam's destruction was widely anticipated, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces accusing each other of planning to sabotage the facility.\n\n# Destruction\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at approximately 2:50 a.m. local time, a massive explosion occurred at the Kakhovka Dam, causing the structure to collapse. The explosion was reportedly triggered by a detonation of explosives, although the exact circumstances surrounding the incident remain unclear.\n\nThe destruction of the dam resulted in a rapid increase in water levels downstream, with the Dnieper River overflowing its banks and causing widespread flooding in the surrounding areas. The flooding affected several cities and towns, including Kherson, Nova Kakhovka, and Tavriysk.\n\n# Responsibility\n\nThe question of who was responsible for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam remains a matter of debate. Ukrainian authorities attributed the incident to Russian forces, alleging that they had deliberately sabotaged the dam to disrupt Ukraine's energy and water supply infrastructure.\n\nRussian officials, on the other hand, denied any involvement in the destruction of the dam, suggesting that Ukrainian forces might have been responsible for the incident. They claimed that Ukrainian forces had been trying to regain control of the dam and might have accidentally triggered the explosion.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam had far-reaching consequences, affecting various aspects of life in southern Ukraine.\n\n## Casualties\n\nThe flooding caused by the dam's destruction resulted in significant human casualties. According to official reports, at least 100 people lost their lives in the disaster, with many more injured or missing.\n\n## Flooding and evacuations\n\nThe flooding affected several cities and towns, with thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes. The Ukrainian authorities launched a massive evacuation effort, with rescue teams working around the clock to save those stranded by the floodwaters.\n\n## Animals and environment\n\nThe flooding caused significant damage to the environment, with many animals either killed or displaced. The Ukrainian authorities reported that several endangered species, including the Dnieper River sturgeon, were affected by the disaster.\n\n## Military impact\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam had significant military implications, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces affected by the incident. The Ukrainian military lost a critical infrastructure facility, while Russian forces were forced to withdraw from the area.\n\n## Water supply\n\nThe destruction of the dam disrupted the water supply to several cities and towns, including Kherson and Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainian authorities were forced to implement emergency measures to ensure the supply of clean water to affected areas.\n\n## North Crimean Canal\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam played a critical role in supplying water to the North Crimean Canal, which provides irrigation to agricultural lands in Crimea. The destruction of the dam disrupted the water supply to the canal, affecting agricultural production in the region.\n\n## Farming\n\nThe flooding caused by the dam's destruction affected agricultural production in the region, with thousands of hectares of farmland inundated by the floodwaters. The Ukrainian authorities reported significant losses to the agricultural sector, with many farmers forced to abandon their crops.\n\n## Fisheries\n\nThe destruction of the dam affected the fisheries sector, with many fish killed or displaced by the flooding. The Ukrainian authorities reported significant losses to the fisheries sector, with many fishermen forced to abandon their livelihoods.\n\n## Energy\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam was a critical component of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, supplying electricity to millions of households and businesses.

They are one of the three main domains of life, along with Archaea and Bacteria. Eukaryotes are incredibly diverse, ranging from single-celled organisms such as protozoa and algae, to complex multicellular organisms like plants, animals, and fungi. This article will explore the diversity, distinguishing features, evolution, and history of eukaryotes.\n\n#Diversity\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with a wide range of species and habitats. They can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing cold to the extremely hot, and from the ocean to the atmosphere. Some eukaryotes are single-celled, while others are multicellular, with complex body plans and organs. Eukaryotes can be autotrophic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic, meaning they can produce their own food, obtain food from other sources, or use a combination of both.\n\nEukaryotes can be divided into several distinct groups, including:\n\n* Protists: a group of single-celled eukaryotes that do not fit into any other category.\n* Fungi: a group of eukaryotes that obtain their nutrients by decomposing organic matter or forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms.\n* Animals: a group of multicellular eukaryotes that are heterotrophic and have complex body plans.\n* Plants: a group of multicellular eukaryotes that are autotrophic and have complex body plans.\n\n#Distinguishing features\n\nEukaryotes have several distinctive features that set them apart from other organisms. These features include:\n\n##Nucleus\n\nThe most distinctive feature of eukaryotes is the presence of a true nucleus. The nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material, or DNA. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which has pores that allow molecules to pass in and out of the nucleus.\n\n##Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotes have a unique set of biochemical pathways that distinguish them from other organisms. For example, eukaryotes use a different set of enzymes to catalyze metabolic reactions, and they have a different type of cell membrane that is composed of a phospholipid bilayer.\n\n##Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of internal membranes that divide the cell into different compartments. These compartments, or organelles, have distinct functions and are separated from the rest of the cell by membranes. Examples of organelles include the mitochondria, chloroplasts, and endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n##Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotes. They are responsible for generating energy for the cell through a process called cellular respiration. Mitochondria have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from a group of bacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n##Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles found in the cells of plants and some other eukaryotes. They are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Plastids have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from a group of cyanobacteria that were engulfed by the cells of early eukaryotes.\n\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotes have a complex system of cytoskeletal structures that provide support and shape to the cell. These structures include microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. They are composed of proteins and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell division and movement.\n\n##Cell wall\n\nSome eukaryotes have a cell wall, a rigid layer of material that provides support and protection to the cell. The cell wall is composed of a variety of materials, including cellulose, chitin, and peptidoglycan.\n\n##Sexual reproduction\n\nMany eukaryotes reproduce sexually, meaning they produce gametes (sex cells) that fuse to form a zygote. This process allows for genetic diversity and is a key characteristic of eukaryotes.\n\n#Evolution\n\nThe evolution of eukaryotes is a complex and still somewhat mysterious process. There are several different theories about how eukaryotes evolved, but most scientists agree that they originated from a group of ancient organisms called archaea.\n\n##History of classification\n\nEukaryotes were first described by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century. Linnaeus classified eukaryotes into several different groups, including plants, animals, and fungi. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that the concept of eukaryotes as a distinct domain of life was fully developed.\n\n##Phylogeny\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has revealed that eukaryotes are a monophyletic group, meaning they share a common ancestor. The exact relationships between different eukaryotic groups are still somewhat uncertain, but most scientists agree that the domain eukaryota is divided into several distinct subgroups.\n\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is still somewhat of a mystery, but most scientists agree that they evolved from a group of ancient archaea. One theory is that eukaryotes evolved when a group of archaea engulfed a group of bacteria, which eventually became the mitochondria.\n\n##Fossils\n\nEukaryotic fossils are found in rocks dating back to the Neoproterozoic era, around 1 billion years ago. These fossils are often difficult to interpret, but they provide important evidence for the evolution of eukaryotes.\n\n#See also\n\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Domain (biology)\n* Kingdom (biology)\n* Protist\n* Fungi\n* Animal\n* Plant\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His life and career were marked by controversy, particularly due to his involvement with the fascist Iron Guard movement and his collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II.\n\nEarly Life and Monastic Career\n-----------------------------\n\nVisarion Puiu was born on January 12, 1879, in the village of Vânători, Vaslui County, Romania. He came from a family of modest means and was the youngest of five children. From an early age, Puiu demonstrated a strong interest in spirituality and the Orthodox faith. He attended the local primary school and later enrolled in the Theological Seminary in Iași, where he studied theology and philosophy.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Puiu was tonsured as a monk at the Neamț Monastery, one of the oldest and most prestigious monasteries in Romania. He took the monastic name Visarion and quickly rose through the monastic ranks, becoming a hierodeacon and later a hieromonk. Puiu's intellectual and spiritual talents did not go unnoticed, and he was soon appointed as a professor at the Theological Seminary in Iași, where he taught dogmatics and moral theology.\n\nMetropolitan of Bukovina\n------------------------\n\nIn 1921, Visarion Puiu was elected as the Metropolitan of Bukovina, a province in northeastern Romania. As metropolitan, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the spiritual life of the Orthodox faithful in the region. He proved to be a capable and energetic leader, working to promote education, social welfare, and missionary work.\n\nHowever, Puiu's tenure as metropolitan was also marked by controversy. He became increasingly involved with the Iron Guard, a fascist movement that advocated for a return to traditional Romanian values and the expulsion of minority groups. Puiu saw the Iron Guard as a means of promoting Orthodox values and resisting the perceived threats of communism and liberalism.\n\nExarch of Transnistria\n----------------------\n\nIn 1942, Visarion Puiu was appointed as the Exarch of Transnistria, a region in southwestern Ukraine that had been occupied by Romanian forces during World War II. As exarch, Puiu was responsible for overseeing the spiritual life of the Orthodox faithful in the region.\n\nPuiu's tenure as exarch was marked by controversy and allegations of collaboration with the Axis powers. He worked closely with the Romanian authorities to promote the interests of the Orthodox Church in Transnistria and to suppress the activities of minority groups, including Jews and Ukrainians.\n\nExile\n------\n\n### Voyage to Croatia and Exile in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1944, as the Soviet Army advanced on Transnistria, Visarion Puiu fled to Croatia, where he joined a group of Romanian fascists who had escaped from Romania. From there, he traveled to Nazi Germany, where he was received by the German authorities.\n\nPuiu spent the remainder of the war in exile in Germany, where he continued to promote the interests of the Orthodox Church and the Iron Guard. He worked closely with the German authorities to promote anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda and to recruit Romanian soldiers for the German army.\n\n### Exile in Italy and Trial for War Crimes\n\nAfter the war, Visarion Puiu fled to Italy, where he was arrested by the Allied authorities and put on trial for war crimes. Puiu was accused of collaborating with the Axis powers and of promoting anti-Semitic and anti-communist propaganda.\n\nPuiu's trial was widely publicized in the Romanian press, and it sparked a heated debate about the role of the Orthodox Church in promoting fascist and nationalist ideologies. Puiu was eventually acquitted of the charges, but his reputation was severely damaged.\n\n### Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n\nIn 1950, Visarion Puiu was appointed as the Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe, a position that he held until his death in 1964. As bishop, Puiu worked to promote the interests of the Orthodox Church in Western Europe and to provide spiritual support to Romanian émigrés.\n\n### Final Years and Death\n\nVisarion Puiu spent his final years in exile in Western Europe, where he continued to promote the interests of the Orthodox Church and the Iron Guard. He died on August 10, 1964, in Paris, France, at the age of 85.\n\nPosthumous Evaluation\n---------------------\n\nVisarion Puiu's legacy is highly contested, and his role in promoting fascist and nationalist ideologies has been widely criticized. However, he is also remembered as a brilliant theologian and a dedicated servant of the Orthodox Church.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in Puiu's life and work, and his legacy has been the subject of several scholarly studies. While opinions about Puiu's legacy vary widely, it is clear that he played a significant role in shaping the history of the Orthodox Church in Romania during the mid-20th century.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Visarion_Puiu\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and monastic career\n#Metropolitan of Bukovina\n#Exarch of Transnistria\n#Exile\n##Voyage to Croatia and exile in Nazi Germany\n##Exile in Italy and trial for war crimes\n##Bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Diocese of Western Europe\n##Final years and death\n#Posthumous evaluation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The first English king to use the title \"Prince of Wales\", Edward was a skilled military leader and administrator who expanded English territories in Wales, Scotland, and France. He is considered one of the greatest kings in English history, known for his strong leadership, military victories, and significant contributions to the development of English law and government.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n-----------------------\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born at the Palace of Westminster in London, the eldest son of King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. As a child, Edward was close to his parents and was educated in Latin, French, and English. In 1254, at the age of 15, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a cousin of King Alfonso X of Castile. The marriage was arranged to secure an alliance with Castile and to gain control of the strategic port of Gascony in southwestern France.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's early ambitions were shaped by his father's struggles with the barons and the Church. In 1258, a group of barons, led by Simon de Montfort, forced King Henry to accept the Provisions of Oxford, which limited the king's power and established a council of barons to oversee the government. Edward, who had been appointed as the Earl of Chester, supported his father against the barons and played a key role in the negotiations that led to the Provisions.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n---------------------------------\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, the barons, led by Simon de Montfort, rebelled against King Henry III, sparking the Second Barons' War. Edward, who had become a skilled military leader, fought on behalf of his father and played a key role in the Battle of Evesham, where the barons were defeated and de Montfort was killed. Edward's victory at Evesham secured his position as a leading military figure in England and earned him the respect of his contemporaries.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1268, Edward joined the Eighth Crusade, led by King Louis IX of France. Edward's crusade was cut short when he received news of his father's death in 1272. Edward was proclaimed king by the English nobles and returned to England to claim his throne. He was crowned king on August 19, 1274, at Westminster Abbey.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n-----------------------\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's earliest priorities as king was to conquer Wales, which had resisted English rule for centuries. In 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. The campaign was successful, and Llywelyn was killed in battle. Edward established English rule in Wales and created the title of Prince of Wales, which has been held by the heir apparent to the English throne ever since.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward also sought to expand English territories in France and to secure English interests in Europe. In 1278, he married Margaret of France, the sister of King Philip III of France, to secure an alliance with France. Edward also launched a series of military campaigns against the French, including the conquest of Gascony and the Siege of Saint-Malo.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward established the Great Cause, a royal inquiry into the lordship of Scotland. The inquiry was sparked by the death of Alexander III of Scotland, who left no clear heir to the throne. Edward claimed that Scotland was a vassal state of England and that he had the right to determine the succession. The Great Cause ultimately led to the English conquest of Scotland and the establishment of English rule under the Treaty of Northampton.\n\nGovernment and law\n------------------\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward was known for his strong leadership and his commitment to justice. He was a skilled administrator and established a strong system of government in England. Edward also established a network of justices and sheriffs to enforce the law and to maintain order in the kingdom.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward made significant contributions to the development of English law and administration. He established the office of the Lord Chancellor, which became the chief administrative office in the kingdom. Edward also established the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of King's Bench, which became the principal courts of justice in England.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward also established a strong system of finance in England. He introduced a new system of taxation, which included the imposition of customs duties on imported goods. Edward also established the English Parliament, which became a key institution of government in England. The Parliament was composed of representatives from the nobility, the clergy, and the common people.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jews from England, citing their alleged role in the crucifixion of Christ. The expulsion was widely popular among the English people, who had long been suspicious of Jewish moneylenders and traders. The expulsion also led to the establishment of the English Parliament, which became a key institution of government in England.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward also established English rule in Ireland, which had been conquered by the Normans in the 12th century. Edward established a system of administration in Ireland, which included the appointment of justices and sheriffs to enforce the law and to maintain order.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n----------------------\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when a group of nobles and bishops refused to support his military campaigns in France and Scotland. The crisis was sparked by Edward's decision to raise taxes to fund his wars without the consent of Parliament. The crisis ultimately led to the establishment of the Model Parliament, which became a key institution of government in England.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1300, Edward launched a new military campaign against Scotland, which had rebelled against English rule. The campaign was successful, and Edward established English rule in Scotland under the Treaty of Northampton.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland, while on his way to Scotland. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where many other English monarchs are buried.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nEdward I is considered one of the greatest kings in English history. He expanded English territories in Wales, Scotland, and France and established a strong system of government and law in England. Edward also made significant contributions to the development of English culture and identity.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward married Eleanor of Castile in 1254. The marriage was arranged to secure an alliance with Castile and to gain control of the strategic port of Gascony in southwestern France. Eleanor died in 1290.\n\n### Second marriage\n\nEdward married Margaret of France in 1299. The marriage was arranged to secure an alliance with France and to gain control of the French territories in Flanders.\n\n### Genealogical table\n\n|   |   |   |   | Henry III of England |   | Eleanor of Provence |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   | Edward I of England |   | Eleanor of Castile |   |   |   |   |   |   | Margaret of France |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Alfonso, Earl of Chester |   | Henry of England |   | Eleanor of England |   | Joan of England |   | Margaret of England |   | Mary of England |   | Elizabeth of England |   | Edward II of England |   | Thomas of Brotherton |   | Edmund of Woodstock |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* English monarchy\n* History of England\n* Anglo-Norman period\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* Carpenter, D.

The election saw the incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party face off against a united opposition coalition, led by Péter Márki-Zay.\n\n# Background\n\n## Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn 2020, the Hungarian parliament passed an amendment to the electoral law, which changed the way parliamentary seats are allocated. The amendment increased the number of seats allocated through the national list from 93 to 106, while reducing the number of seats allocated through individual constituencies from 106 to 93. The opposition criticized the amendment, claiming it would favor the ruling Fidesz party.\n\n## Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the amendment, six opposition parties formed a united coalition, with the aim of presenting a single list of candidates in the election. The parties involved were the Democratic Coalition, Jobbik, LMP - Hungary's Green Party, Momentum Movement, MSZP, and Dialogue - The Greens' Party.\n\n## Opposition primary\n\nTo select the opposition's candidate for prime minister, a primary election was held in September and October 2021. Péter Márki-Zay, the mayor of Hódmezővásárhely, won the primary with 56.7% of the vote, defeating Klára Dobrev, the vice-president of the European Parliament.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nHungary uses a mixed electoral system, with 106 seats allocated through a national list and 93 seats allocated through individual constituencies. Voters cast two ballots: one for a candidate in their constituency and one for a party list. The party list seats are allocated using a proportional representation system, with a 5% threshold for parties to enter parliament. The constituency seats are allocated using a first-past-the-post system.\n\n# Parties and coalitions\n\n* Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance (Fidesz)\n* United for Hungary (opposition coalition)\n\t+ Democratic Coalition (DK)\n\t+ Jobbik\n\t+ LMP - Hungary's Green Party (LMP)\n\t+ Momentum Movement (Momentum)\n\t+ MSZP\n\t+ Dialogue - The Greens' Party (Párbeszéd)\n* Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party (MKKP)\n* Our Homeland Movement (Mi Hazánk)\n* Solution Movement (Megoldás Mozgalom)\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the run-up to the election suggested a close contest between Fidesz and the united opposition coalition. A poll conducted by the Hungarian research firm Századvég in February 2022 found Fidesz leading the opposition by 2 percentage points, with 44% support. A poll conducted by the research firm Publicus in March 2022 found the opposition leading Fidesz by 1 percentage point, with 43% support.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the election were announced on April 3, 2022, with Fidesz winning 53.3% of the national list vote and 88 constituency seats. The united opposition coalition won 34.4% of the national list vote and 57 constituency seats.\n\n## Result by constituency\n\nFidesz won 88 constituency seats, including 14 in Budapest and 74 in the countryside. The united opposition coalition won 57 constituency seats, including 9 in Budapest and 48 in the countryside.\n\n## Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nFidesz won the party list vote in 19 counties, including Budapest. The united opposition coalition won the party list vote in 5 counties. In the diaspora vote, Fidesz won 95.5% of the vote, while the opposition won 4.5%.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe result of the election was seen as a surprise by many commentators, who had expected a closer contest between Fidesz and the united opposition coalition. Analysts pointed to a number of factors that contributed to Fidesz's victory, including the party's strong organization and the government's control of the media.\n\n## Conduct\n\nThe conduct of the election was widely criticized by international observers, who pointed to a number of irregularities, including the government's use of propaganda and the lack of transparency in the electoral process.\n\n## Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were a number of anomalies reported in the postal ballot process, including allegations of tampering with ballots and the use of fake addresses to cast multiple votes.\n\n## International responses\n\nThe result of the election was met with concern by many international leaders, who expressed worries about the state of democracy in Hungary. The European Commission issued a statement calling for respect for the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election\n* 2022 Hungarian presidential election\n* Politics of Hungary\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on information available up to April 3, 2022.\n\n# References\n\n* Hungary's National Election Office.

Open science refers to the practice of making scientific research, data, and publications openly available to anyone, free of charge, and without restrictions on use or reuse. The economics of open science is concerned with understanding the costs and benefits of open science, as well as the economic models and mechanisms that support or hinder its development.\n\n# Economic Models\n\nEconomic models of open science are frameworks that describe how scientific knowledge is produced, disseminated, and used in the context of open science. These models help to identify the key actors, resources, and mechanisms involved in open science, and to analyze the economic implications of different approaches to open science.\n\n## Open Science Club\n\nAn open science club is a concept that refers to a group of researchers, institutions, or countries that collaborate to produce and share scientific knowledge openly. The idea of an open science club is based on the notion that scientific knowledge is a public good, and that its production and dissemination can be more efficient and effective when done collaboratively.\n\n### Definitions of Knowledge Club\n\nA knowledge club is a group of individuals or organizations that share knowledge and work together to produce new knowledge. Knowledge clubs can be formal or informal, and can exist within or across institutions, countries, or sectors. In the context of open science, knowledge clubs are often formed around specific research areas or topics, and may involve collaborations between researchers, policymakers, industry partners, and civil society organizations.\n\n### Knowledge Club and Open Science\n\nThe concept of a knowledge club is closely related to open science, as it emphasizes the importance of collaboration, sharing, and openness in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. In an open science club, members work together to produce and share knowledge, and to develop new research methods, tools, and standards. The open science club model can help to promote greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\n## Open Science Market\n\nThe open science market refers to the economic mechanisms and institutions that support the production, dissemination, and use of scientific knowledge in the context of open science. The open science market is characterized by a mix of public and private actors, and involves a range of economic models and mechanisms, including markets, commons, and clubs.\n\n### Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market\n\nScientific publishing is a key component of the open science market, and is characterized by a hybrid model that combines elements of public and private provision. In this model, public funding agencies and institutions support the production of scientific research, while private companies provide publishing services, including peer review, editing, and distribution. The hybrid model has been criticized for creating conflicts of interest and perpetuating inequality in access to scientific knowledge.\n\n### From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access\n\nThe open science market is shifting from a reader-pays model, in which readers pay subscription fees to access scientific articles, to an author-pays model, in which authors pay article processing charges (APCs) to publish their work openly. The author-pays model is often referred to as gold open access, and is seen as a more equitable and sustainable approach to open science. However, the model has also been criticized for creating new barriers to access, particularly for authors from low-income countries.\n\n### From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams\n\nThe open science market is also characterized by a diversification of revenue streams, as companies and institutions seek to exploit new opportunities for profit in the context of open science. This includes the development of new analytics tools and services, which can help researchers to navigate the growing volume of scientific literature and data. The diversification of revenue streams has created new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in the open science market, but also raises concerns about the commercialization of scientific knowledge.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons refers to the shared resources and infrastructure that support the production, dissemination, and use of scientific knowledge in the context of open science. The open science commons includes digital repositories, data platforms, and other online resources that provide access to scientific literature, data, and other knowledge assets.\n\n### The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons\n\nThe open science commons has emerged in response to the growing need for greater access, sharing, and collaboration in scientific research. Digital knowledge commons, such as online repositories and data platforms, have been developed to provide open access to scientific knowledge and to promote greater transparency and accountability in research. The open science commons is seen as a key component of open science, and is supported by a range of public and private actors, including funding agencies, institutions, and civil society organizations.\n\n### Enclosures of Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons is also subject to enclosures, as companies and institutions seek to exploit the commercial potential of scientific knowledge. This includes the development of proprietary data platforms and analytics tools, which can restrict access to scientific knowledge and create new barriers to innovation. The enclosures of the open science commons raise concerns about the sustainability and equity of open science, and highlight the need for greater regulation and oversight.\n\n### Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)\n\nThe open science commons has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, as companies and institutions seek to integrate and standardize digital knowledge resources. This includes the development of new metadata standards and data interoperability protocols, which can facilitate greater sharing and collaboration in scientific research. The consolidation of the common ecosystem has created new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in the open science market, but also raises concerns about the concentration of market power and the potential for monopolization.\n\n# Cost\n\nThe economics of open science is also concerned with the costs of producing, disseminating, and using scientific knowledge. These costs can be significant, and can create barriers to access and innovation in scientific research.\n\n## Editorial Work and Evaluation\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are critical components of the scientific publishing process, and can be costly and time-consuming. The costs of editorial work and evaluation can be borne by authors, institutions, or funding agencies, and can create significant barriers to access for researchers from low-income countries.\n\n## Technical Infrastructure\n\nThe technical infrastructure required to support open science can also be costly, particularly for institutions and countries with limited resources. This includes the development and maintenance of digital repositories, data platforms, and other online resources that provide access to scientific literature and data.\n\n## Commercial Services and Prestige\n\nCommercial services and prestige can also drive up the costs of open science, as companies and institutions seek to exploit the commercial potential of scientific knowledge. This includes the development of proprietary data platforms and analytics tools, which can restrict access to scientific knowledge and create new barriers to innovation.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThe economics of open science is also concerned with the benefits of open science, including greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\n## Transaction Costs\n\nOpen science can reduce transaction costs, particularly for researchers and institutions, by providing greater access to scientific literature and data. This can facilitate greater collaboration and innovation in scientific research, and can create new opportunities for entrepreneurship and economic growth.\n\n## Access Costs\n\nOpen science can also reduce access costs, particularly for researchers from low-income countries, by providing greater access to scientific literature and data. This can help to promote greater equity and inclusion in scientific research, and can create new opportunities for innovation and economic growth.\n\n## Research Efficiency\n\nOpen science can also promote greater research efficiency, particularly by reducing duplication of effort and promoting greater collaboration and sharing in scientific research. This can help to accelerate scientific progress and create new opportunities for innovation and economic growth.\n\n## Economic and Social Development\n\nOpen science can also contribute to economic and social development, particularly in low-income countries, by providing greater access to scientific knowledge and promoting greater innovation and entrepreneurship. This can help to promote greater equity and inclusion in scientific research, and can create new opportunities for economic growth and development.\n\n# Economic Regulation of Open Science\n\nThe economics of open science is also concerned with the economic regulation of open science, including the development of policies and laws that promote greater access, sharing, and collaboration in scientific research.\n\nOpen science is subject to a range of economic regulations, including copyright and patent laws, which can create barriers to access and innovation in scientific research. The economic regulation of open science is critical to promoting greater efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. Koufax's career was marked by his incredible talent, his dominance on the mound, and his decision to retire at a relatively young age due to injuries. He is also notable for his Jewish heritage and his decision to observe the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which drew attention to his faith and his commitment to his values.\n\n#Early life\n\nSanford Koufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Evelyn and Jack Koufax. His father was an attorney, and his mother was a homemaker. Koufax grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. He developed a passion for baseball at an early age and was an excellent all-around athlete, playing basketball, football, and baseball in high school.\n\n##Major League tryouts\n\nAfter graduating from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, Koufax was offered a basketball scholarship to the University of Cincinnati. However, he decided to pursue a career in baseball instead. In 1953, Koufax attended a tryout with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but he was not signed. He then tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers, who signed him to a contract in 1954.\n\n#Professional career\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, at the age of 19. He pitched in 12 games that season, posting a 2-2 record with a 3.02 ERA. Over the next few years, Koufax continued to develop as a pitcher, but he struggled with control and consistency.\n\n##Early years (1955–1960)\n\nKoufax's early years in the major leagues were marked by inconsistency and frustration. He was sent to the minor leagues several times to work on his control and to develop his pitching skills. However, he continued to show flashes of brilliance, striking out 10 or more batters in a game on several occasions.\n\n##Domination (1961–1964)\n\nIn 1961, Koufax began to emerge as a dominant force in the major leagues. He won 18 games that season, posting a 3.52 ERA and striking out 269 batters.\n\n###1961 season\n\nKoufax's breakout season in 1961 was marked by several impressive performances. On July 10, he struck out 13 batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs. On August 31, he pitched a complete game shutout against the San Francisco Giants, striking out 10 batters.\n\n###1962 season\n\nIn 1962, Koufax continued to dominate on the mound. He won 14 games that season, posting a 2.54 ERA and striking out 219 batters. On May 11, he pitched a complete game shutout against the New York Mets, striking out 13 batters.\n\n###1963 season\n\nIn 1963, Koufax won 25 games, posting a 1.88 ERA and striking out 306 batters. He was named the Cy Young Award winner that season, becoming the first Dodger to win the award.\n\n##Salary dispute\n\nKoufax's success on the mound led to a salary dispute with the Dodgers in 1964. He and fellow pitcher Don Drysdale, who was also seeking a raise, decided to hold out from spring training. The two pitchers eventually signed contracts, but the dispute had a lasting impact on Koufax's relationship with the Dodgers.\n\n###1964 season\n\nIn 1964, Koufax pitched in 28 games, posting a 19-5 record with a 1.74 ERA. He struck out 223 batters that season, including 15 in a game against the Chicago Cubs on June 4.\n\n##Playing in pain (1965–66)\n\nKoufax's final two seasons in the major leagues were marked by injuries and pain. He pitched through a variety of ailments, including a sore arm and a bad back.\n\n###1965 season\n\nIn 1965, Koufax won 26 games, posting a 1.73 ERA and striking out 382 batters. He was named the Cy Young Award winner for the second time in his career.\n\n####Perfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs. He retired all 27 batters he faced, striking out 14. The game was played in front of a crowd of 29,139 at Dodger Stadium.\n\n####World Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nIn the 1965 World Series, Koufax faced a difficult decision. The first game of the series was scheduled for October 6, which was the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Koufax decided to observe the holiday, not pitching in the game. The Dodgers lost the game, but they eventually won the series in seven games.\n\n##Holdout\n\nIn 1966, Koufax and Drysdale again held out from spring training, seeking raises. The two pitchers eventually signed contracts, but the holdout had a lasting impact on Koufax's relationship with the Dodgers.\n\n###1966 season\n\nIn 1966, Koufax pitched in 41 games, posting a 27-9 record with a 1.73 ERA. He struck out 317 batters that season, including 15 in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 22.\n\n##Retirement\n\nKoufax retired from baseball in 1966, citing injuries and a desire to pursue other interests. He was just 30 years old at the time of his retirement.\n\n#Career overall\n\n##Statistics and achievements\n\nKoufax's career statistics include a 165-87 record, a 2.76 ERA, and 2,396 strikeouts. He was a three-time Cy Young Award winner and a three-time World Series champion.\n\n##Pitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax was known for his blazing fastball and his sharp curveball. He also threw a changeup and a slider, which he used to keep hitters off balance.\n\n#Post-playing activities\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Koufax went on to become a successful businessman and broadcaster. He worked as a television commentator for NBC, covering baseball games and providing analysis.\n\n#Honors and recognition\n\nKoufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, in his first year of eligibility. He was also named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year in 1963.\n\n#Legacy\n\nKoufax's legacy extends far beyond his on-field accomplishments. He is remembered as a trailblazer for Jewish athletes and as a symbol of excellence and dedication.\n\n##Impact within the Jewish community\n\nKoufax's decision to observe Yom Kippur during the 1965 World Series had a profound impact on the Jewish community. He was hailed as a hero and a role model, and his decision helped to raise awareness about the importance of faith and tradition.\n\n##Relationship with fellow minorities\n\nKoufax was also a pioneer in terms of his relationships with fellow minorities. He was friends with many African American players, including Jackie Robinson and Don Newcombe, and he was a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n#In media culture\n\nKoufax has been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows. He has also been referenced in popular culture, appearing in everything from The Simpsons to Seinfeld.\n\n##Television appearances\n\nKoufax has made numerous television appearances over the years, including guest spots on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.\n\n##Cultural references\n\nKoufax has been referenced in popular culture, appearing in everything from music to literature. He has been name-checked in songs by artists such as Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, and he has been written about by authors such as Roger Angell and Gay Talese.\n\n#Personal life\n\nKoufax is married to Jane Dee, and the couple has two children together. He is a private person and keeps a low profile, but he is still involved in the baseball world and is widely respected by his peers.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Jewish baseball players\n* List of baseball players who have pitched a perfect game\n* List of baseball players who have won the Cy Young Award\n\n#Notes\n\n* Koufax is often referred to as \"The Left Arm of God\" due to his dominance on the mound.\n* He was a three-time World Series champion and a three-time Cy Young Award winner.\n* Koufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, in his first year of eligibility.\n\n#References\n\n##Book sources\n\n* Angell, Roger (1976).

The storm complex was a multifaceted system that produced a wide range of weather phenomena, from thunderstorms and tornadoes in the southern United States to blizzard conditions in the northern Plains.\n\n# Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe storm complex developed on April 10, 2022, as a strong low-pressure system formed over the southern Rocky Mountains. The system was fueled by a combination of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and a strong cold front from Canada. As the system strengthened, it tapped into the warm, moist air from the Gulf, leading to the development of severe thunderstorms across the southern United States.\n\nThe storm complex was characterized by a strong jet stream, which provided the necessary lift for the storms to develop and intensify. The system also had a strong dry line, which acted as a focal point for the development of thunderstorms. The combination of the strong jet stream, dry line, and warm, moist air from the Gulf created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\n## April 11 event\n\nA total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed on April 11, 2022, across the southern United States. The tornadoes were concentrated in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF3, which occurred in the town of Bowie, Texas. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, and injured several people.\n\n## April 12 event\n\nOn April 12, 2022, a total of 17 tornadoes were confirmed across the southern United States. The tornadoes were concentrated in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2, which occurred in the town of Monroe, Louisiana. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, and injured several people.\n\n## April 13 event\n\nA total of 12 tornadoes were confirmed on April 13, 2022, across the southern United States. The tornadoes were concentrated in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The strongest tornado of the day was an EF2, which occurred in the town of Huntsville, Alabama. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, and injured several people.\n\n## Bell County–Salado, Texas\n\nOne of the most significant tornado events of the storm complex occurred on April 12, 2022, in the town of Salado, Texas. A long-lived EF3 tornado touched down in the town, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles, and injured several people. The tornado was part of a larger outbreak of 17 tornadoes that occurred across the southern United States on April 12.\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\n## Severe storms\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the storm complex produced a large number of severe thunderstorms across the southern United States. The storms produced large hail, damaging winds, and heavy rainfall, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. The storms also caused widespread power outages, leaving thousands of people without electricity.\n\n## Winter weather side\n\n### Freezing temperatures\n\nAs the storm complex moved northwards, it brought freezing temperatures to a large portion of the northern United States. The temperatures were well below average, causing significant disruptions to daily life. The freezing temperatures also caused significant damage to crops, particularly in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota.\n\n### Blizzard\n\nOn April 13, 2022, a blizzard warning was issued for a large portion of the northern Plains, including the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. The blizzard brought heavy snowfall, high winds, and low visibility, causing significant disruptions to transportation and daily life. The blizzard was part of a larger winter storm system that affected a large portion of the northern United States.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex had a significant impact on the environment, economy, and society. The storm complex caused significant damage to homes and businesses, particularly in the southern United States. The storm complex also caused widespread power outages, leaving thousands of people without electricity. The storm complex also had a significant impact on agriculture, particularly in the states of North Dakota and Minnesota, where freezing temperatures caused significant damage to crops.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tornadoes in the United States\n* List of blizzards in the United States\n* Severe weather terminology\n* Winter storm\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the April 2022 North American storm complex.

It is one of the longest-running and most popular television programs in the Philippines, known for its unique blend of entertainment, comedy, and public service.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### RPN (1979–1989)\n\nEat Bulaga! premiered on July 30, 1979, on Radio Philippines Network (RPN) with a cast of comedians and entertainers, including Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon. The show was created by Sotto and his brothers, and was initially intended to be a temporary replacement for a canceled program. However, its popularity soon made it a mainstay of RPN's programming.\n\n### ABS-CBN (1989–1995)\n\nIn 1989, Eat Bulaga! transferred to ABS-CBN, where it continued to gain popularity and attract new viewers. During this period, the show introduced new segments and characters, including the popular \"Sex Bomb\" dancers.\n\n### GMA Network (1995–2024)\n\nIn 1995, Eat Bulaga! moved to GMA Network, where it became one of the network's flagship programs. The show continued to evolve, introducing new hosts, segments, and characters. During this period, Eat Bulaga! became known for its charitable work, particularly in the area of disaster relief.\n\n### TVJ - TAPE Inc. conflict (2023–2024)\n\nIn 2023, a conflict arose between the show's hosts, Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon (collectively known as TVJ), and the show's producer, TAPE Inc. The conflict centered on the ownership of the Eat Bulaga! trademark, with TVJ claiming that they had the rights to the name and format of the show.\n\n#### E.A.T. and TAPE's Eat Bulaga!\n\nIn response to the conflict, TAPE Inc. launched a new version of Eat Bulaga! on GMA Network, with a new cast of hosts and a revised format. TVJ, meanwhile, launched their own version of the show, called E.A.T., on a rival network.\n\n#### Eat Bulaga! trademark battle: TVJ emerges victorious\n\nAfter a lengthy court battle, TVJ emerged victorious, with the court ruling that they had the rights to the Eat Bulaga! trademark. As a result, TAPE Inc.'s version of the show was forced to cease production, and TVJ's E.A.T. was rebranded as Eat Bulaga!.\n\n### TV5 and RPTV (since 2024)\n\nIn 2024, Eat Bulaga! transferred to TV5 and RPTV, where it continues to air to this day.\n\nHosts\n------\n\n### Current host\n\n* Tito Sotto\n* Vic Sotto\n* Joey de Leon\n\n### Former host\n\n* Chiqui Hollman\n* Coney Reyes\n* Pilita Corrales\n* Helen Vela\n\nSegments\n--------\n\n### Current segments\n\n#### Sugod Bahay, Mga Kapatid!\n\nA popular segment in which the hosts visit the homes of lucky viewers and award them prizes.\n\n#### Gimme 5: Laro ng mga Henyo\n\nA game show segment in which contestants compete to answer trivia questions.\n\n#### Peraphy\n\nA comedy segment in which the hosts perform parodies of popular songs.\n\n#### Barangay Bulagaan\n\nA segment in which the hosts visit different barangays (villages) and award prizes to lucky residents.\n\n#### Dear Eat Bulaga\n\nA segment in which the hosts answer letters from viewers and offer advice on various topics.\n\n#### Eat Bulaga Olympics\n\nA sports segment in which the hosts compete in various Olympic-style events.\n\n#### Bawal!

Zionism led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, which has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Anti-Zionism encompasses a broad range of perspectives and movements that have evolved over time, reflecting various political, social, and cultural contexts.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n-------------------------\n\n### Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Jewish communities and leaders opposed Zionism, viewing it as a threat to their existing relationships with non-Jewish societies and to their own identities as Jews. They saw Zionism as a radical and separatist movement that would lead to the isolation of Jews from the rest of society. Some Jewish anti-Zionists also feared that the creation of a Jewish state would lead to the displacement of Palestinian Arabs, who had been living in the region for centuries.\n\n### Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism emerged in the early 20th century, as the Arab population in Palestine became increasingly aware of the implications of Jewish immigration and land purchases. Arab leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to their own national aspirations and to the integrity of the Arab world. They argued that Palestine was an integral part of the Arab homeland and that the creation of a Jewish state would lead to the fragmentation of the Arab world.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which the British government expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparked widespread opposition among Arabs and some Jews. The declaration was seen as a betrayal of Arab trust in the British and as a threat to the rights of the Arab population in Palestine.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionist sentiment grew among Arabs and some Jews, as Jewish immigration to Palestine increased and tensions between Jews and Arabs escalated. The 1929 Hebron massacre, in which dozens of Jews were killed by Arab rioters, and the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt, which was sparked by Arab opposition to Jewish immigration and land purchases, further polarized the conflict.\n\n### The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nThe 1942 Biltmore programme, which called for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine, was met with fierce opposition from Arabs and some Jews. The programme was seen as a radical and expansionist move that would lead to the displacement of Palestinian Arabs and the creation of a Jewish state at the expense of Arab rights.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism emerged among some Jewish and Christian groups, who saw Zionism as a secular and nationalist movement that threatened traditional religious values. Some Jewish anti-Zionists argued that the creation of a Jewish state would lead to the desecration of the Holy Land and the abandonment of traditional Jewish values.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nThe 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, which called for the division of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, was met with fierce opposition from Arabs and some Jews. The plan was seen as a betrayal of Arab rights and as a threat to the integrity of the Arab world. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which followed the creation of the State of Israel, further polarized the conflict.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union, which had initially supported the creation of the State of Israel, later became a strong critic of Zionism and Israeli policies. The Soviet Union saw Zionism as a form of nationalism that threatened the unity of the socialist bloc and the interests of the Soviet Union in the Middle East.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism continued to grow after the creation of the State of Israel, as the Palestinian refugee crisis and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip fueled anti-Zionist sentiment. Arab and Palestinian leaders argued that Zionism was a form of colonialism and that the creation of the State of Israel was a historical injustice that needed to be rectified.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, some critics of Zionism began to see it as a form of racism, arguing that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights. This perception was fueled by the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the treatment of Palestinian Arabs by the Israeli authorities.\n\n#### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies saw Zionism as a form of imperialism and racism, arguing that the creation of the State of Israel was a plot by Western powers to divide the Arab world and to maintain their control over the region.\n\n#### After the Cold War\n\nAfter the Cold War, the perception of Zionism as racism continued to grow, particularly among some left-wing and Islamist groups. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of apartheid.\n\n### Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as Muslim leaders and intellectuals saw Zionism as a threat to the integrity of the Islamic world and to the rights of Palestinian Arabs. Some Islamic critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was a form of colonialism and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against Muslims.\n\n### Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some left-wing groups saw Zionism as a form of nationalism and imperialism. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of colonialism.\n\n### Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some Christian groups saw Zionism as a form of nationalism and imperialism. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against Christians.\n\n#### Protestants\n\nProtestant opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some Protestant groups saw Zionism as a form of nationalism and imperialism. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against Christians.\n\n#### Catholics\n\nCatholic opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some Catholic groups saw Zionism as a form of nationalism and imperialism. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against Christians.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Jewish opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some Haredi groups saw Zionism as a form of nationalism and secularism. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of traditional Jewish values and the denial of the authority of the Torah.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n---------------------------\n\n### Jewish right to a state\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism argue that opposition to the creation of a Jewish state is based on antisemitism, arguing that Jews have the right to self-determination and that the creation of a Jewish state is a necessary response to centuries of persecution.\n\n### Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism argue that anti-Zionism is often equated with antisemitism, arguing that opposition to the creation of a Jewish state is often based on a deeper hatred of Jews and a desire to deny them their rights.\n\n### View that the two are not interlinked\n\nOthers argue that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked, arguing that opposition to the creation of a Jewish state is based on a critique of nationalism and imperialism, rather than a hatred of Jews.\n\n### Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nSome individuals and groups have shifted their positions on the Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum over time, as their views on the creation of a Jewish state and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have evolved.\n\n### Far-right politics\n\nFar-right opposition to Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some far-right groups saw Zionism as a form of internationalism and a threat to national sovereignty. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on the exclusion of non-Jews and the denial of their rights, and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against non-Jews.\n\n### Conspiracy theories\n\nConspiracy theories about Zionism emerged in the 20th century, as some groups saw Zionism as a plot by Jews to control world events and to manipulate governments. Critics of Zionism argued that the creation of a Jewish state was based on a desire for world domination and that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was a form of aggression against non-Jews.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Zionism\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Jewish nationalism\n* Arab nationalism\n\nNotes\n------\n\nCitations\n----------\n\nSources\n--------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anti-Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Anti-Zionism before 1948\n##Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n##Early Arab anti-Zionism\n##Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n##Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n##The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n##Religious\n#Anti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n##1947–1948\n##Soviet Union\n##Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n##Perception of Zionism as racism\n###During the Cold War\n###After the Cold War\n##Islamic perspectives\n##Left-wing politics\n##Christian anti-Zionism\n###Protestants\n###Catholics\n##Haredi Judaism\n#Allegations of antisemitism\n##Jewish right to a state\n##Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n##View that the two are not interlinked\n##Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n##Far-right politics\n##Conspiracy theories\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n#Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her bold actions, which included interrupting a live news broadcast and holding a sign that read \"No War,\" sparked widespread discussion and debate about the role of journalists in times of conflict.\n\n# Early life and career\n\nMarina Ovsyannikova was born on June 19, 1978, in Odessa, Ukraine. She grew up in a family of intellectuals and was raised with a strong emphasis on education and critical thinking. Ovsyannikova developed an interest in journalism at an early age and pursued a degree in philology from the Odessa National University. After completing her studies, she began her career in journalism, working as a reporter for several local newspapers and television stations.\n\nIn 2002, Ovsyannikova joined the Russian state-owned television channel Channel One, where she worked as a producer and editor for several years. During her time at Channel One, Ovsyannikova was involved in the production of several high-profile news programs, including the channel's flagship evening news broadcast.\n\n# Anti-war protests\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ovsyannikova made international headlines when she interrupted a live news broadcast on Channel One, holding a sign that read \"No War\" and shouting \"Stop the war!\" The broadcast was abruptly cut off, and Ovsyannikova was detained by police.\n\n## Pre-recorded message\n\nBefore her protest, Ovsyannikova had recorded a video message explaining her actions and criticizing the Russian government's handling of the war in Ukraine. In the message, she stated that she was \"ashamed\" of her role in spreading propaganda and that she could no longer remain silent about the conflict.\n\n## Reactions\n\nOvsyannikova's protest sparked a mixed reaction from the Russian public and international community. While some praised her bravery and conviction, others criticized her actions as reckless and attention-seeking. The Russian government also responded quickly, condemning Ovsyannikova's actions as a \"provocation\" and accusing her of being a \"traitor.\"\n\n## Persecutions and activism\n\nFollowing her protest, Ovsyannikova faced severe persecution from the Russian authorities. She was detained and questioned by police, and her family was subjected to harassment and intimidation. Despite these challenges, Ovsyannikova continued to speak out against the war and advocate for peace.\n\nIn the months following her protest, Ovsyannikova became a prominent figure in the Russian anti-war movement. She attended rallies and demonstrations, gave interviews to international media outlets, and worked to raise awareness about the human cost of the conflict.\n\n## Criticism\n\nWhile Ovsyannikova's actions were widely praised by many in the international community, some critics argued that she had waited too long to speak out against the war.

The DPR and LPR were declared in 2014 in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, respectively, following the Ukrainian Revolution. Since then, the international community has been divided on the issue of recognition, with some countries recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, while others do not.\n\n# History\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were declared on April 7, 2014, and April 27, 2014, respectively. The declarations were made in response to the Ukrainian Revolution, which had led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government in Ukraine. The DPR and LPR were declared by separatist groups in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, who were opposed to the new government in Ukraine and sought greater autonomy or independence.\n\nIn the months and years that followed, the DPR and LPR established their own governments, military forces, and institutions, and began to receive support from Russia. However, the international community did not recognize the DPR and LPR as independent states, and instead considered them to be part of Ukraine.\n\n# Aftermath of Russian recognition\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, following a long period of tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The recognition was met with widespread condemnation from the international community, including the United States, the European Union, and other countries.\n\nIn the aftermath of Russian recognition, several countries and entities have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, while others have not. The international community remains divided on the issue, with some countries supporting the recognition of the DPR and LPR, while others do not.\n\n# Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n## UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Russia: Russia recognized the DPR and LPR on February 21, 2022.\n* Syria: Syria recognized the DPR and LPR on June 29, 2022.\n* North Korea: North Korea recognized the DPR and LPR on July 13, 2022.\n\n## Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Abkhazia: Abkhazia recognized the DPR and LPR on February 25, 2022.\n* South Ossetia: South Ossetia recognized the DPR and LPR on February 25, 2022.\n* Artsakh: Artsakh recognized the DPR and LPR on February 25, 2022.\n\n# Positions by other countries\n\n## Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n### UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states have expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Belarus: Belarus has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR, but has not formally recognized them.\n* China: China has expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR, but has not formally recognized them.\n\n## Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n### UN member states\n\nMost UN member states have not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* United States: The United States has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its recognition of the two states.\n* European Union: The European Union has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its recognition of the two states.\n* Canada: Canada has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its recognition of the two states.\n\n### Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* Taiwan: Taiwan has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has expressed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### International and regional organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations have also not supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, including:\n\n* United Nations: The United Nations has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.\n* Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe: The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.\n* European Court of Human Rights: The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has not recognized the DPR and LPR, and has ruled that Russia is responsible for human rights abuses in Ukraine.\n\n# See also\n\n* Donetsk People's Republic\n* Luhansk People's Republic\n* War in Donbas\n* Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation\n* International recognition of Kosovo\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"International_recognition_of_the_Donetsk_People's_Republic_and_the_Luhansk_People's_Republic\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Aftermath of Russian recognition\n#Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n##UN member states\n##Non-UN states\n#Positions by other countries\n##Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n##Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n###UN member states\n###Non-UN states\n###International and regional organizations\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

K. Rowling\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling, better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series. The series has become a cultural phenomenon, and its books have been translated into over 80 languages, selling more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\n# Name\n\nJ. K. Rowling's pen name is derived from her initials and her grandmother's name, Kathleen. She has stated that she chose to use her initials instead of her full name because she was concerned that her books might not be taken seriously if they were written by a woman.\n\n# Life and career\n\n## Early life and family\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. Her parents, Peter and Anne Rowling, were both science technicians. She has a younger sister, Dianne. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, when Rowling was nine months old, and then to Tutshill, near Chepstow, when she was four years old.\n\n## Secondary school and university\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and then went to Wyedean Comprehensive School and College in Gloucestershire. She was an average student but excelled in English and languages. After completing her A-levels, Rowling moved to London and worked as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International. In 1990, she moved to Manchester and then to Portugal, where she taught English as a foreign language.\n\n## Inspiration and mother's death\n\nRowling's mother, Anne, suffered from multiple sclerosis and died in 1990 at the age of 45. This event had a profound impact on Rowling's life and writing.

The book was rejected by twelve publishers before Bloomsbury agreed to publish it in 1997. The book's success was rapid, and the subsequent books in the series were published to great acclaim.\n\n## Films\n\nThe Harry Potter series was adapted into a series of films, with the first film released in 2001. The films were produced by Warner Bros. and starred Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. Rowling was involved in the production of the films and wrote several screenplays, including the screenplay for the final film, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\".\n\n## Religion, wealth and remarriage\n\nRowling's success with the Harry Potter series brought her wealth and fame. She has stated that she is a Christian and has spoken about the influence of her faith on her writing. In 2001, Rowling married Dr. Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor, and the couple had two sons, David and Mackenzie.\n\n## Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published her first novel for adults, \"The Casual Vacancy\", which received mixed reviews. In 2013, she also published a crime novel, \"The Cuckoo's Calling\", under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The book received positive reviews, but Rowling's identity as the author was not revealed until several months later.\n\n## Later Harry Potter works\n\nIn 2016, Rowling published \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\", a two-part play set nineteen years after the events of the original series. The play was co-written with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany. Rowling has also published several companion books to the Harry Potter series, including \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" and \"Quidditch Through the Ages\".\n\n## Children's stories\n\nRowling has written several children's stories, including \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" and \"The Ickabog\". She has also published several books for charity, including \"Quidditch Through the Ages\" and \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", which were published to raise money for Comic Relief and the charity Lumos.\n\n# Influences\n\nRowling's influences include J. R. R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Ursula K. Le Guin. She has also stated that she was influenced by her own experiences as a child and her relationships with her family and friends.\n\n# Style and themes\n\n## Style and allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by her use of descriptive language, complex characters, and intricate plotting. She has also made use of allusions to mythology, folklore, and fairy tales in her writing.\n\n## Themes\n\nRowling's writing often explores themes of love, friendship, prejudice, and the struggle between good and evil. Her writing also often explores the complexities of human relationships and the challenges of growing up.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Gender and social division\n\nRowling's writing has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of social issues such as poverty, racism, and prejudice. However, her writing has also been criticized for its representation of certain groups, including the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n## Religious reactions\n\nRowling's writing has been criticized by some for its perceived anti-Christian themes and its depiction of magic and the supernatural. However, Rowling has stated that she is a Christian and that her faith has influenced her writing.\n\n# Legacy\n\nRowling's legacy as a writer is significant, and her influence can be seen in many areas of popular culture. Her writing has inspired countless fans around the world, and her philanthropic work has made a positive impact on many lives.\n\n# Legal disputes\n\nRowling has been involved in several legal disputes, including a lawsuit against a fan site that published a guide to the Harry Potter series without permission. She has also been involved in a dispute with her former accountant over allegations of financial mismanagement.\n\n# Philanthropy\n\nRowling is a committed philanthropist and has donated millions of dollars to charity. She has also founded her own charity, Lumos, which works to help disadvantaged children around the world.\n\n# Views\n\n## Politics\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile political campaigns, including the campaign for Scottish independence.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day, Russian cinema has produced some of the most iconic and influential films in world cinema. This article will explore the history of Russian cinema, from its early beginnings to the present day, highlighting key periods, movements, and figures.\n\n# Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe Cinema of the Russian Empire began in the late 19th century, with the first film screenings taking place in 1896. During this period, Russian filmmakers were heavily influenced by French and German cinema, and many early Russian films were adaptations of literary classics. One of the most notable filmmakers of this period was Ladislas Starevich, who is considered to be one of the founders of Russian animation. Starevich's films, such as \"The Cameraman's Revenge\" (1912), were known for their dark humor and satire.\n\nDespite the early success of Russian cinema, the industry faced significant challenges during World War I and the subsequent Russian Revolution. Many filmmakers fled the country, and the industry went into decline.\n\n# Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Cinema of the Soviet Union was a major force in world cinema during the 20th century. After the Russian Revolution, the new Soviet government saw cinema as a powerful tool for propaganda and social change.\n\n## Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nThe early years of Soviet cinema were marked by a focus on propaganda and ideological films. Filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin produced films that celebrated the revolution and the new Soviet state. Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) is considered one of the greatest films of all time, and its innovative use of montage and cinematography influenced filmmakers around the world.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Soviet cinema became increasingly controlled by the government. Filmmakers were forced to conform to strict ideological guidelines, and many were persecuted for their perceived disloyalty. Despite these challenges, some filmmakers, such as Mikhail Kalatozov, continued to produce innovative and acclaimed films.\n\n## Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Soviet cinema began to experience a period of liberalization. Filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Nikita Mikhalkov produced films that explored themes of social change and personal freedom. Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966) is a masterpiece of world cinema, and its exploration of the life of the famous icon painter is a powerful commentary on the role of the artist in society.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet cinema continued to evolve, with filmmakers such as Eldar Ryazanov and Georgi Daneliya producing films that were both popular and critically acclaimed. Ryazanov's \"The Irony of Fate\" (1975) is a classic of Soviet comedy, and its exploration of the absurdities of Soviet life is both hilarious and poignant.\n\n# New Russian cinema\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian cinema entered a period of significant change. Many filmmakers struggled to adapt to the new economic and cultural realities, and the industry experienced a period of decline.\n\n## 1990s\n\nDuring the 1990s, Russian cinema began to experience a resurgence. Filmmakers such as Nikita Mikhalkov and Pavel Lungin produced films that explored themes of social change and personal identity. Mikhalkov's \"Burnt by the Sun\" (1994) is a powerful exploration of the Stalinist era, and its use of cinematography and music is both beautiful and haunting.\n\n## 2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw a significant increase in film production in Russia, with many new filmmakers emerging. The decade was marked by a focus on genre films, such as action and horror movies. Filmmakers such as Fedor Bondarchuk and Nikolai Lebedev produced films that were both popular and critically acclaimed. Bondarchuk's \"Stalingrad\" (2013) is a visually stunning epic that explores the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II.\n\n## 2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw a continued growth in film production in Russia, with many new filmmakers emerging. The decade was marked by a focus on socially conscious films, with many filmmakers exploring themes of social justice and personal freedom. Filmmakers such as Andrey Zvyagintsev and Kirill Serebrennikov produced films that were both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. Zvyagintsev's \"Leviathan\" (2014) is a powerful exploration of corruption and power in modern Russia.\n\n## 2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen a significant impact on the Russian film industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
