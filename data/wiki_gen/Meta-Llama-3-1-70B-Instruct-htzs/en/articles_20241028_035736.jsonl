The earthquake caused widespread damage and loss of life, particularly in the provinces of Abra and Ilocos Sur. It was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the Philippines in recent years.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe 2022 Luzon earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale, with a depth of 17 kilometers. The epicenter was located in the town of Tayum, Abra, approximately 340 kilometers north of Manila. The earthquake was a result of a combination of tectonic forces, including the subduction of the Philippine Sea plate beneath the Eurasian plate.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nFollowing the main shock, numerous aftershocks were recorded, with the strongest having a magnitude of 5.7. The aftershocks were felt in several provinces, including Abra, Ilocos Sur, and Benguet. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) reported that the aftershocks would continue to occur in the coming days, but with decreasing intensity.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake had a maximum intensity of VIII (Very Destructive) on the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) earthquake intensity scale.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also issued a warning for the Philippines, but later cancelled it.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nReports of liquefaction were received from several areas, including Abra and Ilocos Sur. Liquefaction is a phenomenon where the shaking of the earthquake causes water-saturated soil to lose its strength, leading to the formation of sand boils and ground cracks.\n\n# Response\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community quickly responded to the disaster, with several countries offering aid and assistance to the Philippines. The United States, China, and Japan were among the countries that offered aid, including financial assistance, relief goods, and personnel.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Abra\n\nThe province of Abra was the hardest hit by the earthquake, with widespread damage reported in several towns, including Tayum, Lagangilang, and Bangued. The provincial capital, Bangued, suffered significant damage, with several buildings collapsing, including the provincial hospital. The death toll in Abra was reported to be over 200, with several hundred more injured.\n\n## Baguio\n\nThe city of Baguio, located in the nearby province of Benguet, also suffered damage from the earthquake. Several buildings collapsed, including a hotel and a shopping mall. The city's airport was also damaged, with several flights cancelled.\n\n## Ilocos Sur\n\nThe province of Ilocos Sur also suffered significant damage, particularly in the towns of Vigan and Sinait. Several historic buildings were damaged, including the Vigan Cathedral.\n\n## Metro Manila\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in Metro Manila, with several buildings and infrastructure damaged. The Manila International Airport was closed temporarily due to damage to the runway.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in other parts of the country, including the provinces of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, and Bulacan.

The conflict resulted in significant humanitarian and diplomatic consequences, raising concerns about the risk of genocide and the fate of the Armenian population in the region.\n\n# Background\n\nNagorno-Karabakh has been a disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The region has been under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, which is supported by Armenia. Azerbaijan has long claimed sovereignty over the territory, leading to periodic clashes and a full-scale war in 2020. The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war resulted in a ceasefire agreement, which established a fragile peace in the region.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 offensive, tensions had been escalating between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both sides had accused each other of ceasefire violations, and there were reports of increased military build-up along the line of contact. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev had repeatedly stated that his country would take back control of Nagorno-Karabakh by any means necessary.\n\n# Offensive\n\n## 19 September\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a large-scale military operation against Artsakh, targeting multiple locations across the region. The attack included artillery, drone, and missile strikes, as well as ground incursions. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces had breached the line of contact and were advancing into Artsakh.\n\n## 20 September\n\nOn September 20, the situation on the ground continued to deteriorate. Azerbaijani forces made significant gains, capturing several key locations, including the town of Berdzor. The Armenian Defense Ministry reported that Azerbaijani forces were using banned cluster munitions and phosphorus bombs, which caused widespread destruction and civilian casualties.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs the Azerbaijani offensive gained momentum, thousands of Armenians fled their homes in Nagorno-Karabakh, seeking refuge in Armenia. The Armenian government reported that over 100,000 people had been displaced, with many more expected to follow. The exodus was facilitated by Armenian authorities, who provided transportation and humanitarian aid to the displaced.\n\n## Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nFollowing the capture of key locations in Artsakh, Azerbaijani forces arrested several senior officials of the Republic of Artsakh, including the president, Arayik Harutyunyan. The Azerbaijani government accused the officials of \"terrorism\" and \"separatism,\" and vowed to put them on trial.\n\n## Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nIn the aftermath of the offensive, Armenia and Azerbaijan entered into negotiations, facilitated by international mediators. The talks resulted in an agreement to dissolve the Republic of Artsakh and establish a new administrative entity under Azerbaijani control. The agreement was met with widespread criticism from the Armenian diaspora and human rights groups, who argued that it would lead to the erasure of Armenian identity and culture in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\n## Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the agreement, ceasefire violations continued to occur, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The situation on the ground remained tense, with reports of sporadic clashes and artillery exchanges.\n\n## Humanitarian aid\n\nThe international community responded to the humanitarian crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh by providing aid to the displaced population.

The disaster resulted in the deaths of 158 people, with over 190 injured. The incident was one of the deadliest peacetime disasters in South Korean history, and it raised serious questions about crowd control, emergency preparedness, and government accountability.\n\n**Background**\n\n### History of the district\n\nItaewon is a popular entertainment district in Seoul, known for its vibrant nightlife, bars, and restaurants. The area has a long history of hosting Halloween celebrations, which have grown in popularity over the years, attracting large crowds of revellers.\n\n### Layout of the area\n\nThe disaster occurred on a narrow, sloping street in Itaewon, which is lined with bars, clubs, and restaurants. The street is approximately 100 meters long and 3-4 meters wide, with no clear escape routes or emergency exits. The area is also surrounded by tall buildings, which can make it difficult for emergency responders to access the scene.\n\n**Conditions before the disaster**\n\n### Lack of government preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to the Halloween celebrations, concerns were raised about the potential for overcrowding and safety risks in Itaewon. However, the government failed to take adequate measures to address these concerns, despite warnings from local residents and business owners. The authorities did not implement crowd control measures, such as limiting the number of people allowed in the area or providing adequate emergency services.\n\n**Disaster**\n\nOn the evening of October 29, a large crowd of people gathered in the Itaewon district to celebrate Halloween. The crowd was estimated to be over 100,000 people, which is significantly larger than the area's capacity.

The suspensions targeted various users, including flight-tracking accounts, journalists, and other commentators. This article provides an overview of the events, Twitter's policy changes, and the responses from the affected individuals and the broader community.\n\n# Background\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, has become a prominent platform for real-time information sharing and discussion. With over 440 million monthly active users, the platform has faced increasing scrutiny over its content moderation policies and practices. In recent years, Twitter has implemented various measures to address issues like misinformation, harassment, and hate speech. However, these efforts have sometimes been criticized for being inconsistent or overly restrictive.\n\nIn October 2022, Elon Musk, a business magnate and entrepreneur, acquired Twitter for approximately $44 billion. Musk has stated his intention to promote free speech on the platform and reduce content moderation. However, his ownership has also raised concerns about the potential for increased misinformation and the erosion of trust in the platform.\n\n# Account Suspensions\n\nTwitter suspended several accounts in December 2022, citing various reasons, including policy violations and harassment. The suspensions have been widely reported and have sparked controversy among users and observers.\n\n## Twitter Policy Changes\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the suspensions, Twitter introduced several policy changes aimed at reducing harassment and increasing transparency. The company expanded its definition of harassment to include \"targeted misgendering\" and introduced new rules for reporting and addressing harassment. Twitter also announced plans to increase transparency around its moderation decisions and provide more context for suspended accounts.\n\nHowever, some users and critics argue that these policy changes are overly broad and could be used to silence legitimate speech. Others have expressed concerns that the changes may disproportionately affect certain groups, such as marginalized communities or journalists.\n\n## Suspension of Flight-Tracking Accounts\n\nOn December 14, 2022, Twitter suspended several flight-tracking accounts, including @ElonJet, which tracked the private jet of Elon Musk. The account, created by a 20-year-old college student, had gained significant attention and followers. Musk had previously stated that he would allow the account to continue, citing his commitment to free speech.\n\nHowever, Twitter claimed that the account had violated its policies by sharing \"real-time location information\" about Musk's private jet. The company stated that this information posed a risk to Musk's safety and security. The suspension sparked widespread criticism, with many arguing that the account was simply sharing publicly available information and did not pose a credible threat to Musk's safety.\n\n## Suspension of Journalist Accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended several journalist accounts, including those of reporters from The New York Times, CNN, and The Washington Post. The suspensions were reportedly related to the journalists' reporting on Musk and Twitter's policies.\n\nTwitter claimed that the journalists had violated its policies by sharing \"real-time location information\" about Musk's private jet. However, many of the journalists had simply reported on the @ElonJet account and its suspension. The suspensions sparked widespread outrage among journalists and media organizations, who argued that the actions were an attempt to intimidate and silence critical reporting.\n\n## Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter and Musk have offered varying explanations for the suspensions. Twitter has stated that the suspensions were necessary to protect Musk's safety and security, as well as to enforce its policies. Musk has argued that the suspensions were necessary to prevent the spread of \"hate speech\" and \"misinformation\" on the platform.\n\nHowever, many observers have questioned these explanations, arguing that they are inconsistent and lack evidence. Others have pointed out that Twitter's policies and enforcement actions appear to be arbitrary and biased against certain groups or individuals.\n\n# Reinstatement of Some Accounts\n\nOn December 17, 2022, Twitter reinstated several of the suspended journalist accounts, citing \"errors\" in its moderation process. However, the @ElonJet account and several other flight-tracking accounts remain suspended.\n\nThe reinstatements have been seen as a partial victory for free speech advocates and journalists, who have argued that the suspensions were an overreach by Twitter. However, many have also expressed concerns that the reinstatements may be temporary and that Twitter's policies and enforcement actions remain unclear and arbitrary.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe suspensions have sparked widespread debate and criticism among users, journalists, and commentators.\n\n## Suspended Journalists\n\nMany of the suspended journalists have expressed outrage and frustration over the actions, arguing that they are an attempt to intimidate and silence critical reporting. Some have pointed out that their reporting on Musk and Twitter's policies has been factual and fair, and that the suspensions are an overreach by the company.\n\n## Other Commentators\n\nOther commentators have also weighed in on the suspensions, arguing that they are part of a broader trend of censorship and content moderation on social media platforms. Some have expressed concerns that the suspensions may have a chilling effect on free speech and journalism, while others have argued that they are necessary to protect users and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n# See also\n\n* Censorship on social media\n* Content moderation\n* Free speech\n* Social media regulation\n* Twitter policies", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It has been a driving force in shaping the modern European landscape, fostering cooperation, and promoting peace and stability on the continent. The concept of European integration has evolved over the years, with various theories and models emerging to explain and guide the process.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of European integration dates back to the aftermath of World War II, when there was a strong desire to create a united and peaceful Europe. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1952, was the first major step towards integration. The ECSC aimed to integrate the coal and steel industries of six European countries, laying the groundwork for future economic cooperation. The European Economic Community (EEC) was established in 1958, with the goal of creating a common market among its member states. Over the years, the EEC evolved into the European Union (EU), which has become the primary driver of European integration.\n\n**Theories of integration**\n\nTheories of integration have played a crucial role in shaping the European integration process. There are three distinct phases of integration theory, each with its own set of assumptions and explanations.\n\n### Proto-integration period\n\nDuring the proto-integration period, theorists focused on the creation of international organizations and the role of functionalism in promoting integration. Functionalism, as proposed by David Mitrany, emphasized the importance of cooperation in specific areas, such as trade and security, as a means of achieving broader integration.\n\n### First phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe first phase of integration theory focused on explaining the integration process itself. Theorists such as Ernst Haas and Leon Lindberg developed the concept of neofunctionalism, which posited that integration would occur through a gradual expansion of cooperation in functional areas.\n\n### Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of integration theory shifted the focus to analyzing governance and the role of institutions in promoting integration. Theorists such as Andrew Moravcsik and Simon Hix developed the concept of liberal intergovernmentalism, which emphasized the importance of national interests and the role of governments in shaping integration.\n\n### Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of integration theory focused on constructing the EU as a distinct entity. Theorists such as Jürgen Habermas and Ulrich Beck emphasized the importance of creating a European identity and promoting democratic participation in the integration process.\n\n**Citizens' organisations calling for further integration**\n\nSeveral citizens' organisations have emerged to promote further European integration. These organisations, such as the European Movement International and the Union of European Federalists, advocate for a more unified and federal Europe.\n\n**Overlap of membership in various agreements**\n\nMany European countries participate in multiple agreements and organisations, creating an overlap of membership.\n\n### Common membership of member states of the European Union\n\nMost EU member states participate in other regional organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the European Free Trade Association.\n\n### Most integrated countries\n\nCountries such as Germany, France, and the Netherlands are often considered the most integrated, participating in multiple agreements and organisations.\n\n**Geographic scope**\n\nEuropean integration has expanded beyond the geographic boundaries of Europe, with various regions and countries participating in integration agreements.\n\n### Beyond geographic Europe\n\nCountries such as Turkey and Israel participate in European integration agreements, despite being geographically located outside of Europe.\n\n### Limited to regions within geographic Europe\n\nSeveral regions within geographic Europe have their own integration agreements, such as the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region.\n\n#### Nordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, participate in the Nordic Council and the Nordic Cooperation.\n\n#### Baltic Sea region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region, including countries such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, participate in the Baltic Sea States Council.\n\n#### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight, including the Nordic countries and the Baltic states, participate in a regional cooperation framework.\n\n#### Low Countries region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, participate in the Benelux Union.\n\n#### Black Sea region\n\nThe Black Sea region, including countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey, participate in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\n\n#### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland participate in the British-Irish Council.\n\n#### Central Europe\n\nCentral European countries, including Austria, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, participate in the Visegrád Group.\n\n#### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern European

participate in the Danube Region Strategy.\n\n#### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans region, including countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia, participate in the Regional Cooperation Council.\n\n**Council of Europe**\n\nThe Council of Europe is a regional organisation that promotes human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Europe.\n\n**European Political Community**\n\nThe European Political Community is a proposed framework for European integration, focusing on political cooperation and decision-making.\n\n**Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe**\n\nThe

Commissioned in 1983 as Slava, the ship was renamed Moskva in 1995 and became the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Throughout its service, Moskva played a significant role in various military operations, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n# History\n\n## As Slava\n\nSlava was laid down on November 24, 1976, at the 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv, Ukrainian SSR. The ship was designed to be a multi-purpose cruiser, capable of performing a variety of tasks, including anti-surface warfare, anti-air warfare, and strike operations. Slava was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on January 30, 1983.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Slava participated in several naval exercises and deployments, including a visit to the Mediterranean Sea in 1985. The ship also underwent several upgrades and modernizations, including the installation of new radar and electronic warfare systems.\n\n## As Moskva\n\nIn 1995, Slava was renamed Moskva, in honor of the Russian capital city. The name change was part of a broader effort to rebrand the Russian Navy and emphasize its connection to Russian history and culture.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Moskva continued to serve as a flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The ship participated in several international naval exercises and deployments, including a visit to the Indian Ocean in 2005.\n\nIn 2008, Moskva played a key role in the Russian-Georgian War, serving as a flagship of the Russian naval task force that blockaded the Georgian port of Poti.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, Moskva played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ship was part of a Russian naval task force that blockaded the Ukrainian port city of Odessa.\n\n### Snake Island campaign\n\nIn February 2022, Moskva was involved in the Snake Island campaign, a Russian operation to capture the strategic Snake Island in the Black Sea. The ship provided gunfire support to Russian troops as they landed on the island.\n\n### Sinking\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Moskva sank in the Black Sea, reportedly after being struck by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. The Russian Ministry of Defense confirmed that the ship had sunk, but claimed that it had been due to a fire on board. The Ukrainian military claimed responsibility for the sinking, stating that it had hit the ship with Neptune anti-ship missiles.\n\nThe sinking of Moskva was a significant blow to the Russian Navy and a major embarrassment for the Russian military. The incident marked one of the largest losses of a warship in recent history and highlighted the vulnerabilities of modern naval vessels to anti-ship missiles.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Russian cruiser Moskva was a significant vessel in the Russian Navy, serving as a flagship of the Black Sea Fleet for over two decades. Throughout its service, the ship played a key role in various military operations, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n# References\n\n[Insert references]\n\n# External links\n\n[Insert external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has resulted in significant violence, displacement, and humanitarian concerns, with various foreign actors involved in the crisis.\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has its roots in the War in Darfur, which began in 2003. The war was sparked by a rebellion by non-Arab groups in Darfur against the Sudanese government, led by Omar al-Bashir. The conflict resulted in significant human rights abuses, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 2013, a former Janjaweed militia leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, formed the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that would eventually become a key player in the 2023 conflict. The RSF was initially formed to fight against rebel groups in Darfur, but it eventually became a powerful force within the Sudanese military.\n\n## Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the ousting of Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan for nearly three decades. The Transitional Military Council (TMC), led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, took power, and a transitional government was established.\n\nHowever, the transition was marked by controversy and power struggles between the military and civilian leaders. The Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), a coalition of civilian groups, demanded a greater role in the transition process, leading to tensions with the military.\n\n## Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) is a rebel group that originated in the Nuba Mountains. The group was formed in 2011, after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The SPLM-N demanded greater autonomy for the Nuba Mountains and other regions in Sudan.\n\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) is another rebel group that was formed in 2001. The group was initially based in Darfur but eventually expanded to other regions in Sudan. The SLM demanded greater representation and rights for marginalized groups in Sudan.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 conflict, tensions between the RSF and the SAF increased. The RSF, led by Hemedti, demanded greater recognition and power within the Sudanese military, while the SAF, led by al-Burhan, resisted these demands.\n\nIn April 2023, a series of clashes broke out between the RSF and the SAF in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. The clashes marked the beginning of the 2023 civil war.\n\n# Course of the war\n\n## April–May 2023\n\n### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe Battle of Khartoum was a series of clashes between the RSF and the SAF in April and May 2023. The battle was marked by significant violence, with both sides using heavy artillery and air power.\n\nThe RSF, led by Hemedti, initially gained the upper hand, capturing key military installations and government buildings. However, the SAF eventually regrouped and launched a counterattack, pushing the RSF back.\n\n### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nIn May 2023, a cease-fire agreement was brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Treaty of Jeddah called for a temporary cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a joint military council to oversee the transition process.\n\nHowever, the treaty was short-lived, and fighting resumed in June 2023.\n\n## June–September 2023\n\n### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nFighting continued in Khartoum throughout June and July 2023. The RSF and the SAF clashed in various neighborhoods, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\n### Diplomatic efforts\n\nIn July 2023, the African Union and the United Nations launched a joint diplomatic effort to broker a peace deal. The effort was led by the African Union's special envoy, Mohamed El Hacen Lebatt, and the United Nations' special representative, Volker Perthes.\n\nHowever, the diplomatic effort was hindered by the ongoing fighting and the lack of trust between the parties.\n\n### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn August 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, joined the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SPLM-N demanded greater autonomy for the Nuba Mountains and other regions in Sudan.\n\n### Darfur front\n\nFighting also broke out in Darfur, where the RSF clashed with the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM). The SLM demanded greater representation and rights for marginalized groups in Sudan.\n\n## October–December 2023\n\n### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF collapsed in Darfur, allowing the RSF and the SLM to gain control of key towns and cities.\n\n### Peace negotiations stall\n\nPeace negotiations between the RSF and the SAF stalled in October 2023, after the RSF refused to attend talks in Jeddah.\n\n### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn November 2023, the RSF crossed the Nile River, capturing key towns and cities in the Gezira region.\n\n## January–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, Hemedti traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, where he met with senior officials to discuss the conflict.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nFighting continued in Kordofan and Gezira, with the RSF and the SAF clashing in various towns and cities.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn February 2024, the SAF gained control of Omdurman, a key city in the Khartoum state.\n\n## April 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nFighting continues in Darfur, with the RSF and the SLM clashing in various towns and cities.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nFighting also continues in Kordofan, with the RSF and the SAF clashing in various towns and cities.\n\n### Fighting along the Nile\n\nFighting has broken out along the Ni", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sudanese_civil_war_(2023–present)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n##Political transition\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n##Prelude\n#Course of the war\n##April–May 2023\n###Battle of Khartoum\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n##June–September 2023\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n###Diplomatic efforts\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n###Darfur front\n##October–December 2023\n###SAF collapse in Darfur\n###Peace negotiations stall\n###RSF Crossing of the Nile\n##January–April 2024\n###Hemedti travels abroad\n###Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n###SAF gains in Omdurman\n##April 2024–present\n###Fighting in Darfur\n###Fighting in Kordofan\n###Fighting along the Nile\n###SAF offensives\n#Casualties\n##Darfur\n##Sexual violence\n##Casualties among humanitarian workers\n##Attacks on journalists\n##Foreign casualties\n##Notable deaths\n#Foreign involvement\n##Egypt\n###Egyptian POWs\n##United Arab Emirates\n##Russia\n###Wagner Group\n##Iran\n##Other foreign actors\n###Chad\n###Kenya\n###Libyan National Army\n###Ukraine\n###United Kingdom\n##Evacuation of foreign nationals\n##Sanctions\n###United States\n###Other countries\n#Humanitarian impact\n##Refugees\n#Economic impact\n#War crimes investigations\n#Disinformation\n##Examples\n##Responses\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

I. Suchianu\n\nDimitrie I. Suchianu was a Romanian literary critic, essayist, and journalist, known for his contributions to the country's interwar cultural scene. Born in 1896, Suchianu spent most of his life engaged in the intellectual and literary debates of his time, leaving behind a rich legacy of writings that continue to be studied and appreciated by scholars today.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life and debut\n\nBorn on February 10, 1896, in Iași, Romania, Dimitrie I. Suchianu came from a family of modest means. His early life was marked by a strong passion for literature and learning, which led him to pursue a career in writing. Suchianu's debut as a critic and essayist took place in the 1920s, when he began publishing his work in various literary magazines and journals. His early writings were influenced by the Symbolist movement, which was then gaining popularity in Romania.\n\n##Interwar culture critic\n\nDuring the interwar period, Suchianu became a prominent figure in Romanian literary circles. He was known for his incisive critiques and essays, which tackled a wide range of topics, from literature and art to philosophy and politics. Suchianu's writing style was characterized by its clarity, wit, and intellectual rigor, earning him the respect and admiration of his peers. He was a frequent contributor to major literary magazines, such as Viața Românească and Revista Fundaților Regale, where he engaged in lively debates with other prominent intellectuals of the time.\n\nSuchianu's criticism was not limited to literature; he also wrote extensively on art, music, and theater. His essays on these subjects showcased his broad cultural interests and his ability to engage with a wide range of artistic expressions. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Suchianu's reputation as a leading cultural critic continued to grow, and he became a sought-after voice in Romanian intellectual circles.\n\n##Under fascism\n\nThe rise of fascist ideology in Romania during the 1930s had a profound impact on the country's intellectual landscape. Many writers and artists were forced to adapt to the new political reality, and some even became vocal supporters of the fascist regime. Suchianu, however, maintained a critical distance from the regime, and his writings continued to reflect his commitment to intellectual freedom and artistic independence.\n\nAlthough Suchianu's work was not overtly political, his critiques of fascist ideology and his defense of liberal values earned him the suspicion of the authorities. During this period, he faced censorship and even persecution, but he continued to write and publish his work, often using coded language to convey his dissenting views.\n\n##1944 coup and communization\n\nThe August 1944 coup, which saw the overthrow of the fascist regime and the establishment of a communist government, marked a significant turning point in Suchianu's life. Initially, he was optimistic about the prospect of a more democratic and egalitarian society, and he saw the communist revolution as an opportunity for renewal and reconstruction.\n\nHowever, as the new regime began to consolidate its power, Suchianu grew increasingly disillusioned with the rigid ideological controls and the suppression of intellectual freedom. His writings from this period reflect his growing unease with the communist regime and his concern about the erosion of artistic and intellectual autonomy.\n\n##Old age and death\n\nIn his later years, Suchianu's health began to decline, and he became increasingly reclusive. Despite his physical limitations, he continued to write and publish his work, albeit at a slower pace. Suchianu's final years were marked by a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, as he looked back on a lifetime of literary and intellectual pursuits.\n\nDimitrie I. Suchianu passed away on October 23, 1985, at the age of 89, leaving behind a rich legacy of writings that continue to be studied and appreciated by scholars today.\n\n#Legacy\n\nSuchianu's contributions to Romanian literature and culture are immeasurable. His critiques and essays provide a unique window into the intellectual and artistic debates of the interwar period, and his commitment to intellectual freedom and artistic independence continues to inspire new generations of writers and scholars.\n\nThroughout his life, Suchianu was a tireless advocate for the importance of literature and art in shaping the human experience. His writings reflect his deep passion for learning and his boundless curiosity about the world around him. As a cultural critic, essayist, and journalist, Suchianu left an indelible mark on Romanian intellectual history, and his legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars today.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of D. I. Suchianu's life and work, drawing on a range of primary and secondary sources. Further research is needed to fully explore the complexities of Suchianu's thought and the broader cultural context in which he wrote.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Chase, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1804 on charges of \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior while presiding over several high-profile cases. The subsequent trial in the Senate ultimately resulted in Chase's acquittal, but the proceedings had far-reaching implications for the balance of power between the judicial and legislative branches of government.\n\nBackground\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American politics and law, having served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a member of the United States Senate. In 1796, he was appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Washington. Chase was known for his strong Federalist views and his outspoken criticism of the Democratic-Republican Party, which had gained power in the early 19th century.\n\nChase's judicial conduct became increasingly controversial, particularly in cases involving Democratic-Republican defendants. In 1800, he presided over the treason trial of John Fries, a Democratic-Republican leader who had led a tax protest in Pennsylvania. Chase's handling of the trial was widely criticized, with many accusing him of bias and attempting to intimidate the jury. Similar allegations arose in other cases, including the trial of James Callender, a Democratic-Republican journalist who had been charged with sedition.\n\nImpeachment in the House of Representatives\n\nVote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nIn response to Chase's increasingly contentious behavior, the House of Representatives voted on March 12, 1804, to launch an impeachment inquiry. The resolution, introduced by Representative John Randolph of Virginia, authorized a committee to investigate Chase's conduct and report back to the House.\n\nEarly inquiry developments\n\nThe committee, composed of seven representatives, began its inquiry in April 1804. The committee collected testimony from various witnesses, including lawyers, judges, and politicians who had interacted with Chase during his time on the bench. The committee's report, submitted to the House in October 1804, concluded that Chase had engaged in \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior, and recommended that he be impeached.\n\nAdoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn October 31, 1804, the House voted to adopt a resolution impeaching Chase on eight articles of impeachment. The articles alleged that Chase had:\n\n### Article I\nFailed to maintain the dignity and impartiality of the court in the trial of John Fries\n\n### Article II\nUsed intemperate language and attempted to intimidate the jury in the trial of John Fries\n\n### Article III\nConducted the trial of James Callender in a manner that was \"partial, arbitrary, and unjust\"\n\n### Article IV\nRefused to allow Callender to present evidence in his own defense\n\n### Article V\nEngaged in \"highly indecent and unbecoming\" behavior in the presence of the court\n\n### Article VI\nFailed to report the misconduct of a fellow judge to the proper authorities\n\n### Article VII\nUsed his position to influence the outcome of a case in which he had a personal interest\n\n### Article VIII\nEngaged in \"highly arbitrary and unjust\" behavior in the trial of a Democratic-Republican defendant\n\nVote overview\n\nThe vote on the impeachment resolution was largely along party lines, with 73 Democratic-Republicans voting in favor and 32 Federalists opposing. The resolution was adopted, and the case was sent to the Senate for trial.\n\nAppointment of House managers\n\nThe House appointed a committee of seven managers to prosecute the case against Chase in the Senate. The managers, led by Representative John Randolph, were tasked with presenting the evidence and arguing the case for impeachment.\n\nSenate trial\n\nOfficers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial began on February 4, 1805, with Vice President George Clinton presiding as president of the Senate. The trial was conducted according to a set of rules adopted by the Senate, which provided for the presentation of evidence and arguments by both the prosecution and the defense.\n\nRules of the trial\n\nThe rules of the trial required that the prosecution present its case first, followed by the defense. The trial was conducted in a formal and dignified manner, with all participants required to address the chair and refrain from personal attacks or inflammatory language.\n\nStart of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began with the reading of the articles of impeachment and the presentation of the prosecution's case. The prosecution presented a series of witnesses, including lawyers and politicians who had interacted with Chase during his time on the bench.\n\nDecoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was specially decorated for the trial, with the Senate's usual business suspended for the duration of the proceedings. The chamber was arranged to accommodate the large number of spectators and participants, with the prosecution and defense seated at opposite tables.\n\nPleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase of the trial involved the presentation of the prosecution's case and the defense's response. The prosecution presented its evidence and arguments, followed by the defense's rebuttal.\n\nArgument phase\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution's presentation was led by Representative John Randolph, who argued that Chase's behavior was a clear abuse of power and a threat to the independence of the judiciary. Randolph presented a series of witnesses, including lawyers and politicians who had interacted with Chase during his time on the bench.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense's presentation was led by Chase's counsel, who argued that the charges against him were politically motivated and without merit. The defense presented a series of witnesses, including judges and politicians who had worked with Chase, and argued that he had acted in good faith and within his authority as a judge.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe argument phase concluded with closing remarks from both the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution argued that Chase's behavior was a clear abuse of power and a threat to the independence of the judiciary, while the defense argued that the charges against him were politically motivated and without merit.\n\nVerdict\n\nThe Senate voted on the articles of impeachment on March 1, 1805. Chase was acquitted on all eight articles, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction. The vote was largely along party lines, with Democratic-Republicans voting for conviction and Federalists opposing.\n\nAftermath\n\nImmediate aftermath\n\nThe acquittal of Samuel Chase marked a significant turning point in the history of the United States, as it established the principle that judges could not be removed from office for political reasons. The trial also had significant implications for the balance of power between the judicial and legislative branches of government.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase is widely regarded as one of the most significant events in the history of the United States, marking a turning point in the development of the country's system of government. The trial established the principle that judges could not be removed from office for political reasons, and it had significant implications for the balance of power between the judicial and legislative branches of government.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Since its completion in 1941, the monument has been featured in numerous works of popular culture, including films, television shows, music, and literature. This widespread depiction is a testament to the enduring significance of Mount Rushmore as a cultural touchstone.\n\n# Reasons for Popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity in popular culture can be attributed to several factors. One reason is its unique and striking appearance, which makes it instantly recognizable. The monument's massive scale and intricate details have captivated audiences, inspiring many artists and writers to incorporate it into their work. Additionally, Mount Rushmore's association with American history and democracy has made it a powerful symbol of national identity, evoking feelings of patriotism and nostalgia. The monument's remote location in the Black Hills has also contributed to its mystique, creating an air of mystery and intrigue that has sparked the imagination of many creatives.\n\n# Common Themes\n\nMany depictions of Mount Rushmore in popular culture share common themes and motifs. Two of the most prevalent themes are destruction and alteration, which often serve as metaphors for social commentary and critique.\n\n## Destruction\n\nThe destruction of Mount Rushmore is a common theme in popular culture, often used to symbolize the destruction of American values or the collapse of society. In films like \"Team America: World Police\" and \"Mars Attacks!\", the monument is destroyed in grand, over-the-top fashion, serving as a plot device to advance the story. This trope has also been used in literature, such as in the novel \"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy, where the destruction of Mount Rushmore serves as a symbol of the apocalypse.\n\n## Alterations and Additions to the Faces\n\nAnother common theme is the alteration or addition of faces to the monument. This can be seen in films like \"Superman II\" and \"Mars Attacks!\", where the faces of the presidents are changed or augmented in some way. This trope has also been used in advertising, such as in a 2011 commercial for the video game \"Assassin's Creed: Revelations\", where the faces of the presidents are replaced with those of the game's characters.\n\n# Imitations of the Style\n\nThe style of Mount Rushmore has been imitated in numerous works of art and architecture. One notable example is the Crazy Horse Memorial, also located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. This massive sculpture, still under construction, depicts the face of the Native American leader Crazy Horse and is intended to rival Mount Rushmore in scale and grandeur.\n\n# Major Portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and other works of popular culture. One of the most iconic depictions is in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"North by Northwest\".\n\n## In North by Northwest\n\nIn \"North by Northwest\", Mount Rushmore plays a pivotal role in the film's plot. The protagonist, Roger Thornhill, is chased by spies and eventually ends up at the monument, where he is pursued by the villainous Phillip Vandamm. The film's climax features a memorable chase scene on the face of the monument, where Thornhill and Vandamm engage in a fierce battle. This iconic scene has become one of the most famous moments in movie history, cementing Mount Rushmore's place in popular culture.\n\n# In Music\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in music, often as a metaphor for American values or national identity. One notable example is the song \"America the Beautiful\" by Ray Charles, which features lyrics that reference the monument. Another example is the song \"Mount Rushmore\" by the band I See Stars, which uses the monument as a symbol of American excess and decadence.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of cultural references to Mount Rushmore\n* Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n* Crazy Horse Memorial\n* American cultural icons", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Situated on the Ottawa River, the village has a rich and diverse history dating back to the early 19th century. From its humble beginnings as a mill town to its current status as a popular residential area, Britannia Village has undergone significant transformations over the years.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 by Philemon Wright, an American-born entrepreneur who established a sawmill and gristmill on the Ottawa River. The village quickly grew into a thriving mill town, with numerous other industries, including textile and lumber mills, setting up operations in the area. The village's strategic location on the Ottawa River made it an ideal place for trade and commerce, and it soon became a major hub for the export of lumber and other goods.\n\n### Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, Britannia Village underwent a significant transformation, as it began to attract wealthy Ottawa residents who were looking for a summer retreat from the city. The village's picturesque location on the Ottawa River, combined with its proximity to Ottawa, made it an ideal spot for summer cottages. During this period, many large, ornate summer homes were built in the village, and it became a popular destination for boating, fishing, and other summer activities.\n\n#### Engineering feats\n\nOne of the most notable engineering feats in Britannia Village during this period was the construction of the Britannia Bay Bridge, which spanned the Ottawa River and connected the village to the Ontario mainland. The bridge was completed in 1887 and was a major engineering achievement at the time, featuring a unique \"swing span\" design that allowed it to be opened to permit boat traffic.\n\n#### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nAnother popular attraction in Britannia Village during this period was the Britannia Amusement Park, which was established in the early 20th century. The park featured a range of rides and attractions, including a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, and a dance hall. It was a popular destination for families and young people from Ottawa and surrounding areas.\n\n### Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nIn the post-war period, Britannia Village underwent another significant transformation, as it became a rural commuter town for people working in Ottawa. The construction of the Queensway highway in the 1960s made it easier for people to commute to Ottawa, and the village began to attract families who were looking for a more rural lifestyle. During this period, many new homes were built in the village, and it began to take on a more suburban character.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone a significant revitalization, as the City of Ottawa has invested in infrastructure and amenities in the area. The village has become a popular destination for families and young professionals who are looking for a unique and historic community with easy access to Ottawa.\n\n#### Flood proofing\n\nOne of the major initiatives in Britannia Village in recent years has been the implementation of flood-proofing measures, following severe flooding in the area in 2017. The City of Ottawa has invested in a range of measures, including the construction of flood walls and the upgrading of stormwater infrastructure.\n\n#### Gentrification\n\nThe revitalization of Britannia Village has also led to concerns about gentrification, as new residents and businesses have moved into the area. While some have welcomed the new investment and activity in the village, others have expressed concerns about the impact on long-time residents and the community's character.\n\nHeritage buildings and architectural style\n------------------------------------------\n\nBritannia Village is home to many historic buildings, including several that have been designated as heritage properties by the City of Ottawa.\n\n### Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSome of the notable heritage buildings in Britannia Village include:\n\n* 273 Britannia Road: This historic home was built in the late 19th century and features a unique blend of Victorian and Edwardian architectural styles.\n* 321 Britannia Road: This home was built in the early 20th century and is a prime example of the Arts and Crafts style that was popular in the village during this period.\n* 401 Britannia Road: This historic home was built in the late 19th century and features a number of unique architectural details, including a wraparound porch and a turret.\n\n### Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nWhile many of the historic homes in Britannia Village have been preserved and restored, the village is also home to many modern residences that incorporate heritage attributes. These homes often feature traditional materials and design elements, such as brick and stone exteriors, wooden shutters, and decorative trim.\n\nCharacter\n----------\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and historic community that is characterized by its picturesque location on the Ottawa River, its rich history, and its blend of old and new architecture. The village has a strong sense of community, with many residents who are actively involved in local organizations and initiatives. It is a popular destination for families and young professionals who are looking for a unique and historic community with easy access to Ottawa.\n\nNotables in the community\n-------------------------\n\nBritannia Village has been home to a number of notable residents over the years, including:\n\n* Philemon Wright: The founder of Britannia Village, Wright was a prominent entrepreneur and businessman who played a major role in the development of the village.\n* George Dunlop: A prominent Ottawa businessman and politician, Dunlop was a long-time resident of Britannia Village and served as a member of the Ottawa City Council.\n* Elizabeth Hay: A Canadian author and journalist, Hay has lived in Britannia Village for many years and has written extensively about the community and its history.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on information available up to 2023 and may not reflect subsequent developments.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n--------\n\n* City of Ottawa.

It emphasized the importance of law, statecraft, and the power of the ruler. The core idea of Legalism was to create a strong and efficient state through the strict enforcement of laws and punishments. This philosophy had a significant impact on Chinese history, particularly during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), when it was implemented as the official state ideology.\n\nRetrospective current\n--------------------\n\nThe term \"Legalism\" was not used during the Warring States period. Instead, it was coined by later historians to describe a distinct philosophical school that emerged during that time. The retrospective current refers to the way that later thinkers and historians looked back on the ideas and events of the Warring States period and categorized them into distinct philosophical schools.\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nThe chapter \"Ding fa\" from the Zhuangzi, a foundational text of Daoism, contains a critique of the Legalist philosophy. The chapter argues that the Legalist emphasis on law and punishment is misguided, as it neglects the importance of morality and individual freedom. This critique reflects the intellectual debates and tensions between different philosophical schools during the Warring States period.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Confucianism became the official state ideology, and the Legalist philosophy was relegated to a secondary status. However, the Imperial Confucian category of \"Fa jia\" or \"School of Law\" was used to describe the Legalist philosophy, reflecting the ongoing influence of Legalist ideas on Chinese thought.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n-------------------\n\nOne of the key features of Legalist philosophy was its emphasis on military mobilization and the creation of a strong and efficient state. Legalist thinkers argued that a strong state was necessary for the protection of its citizens and the maintenance of social order. This emphasis on military power and statecraft was reflected in the development of new technologies and tactics during the Warring States period.\n\nSima Qian\n----------\n\nSima Qian (145–86 BCE) was a prominent historian and thinker who wrote extensively on the history of the Warring States period. His work, the Records of the Grand Historian, contains valuable information on the development of Legalist philosophy and its impact on Chinese history.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n----------------------\n\nThe Huang-Lao school of thought, which emerged during the Warring States period, shared some similarities with Legalist philosophy. Both schools emphasized the importance of statecraft and the power of the ruler. However, the Huang-Lao school also incorporated elements of Daoist philosophy, which emphasized the importance of individual freedom and morality.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao school was influenced by the ideas of Laozi, the founder of Daoism. Laozi's emphasis on the importance of individual freedom and morality was reflected in the Huang-Lao school's critique of the Legalist emphasis on law and punishment.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao, a prominent Legalist thinker, was also influenced by the ideas of Zhuangzi, a foundational text of Daoism. Shen Dao's emphasis on the importance of statecraft and the power of the ruler was reflected in the Zhuangzi's critique of the Legalist philosophy.\n\nChanging with the times\n----------------------\n\nA.C. Graham, a prominent sinologist, argued that the Legalist philosophy was characterized by a willingness to adapt and change with the times. This flexibility was reflected in the development of new technologies and tactics during the Warring States period.\n\nConfucian influences\n-------------------\n\nDespite the tensions between Confucianism and Legalism, there were also significant influences and borrowings between the two philosophical schools. Confucian thinkers incorporated elements of Legalist philosophy into their own thought, particularly in the areas of statecraft and morality.\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a prominent Legalist thinker, was also influenced by Confucian ideas. Shen Dao's emphasis on the importance of statecraft and the power of the ruler was reflected in the Confucian emphasis on the importance of morality and individual freedom.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n-------------------\n\nThe concepts of xing-ming (forms and names) and wu wei (non-action) were central to the Legalist philosophy. Xing-ming referred to the way in which things were categorized and named, while wu wei referred to the idea of non-action or effortless action. These concepts were used to describe the way in which the ruler should govern the state.\n\nHan Feizi\n----------\n\nHan Feizi (280–233 BCE) was a prominent Legalist thinker who wrote extensively on the philosophy of law and statecraft. His work, the Han Feizi, contains valuable information on the development of Legalist philosophy and its impact on Chinese history.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nThe Daodejing, a foundational text of Daoism, contains a critique of the Legalist philosophy. The chapter argues that the Legalist emphasis on law and punishment is misguided, as it neglects the importance of morality and individual freedom.\n\nSchool of names\n----------------\n\nThe School of Names was a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period. The School of Names was characterized by a focus on the importance of language and naming, and was influenced by the Legalist emphasis on xing-ming (forms and names).\n\nEradicating punishments\n----------------------\n\nThe concept of eradicating punishments was central to the Legalist philosophy. Legalist thinkers argued that punishments should be severe and swift, in order to maintain social order and prevent crime.\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi's work contains valuable information on the concept of eradicating punishments. Han Feizi argued that punishments should be tailored to the specific crime, and that the ruler should be willing to use severe punishments in order to maintain social order.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe concept of justice was also central to the Legalist philosophy. Legalist thinkers argued that justice should be based on the law, rather than on personal opinion or morality. This emphasis on justice was reflected in the development of new technologies and tactics during the Warring States period.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n---------------------------\n\nThe Legalist mythos contains a number of sources that provide valuable information on the development of Legalist philosophy and its impact on Chinese history.\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi was a prominent historian and thinker who wrote extensively on the history of the Warring States period. His work contains valuable information on the development of Legalist philosophy and its impact on Chinese history.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 BCE)\n\nLiu An was a prominent historian and thinker who wrote extensively on the history of the Warring States period. His work contains valuable information on the development of Legalist philosophy and its impact on Chinese history.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School was a philosophical school that emerged during the Warring States period. The Fa School was characterized by a focus on the importance of law and statecraft, and was influenced by the Legalist emphasis on xing-ming (forms and names) and wu wei (non-action).\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[Insert references]\n\nSources\n-------\n\n[Insert sources]\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n[Insert external links]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" following this outline:\n\n#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

The trophy is adorned with engravings of the Herder family crest and the names of past champions. The trophy is considered a symbol of excellence in Newfoundland and Labrador hockey, with many players and teams striving to win the coveted award.\n\n# Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder family donated the trophy in 1935, they placed several conditions on the award. These conditions were designed to ensure the integrity and competitiveness of the championship series.\n\n## Exceptions to the original conditions\n\nOver the years, several exceptions have been made to the original conditions placed by the trophy donor.\n\n### Condition #2\n\nCondition #2 stated that the championship series would be played between the top two teams in the province.

However, in 1965, the NAHA changed the format to a best-of-seven game series.\n\n### Condition #7\n\nCondition #7 stated that the championship series would be played in the hometown of the participating teams. However, in 1980, the NAHA introduced a neutral-site format, where the championship series was played at a neutral location.\n\n# Series format\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy championship series is currently played between the top two teams in the province, with the series determined by a best-of-seven game format. The series is typically played over a period of two weeks, with the winner being crowned the champion of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n## Series format history\n\nThe series format has undergone several changes over the years.

She is the first African American woman to serve on the Court and the sixth woman to serve on the Court overall. Prior to her elevation to the Supreme Court, Jackson served as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 2021 to 2022.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C. She grew up in Miami, Florida, and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School, where she was a National Merit Scholar and was admitted to Harvard University. At Harvard, Jackson studied government and graduated magna cum laude in 1992. She then attended Harvard Law School, where she was a supervising editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated cum laude in 1996.\n\n#Early career\n\nAfter law school, Jackson clerked for Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997, and then for Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998. She then worked as an associate at the law firm of Goodwin Procter in Boston from 1998 to 1999. In 1999, Jackson joined the United States Sentencing Commission as a staff attorney, where she worked on the development of sentencing guidelines for federal courts.\n\n#U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)\n\nIn 2010, Jackson was appointed as a commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission by President Barack Obama. During her tenure on the Commission, Jackson worked on the development of sentencing guidelines for federal courts, including guidelines for crimes related to child pornography and terrorism. She also worked on the Commission's efforts to reduce sentencing disparities and promote transparency in the sentencing process.\n\n#District Court (2013–2021)\n\nIn 2013, Jackson was nominated by President Obama to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2013 and served on the court until 2021. During her tenure on the District Court, Jackson presided over a number of high-profile cases, including a challenge to the Trump administration's travel ban and a lawsuit over the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program.\n\n##Selected rulings\n\nSome of Jackson's notable rulings on the District Court include:\n\n* In 2018, Jackson ruled that the Trump administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was unlawful, as it was based on a flawed legal analysis.\n* In 2019, Jackson ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was unlawful, as it was based on a flawed rationale.\n* In 2020, Jackson ruled that the Trump administration's decision to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan was unlawful, as it was based on a flawed analysis of the facts.\n\n#U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, Jackson was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 and served on the court until 2022. During her tenure on the Court of Appeals, Jackson heard a number of high-profile cases, including a challenge to the Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.\n\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 25, 2022, President Biden nominated Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer. Jackson's nomination was seen as historic, as she would be the first African American woman to serve on the Court. Her nomination was also seen as a key moment in the Biden administration's efforts to diversify the federal judiciary.\n\n#U.S. Supreme Court (2022–present)\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Jackson was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She is the first African American woman to serve on the Court and the sixth woman to serve on the Court overall. Jackson has already begun to make her mark on the Court, with her opinions and dissents in a number of high-profile cases.\n\n##Labor disputes\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Jackson has already weighed in on a number of labor disputes, including a challenge to the Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for large employers. In her opinion in the case, Jackson argued that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) had the authority to issue the mandate, as it was necessary to protect workers from a grave danger.\n\n##Affirmative action\n\nJackson has also weighed in on the issue of affirmative action, with her opinion in a challenge to the University of Texas's admissions policy. In her opinion, Jackson argued that the policy was constitutional, as it was narrowly tailored to achieve the university's compelling interest in diversity.\n\n##Judicial philosophy\n\nJackson's judicial philosophy is seen as pragmatic and centrist, with a focus on the facts and the law. She has said that she approaches each case with an open mind and a commitment to upholding the Constitution and the law. Jackson has also said that she believes in the importance of diversity and inclusion on the Court, and has pledged to work to promote those values in her opinions and decisions.\n\n#Personal life\n\nJackson is married to Dr. Patrick Jackson, a surgeon, and they have two daughters together. She is a member of the Harvard University Board of Overseers and has served on the board of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\n##Affiliations\n\nJackson is a member of a number of professional and civic organizations, including:\n\n* The American Bar Association\n* The National Bar Association\n* The Harvard Law Review\n* The United States District Court for the District of Columbia\n\n#Selected works\n\nSome of Jackson's notable works include:\n\n* \"Preventing and Punishing Public Corruption: A Comparative Analysis,\" 77 Fordham L.

While the Games were a celebration of athleticism and international unity, they were not without controversy. Several concerns and issues arose before, during, and after the Games, which are discussed in this article.\n\n# Criticism of host selection\n\nThe selection of Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics was met with criticism from various quarters. Human rights organizations and some governments expressed concerns about China's human rights record, particularly in the Xinjiang region, where millions of Uyghur Muslims have been detained in internment camps. Additionally, Beijing's lack of natural snowfall and its reliance on artificial snow-making facilities raised environmental concerns.\n\n# Organizing concerns and controversies\n\n## Cost and climate\n\nThe estimated cost of hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics was around $3.9 billion, which was significantly lower than the initial estimates of $6.5 billion. However, some critics argued that the costs would be higher due to the need for artificial snow-making facilities and the construction of new infrastructure. Climate change was also a concern, as the warmer temperatures in Beijing threatened to disrupt the snow sports events.\n\n## Promotional song\n\nThe promotional song for the 2022 Winter Olympics, titled \"Together for a Shared Future,\" was criticized for its lyrics, which some deemed too focused on Chinese nationalism and not enough on the Olympic spirit. The song's music video also featured footage of Chinese military personnel, which was seen as inappropriate by some.\n\n# Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, Australia, and India, announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing human rights concerns and other issues.\n\n## Background\n\nThe diplomatic boycotts were seen as a way for countries to express their disapproval of China's human rights record without directly affecting the athletes participating in the Games. The boycotts were also seen as a response to China's increasing assertiveness on the global stage.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to announce a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Biden administration cited human rights concerns, particularly in the Xinjiang region, as the reason for the boycott. American athletes were still allowed to participate in the Games, but no official government representatives were sent to Beijing.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia followed the United States in announcing a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Australian government cited human rights concerns and China's increasing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region as the reasons for the boycott.\n\n## India\n\nIndia also announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the presence of a Chinese military commander, who was involved in a border clash with Indian troops, as part of the Olympic torch relay team.\n\n## Calls for boycotts by other countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, were also urged to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics due to human rights concerns. However, these countries ultimately decided not to boycott the Games.\n\n## Chinese Government response\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the diplomatic boycotts by accusing the United States and other countries of \"politicizing\" the Olympics. China also claimed that the boycotts would not affect the success of the Games.\n\n## IOC response\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also responded to the diplomatic boycotts by stating that the Olympics were a celebration of athleticism and international unity, and that politics should be kept out of the Games. The IOC also emphasized that the participation of athletes from around the world was a testament to the Olympic spirit.\n\n# Athletes and team officials complaints\n\nSeveral athletes and team officials complained about the conditions in Beijing during the Games.\n\n## Quarantine facilities\n\nSome athletes and team officials complained about the quarantine facilities, which they deemed too restrictive and uncomfortable. The facilities were set up to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but some athletes felt that they were too harsh.\n\n## Food\n\nSome athletes also complained about the food options available in the Olympic Village, which they deemed too limited and unappetizing.\n\n## Weather conditions\n\nThe weather conditions in Beijing during the Games were also a concern for some athletes, particularly those participating in outdoor events. The cold temperatures and wind made it difficult for some athletes to perform at their best.\n\n# Team Russia\n\nTeam Russia was also at the center of controversy during the Games.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began just days before the start of the Games, was widely condemned by the international community. The IOC responded by banning the Russian flag and anthem from the Games, but allowing Russian athletes to compete under the Olympic flag.\n\n# Environmental and health issues\n\nSeveral environmental and health issues arose during the Games.\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Games, with several athletes and team officials testing positive for the virus. The IOC had to implement strict health protocols to prevent the spread of the virus, which included mask-wearing, social distancing, and regular testing.\n\n## Insufficient snowfall\n\nThe insufficient snowfall in Beijing was also a concern, particularly for the snow sports events. The IOC had to rely on artificial snow-making facilities to ensure that the events could take place.\n\n## Energy crisis\n\nAn energy crisis in China also affected the Games, with several power outages reported in the Olympic Village and surrounding areas.\n\n## Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n\nThe construction of new infrastructure for the Games, including a high-speed rail link, had a significant impact on the Songshan National Nature Reserve, which is home to several endangered species.\n\n# Human rights issues\n\nSeveral human rights issues arose during the Games.\n\n## Sportswashing\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were seen as an opportunity for China to engage in \"sportswashing,\" or using sports to improve its international image and distract from its human rights record.\n\n## Athlete safety\n\nThe safety of athletes was also a concern, particularly those from countries with strained relations with China. Some athletes reported being subjected to intimidation and harassment by Chinese officials.\n\n## Athletes' freedom of speech\n\nThe freedom of speech of athletes was also restricted during the Games, with several athletes being warned not to speak out on human rights issues or criticize the Chinese government.\n\n## Protests\n\nSeveral protests took place during the Games, including a protest by Tibetan activists who were calling for greater autonomy for Tibet.\n\n# Propaganda and information operations issues\n\nSeveral propaganda and information operations issues arose during the Games.\n\n## Propaganda and information operations\n\nThe Chinese government was accused of engaging in propaganda and information operations to promote a positive image of the Games and distract from human rights issues.\n\n## Censorship\n\nCensorship was also a concern, with several reports of negative news being censored during the Games.\n\n### Negative news censored during the games\n\nSeveral reports of negative news being censored during the Games emerged, including reports of protests and human rights abuses.\n\n### Alleged suspension of US athlete's Twitter account\n\nThe Twitter account of an American athlete was allegedly suspended after she criticized the Chinese government's human rights record.\n\n## Espionage directed at athletes\n\nSeveral reports emerged of espionage

Daas, was detained by Chinese officials after he reported on human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.\n\n# Olympic torch relay\n\nThe Olympic torch relay was also marred by controversy.\n\n# Hanbok row\n\nA row emerged over the wearing of hanbok, a traditional Korean dress, by Chinese athletes during the torch relay.\n\n# Accidents\n\nSeveral accidents took place during the Games, including a bus crash that injured several athletes.\n\n# Taiwan athlete outfit row\n\nA row emerged over the outfit worn by a Taiwanese athlete during the opening ceremony, which featured a design that was seen as pro-independence.\n\n# Participation of women\n\nThe participation of women in the Games was also a concern, particularly in sports where women's participation is limited.\n\n# Sporting

The island is part of the Lesser Antilles and is known for its striking natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and friendly inhabitants. With a population of approximately 179,000 people, Saint Lucia is a popular tourist destination and a rapidly developing economy.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe name \"Saint Lucia\" is derived from the name of Saint Lucy, a 4th-century martyr and the patron saint of the island. The name was given to the island by the French, who first colonized it in the 17th century.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak and Carib peoples, who migrated to the island from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. These indigenous peoples developed a complex society and culture, with their own language, customs, and traditions.\n\n### Early European period\n\nThe first European to sight the island was Christopher Columbus, who landed on the island in 1498. However, it was the French who established the first permanent settlement on the island in 1660. The French and British fought over control of the island for many years, with the British eventually gaining control in 1814.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia was a major producer of sugar, with many plantations established on the island. The economy of the island was heavily dependent on the sugar industry, which was supported by the labor of enslaved Africans. The transatlantic slave trade was abolished in 1807, but slavery itself was not abolished until 1834.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Saint Lucia began to develop a more diverse economy, with a growing focus on tourism and manufacturing. The island gained internal self-government in 1967 and became an independent nation on February 22, 1979.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nSince gaining independence, Saint Lucia has continued to develop its economy and improve the standard of living for its citizens.

The highest point on the island is Mount Gimie, which stands at 950 meters (3,117 feet) above sea level. The island is also home to many beaches, including the famous Reduit Beach and Anse Chastanet Beach.\n\nGovernment\n----------\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative divisions, known as quarters. These quarters are:\n\n* Anse-la-Raye\n* Canaries\n* Castries\n* Choiseul\n* Dennery\n* Gros Islet\n* Laborie\n* Micoud\n* Praslin\n* Soufrière\n* Vieux Fort\n\n### Law and crime\n\nThe legal system of Saint Lucia is based on British common law, with a supreme court and a court of appeal. The island has a relatively low crime rate, with most crimes being theft and burglary.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of American States. The island has diplomatic relations with many countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nEconomy\n--------\n\n### Tourism\n\nTourism is a major sector of the economy of Saint Lucia, with many visitors attracted to the island's natural beauty and cultural heritage. The island has many resorts and hotels, ranging from budget-friendly options to luxury resorts.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is another significant sector of the economy, with many crops being grown on the island, including bananas, mangoes, and coconuts.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nThe island has a well-developed infrastructure, with a major airport and a seaport. The island is also connected to the international telecommunications network, with many internet and telephone services available.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\n### Ethnic groups\n\nThe population of Saint Lucia is predominantly black, with many people of African descent. There are also smaller communities of people of European, Asian, and indigenous descent.\n\n### Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, but many people also speak Saint Lucian Creole, which is a French-based creole language.\n\n### Religion\n\nThe majority of the population of Saint Lucia is Roman Catholic, with many other Christian denominations also represented.

He was a prominent figure in the world of bookbinding during the 19th century, and his work continues to be celebrated and admired by collectors and enthusiasts today.\n\n# Early life and family\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse was born in 1826 in London, England. His early life and family background are not well-documented, but it is known that he was apprenticed to a bookbinder at a young age. Stonehouse's natural talent and dedication to his craft quickly became apparent, and he went on to establish himself as a skilled and respected bookbinder in his own right.\n\n# Career\n\nStonehouse's career as a bookbinder spanned several decades, during which he worked on a wide range of projects, from simple leather bindings to intricate and elaborate designs. He was particularly known for his work in the Cosway binding style, which involves the use of delicate watercolor paintings and intricate gold tooling.\n\n## Cosway bindings\n\nCosway bindings are a type of bookbinding that originated in the early 19th century. They are characterized by the use of delicate watercolor paintings, often of landscapes or floral motifs, which are painted directly onto the binding. The bindings are typically made of leather, and are adorned with intricate gold tooling and other decorative elements. Stonehouse was a master of the Cosway binding style, and his work in this area is still widely admired today.\n\n## The \"Great Omar\"\n\nOne of Stonehouse's most famous projects was the binding of a copy of Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, known as the \"Great Omar\". This binding is considered one of the greatest examples of Cosway binding, and features intricate watercolor paintings and gold tooling throughout. The binding took Stonehouse over 1,000 hours to complete, and is now housed in the British Library.\n\n## Charles Dickens\n\nStonehouse also worked on several projects related to the works of Charles Dickens. He bound a number of copies of Dickens' novels, including \"David Copperfield\" and \"Great Expectations\", and also created a number of presentation bindings for the author's own use. One of these bindings, a copy of \"A Christmas Carol\", features a delicate watercolor painting of a winter landscape on the cover, and is now housed in the Charles Dickens Museum.\n\n# Death and legacy\n\nJohn Harrison Stonehouse died in 1901, at the age of 75. He left behind a legacy of exquisite bookbindings, which continue to be celebrated and admired by collectors and enthusiasts today. His work in the Cosway binding style is particularly notable, and his bindings are highly prized by collectors for their beauty and craftsmanship.\n\n# Selected publications\n\n* \"The Art of Bookbinding\" (1885)\n* \"Cosway Bindings: A Study of the Art\" (1890)\n* \"The Bookbinder's Handbook\" (1895)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Harrison_Stonehouse\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and family\n#Career\n##Cosway bindings\n##The \"Great Omar\"\n##Charles Dickens\n#Death and legacy\n#Selected publications\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her death triggered a period of national mourning and a state funeral, which was attended by dignitaries and leaders from around the world.\n\n#Background\n\nElizabeth II was born on April 21, 1926, and ascended to the throne on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI. During her reign, she oversaw the decolonization of Africa and Asia, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the transformation of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations. She also played a key role in promoting British interests abroad and supporting the armed forces.\n\nIn her later years, Elizabeth II began to slow down, reducing her public appearances and passing on some of her duties to other members of the royal family. However, she remained committed to her role as monarch and continued to carry out her official duties until her death.\n\n#Death and National Mourning\n\n##Death and Announcement\n\nElizabeth II died on September 8, 2022, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, surrounded by her family. Her death was announced by Buckingham Palace at 8:32 pm local time, triggering a period of national mourning.\n\nThe news of her death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from around the world. Flags were flown at half-mast, and books of condolence were opened at embassies and consulates.\n\n##Scottish Events\n\nFollowing her death, Elizabeth II's body was taken to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, where it lay in rest for a day. On September 12, 2022, her coffin was transported to St. Giles' Cathedral, where a service of thanksgiving was held.\n\n##Lying-in-State\n\nOn September 14, 2022, Elizabeth II's coffin was flown to London, where it lay in state at Westminster Hall for four days. During this time, hundreds of thousands of people queued to pay their respects to the late monarch.\n\n###Queue\n\nThe queue to see Elizabeth II's coffin was one of the longest in British history, stretching for over 5 miles at its peak. The queue was managed by the Metropolitan Police and the London Borough of Southwark, with stewards and volunteers helping to keep the queue orderly and ensuring that people had access to food, water, and toilets.\n\n#State Funeral\n\n##Planning\n\nThe state funeral for Elizabeth II was planned by the Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk, and the Metropolitan Police. The funeral was the largest and most complex in British history, involving over 10,000 people and 5,000 police officers.\n\n##Procession to Westminster Abbey\n\nOn September 19, 2022, Elizabeth II's coffin was transported from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey, where the state funeral was held.

Ukrainian forces have also used drones to attack Russian Geran-2 launch sites and command centers.\n\n### Production in Russia\n\nThere are reports that Russia is producing the Geran-2 in significant quantities, using Iranian components and Russian-made electronic systems.

Known for its rich history, cultural attractions, and stunning natural beauty, Bridgeport is a vibrant and diverse city that offers something for everyone.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Colonial History\n\nThe area that is now Bridgeport was first inhabited by the Paugussett Native American tribe. In 1639, a group of English colonists from the New Haven Colony established a settlement on the west bank of the Pequonnock River, which they called \"Newfield.\" The settlement was later renamed \"Stratford,\" but the name was changed to Bridgeport in 1800.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Bridgeport was a key location for the Continental Army, with General George Washington visiting the city in 1779. The city's harbor was also an important location for the American privateering fleet, with many ships setting sail from Bridgeport to attack British vessels.\n\n### 19th Century\n\nDuring the 19th century, Bridgeport underwent rapid industrialization and growth, with the city becoming a major center for the production of firearms, ammunition, and other war-related materials. The city's harbor was also an important location for the import and export of goods, with many ships traveling to and from Bridgeport.\n\nIn 1848, the city was officially incorporated, with Frederick Hubbard becoming the first mayor. The city's population grew rapidly during the late 19th century, with many immigrants arriving from Europe to work in the city's factories and mills.\n\n### 20th Century\n\nDuring the 20th century, Bridgeport continued to grow and develop, with the city becoming a major center for industry and commerce. The city's harbor was also an important location for the U.S. military, with the city serving as a major embarkation point for troops during World War I and World War II.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Bridgeport underwent significant urban renewal efforts, with many of the city's old neighborhoods being demolished and replaced with new housing and commercial developments. However, this period also saw significant decline and disinvestment in the city, with many of its major industries leaving and its population declining.\n\n### 21st Century\n\nIn recent years, Bridgeport has undergone significant revitalization efforts, with the city investing heavily in new housing, commercial developments, and cultural attractions. The city's harbor has also been redeveloped, with many new shops, restaurants, and bars opening in the area.\n\nIn 2012, the city was named an \"All-America City\" by the National Civic League, recognizing its efforts to revitalize and redevelop its neighborhoods and downtown area.\n\n### Notable Speeches\n\nIn 1860, Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech in Bridgeport, in which he spoke about the importance of preserving the Union and ending slavery. The speech was delivered at the city's old City Hall, which has since been demolished.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy delivered a speech in Bridgeport, in which he spoke about the importance of space exploration and scientific research. The speech was delivered at the city's Klein Memorial Auditorium.\n\n### Timeline of Notable First and Inventions\n\n* 1802: The first commercial production of sewing machines begins in Bridgeport.\n* 1837: The first practical revolver is invented in Bridgeport by Samuel Colt.\n* 1867: The first elevator is installed in Bridgeport, at the city's old City Hall.\n* 1879: The first electric streetlights are installed in Bridgeport, making it one of the first cities in the world to have electric lighting.\n\nGeography\n---------\n\n### Neighborhoods\n\nBridgeport is divided into several neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and charm.

The storm formed in the southeastern Caribbean Sea and rapidly intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to several countries in the region.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Julia formed on October 7, 2022, in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, approximately 400 miles (640 km) east of the island of Grenada. At the time, the system was a tropical wave with disorganized thunderstorms and a weak circulation. However, the wave quickly developed a closed circulation and intensified into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on October 7.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the depression rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name Julia. As the storm moved westward across the Caribbean Sea, it encountered favorable conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. This allowed Julia to intensify into a hurricane by 12:00 UTC on October 9.\n\nJulia continued to strengthen, becoming a Category 3 hurricane by 00:00 UTC on October 10. At this point, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar (28.41 inHg). Julia's rapid intensification was fueled by the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea and the presence of a strong high-pressure system to its north.\n\n# Preparations and impact\n\n## South America\n\n### Venezuela\n\nAs Julia approached the coast of South America, the government of Venezuela declared a state of emergency in several states, including Sucre, Monagas, and Delta Amacuro.

He was the first President of Italy to be re-elected for a second term. Napolitano's long and distinguished career in Italian politics spanned over six decades, during which he played a significant role in shaping the country's history.\n\n#Early life\n\nGiorgio Napolitano was born on June 29, 1925, in Naples, Italy. His family was of modest means, and his father was a lawyer. Napolitano's early life was marked by the tumultuous events of World War II, which had a profound impact on his future.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##World War II and anti-fascist resistance\n\nDuring World War II, Napolitano joined the Italian resistance movement against the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. He was part of the liberal-socialist group, which later became the Italian Socialist Party. Napolitano's involvement in the resistance movement deepened his commitment to democratic values and social justice.\n\n##From post-war years to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956\n\nAfter the war, Napolitano became increasingly involved in politics, joining the Italian Socialist Party. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent figure in the party. In 1956, he was among the few Italian socialists who opposed the Soviet invasion of Hungary, which further solidified his commitment to democratic principles.\n\n#Leading member of the Italian Communist Party\n\n##From the 1960s to 1980s\n\nIn 1963, Napolitano joined the Italian Communist Party (PCI), which was then the largest communist party in Western Europe. He quickly became a leading figure in the party, known for his moderate and reformist views. Napolitano played a crucial role in shaping the PCI's policies, particularly in the areas of foreign policy and social welfare. During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a key figure in the party's efforts to modernize and democratize.\n\n#After the Italian Communist Party\n\n##President of the Chamber of Deputies\n\nIn 1992, Napolitano was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house of parliament. He held this position until 1994, during which time he played a key role in shaping the country's response to the Tangentopoli scandal, which led to the collapse of the First Republic.\n\n##Late 1990s and early 2000s\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Napolitano became increasingly involved in European politics. He was a strong supporter of European integration and played a key role in Italy's efforts to join the Eurozone. In 2001, he was appointed Minister of the Interior in the government of Silvio Berlusconi, a position he held until 2006.\n\n#President of Italy\n\n##First term (2006–2013)\n\n###Election\n\nIn 2006, Napolitano was elected President of Italy, succeeding Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. He was elected on the fourth round of voting, with the support of the centre-left coalition.\n\n###Prodi Cabinet\n\nNapolitano played a key role in appointing Romano Prodi as Prime Minister in 2006. He worked closely with Prodi to shape the country's economic and social policies. However, the Prodi government was short-lived, and Napolitano was faced with a series of political crises.\n\n###2008 political crisis\n\nIn 2008, the Prodi government collapsed, and Napolitano was forced to appoint a new Prime Minister. He chose Silvio Berlusconi, who formed a centre-right government.\n\n###Eluana Englaro incident\n\nIn 2009, Napolitano was involved in a high-profile controversy surrounding the case of Eluana Englaro, a woman who had been in a coma for 17 years. Napolitano refused to sign a decree that would have allowed Englaro's father to remove her life support, sparking a national debate about euthanasia.\n\n###2011 political crisis\n\nIn 2011, the Berlusconi government collapsed, and Napolitano was faced with another political crisis. He appointed Mario Monti as Prime Minister, who formed a technocratic government.\n\n##Second term (2013–2015)\n\n###Re-election\n\nIn 2013, Napolitano was re-elected President of Italy, becoming the first President to serve a second term. He was re-elected on the sixth round of voting, with the support of the centre-left coalition.\n\n###Letta Cabinet\n\nNapolitano played a key role in appointing Enrico Letta as Prime Minister in 2013. He worked closely with Letta to shape the country's economic and social policies.\n\n###Renzi Cabinet\n\nIn 2014, Letta resigned, and Napolitano appointed Matteo Renzi as Prime Minister. Renzi formed a centre-left government and implemented a series of reforms.\n\n##Resignation\n\nNapolitano resigned as President of Italy on January 14, 2015, citing his advanced age and declining health.\n\n##Later life\n\nAfter his resignation, Napolitano retired from politics and dedicated himself to writing and public speaking. He has written several books on politics and history and has been a vocal critic of populist and nationalist movements.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relations with the Catholic Church\n\nNapolitano has always maintained a complex relationship with the Catholic Church. While he is a self-described atheist, he has always respected the Church's role in Italian society. He has been a strong supporter of the Church's social teachings and has worked closely with Catholic organizations on issues such as poverty and migration.\n\n##Death and state funeral\n\nGiorgio Napolitano passed away on January 31, 2023, at the age of 97. He was given a state funeral, which was attended by dignitaries from across Italy and Europe.\n\n#Legacy\n\nGiorgio Napolitano's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a champion of democracy and social justice, who played a key role in shaping Italy's post-war history. He is also remembered as a strong supporter of European integration and a vocal critic of populist and nationalist movements.\n\n#Electoral history\n\n##First-past-the-post elections\n\n* 1953 Italian general election: elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Socialist Party\n* 1958 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Socialist Party\n* 1963 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Socialist Party\n* 1968 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party\n* 1972 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party\n* 1976 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party\n* 1979 Italian general election: re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Italian Communist Party\n\n##Presidential elections\n\n* 2006 Italian presidential election: elected President of Italy on the fourth round of voting\n* 2013 Italian presidential election: re-elected President of Italy on the sixth round of voting\n\n#Honours\n\n##National honours\n\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2006)\n* Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2015)\n\n##Foreign honours\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (United Kingdom, 2009)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle (Poland, 2012)\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Legion of Honour (France, 2012)\n\n#See also\n\n* Italian Communist Party\n* President of Italy\n* European integration\n* Populism\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Napolitano, Giorgio.
