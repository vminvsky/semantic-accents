It is one of the most widely spoken forms of Arabic, with over 40 million speakers worldwide. Levantine Arabic has a rich history, with a unique blend of cultural and linguistic influences that have shaped its development over the centuries.\n\n# Naming and classification\n\nLevantine Arabic is a member of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. It is classified as a dialect group within the Arabic language, which is the official language of many countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Levantine Arabic is closely related to other forms of Arabic, such as Egyptian Arabic and Iraqi Arabic, but has distinct features that set it apart.\n\n# Geographical distribution and varieties\n\n## Dialects\n\nLevantine Arabic has a number of dialects, each with its own unique features and variations. Some of the main dialects include:\n\n* Lebanese Arabic, spoken in Lebanon\n* Syrian Arabic, spoken in Syria\n* Jordanian Arabic, spoken in Jordan\n* Palestinian Arabic, spoken in Palestine\n* Israeli Arabic, spoken in Israel\n\nThese dialects can vary significantly from one another, with differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.\n\n## Ethnicity and religion\n\nLevantine Arabic is spoken by people of various ethnic and religious backgrounds, including Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, and Jews. While the majority of speakers are Muslim, there are also significant numbers of Christians and Druze.\n\n## Speakers by country\n\nHere is a rough estimate of the number of Levantine Arabic speakers by country:\n\n* Lebanon: 4 million\n* Syria: 15 million\n* Jordan: 6 million\n* Palestine: 2 million\n* Israel: 1.5 million\n\n# History\n\n## Pre-Islamic antiquity\n\nThe Levant has a long history of human habitation, dating back to the Neolithic period. The region was home to a number of ancient civilizations, including the Phoenicians, Aramaeans, and Canaanites. These civilizations left their mark on the language and culture of the region, which would later influence the development of Levantine Arabic.\n\n## Muslim conquest of the Levant\n\nIn the 7th century CE, the Levant was conquered by the Arabs, who brought with them their language, Islam, and culture. This marked the beginning of a new era in the region, as Arabic became the dominant language and Islam the dominant religion.\n\n## Medieval and early modern era\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Levant was a center of trade and learning, with cities such as Damascus and Aleppo playing important roles in the development of Arabic literature and culture. The region was also home to a number of important Islamic scholars and thinkers.\n\n## 20th and 21st centuries\n\nIn the 20th century, the Levant underwent significant changes, including the creation of new nation-states and the displacement of large numbers of people. This led to the development of new forms of Levantine Arabic, as well as the spread of the language to other parts of the world.\n\n# Status and usage\n\n## Diglossia and code-switching\n\nLevantine Arabic is often used in informal settings, such as at home or in the street. In formal settings, such as education and government, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is often used. This can lead to a phenomenon known as diglossia, where speakers switch between two languages or dialects depending on the context.\n\n## Education\n\nLevantine Arabic is not typically taught in schools, where MSA is the focus.

The storm was characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant storm surges, causing widespread damage and disruption to the affected regions. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of Cyclone Batsirai.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Batsirai formed on January 27, 2022, as a tropical disturbance in the southern Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) east of Mauritius. The system gradually intensified, with the Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) upgrading it to a tropical depression on January 29. Over the next few days, the depression continued to strengthen, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on January 31.\n\nOn February 1, the MMS upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm, naming it Batsirai. The storm continued to intensify, with the JTWC upgrading it to a tropical cyclone on February 2. Batsirai reached its peak intensity on February 3, with maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940 hPa (27.36 inHg).\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mauritius\n\nAs Cyclone Batsirai approached Mauritius, the government declared a state of emergency and ordered the evacuation of low-lying areas. The Mauritius Meteorological Services issued a Class 3 cyclone warning, indicating that the storm posed a significant threat to the island. The authorities also activated the National Emergency Operations Center to coordinate relief efforts.\n\nThe island's major airports, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport and Plaisance Airport, were closed as a precautionary measure. The Mauritius Ports Authority also suspended all port operations until further notice.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government issued a cyclone warning for the eastern part of the island, where Batsirai was expected to make landfall. The authorities evacuated thousands of people from the coastal regions and set up emergency shelters.\n\nThe Malagasy government also mobilized its military and emergency services to prepare for the storm's impact. The country's major ports, including the Port of Toamasina, were closed as a precautionary measure.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mauritius\n\nCyclone Batsirai passed approximately 100 km (62 miles) south of Mauritius on February 3, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The storm caused widespread damage, with thousands of homes destroyed or damaged. The island's electricity and water supply were also disrupted.\n\nThe cyclone also caused significant damage to the island's agricultural sector, with reports of extensive damage to sugarcane, tea, and other crops. The island's major tourist areas, including the popular resort town of Grand Baie, were also affected.\n\n## Réunion\n\nAlthough Cyclone Batsirai did not make a direct hit on Réunion, the island was still affected by the storm's outer rain bands. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the island, causing localized flooding and damage to infrastructure.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nCyclone Batsirai made landfall in Madagascar on February 5, bringing widespread destruction to the eastern part of the island. The storm caused significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and crops, with thousands of people left homeless.\n\nThe cyclone also caused extensive damage to the country's agricultural sector, with reports of widespread damage to rice, maize, and other crops. The storm also disrupted the country's transportation network, with several major roads and bridges damaged or destroyed.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Mauritius\n\nIn the aftermath of Cyclone Batsirai, the Mauritian government declared a state of emergency and mobilized its emergency services to respond to the disaster. The authorities also set up emergency shelters and distributed food and water to affected communities.\n\nThe island's major airports and ports were reopened on February 5, with normal operations resuming shortly thereafter. The government also launched a relief effort, with a focus on rebuilding damaged infrastructure and providing support to affected communities.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the government declared a state of emergency and mobilized its emergency services to respond to the disaster. The authorities also set up emergency shelters and distributed food and water to affected communities.\n\nThe country's international partners, including the United Nations and the European Union, also provided support to the relief efforts. The Malagasy government also launched a relief effort, with a focus on rebuilding damaged infrastructure and providing support to affected communities.\n\n### International response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with several countries and organizations providing support to the affected regions. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) activated its Emergency Response Fund to provide support to the relief efforts.\n\nThe European Union also provided support to the relief efforts, with a focus on providing humanitarian aid to affected communities. Other countries, including France, the United States, and Australia, also provided support to the relief efforts.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cyclone Idai\n* Cyclone Kenneth\n* Cyclone Enawo\n* Cyclone Leon-Eline\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of Cyclone Batsirai.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Mauritius Meteorological Services\n* Joint Typhoon Warning Center\n* National Emergency Operations Center (Mauritius)\n* Malagasy National Meteorological Service\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Batsirai\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n#Impact\n##Mauritius\n##Réunion\n##Madagascar\n#Aftermath\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n###International response\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The movement is centered around the anonymous figure \"Q,\" who claims to have access to classified information about a deep-state cabal of global elites who are working to undermine the Trump administration. QAnon has since spread to other social media platforms and has gained a significant following worldwide.\n\nBackground\n------------\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nThe QAnon movement has its roots in the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016. Pizzagate posited that high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a Washington, D.C. pizzeria. Although the theory was thoroughly debunked, it laid the groundwork for the QAnon movement's focus on child sex trafficking and the supposed existence of a global cabal of elite pedophiles.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\nQAnon emerged on 4chan's /pol/ board, a hub for far-right and conspiracy-oriented discussion. The movement's early adopters were influenced by the site's culture of anonymity, trolling, and meme-driven humor. This cultural context helped shape the movement's tone, style, and appeal.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nQAnon was not the first movement to emerge from the anonymous posting culture of 4chan. Previous movements, such as \"Anon\" and \"Operation Payback,\" had used similar tactics and rhetoric to mobilize action and promote their causes. QAnon built upon this legacy, incorporating elements of these earlier movements into its own ideology.\n\nOrigin and Spread\n-----------------\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon gained mainstream attention in 2018, when media outlets began reporting on the movement's growing popularity and its connections to other far-right groups. This increased visibility helped to further spread QAnon's ideas and attract new adherents.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon has attracted a significant following worldwide, with adherents in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. The movement's global reach has been facilitated by social media platforms, which have enabled QAnon supporters to connect with one another and share information across national borders.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon known as \"Pastel QAnon\" emerged on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Pastel QAnon is characterized by its use of soft colors, gentle language, and a focus on wellness and self-care. This variant has attracted a new audience for QAnon, particularly among young women and individuals who may not have been drawn to the movement's more extreme and masculine aspects.\n\nClaims\n-------\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQAnon's anonymous figure, \"Q,\" posts cryptic messages known as \"Q drops\" on online forums. These messages often contain coded language, references to conspiracy theories, and claims", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"QAnon\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Pizzagate\n##Influence of 4chan culture\n##Previous \"anons\"\n#Origin and spread\n##Mainstream attention\n##International following\n##Pastel QAnon\n#Claims\n##Q's posts\n##The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n##Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n##Other QAnon beliefs\n#Analysis\n##Identity of Q\n###Multiple people\n###Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n##Slogans and vocabulary\n##Derivative elements\n###Christian themes\n###Antisemitism\n##Appeal\n###Disillusionment\n##Demographics\n#Incidents\n##Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. election\n##German coup attempt\n#Reactions\n##Media, advocacy groups, and public figures\n##Official responses\n###FBI domestic terrorism assessment\n###Congressional resolution\n##Republican politicians and organizations\n##Connected individuals\n###Donald Trump\n###Mike Pence\n###Michael Flynn\n###Lin Wood\n###Sidney Powell\n###Kelly Townsend\n###Liz Harris\n#Online\n##QDrops app\n##Anti-QAnon subreddits\n##Removal of content\n##Migration to alt-tech\n##Return to Twitter/X\n#See also\n#Further reading\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had been in office since 2014, sought re-election for a third term. The election was widely seen as a crucial test for Erdoğan's rule and the future of Turkish politics.\n\n# Background\n\n## 2018 Elections\n\nThe previous presidential election was held in 2018, in which Erdoğan won re-election with 52.6% of the vote, defeating Muharrem İnce of the Republican People's Party (CHP). The 2018 election was the first to be held under the new presidential system, which was introduced by a constitutional referendum in 2017. The system abolished the office of the Prime Minister and gave the President sweeping executive powers.\n\n# Date\n\n## Discussion on Snap Elections\n\nIn the run-up to the 2023 election, there was speculation about the possibility of snap elections. Some opposition parties, including the CHP and the Good Party (İP), called for early elections, citing the country's economic woes and Erdoğan's declining popularity. However, Erdoğan ruled out the possibility of snap elections, saying that the election would be held on schedule.\n\n## Discussion on Postponing Election Date\n\nThere were also rumors about a possible postponement of the election date. Some analysts suggested that Erdoğan might try to delay the election to avoid a potential defeat or to coincide with the 2023 local elections. However, the Supreme Election Council (YSK) rejected any suggestions of a postponement, saying that the election would be held on May 14 as scheduled.\n\n## Election Calendar\n\nThe election calendar was announced by the YSK on March 10, 2023. The calendar outlined the key dates for the election, including the nomination period, the campaign period, and the voting dates.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe Turkish presidential election uses a two-round system. In the first round, voters choose from a list of candidates, and the top two candidates with the most votes proceed to a second round. In the second round, the candidate with the most votes wins the presidency. The election is held by secret ballot, and voters must be 18 years or older to participate.\n\n# Candidates\n\n## Candidates\n\nA total of four candidates ran in the 2023 presidential election:\n\n* Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Justice and Development Party, AKP)\n* Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (Republican People's Party, CHP)\n* Muharrem İnce (Homeland Party, MP)\n* Sinan Oğan (ATA Alliance)\n\n## Nominations\n\nThe nomination period for the election was from March 20 to March 31, 2023. Candidates had to gather at least 100,000 signatures from supporters to be eligible to run.\n\n## Endorsements\n\nSeveral parties and alliances endorsed candidates in the election. The CHP and the İP endorsed Kılıçdaroğlu, while the AKP and its allies endorsed Erdoğan.\n\n## Parties and Alliances\n\nSeveral parties and alliances participated in the election, including:\n\n* Justice and Development Party (AKP)\n* Republican People's Party (CHP)\n* Good Party (İP)\n* Homeland Party (MP)\n* ATA Alliance\n* Nation Alliance\n\n# Second Round\n\n## Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n\nAfter the first round, Sinan Oğan and Ümit Özdağ, the leaders of the ATA Alliance and the Victory Party, respectively, held negotiations about a potential alliance in the second round. However, the talks ultimately failed, and Oğan announced that he would endorse Erdoğan in the second round.\n\n### Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n\nFollowing Oğan's endorsement of Erdoğan, the ATA Alliance announced its dissolution. The alliance had been formed in 2022 by several small parties, including the ATA Alliance and the Victory Party.\n\n### Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n\nOğan's endorsement of Erdoğan was seen as a surprise move, given his previous criticism of the President. However, Oğan said that he had decided to endorse Erdoğan to prevent a CHP victory.\n\n### Özdağ's Support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n\nMeanwhile, Özdağ announced that he would support Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round. Özdağ said that he had decided to support Kılıçdaroğlu to prevent a \"one-man rule\" in Turkey.\n\n## Erdoğan's Strategy\n\nErdoğan's strategy in the second round was to appeal to nationalist and conservative voters. He emphasized his record on economic growth and his efforts to promote Turkish interests abroad.\n\n## Kılıçdaroğlu's Strategy\n\nKılıçdaroğlu's strategy in the second round was to appeal to liberal and secular voters. He emphasized his commitment to democracy and human rights and promised to reverse Erdoğan's authoritarian policies.\n\n## Potential Debate\n\nThere were calls for a debate between Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round, but the two candidates ultimately failed to agree on a format.\n\n# Controversies\n\n## Erdoğan's Right to Seek Re-Election\n\nThere were controversies about Erdoğan's right to seek re-election. Some opposition parties argued that Erdoğan had already served two terms and was therefore ineligible to run again. However, the YSK ruled that Erdoğan was eligible to run, citing a loophole in the constitution.\n\n## Political Violence\n\nThere were reports of political violence during the campaign, including attacks on opposition party offices and supporters. The violence was condemned by human rights groups and opposition parties.\n\n## Erdoğan's Photo on Ballot Paper\n\nThere was controversy about Erdoğan's photo on the ballot paper. Some opposition parties argued that the photo was too large and prominent, giving Erdoğan an unfair advantage.\n\n## Fake Videos\n\nThere were reports of fake videos and social media posts during the campaign, including a video that appeared to show Kılıçdaroğlu making anti-Turkish comments. The video was widely shared on social media before being debunked as fake.\n\n## Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n\nThe popular Turkish social media platform Ekşi Sözlük was blocked by the government during the campaign, allegedly for publishing \"hate speech.\" The block was widely condemned by human rights groups and opposition parties.\n\n## Reporting of the Results\n\nThere were controversies about the reporting of the results, including allegations of bias in the state-run media.\n\n## Azerbaijani and Russian Interference Allegations\n\nThere were allegations of Azerbaijani and Russian interference in the election, including reports of Azerbaijani and Russian citizens voting in the election.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\n## First Round\n\nOpinion polls before the first round showed a tight race between Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu. However, Erdoğan ultimately won the first round with 49.5% of the vote.\n\n## Second Round\n\nOpinion polls before the second round showed a close race between Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu. However, Erdoğan ultimately won the second round with 52.2% of the vote.\n\n# Results\n\nThe official results of the election were announced by the YSK on May 30, 2023. Erdoğan won the election with 52.2% of the vote, defeating Kılıçdaroğlu who received 47.8% of the vote.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe results of the election were widely seen as a victory for Erdoğan and his allies. However, the opposition parties and human rights groups raised concerns about the fairness and transparency of the election.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw widespread protests and demonstrations by opposition supporters. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were reports of clashes between protesters and police.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community reacted to the election results with caution. The European Union and the United States congratulated Erdoğan on his victory but expressed concerns about the fairness and transparency of the election.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2018 Turkish presidential election\n* 2023 Turkish local elections\n* Turkish general election, 2023\n* Recep Tayyip Erdoğan\n* Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu\n* Justice and Development Party (Turkey)\n* Republican People's Party (Turkey)\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Turkish_presidential_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##2018 elections\n#Date\n##Discussion on snap elections\n##Discussion on postponing election date\n##Election calendar\n#Electoral system\n#Candidates\n##Candidates\n##Nominations\n#Endorsements\n##Parties and alliances\n#Second round\n##Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n###Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n###Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n###Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n##Erdoğan's strategy\n##Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy\n##Potential debate\n#Controversies\n##Erdoğan's right to seek re-election\n##Political violence\n##Erdoğan's photo on ballot paper\n##Fake videos\n##Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n##Reporting of the results\n##Azerbaijani and Russian interference allegations\n#Opinion polls\n##First round\n##Second round\n#Results\n##Analysis\n#Aftermath\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 and has served on the Court since October 23, 1991. Thomas is known for his originalist and textualist judicial philosophy, which emphasizes the interpretation of the Constitution and statutes based on their original meaning. He has written numerous influential opinions on a wide range of topics, including federalism, individual rights, and the separation of powers.\n\n#Early life\n\nClarence Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small Gullah Geechee community near Savannah. He was raised in a poor household with his mother, Leola Williams, and his grandparents, who instilled in him a strong work ethic and a love of education. Thomas attended local Catholic schools and later enrolled in the College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated cum laude with a degree in English literature in 1971.\n\n##College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School\n\nThomas attended Holy Cross on a full scholarship and was active in the college's debate team and drama club. He later attended Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974. At Yale, Thomas was a member of the Black Students Association and was involved in various student organizations focused on social justice and civil rights.\n\n#Early legal career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Thomas worked as a staff attorney for the Missouri Attorney General's office, where he argued several cases before the Missouri Supreme Court. In 1977, he became the assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, a position he held until 1981. During this time, Thomas also taught law at the University of Missouri and was a visiting lecturer at the University of Kansas.\n\n#District of Columbia Court of Appeals\n\nIn 1990, Thomas was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where he served for 16 months before being nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n#Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nOn July 1, 1991, President Bush nominated Thomas to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement. Thomas's nomination was met with controversy, particularly from liberal groups and civil rights organizations, who questioned his conservative views and his lack of experience on the federal bench.\n\n##Anita Hill accusations\n\nDuring Thomas's Senate confirmation hearings, Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas's at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), accused him of sexual harassment. Hill testified that Thomas had made unwanted advances towards her and had engaged in inappropriate behavior, including discussing explicit content and making suggestive comments.\n\n###Second hearing\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee held a second hearing to address Hill's allegations, which was widely covered in the media. Thomas denied Hill's allegations and accused the Committee of conducting a \"high-tech lynching\" against him.\n\n##Senate votes\n\nOn October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas's nomination by a margin of 52-48, with 11 Democrats voting in favor of his confirmation.\n\n#Supreme Court of the United States\n\nThomas took office on October 23, 1991, and has since become one of the most conservative justices on the Court. He has written numerous influential opinions on a wide range of topics, including federalism, individual rights, and the separation of powers.\n\n##Government powers and legal structure\n\n###Court precedent\n\nThomas has been a vocal critic of the doctrine of stare decisis, which holds that courts should respect and follow prior precedent. He has argued that this doctrine can lead to judicial activism and the erosion of the rule of law.\n\n###Executive power\n\nThomas has written extensively on the topic of executive power, arguing that the President has broad authority to act in the national interest. He has also argued that the Constitution grants the President significant discretion in matters of foreign policy and national security.\n\n###Federalism and states' rights\n\nThomas has been a strong advocate for federalism and states' rights, arguing that the Constitution grants significant authority to the states to regulate their own affairs.

The storm system, which developed in the western United States and intensified as it moved eastward, caused widespread disruptions to daily life, including travel, commerce, and essential services.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nThe winter storm system began to take shape on December 20, 2022, in the western United States, where a low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains. As the system intensified, it began to move eastward, drawing in cold air from Canada and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. This collision of air masses led to the formation of a strong cold front, which swept across the central and eastern United States, bringing snow, sleet, and freezing rain to a vast area.\n\nAs the storm system continued to intensify, it developed a strong low-pressure center, which deepened to a minimum central pressure of 970 millibars (28.64 inHg) on December 23. The storm's winds howled to speeds of over 70 mph (113 km/h) in some areas, leading to significant drifting and blowing snow. The storm's precipitation totals were also impressive, with some areas receiving over 2 feet (61 cm) of snow and others seeing significant accumulations of freezing rain and sleet.\n\n# Preparations\n\nIn anticipation of the storm's arrival, governments and emergency management officials across the United States and Canada took steps to prepare for the worst. Many states and provinces declared states of emergency, mobilizing resources and personnel to respond to the storm's impacts. Utility companies and road crews were put on high alert, with many workers being recalled from vacation to help with storm response efforts.\n\nAirlines and airports also took steps to prepare for the storm, canceling flights and implementing travel waivers for passengers affected by the bad weather. Many schools and businesses closed or delayed opening, and government offices were shut down in some areas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe December 2022 North American winter storm had a significant impact on the continent, with widespread disruptions to daily life and essential services.\n\n## Deaths\n\nTragically, the storm claimed the lives of at least 91 people, with many more injured or stranded.

Founded in 1983, the bank played a significant role in the growth and development of the technology industry, particularly in Silicon Valley. This article provides an overview of the bank's history, operations, and collapse.\n\nFoundation and Early Growth\n---------------------------\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis. The bank's initial focus was on providing financial services to the growing number of technology startups in Silicon Valley. At the time, traditional banks were hesitant to lend to these companies due to the perceived high risk. SVB, however, took a different approach, recognizing the potential for growth and innovation in the technology sector.\n\nIn its early years, the bank experienced rapid growth, with assets increasing from $20 million to over $1 billion by the end of the 1980s. SVB's success was largely due to its willingness to take calculated risks and provide financing to companies that might not have qualified for traditional bank loans. The bank's client base expanded to include some of the most successful technology companies of the time, including Cisco Systems, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems.\n\nExpansion\n----------\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Silicon Valley Bank continued to expand its operations, both domestically and internationally. The bank established offices in major technology hubs, including Boston, New York, and Seattle, as well as in the United Kingdom, Israel, and China. SVB also expanded its product offerings to include a range of financial services, including venture debt, asset-based lending, and treasury management.\n\nDuring this period, the bank also made significant investments in its technology infrastructure, including the development of online banking and cash management systems. This allowed SVB to better serve its clients and provide more efficient and effective financial services.\n\nOperations in Lead-up to Collapse\n---------------------------------\n\n### Business Model\n\nSilicon Valley Bank's business model was centered around providing financial services to technology, life science, and cleantech companies. The bank's focus on these sectors allowed it to develop a deep understanding of the unique financial needs of these companies. SVB's business model was based on providing a range of financial products and services, including:\n\n* Venture debt: SVB provided debt financing to early-stage companies, often in conjunction with venture capital investments.\n* Asset-based lending: The bank provided loans secured by a company's assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory.\n* Treasury management: SVB offered a range of cash management services, including online banking and payment processing.\n\n### Facilities\n\nSilicon Valley Bank operated a network of offices and branches, primarily in the United States. The bank's headquarters were located in Santa Clara, California, and it had major offices in other technology hubs, including Boston, New York, and Seattle.\n\n### Affiliations and Community Involvement\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was actively involved in the technology and entrepreneurial communities. The bank sponsored a range of events and programs, including the annual SVB CEO Summit and the SVB Analytics conference. SVB also partnered with a number of organizations, including the National Venture Capital Association and the Silicon Valley Leadership Group.\n\nCollapse\n--------\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank was placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The bank's collapse was the result of a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of its investment portfolio and a loss of confidence among its depositors.\n\nIn the days leading up to the collapse, SVB had attempted to raise capital through a sale of shares, but was ultimately unable to do so. The bank's failure was the largest bank failure in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nWorks Cited\n------------\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Foundation and early growth\n#Expansion\n#Operations in lead-up to collapse\n##Business model\n##Facilities\n##Affiliations and community involvement\n#Collapse\n#References\n##Works cited\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Roman surgery was characterized by a range of techniques, tools, and procedures that were used to treat a variety of medical conditions, from simple wounds and injuries to complex diseases and disorders. This article provides an overview of the history, tools, and techniques of surgery in ancient Rome.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nSurgery in ancient Rome was heavily influenced by Greek medical traditions, which were introduced to Italy through the conquests of Alexander the Great and the subsequent establishment of Greek colonies in southern Italy. Roman surgeons, such as Galen and Aulus Cornelius Celsus, were trained in Greek medical schools and incorporated Greek techniques and knowledge into their own practices.\n\nDuring the Roman Republic (509-27 BCE), surgery was primarily performed by specialized physicians who were trained in the art of surgery. These physicians, known as \"medici,\" were responsible for treating a range of medical conditions, including wounds, injuries, and diseases. Roman surgeons also developed new techniques and tools, such as the use of forceps and scalpels, which were designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of surgical procedures.\n\nIn the Roman Empire (27 BCE-476 CE), surgery continued to evolve and become more sophisticated. Roman surgeons developed new techniques, such as the use of anesthesia and the performance of complex operations, such as amputations and dissections. Roman hospitals, known as \"valetudinaria,\" were also established, providing a centralized location for medical care and treatment.\n\nTools\n-----\n\nRoman surgeons used a range of tools and instruments to perform surgical procedures. These tools were often made of high-quality materials, such as bronze, silver, and gold, and were designed to be durable and effective.\n\n### Cupping Vessels\n\nCupping vessels were used to create suction on the skin, which was believed to draw out impurities and toxins from the body.

These tools were often used in procedures such as surgeries and dissections.\n\n### Specula\n\nSpecula were used to dilate and examine body cavities, such as the vagina and anus. These tools were often used in procedures such as gynecological exams and rectal exams.\n\n### Spoon of Diocles\n\nThe spoon of Diocles was a specialized tool used to remove foreign bodies from the throat. This tool was designed by the Greek physician Diocles and was widely used in ancient Rome.\n\n### Catheters\n\nCatheters were used to inject fluids into the body or to drain fluids from the body. These tools were often used in procedures such as urinary catheterization and enemas.\n\n### Strigils\n\nStrigils were used to scrape and clean the skin. These tools were often used in procedures such as skin care and wound care.\n\n### Knives and Needles\n\nKnives and needles were used to make incisions and to suture wounds. These tools were often used in procedures such as surgeries and wound care.\n\n### Hooks\n\nHooks were used to retract and manipulate tissue. These tools were often used in procedures such as dissections and surgeries.\n\n### Other Tools\n\nRoman surgeons also used a range of other tools and instruments, including lancets, bistouries, and retractors. These tools were often used in specialized procedures, such as bloodletting and trephining.\n\nTechniques\n----------\n\nRoman surgeons developed a range of techniques and procedures to treat a variety of medical conditions.\n\n### Abortion\n\nAbortion was a common procedure in ancient Rome, and was often performed using a combination of herbs and surgical instruments.\n\n### Amputations and Dissections\n\nAmputations and dissections were often performed to treat injuries and diseases, such as gangrene and cancer.

However, the team resumed its international activities in the early 1980s, and its first major tournament was the 1984 Asian Cup, where it finished in third place.\n\n## 1998–2006\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Iran national team experienced a resurgence, led by players such as Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri, and Mehdi Mahdavikia. During this period, the team qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to the United States and Yugoslavia, and drew with Germany.\n\n## Temporary suspension\n\nIn 2006, the team was temporarily suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. However, the suspension was lifted after the government agreed to allow the federation to operate independently.\n\n## 2007–14\n\nUnder the leadership of coach Afshin Ghotbi, the team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to Brazil and Portugal, and drew with North Korea. The team also reached the quarterfinals of the 2011 Asian Cup, where it lost to South Korea.\n\n## Late 2010s\n\nIn the late 2010s, the team experienced a decline in performance, failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, under the leadership of coach Carlos Queiroz, the team showed improvement, reaching the semifinals of the 2019 Asian Cup, where it lost to Japan.\n\n## Early 2020s\n\nIn the early 2020s, the team showed further improvement, qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where it lost to England and the United States, and drew with Wales.\n\n# Team image\n\n## Nicknames\n\nThe Iran national football team is nicknamed Team Melli, which means \"national team\" in Persian.\n\n## Kits and crests\n\n### Kit suppliers\n\nThe team's kit supplier is Merooj.\n\n### Kit evolution\n\nThe team's kit has undergone several changes over the years, with various designs and colors being used.

including Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\n\n## Stadiums\n\nThe team's home stadium is the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, which has a seating capacity of over 100,000 spectators.\n\n# Results and fixtures\n\n##

The history of African Greeks spans over two millennia, with significant periods of Greek influence in ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia. This article explores the history and culture of African Greeks in these regions.\n\n# Ancient Egypt\n\n## First historical colonies\n\nThe first recorded Greek presence in Egypt dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek mercenaries served in the Egyptian army during the reign of Pharaoh Psamtik I. These early Greek settlers were primarily from the city-states of Ionia and Aeolia, and they established themselves in the Nile Delta region. The most notable of these early colonies was the city of Naucratis, founded around 620 BC, which became a major center of Greek trade and culture in Egypt.\n\n## Hellenistic times\n\nThe conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC marked the beginning of the Hellenistic period in Egypt. Alexander's successors, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt for over three centuries, during which time Greek culture became deeply ingrained in Egyptian society.\n\n### Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n\nAlexander's brief but significant rule in Egypt had a profound impact on the country's culture and politics. He founded the city of Alexandria, which would become a major center of Greek learning and culture, and he established a new ruling class of Greek Macedonians. Alexander's conquest of Egypt also led to the spread of Greek language and culture throughout the country.\n\n### The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n\nThe Ptolemaic Empire, which ruled Egypt after Alexander's death, was a period of significant Greek influence in Egypt. The Ptolemies were Macedonian Greeks who adopted many of the customs and traditions of ancient Egypt, while also maintaining their Greek heritage. During this period, Greek became the language of government and commerce in Egypt, and many Egyptians adopted Greek customs and practices.\n\n## Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n\nThe Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC marked the end of the Ptolemaic Empire and the beginning of a new period of Roman rule in Egypt. During this period, Greek continued to be an important language and culture in Egypt, and many Egyptians maintained their Greek heritage.\n\n### Coptic Greeks\n\nThe Coptic Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Egypt during the Roman and Byzantine periods. They were primarily descendants of the Greek settlers who had arrived in Egypt during the Ptolemaic period, and they maintained a distinct Greek identity and culture. The Coptic Greeks played an important role in the development of Christianity in Egypt, and many of them became prominent leaders in the early Christian church.\n\n# Ancient Ethiopia\n\n## Axumites of Ethiopia\n\nThe Axumite Empire, which flourished in Ethiopia from the 1st to the 8th centuries AD, had significant trade and cultural ties with the Greek world. The Axumites were a Semitic people who had been influenced by Greek culture, and they adopted many Greek customs and practices.\n\n## Abyssinian Greeks\n\nThe Abyssinian Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Ethiopia during the Axumite period. They were primarily descendants of Greek traders and settlers who had arrived in Ethiopia from the Mediterranean region. The Abyssinian Greeks played an important role in the development of Christianity in Ethiopia, and many of them became prominent leaders in the early Christian church.\n\n# Ancient Libya\n\n## Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n\nThe Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica were a community of Greeks who lived in the region of Cyrenaica, in modern-day Libya. They were primarily descendants of Greek settlers who had arrived in the region from the Mediterranean, and they maintained a distinct Greek identity and culture.\n\n## Libyan Greek culture\n\nLibyan Greek culture was a unique blend of Greek and African influences. The Libyan Greeks developed a distinct dialect of Greek, which was influenced by the local Berber language. They also developed a unique style of art and architecture, which was characterized by the use of Greek motifs and techniques.\n\n# Ancient Nubia\n\n## Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n\nThe Axumite Empire conquered Nubia in the 3rd century AD, and the region became an important center of Greek culture and trade. The Axumites introduced Greek language and culture to Nubia, and many Nubians adopted Greek customs and practices.\n\n## Nubian Greeks\n\nThe Nubian Greeks were a community of Greeks who lived in Nubia during the Axumite period. They were primarily descendants of Greek traders and settlers who had arrived in Nubia from the Mediterranean region. The Nubian Greeks played an important role in the development of Christianity in Nubia, and many of them became prominent leaders in the early Christian church.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of African Greeks spans over two millennia, with significant periods of Greek influence in ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Nubia. The African Greeks developed unique cultures and identities, which were shaped by their Greek heritage and their African surroundings. Despite the passage of time, the legacy of African Greeks continues to be felt in the modern world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"African_Greeks\" following this outline:\n\n#Ancient Egypt\n##First historical colonies\n##Hellenistic times\n###Rule of Alexander the Great (332–323 BC)\n###The Ptolemaic Empire (323–30 BC)\n##Roman and Byzantine Egypt\n###Coptic Greeks\n#Ancient Ethiopia\n##Axumites of Ethiopia\n##Abyssinian Greeks\n#Ancient Libya\n##Libyan Greeks of Cyrenaica\n##Libyan Greek culture\n#Ancient Nubia\n##Axumite subjugation of Nubia\n##Nubian Greeks\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The remains, estimated to be around 3,000 years old, have provided significant insights into the lives of people living during the Nordic Bronze Age. The Luttra Woman's discovery, studies, and subsequent reconstruction have contributed substantially to our understanding of prehistoric Scandinavian societies.\n\nDiscovery\n----------\n\nIn the summer of 1943, a team of archaeologists led by Dr. Wilhelm Holmqvist were conducting excavations in the Luttra parish, located near the town of Falköping in Västergötland, Sweden. The excavation site was a wetland area that had been drained and converted into farmland. During the dig, the team stumbled upon a human skeleton buried in a shallow grave. Initially, the remains were thought to be of a relatively recent date, but further examination revealed that the skeleton was much older.\n\nThe Luttra Woman was found in a flexed position, with her knees pulled up towards her chest, indicating that she had been buried in a crouched position. The skeleton was remarkably well-preserved, with most of the bones still intact. The team also discovered a few artifacts, including a ceramic vessel, a bronze pin, and a few other personal items, which helped to date the burial to the Nordic Bronze Age.\n\nStudies\n--------\n\nThe Luttra Woman's skeleton was subjected to extensive analysis, including radiocarbon dating, osteological examination, and other scientific tests. The results revealed that the skeleton was approximately 3,000 years old, placing it firmly within the Nordic Bronze Age period.\n\n### Cause of death\n\nThe osteological examination revealed that the Luttra Woman had suffered from several health issues during her lifetime, including arthritis, dental problems, and a possible case of osteoporosis. However, the exact cause of her death remains a mystery. The analysis of her skeleton did not reveal any signs of trauma or violence, leading researchers to speculate that she may have died from natural causes or illness.\n\nExhibition and reconstruction\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the 1950s, the Luttra Woman's skeleton was reconstructed and put on display at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. The reconstruction process involved creating a detailed model of the skeleton, using the original bones as a reference point. The model was then clothed in a replica of the clothing that would have been worn by a woman of her status and period.\n\nThe exhibit was designed to provide a glimpse into the life of a prehistoric Scandinavian woman, showcasing her daily life, social status, and cultural practices. The Luttra Woman's reconstruction has been seen by millions of visitors over the years, making her one of the most famous prehistoric human remains in the world.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Nordic Bronze Age\n* Prehistoric Scandinavia\n* Archaeology in Sweden\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Notes\n\n* This article is based on the available literature and research on the Luttra Woman.\n* The exact dates and details of the discovery and excavation are not well-documented, and some information may be subject to interpretation.\n\n### Citations\n\n* (none)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Swedish History Museum: Luttra Woman exhibit\n* Swedish National Heritage Board: Luttra Woman\n* Archaeology in Sweden: Luttra Woman", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Luttra_Woman\" following this outline:\n\n#Discovery\n#Studies\n##Cause of death\n#Exhibition and reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of the deaths of federal judges in active service, exploring the background, political and logistical consequences, and listing the judges who have died in office since the establishment of the federal judiciary in 1789.\n\n#Background\n\nThe United States federal judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court, the Courts of Appeals, the District Courts, and the Bankruptcy Courts. The judges who serve on these courts are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and they typically serve for life. However, judges can retire or resign from office, and they can also die while serving. The death of a federal judge in active service can create a vacancy on the court, which can have significant consequences for the administration of justice and the functioning of the judiciary.\n\n#Political consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can have significant political consequences. The President and the Senate may disagree on the appointment of a new judge to fill the vacancy, leading to a delay in the confirmation process. This can be particularly contentious if the vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court, where the ideological balance of the court can be significantly affected by the appointment of a new justice. Additionally, the death of a judge can create an opportunity for the President to appoint a new judge who shares their ideological views, which can shift the balance of power on the court.\n\n#Logistical consequences\n\nThe death of a federal judge in active service can also have significant logistical consequences for the court. The judge's cases must be reassigned to other judges, which can create a significant workload for the remaining judges on the court. This can lead to delays in the resolution of cases and can create a backlog of cases waiting to be heard. Additionally, the court may need to adjust its schedule and procedures to accommodate the loss of a judge, which can be a time-consuming and complex process.\n\n#Lists\n\nThis section provides a list of federal judges who have died in active service, divided into four time periods: 1789-1869, 1870-1919, 1920-1954, and 1954-present.\n\n##1789–1869\n\n* John Blair (1790-1796)\n* William Paterson (1793-1806)\n* John Jay (1795-1801)\n* William Cushing (1796-1810)\n* Oliver Ellsworth (1796-1800)\n* James Wilson (1789-1798)\n* John Marshall (1801-1835)\n* William Johnson (1804-1834)\n* Brockholst Livingston (1806-1823)\n* Thomas Todd (1807-1826)\n* Joseph Story (1812-1845)\n* Gabriel Duvall (1811-1835)\n* Smith Thompson (1823-1843)\n* Robert Trimble (1826-1828)\n* John McLean (1829-1861)\n* Henry Baldwin (1830-1844)\n* James Wayne (1835-1867)\n* Roger Taney (1836-1864)\n* Philip Barbour (1836-1841)\n* John Catron (1837-1865)\n* John McKinley (1837-1852)\n* Peter Daniel (1841-1860)\n* Samuel Nelson (1845-1872)\n* Levi Woodbury (1845-1851)\n* Robert Grier (1846-1870)\n* Benjamin Curtis (1851-1857)\n* John Campbell (1853-1861)\n* Nathan Clifford (1858-1881)\n* John Archibald Campbell (1853-1861)\n* John Wayne (1861-1867)\n\n##1870–1919\n\n* Samuel Miller (1862-1890)\n* David Davis (1862-1877)\n* Stephen Field (1863-1897)\n* Joseph Bradley (1870-1892)\n* Ward Hunt (1872-1882)\n* John Harlan (1877-1911)\n* William Strong (1870-1880)\n* John M.

The protests were sparked by the country's worst economic crisis in decades, which had led to severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicines. The protests eventually led to the resignation of President Rajapaksa and the appointment of a new government.\n\n# Background\n\nSri Lanka has been facing an economic crisis since 2020, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's foreign exchange reserves had dwindled, leading to a shortage of essential goods, including food, fuel, and medicines. The government had imposed a number of austerity measures, including a ban on the importation of non-essential goods, but these measures had failed to address the crisis. The economic situation had become increasingly dire, with long queues for fuel and food, and power cuts becoming a regular occurrence.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## March\n\nThe protests began in March 2022, with small-scale demonstrations taking place in several parts of the country. The protests were largely peaceful, but they were met with a heavy-handed response from the police, who used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowds.\n\n## April\n\n### Declaration of state of emergency\n\nOn April 1, 2022, President Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency, giving the military sweeping powers to arrest and detain individuals without trial. The move was widely condemned by opposition parties and civil society groups, who saw it as an attempt to suppress the protests.\n\n### Social media blocks\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the government blocked social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, in an attempt to prevent the spread of information about the protests. The move was widely criticized, with many seeing it as an attempt to suppress free speech.\n\n### Cabinet resignation\n\nOn April 3, 2022, the entire cabinet resigned, citing the need for a new government to address the economic crisis. However, the move was seen as a desperate attempt by the government to cling to power.\n\n### Reconvening of Parliament\n\nOn April 5, 2022, Parliament reconvened after a brief adjournment, with opposition parties calling for the government to resign. However, the government refused to budge, leading to a standoff between the two sides.\n\n### \"Occupy Galle Face\"\n\nOn April 9, 2022, a group of protesters began an \"Occupy Galle Face\" movement, setting up a tent city in the heart of Colombo.

Abu Akleh was a prominent journalist who had spent over two decades covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and her death sparked an international outcry and calls for accountability.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nShireen Abu Akleh was born on April 3, 1971, in Jerusalem, to a Palestinian Christian family. Her family was originally from Bethlehem, but they had moved to Jerusalem, where Abu Akleh grew up. She studied English literature at the Jordan University and later earned a master's degree in broadcast journalism from Yarmouk University in Jordan.\n\nAbu Akleh's interest in journalism began at a young age, and she started her career in the field while still in college. She worked as a journalist for several Palestinian and Arab news outlets, including the Palestinian Television Corporation and the Arab satellite channel, Al-Jazeera.\n\n#Career\n\nAbu Akleh joined Al-Jazeera in 1997, and over the years, she became one of the network's most prominent and respected journalists. She covered major events in the Middle East, including the Second Intifada, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the Gaza wars. Abu Akleh was known for her fearless reporting and her ability to tell the stories of ordinary people caught up in the conflict.\n\nAbu Akleh's reporting often focused on the human cost of the conflict, and she was particularly interested in highlighting the experiences of Palestinian women and children. She was also known for her ability to get access to areas that were difficult for other journalists to reach, and her reporting often provided a unique perspective on the conflict.\n\nAbu Akleh's work was widely respected, and she won numerous awards for her reporting. She was also a popular figure among Palestinians, who admired her courage and her commitment to telling their story.\n\n#Death\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Abu Akleh was reporting on an Israeli military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin. She was wearing a press vest and a helmet, and she was accompanied by other journalists. According to eyewitnesses, Abu Akleh was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers, who were firing on a group of Palestinian fighters.\n\nAbu Akleh was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her death was met with shock and outrage, and it sparked an international outcry. The Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh had been caught in the crossfire, but later said that it was unclear who had fired the shot that killed her.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Abu Akleh's death was marked by widespread condemnation and calls for accountability. The Palestinian Authority accused Israel of deliberately targeting Abu Akleh, and the United States, the European Union, and other countries called for a thorough investigation into her death.\n\nAbu Akleh's family and colleagues were shocked and devastated by her death, and they demanded that those responsible be held accountable. The Al-Jazeera network, where Abu Akleh worked, accused Israel of a \"cold-blooded assassination\" and called for an international investigation.\n\n#Funeral\n\nAbu Akleh's funeral was held on May 13, 2022, in Jerusalem. The funeral was attended by hundreds of people, including Palestinian officials, journalists, and ordinary citizens.

The Israeli authorities were not invited to the funeral, and they did not send any representatives.\n\n#Reaction\n\nThe reaction to Abu Akleh's death was widespread and intense.

The United States, the European Union, and other countries called for a thorough investigation into Abu Akleh's death and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\nThe international community was shocked and outraged by Abu Akleh's death, and it sparked a renewed debate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the need for accountability. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, called for a thorough investigation and for those responsible to be held accountable.\n\n#Investigations\n\nThe investigation into Abu Akleh's death was complex and multifaceted. The Israeli military initially claimed that Abu Akleh had been caught in the crossfire, but later said that it was unclear who had fired the shot that killed her.\n\n##Initial Israel investigations\n\nThe Israeli military launched an initial investigation into Abu Akleh's death, which concluded that it was unclear who had fired the shot that killed her. The investigation was widely criticized as inadequate and biased, and it failed to provide any clear answers about what had happened.\n\n##Subsequent investigations\n\nThe Israeli government later launched a more comprehensive investigation into Abu Akleh's death, which was headed by a senior military officer. The investigation was widely seen as an attempt to deflect criticism and to provide a more convincing explanation for what had happened.\n\n##Announcement of US investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the United States announced that it would be launching its own investigation into Abu Akleh's death. The investigation was widely seen as a response to the international outcry and the need for accountability.\n\n##Referral of case to the International Criminal Court\n\nIn June 2022, the Palestinian Authority referred the case of Abu Akleh's death to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The referral was widely seen as a move to seek justice and accountability, and it marked a significant development in the case.\n\n#Remembrance and legacy\n\nAbu Akleh's death was met with widespread tributes and remembrance.

The season officially started on May 15, 2023, and will end on November 30, 2023. This article documents all the storms that developed in the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator and west of the International Date Line during the 2023 calendar year.\n\n# Seasonal forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the season, several forecasting agencies released their predictions for the number of tropical cyclones that would form in the Pacific Ocean during the 2023 season. These forecasts were based on various climate indicators, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).\n\nSome forecasting agencies predicted a below-average season, citing the potential for a developing El Niño event, which tends to suppress hurricane activity in the Pacific. However, other agencies predicted a near-average or above-average season, citing the ongoing positive phase of the PDO, which tends to favor hurricane activity.\n\n# Seasonal summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2023 Pacific hurricane season was marked by a complex interplay of various climate factors, including ENSO and the PDO. During the spring, the Pacific Ocean was in a neutral state, with neither El Niño nor La Niña conditions present. However, as the season progressed, a developing El Niño event began to influence the climate, leading to increased wind shear and reduced instability in the atmosphere.\n\n## Early activity\n\nThe season got off to a relatively slow start, with only a few tropical cyclones forming in the first few weeks.

The shooting resulted in the deaths of six people and injuries to twelve others. It was one of the deadliest mass shootings in Sacramento's history.\n\n# Events\n\n## Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 2:00 a.m. local time near the intersection of 10th and K Streets in downtown Sacramento. The area was crowded with people leaving bars and nightclubs when the shooting began. Witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and seeing people running from the scene. The Sacramento Police Department (SPD) received multiple 911 calls reporting the shooting, and officers responded quickly to the scene.\n\n## Response\n\nThe SPD immediately established a perimeter around the area and began searching for suspects. Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the California Highway Patrol and the FBI, assisted in the response. Emergency medical personnel were also dispatched to the scene to treat the wounded.\n\n## Suspects\n\nAccording to witnesses, there were multiple shooters involved in the incident. The SPD initially reported that they were searching for multiple suspects, but later stated that they were focusing on one suspect. On April 4, 2022, the SPD announced that they had arrested a 26-year-old man, Dandre Martin, in connection with the shooting. Martin was charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.\n\n# Victims\n\nSix people were killed in the shooting, and their identities were released by the Sacramento County Coroner's Office.

Many of the victims were patrons of the nearby bars and nightclubs, while others were simply passing by the area when the shooting occurred.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe SPD launched a thorough investigation into the shooting, which was assisted by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. The investigation included reviewing security footage, interviewing witnesses, and analyzing physical evidence from the scene.\n\n## Motive\n\nThe motive for the shooting was not immediately clear, but investigators believed that it may have been gang-related. The SPD reported that some of the victims had ties to local gangs, and that the shooting may have been a result of a dispute between rival gangs.\n\n## Gun used\n\nThe gun used in the shooting was a stolen handgun, according to the SPD. The gun had been reported stolen in a burglary several days before the shooting.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Local reaction\n\nThe shooting sent shockwaves through the Sacramento community, with many residents expressing outrage and sadness. The city's mayor, Darrell Steinberg, released a statement condemning the violence and vowing to take action to prevent future incidents. Local business owners and residents also expressed concerns about the safety of the downtown area.\n\n## State and national reaction\n\nThe shooting drew attention from state and national leaders, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and the White House. Newsom released a statement expressing condolences to the victims' families and calling for action to address gun violence. The White House also released a statement condemning the shooting and offering support to the affected families.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in the United States\n* Gun violence in the United States\n* Sacramento Police Department", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Sacramento_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Events\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These standards ensure that devices from different manufacturers can display content at consistent and compatible resolutions, making it possible for users to enjoy high-quality visuals across various platforms.\n\n# Overview\n\nDisplay resolution standards have evolved significantly over the years, with advancements in technology leading to higher resolutions and improved display quality. The earliest display standards were introduced in the 1980s, with the Video Graphics Array (VGA) standard being one of the most widely adopted. Since then, numerous other standards have been developed, including the Extended Graphics Array (XGA) and the High-Definition (HD) standards.\n\n# Aspect Ratio\n\nAspect ratio refers to the proportion of the width of a display to its height. The most common aspect ratios used in displays are 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. The 4:3 aspect ratio was widely used in older displays, while the 16:9 aspect ratio is commonly used in modern widescreen displays. The 16:10 aspect ratio is also used in some displays, particularly in laptops and tablets.\n\n# High-Definition\n\nHigh-Definition (HD) display standards refer to resolutions that are significantly higher than those of traditional Standard-Definition (SD) displays.

Directed by Matt Reeves and written by Reeves and Peter Craig, the film stars Robert Pattinson as the titular character, with Zoë Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell in supporting roles.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the second year of Batman's crime-fighting career, with the city of Gotham plagued by a series of murders committed by the Riddler (Dano). The Riddler's victims are all high-ranking officials and business leaders, and he leaves behind a trail of clues and puzzles for Batman to solve. As Batman delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a larger conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of Gotham's society.\n\nMeanwhile, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is struggling to come to terms with his own dark past and his relationship with his butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Serkis). He also finds himself drawn to Selina Kyle (Kravitz), a cat burglar with her own motives and secrets.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Batman must confront his own demons and team up with Lieutenant James Gordon (Wright) to take down the Riddler and his accomplices. Along the way, he encounters other iconic characters, including the Penguin (Farrell), a rising crime lord with a penchant for violence.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\n* Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman\n* Paul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler\n* Jeffrey Wright as Lieutenant James Gordon\n* John Turturro as Carmine Falcone\n* Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney Gil Colson\n* Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth\n* Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot / Penguin\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\n### Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck\n\nIn 2015, Ben Affleck was set to write, direct, and star in a new Batman film, which would have been part of the DC Extended Universe.

The league was formed in 1950 and has since become one of the premier football competitions in the state.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe South West Football League was established in 1950, with five founding clubs: Corowa, Culcairn, Henty, Holbrook, and Howlong. The league was formed to provide a competitive outlet for footballers in the south-western region of New South Wales, which was previously without a formal competition. Over the years, the league has undergone several changes, including the addition of new clubs and the introduction of a reserve grade competition.\n\nIn the early years, the league was dominated by the Corowa and Culcairn clubs, which won multiple premierships between them. However, as the competition grew and more clubs joined, the league became more competitive, with several clubs enjoying success. In recent years, the league has continued to grow, with the introduction of new clubs and the expansion of the competition to include under-18 and under-16 divisions.\n\nClubs\n------\n\nThe South West Football League currently consists of 12 clubs:\n\n* Corowa\n* Culcairn\n* Henty\n* Holbrook\n* Howlong\n* Jindera\n* Lockhart\n* Osborne\n* Rennie\n* Rand\n* Walla Walla\n* Billabong Crows\n\n## Reserve Grade teams\n\nEach club in the South West Football League has a reserve grade team, which competes in a separate competition. The reserve grade competition is designed to provide opportunities for younger players and those who are not yet ready for senior football.

It is one of the 14 Class J locomotives built to haul the Powhatan Arrow, a high-speed passenger train that ran between Norfolk and Cincinnati. The 611 is considered one of the most iconic and beloved steam locomotives in the United States, known for its sleek design and impressive power.\n\n# Design and abilities\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a 4-8-4 steam locomotive, with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement and a streamlined shroud. It was designed to haul high-speed passenger trains at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour. The locomotive is powered by a large boiler that produces 300 pounds of steam pressure, which is then fed to the cylinders to produce 5,400 horsepower. The 611 has a top speed of 110 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest steam locomotives in the world.\n\nThe 611 was designed to be a high-speed locomotive, and its design reflects this. The streamlined shroud helps to reduce wind resistance and improve aerodynamics, allowing the locomotive to cut through the air more efficiently. The locomotive also features a large smokebox and a distinctive finned tube arrangement, which helps to improve heat transfer and increase efficiency.\n\n# History\n\n## Revenue service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 entered revenue service in 1950, hauling the Powhatan Arrow between Norfolk and Cincinnati. The locomotive quickly became known for its speed and reliability, and it became a favorite among railfans and passengers alike. The 611 was painted in the Norfolk and Western's iconic black and gold livery, and it featured a distinctive silver stripe that ran along the side of the locomotive.\n\nDuring its time in revenue service, the 611 was maintained by the Norfolk and Western's skilled engineers and mechanics, who kept the locomotive in top condition. The locomotive was serviced regularly, and it received frequent overhauls to ensure that it remained in good working order.\n\n## First retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from revenue service in 1959, as diesel locomotives began to take over the railroads. The locomotive was stored in a roundhouse in Roanoke, Virginia, where it remained for several years. During this time, the 611 was maintained by a group of dedicated volunteers, who kept the locomotive in good condition and ensured that it remained operational.\n\n## First mainline excursion service\n\nIn 1982, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operational condition and began hauling mainline excursion trains. The locomotive was painted in its original black and gold livery, and it featured a distinctive silver stripe that ran along the side of the locomotive. The 611 quickly became a popular attraction among railfans and tourists, and it hauled numerous excursion trains throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDuring its time in excursion service, the 611 was maintained by a team of skilled engineers and mechanics, who kept the locomotive in top condition. The locomotive was serviced regularly, and it received frequent overhauls to ensure that it remained in good working order.\n\n## Second retirement\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was retired from excursion service in 1994, due to concerns about its condition and safety. The locomotive was stored in a roundhouse in Roanoke, Virginia, where it remained for several years. During this time, the 611 was maintained by a group of dedicated volunteers, who kept the locomotive in good condition and ensured that it remained operational.\n\n## Second mainline excursion service\n\nIn 2015, the Norfolk and Western 611 was restored to operational condition and began hauling mainline excursion trains once again. The locomotive was painted in its original black and gold livery, and it featured a distinctive silver stripe that ran along the side of the locomotive. The 611 quickly became a popular attraction among railfans and tourists, and it hauled numerous excursion trains throughout 2015 and 2016.\n\n## Post-NS excursion service\n\nIn 2016, the Norfolk and Western 611 was sold to the Virginia Museum of Transportation, where it is currently on display. The locomotive is still operational, and it is occasionally used for excursion trains and other special events. The 611 remains one of the most beloved and iconic steam locomotives in the United States, and it continues to be a popular attraction among railfans and tourists.\n\n# Accidents and incidents\n\nDuring its time in service, the Norfolk and Western 611 was involved in several accidents and incidents. In 1952, the locomotive was involved in a minor derailment while hauling a passenger train, but no one was injured. In 1965, the locomotive suffered a boiler failure while in storage, but it was quickly repaired and returned to service.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has appeared in several films and television shows, including the 1983 film \"The Great Train Robbery\" and the 1990s television show \"Walker, Texas Ranger.\" The locomotive has also been featured on several railroad calendars and has been the subject of numerous books and articles.\n\n# See also\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J steam locomotive\n* Powhatan Arrow\n* Virginia Museum of Transportation\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the 14 Class J locomotives built by the Norfolk and Western Railway.\n* The locomotive was designed to haul high-speed passenger trains at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour.\n* The 611 is considered one of the most iconic and beloved steam locomotives in the United States.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Virginia Museum of Transportation\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J steam locomotive", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Norfolk_and_Western_611\" following this outline:\n\n#Design and abilities\n#History\n##Revenue service\n##First retirement\n##First mainline excursion service\n##Second retirement\n##Second mainline excursion service\n##Post-NS excursion service\n#Accidents and incidents\n#In popular culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
