The dynasty is said to have ruled the world for over 2,000 years, from the time of the first king, Kayumars, to the rise of the Kayanian dynasty. The Pishdadian kings are revered for their wisdom, justice, and military prowess.\n\n# Origins, Etymology, and Sources\n\nThe term \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"Pishdad,\" meaning \"benefactor\" or \" ancestor.\" The Pishdadian dynasty is mentioned in various ancient sources, including the Avesta, the Shahnameh, and the works of the Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. The Avesta, a collection of sacred texts in the Zoroastrian tradition, provides limited information on the Pishdadian kings, while the Shahnameh offers a more detailed account of their reigns.\n\n# The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian Tradition\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Shahnameh, composed by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is the primary source of information on the Pishdadian dynasty. The epic poem tells the story of Iran's mythological and historical past, from the creation of the world to the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Pishdadian kings are central to the narrative, which emphasizes their role in shaping Iranian identity and culture.\n\n## The Kings\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is said to have begun with Kayumars, the first king, who ruled for 30 years. Kayumars was succeeded by his son, Hushang, who introduced fire worship and the use of iron tools. The next king, Tahmuras, expanded the empire and established trade relationships with neighboring countries. The most famous Pishdadian king, however, is Jamshid, who ruled for 700 years and established the city of Persepolis. Jamshid's reign was marked by great prosperity and cultural achievements, but he eventually fell victim to his own pride and was overthrown by the demon king, Zahhak.\n\n# Tabari and the Muslim Narratives\n\n## The First Pishdadian Kings and the Conflict with Iblis\n\nTabari's History of the Prophets and Kings provides a Muslim perspective on the Pishdadian dynasty. According to Tabari, the first Pishdadian king, Kayumars, was a just ruler who fought against the evil spirit Iblis. Kayumars' son, Hushang, continued his father's legacy, introducing fire worship and the use of iron tools. However, the third king, Tahmuras, faced opposition from Iblis, who sought to undermine the Pishdadian dynasty.\n\n## From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: al-Dahhak and War with the Turks\n\nTabari's account of the Pishdadian kings diverges from the Shahnameh in its description of the later kings. According to Tabari, Jam al-Shidh was succeeded by al-Dahhak, a tyrannical ruler who was overthrown by the hero Afridun. Afridun's son, Zaw, faced a major challenge from the Turks, who threatened to destroy the Pishdadian empire. Zaw's military campaigns against the Turks were ultimately successful, but the empire began to decline under his successors.\n\n# Significance\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty holds a significant place in Iranian mythology and history. The Shahnameh's account of the Pishdadian kings has shaped Iranian identity and culture, emphasizing the importance of justice, wisdom, and military prowess. The dynasty's legendary status has also influenced the development of Persian literature and art.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Pishdadian dynasty is a complex and multifaceted topic, with different sources offering varying accounts of the kings and their reigns. While the Shahnameh provides a detailed and engaging narrative, Tabari's History offers a more concise and factual account. Further research is needed to reconcile the different sources and to gain a deeper understanding of the Pishdadian dynasty's significance in Iranian history and culture.\n\n# References\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Translations of Original Sources\n\n* Ferdowsi.

The storm caused widespread damage and disruption, particularly in Japan and the Korean Peninsula.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Khanun formed as a tropical depression on August 3, 2023, in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) southeast of Okinawa, Japan. The system slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, fueled by warm waters and low wind shear. On August 5, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Khanun.\n\nOver the next few days, Khanun continued to strengthen, becoming a severe tropical storm on August 7. The storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 120 km/h (75 mph), with gusts reaching up to 150 km/h (90 mph). Khanun's central pressure dropped to 965 hPa (28.50 inHg), indicating a significant intensification of the storm.\n\nAs Khanun approached the Ryukyu Islands, the JMA upgraded it to a typhoon on August 9. The storm's winds increased further, reaching 160 km/h (100 mph), with gusts of up to 200 km/h (125 mph). Khanun's central pressure dropped to 945 hPa (27.91 inHg), making it a category 2-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n#Preparations, impact, and aftermath\n\n##Japan\n\nTyphoon Khanun brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Japan, particularly in the southern prefectures of Okinawa and Kagoshima. The storm made landfall on August 10, causing widespread power outages and property damage.\n\nIn Okinawa, winds gusting up to 180 km/h (110 mph) knocked down trees and power lines, leaving over 10,000 households without electricity. The Okinawa Prefectural Government reported that 15 people were injured, with one fatality confirmed.\n\nIn Kagoshima, the city of Kagoshima experienced its heaviest rainfall in 30 years, with over 400 mm (16 in) of rain falling in a 24-hour period. The resulting floods affected over 1,000 households, with 10 people reported missing.\n\n##Korean Peninsula\n\nTyphoon Khanun brought significant rainfall and strong winds to the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the southern regions of South Korea. The storm made landfall on August 11, causing widespread disruption and damage.\n\nIn South Korea, the city of Busan reported over 300 mm (12 in) of rain, with winds gusting up to 120 km/h (75 mph). The resulting floods affected over 5,000 households, with 20 people reported missing.\n\nIn North Korea, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Typhoon Khanun caused significant damage to crops and infrastructure, particularly in the southern provinces of South Hwanghae and North Hwanghae.\n\n##Elsewhere\n\nTyphoon Khanun also affected other countries in East Asia, including China and Taiwan.

The operation was a significant turning point in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, marking a major shift in momentum in favor of Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast had been under Russian occupation since the early days of the invasion, with the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, being a key target for Russian forces. Despite being pushed back from the city limits, Russian forces maintained control over a significant portion of the oblast, including key infrastructure and transportation hubs. Ukrainian forces had been conducting a series of local counterattacks and guerrilla operations in the oblast, but a major breakthrough had yet to be achieved.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been gathering intelligence and preparing for a major operation. Ukrainian commanders had identified weaknesses in the Russian defenses, including a lack of manpower and equipment, as well as poor communication and coordination between Russian units. Ukrainian forces had also been conducting a series of small-scale attacks and reconnaissance missions to test Russian defenses and gather information on their troop movements and dispositions.\n\n# Counteroffensive\n\n## First Phase (6–12 September 2022)\n\n### Initial Advance\n\nOn September 6, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast, with the aim of pushing Russian forces back from the city of Kharkiv and liberating the surrounding territory. Ukrainian forces advanced on multiple axes, using a combination of infantry, armor, and artillery to break through Russian defenses. The initial advance was rapid, with Ukrainian forces making significant gains in the first 24 hours of the operation.\n\n### Breakthrough\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Ukrainian forces achieved a major breakthrough in the Russian defenses, pushing through the key town of Balakliia and advancing deep into Russian-held territory. The breakthrough was facilitated by the use of precision artillery and drone strikes, which allowed Ukrainian forces to target Russian command and control centers, as well as key infrastructure and logistics hubs.\n\n### Russian Withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast West of Oskil River\n\nIn the face of the Ukrainian advance, Russian forces began to withdraw from the Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was chaotic, with Russian forces abandoning equipment and supplies as they retreated. Ukrainian forces pursued the retreating Russians, inflicting significant casualties and capturing large quantities of equipment and supplies.\n\n### Other Gains and Casualties\n\nOver the course of the first phase of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces made significant gains in the Kharkiv Oblast, liberating numerous towns and villages, including the key town of Izyum. Ukrainian forces also inflicted significant casualties on Russian forces, including several high-ranking officers. However, the operation was not without cost, with Ukrainian forces suffering significant casualties, including several hundred killed and wounded.\n\n## Battle of Shevchenkove\n\nIn the aftermath of the breakthrough, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks on the town of Shevchenkove, which was a key Russian logistics hub. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering significant casualties. However, Ukrainian forces ultimately emerged victorious, capturing the town and inflicting significant damage on Russian forces.\n\n## Second Phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n\n### Oskil River Crossing\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River, which marked the boundary between the Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts. The operation was successful, with Ukrainian forces establishing a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the river.\n\n### Encirclement and Recapture of Lyman\n\nIn the aftermath of the river crossing, Ukrainian forces launched a series of attacks on the town of Lyman, which was a key Russian stronghold. The battle was intense, with both sides suffering significant casualties. However, Ukrainian forces ultimately emerged victorious, encircling and capturing the town, and inflicting significant damage on Russian forces.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Russia\n\nThe Russian government was caught off guard by the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and initially struggled to respond effectively. Russian officials accused Ukraine of launching a \"massive\" and \"unprovoked\" attack, and vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to defend Russian territory.

The coup marked a significant turning point in Niger's recent history, which had been characterized by a fragile democracy and growing instability.\n\n# Background\n\nNiger, a landlocked country in West Africa, had been facing numerous challenges in the years leading up to the coup. The country was struggling with poverty, corruption, and insecurity, particularly in the north, where Islamist militants had been active. Despite these challenges, Niger had made significant progress in consolidating its democracy, with President Mohamed Bazoum winning the 2020 presidential election in a relatively peaceful and transparent process.\n\nHowever, Bazoum's government faced growing opposition and criticism from various quarters, including the military, which had been dissatisfied with the government's handling of the security situation in the north. The military had also been concerned about the government's decision to reduce the military's budget and personnel, which they saw as a threat to their interests.\n\n# Events\n\n## 26 July\n\n### Bazoum's detention\n\nOn the morning of 26 July, President Bazoum was detained by a group of military officers at the Presidential Palace in Niamey, the capital city of Niger. The officers, who were reportedly from the Presidential Guard, took control of the palace and surrounding areas, and Bazoum was placed under house arrest.\n\n### Military mobilization\n\nFollowing Bazoum's detention, the military began to mobilize its forces across the country. Troops were deployed to key locations, including government buildings, airports, and border crossings. The military also imposed a curfew and restricted movement in the capital city.\n\n### Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n\nLater in the day, a group of military officers appeared on national television to announce the overthrow of President Bazoum. The officers, who identified themselves as the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), claimed that they had taken power to restore stability and security in the country.\n\n## 27 July\n\n### Bazoum's response\n\nOn 27 July, President Bazoum released a statement through his social media accounts, condemning the coup and calling on the military to stand down. Bazoum also appealed to the international community to intervene and restore democracy in Niger.\n\n### Military recognition of the junta\n\nDespite Bazoum's appeal, the military continued to consolidate its power. The CNSP, which had taken control of the government, began to appoint new officials and governors to key positions. The military also received recognition from some neighboring countries, including Burkina Faso and Mali, which had also experienced military coups in recent years.\n\n## 28 July\n\nOn 28 July, the CNSP announced the formation of a transitional government, which would be headed by a civilian prime minister. The move was seen as an attempt by the military to legitimize its rule and appease the international community.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the coup was marked by uncertainty and instability. The international community, including the African Union and the European Union, condemned the coup and called for the restoration of democracy in Niger. The United States and France, which had been key partners of Niger's government, also suspended their military cooperation with the country.\n\nThe coup also had significant humanitarian implications. The country's economy, which was already struggling, was severely impacted by the coup, with many businesses and markets closing down. The humanitarian situation in the north, where many people were already displaced, also deteriorated further.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe reaction to the coup within Niger was mixed. Some people welcomed the coup, seeing it as an opportunity to bring about change and stability in the country. Others, however, were strongly opposed to the coup, viewing it as a threat to democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community was quick to condemn the coup. The African Union, the European Union, and the United Nations all issued statements calling for the restoration of democracy in Niger. The United States and France, which had been key partners of Niger's government, also suspended their military cooperation with the country.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2023 Nigerien coup d'état was a complex and multifaceted event that reflected the deep-seated challenges facing Niger's democracy. The coup was the result of a combination of factors, including the country's fragile economy, its porous borders, and the growing discontent within the military.\n\nThe coup also highlighted the fragility of democracy in West Africa, where several countries have experienced military takeovers in recent years. The international community's response to the coup was swift and decisive, but it remains to be seen whether the country will be able to return to democratic rule.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Nigerien_coup_d'état\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##26 July\n###Bazoum's detention\n###Military mobilization\n###Announcement of Bazoum's overthrow\n##27 July\n###Bazoum's response\n###Military recognition of the junta\n##28 July\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The rebellion was sparked by a series of events, including internal tensions within the Wagner Group and a perceived betrayal by the Russian government.\n\nBackground\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and close associate of President Vladimir Putin, founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The Wagner Group is a private military company (PMC) that has been involved in various conflicts, including the Syrian Civil War and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The group has been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses in these conflicts.\n\nInternal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nIn 2022, the Wagner Group was involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where they suffered significant losses. Internal tensions within the group began to rise, with some members expressing dissatisfaction with the group's leadership and the Russian government's handling of the war.\n\nOrder to integrate Wagner\n\nIn May 2023, the Russian government ordered the Wagner Group to integrate into the Russian military, which was seen as a move to bring the group under greater state control. This order was met with resistance from Prigozhin, who saw it as a threat to his authority and the group's autonomy.\n\nPlanning the rebellion\n\nPrigozhin and his associates began to secretly plan a rebellion against the Russian government, which would involve the Wagner Group and other sympathetic forces. The plan was to march on Moscow and overthrow the government, which Prigozhin saw as corrupt and ineffective.\n\nRebellion\n\nPrigozhin's statements\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Prigozhin released a statement in which he rebuked the Russian government and alleged that the Wagner Group had been attacked by Russian military forces. He called on his followers to prepare for a rebellion against the government.\n\nRebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nPrigozhin accused the Russian government of betraying the Wagner Group and of attempting to destroy the group. He alleged that Russian military forces had attacked Wagner Group positions in Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of several group members.\n\nCall to rebellion\n\nPrigozhin called on his followers to rise up against the Russian government, which he saw as corrupt and ineffective. He promised that the Wagner Group would lead the rebellion and that they would bring about a new era of freedom and prosperity in Russia.\n\nCapture of Rostov-on-Don\n\nOn June 24, 2023, the Wagner Group captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, which is a key strategic location in southern Russia. The group's forces took control of the city's airport, train station, and other key infrastructure.\n\nAdvance towards Moscow\n\nThe Wagner Group began to advance towards Moscow, which is the capital of Russia. The group's forces moved quickly, taking control of several key cities and towns along the way.\n\nSecurity measures\n\nThe Russian government responded to the rebellion by imposing security measures, including a curfew and restrictions on movement. The government also deployed military forces to counter the Wagner Group's advance.\n\nEvents in Syria\n\nThe rebellion also had implications for the Syrian Civil War, where the Wagner Group had been involved in fighting on behalf of the Syrian government. The group's withdrawal from Syria created a power vacuum, which was filled by other forces.\n\nResolution\n\nThe rebellion was eventually put down by the Russian government, which deployed military forces to counter the Wagner Group's advance. Prigozhin and his associates were forced to flee, and the group's leadership was dismantled.\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic\n\nVladimir Putin's address\n\nOn June 25, 2023, President Vladimir Putin addressed the nation, condemning the rebellion and promising to take action against those responsible. Putin accused Prigozhin of treason and promised to bring him to justice.\n\nOther government-aligned figures\n\nOther government-aligned figures, including politicians and military leaders, condemned the rebellion and expressed support for Putin.\n\nAnti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n\nAnti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups expressed support for the rebellion, seeing it as a chance to bring about change in Russia.\n\nUltranationalists and milbloggers\n\nUltranationalists and milbloggers, who had previously supported the Wagner Group, condemned the rebellion and accused Prigozhin of treason.\n\nWider public\n\nThe wider public was largely divided on the rebellion, with some people expressing suppor", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Wagner_Group_rebellion\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n##Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n###Order to integrate Wagner\n##Planning the rebellion\n#Rebellion\n##Prigozhin's statements\n###Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n###Call to rebellion\n##Capture of Rostov-on-Don\n##Advance towards Moscow\n##Security measures\n##Events in Syria\n#Resolution\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n###Vladimir Putin's address\n###Other government-aligned figures\n###Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups\n###Ultranationalists and milbloggers\n###Wider public\n##International\n#Aftermath\n##Fallout and restoring order\n##Subsequent statements\n##Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n###Closure of criminal case and initial statements\n###Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests\n###Prigozhin's return to Russia\n###Death of Prigozhin and Utkin\n##Measures of NATO countries\n#Analysis\n##Political\n##Military\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This led to the resignation of 25 members of the Provincial Assembly, who had defected to the PML-N.

Nonmetals are typically characterized by their inability to conduct electricity and their tendency to gain electrons to form anions. They are often found on the right-hand side of the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is a nonmetal but is located on the far left of the periodic table.\n\n# Definition and applicable elements\n\nNonmetals are defined as elements that do not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals, such as the ability to conduct electricity, malleability, and ductility. Nonmetals are typically found in the p-block of the periodic table, which includes the elements in groups 13-18. These elements are often referred to as the nonmetal elements or the p-block elements.\n\n# General properties\n\n## Physical\n\nNonmetals typically exhibit a range of physical properties that distinguish them from metals. These properties include:\n\n* Low melting and boiling points: Nonmetals typically have low melting and boiling points compared to metals.\n* Low density: Nonmetals are typically less dense than metals.\n* Brittle: Nonmetals are often brittle and lack the malleability and ductility of metals.\n\n### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals exist in multiple allotropes, which are different forms of the same element. For example, carbon exists as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes, while sulfur exists as orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals.\n\n## Chemical\n\nNonmetals typically exhibit a range of chemical properties that distinguish them from metals. These properties include:\n\n* Tendency to gain electrons: Nonmetals tend to gain electrons to form anions.\n* Formation of covalent bonds: Nonmetals typically form covalent bonds with other nonmetals.\n* Low reactivity: Nonmetals are often less reactive than metals.\n\n## Complications\n\nWhile the general properties of nonmetals provide a good starting point for understanding these elements, there are several complications that arise when dealing with the chemistry of nonmetals.\n\n### First row anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table, which includes hydrogen, helium, and lithium, exhibits anomalous behavior when compared to the rest of the nonmetals. This is due to the small size of the atoms in the first row, which leads to a range of unusual properties.\n\n### Secondary periodicity\n\nSecondary periodicity refers to the periodic trends that occur within a group of elements. For example, the chemistry of the halogens (group 17) exhibits a range of periodic trends, including the decrease in electronegativity down the group.\n\n### Higher oxidation states\n\nSome nonmetals are capable of exhibiting higher oxidation states, which can lead to a range of unusual properties. For example, phosphorus can exhibit oxidation states ranging from -3 to +5.\n\n### Multiple bond formation\n\nSome nonmetals are capable of forming multiple bonds, which can lead to a range of unusual properties. For example, carbon is capable of forming double and triple bonds, which are essential for the chemistry of organic compounds.\n\n### Property overlaps\n\nWhile the properties of nonmetals provide a good starting point for understanding these elements, there are several property overlaps that occur between nonmetals and metals. For example, some nonmetals, such as graphite and diamond, exhibit metallic properties under certain conditions.\n\n# Types\n\nNonmetals can be broadly classified into three categories: noble gases, halogen nonmetals, and unclassified nonmetals.\n\n## Noble gases\n\nNoble gases are a group of nonmetals that are located in group 18 of the periodic table. These elements are characterized by their full outer energy level, which makes them extremely unreactive.\n\n## Halogen nonmetals\n\nHalogen nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that are located in group 17 of the periodic table. These elements are characterized by their high electronegativity and their tendency to gain electrons to form anions.\n\n## Unclassified nonmetals\n\nUnclassified nonmetals are a group of nonmetals that do not fit into either the noble gas or halogen nonmetal categories. These elements are located in groups 13-16 of the periodic table and are characterized by a range of properties that distinguish them from metals.\n\n# Abundance, extraction, and uses\n\n## Abundance\n\nNonmetals are relatively rare in the Earth's crust, with the exception of oxygen, silicon, and aluminum. However, many nonmetals are abundant in the atmosphere, including nitrogen, oxygen, and argon.\n\n## Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from the Earth's crust through a range of processes, including mining, smelting, and electrolysis.\n\n## Uses\n\nNonmetals have a range of uses, including:\n\n* Electronics: Nonmetals are used in the production of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and televisions.\n* Energy: Nonmetals are used in the production of energy, including the generation of electricity and the production of fuels.\n* Aerospace: Nonmetals are used in the production of aerospace materials, including rocket components and aircraft parts.\n\n# Taxonomical history\n\nThe concept of nonmetals has a long history that dates back to the early days of chemistry.\n\n## Background\n\nThe early chemists recognized that certain elements did not exhibit the characteristic properties of metals, including the ability to conduct electricity and the tendency to form cations.\n\n## Organization of elements by types\n\nThe organization of elements by types was first proposed by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century. Lavoisier recognized that elements could be broadly classified into metals and nonmetals.\n\n## Development of types\n\nThe development of the concept of nonmetals continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with the recognition of new types of nonmetals, including the noble gases and the halogen nonmetals.\n\n## Suggested distinguishing criteria\n\nThe suggested distinguishing criteria for nonmetals include:\n\n* Inability to conduct electricity\n* Tendency to gain electrons to form anions\n* Formation of covalent bonds with other nonmetals\n* Low reactivity\n\n# Comparison of selected properties\n\n## Physical properties by element type\n\n| Element type | Melting point (°C) | Boiling point (°C) | Density (g/cm³) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble gases | -259 to -189 | -259 to -186 | 0.17 to 1.40 |\n| Halogen nonmetals | -250 to -35 | -250 to 58 | 1.50 to 6.20 |\n| Unclassified nonmetals | -250 to 2800 | -250 to 4000 | 1.50 to 5.00 |\n\n## Chemical properties by element type\n\n| Element type | Electronegativity | Ionization energy (kJ/mol) | Electron affinity (kJ/mol) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Noble gases | 0.5 to 2.5 | 1000 to 2500 | -50 to 0 |\n| Halogen nonmetals | 2.5 to 4.0 | 1000 to 2000 | -200 to -100 |\n| Unclassified nonmetals | 1.5 to 3.5 | 500 to 1500 | -100 to 100 |\n\n# See also\n\n* Metal\n* Metalloid\n* Periodic table\n* Chemistry\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual overview of nonmetals and is intended to provide a general understanding of these elements.\n\n# References\n\nThis article is a factual overview of nonmetals and does not include any references.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nThis article is a factual overview of nonmetals and does not include any bibliography.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article is a factual overview of nonmetals and does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nonmetal\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and applicable elements\n#General properties\n##Physical\n###Allotropes\n##Chemical\n##Complications\n###First row anomaly\n###Secondary periodicity\n###Higher oxidation states\n###Multiple bond formation\n###Property overlaps\n#Types\n##Noble gases\n##Halogen nonmetals\n##Unclassified nonmetals\n#Abundance, extraction, and uses\n##Abundance\n##Extraction\n##Uses\n#Taxonomical history\n##Background\n##Organization of elements by types\n##Development of types\n##Suggested distinguishing criteria\n#Comparison of selected properties\n##Physical properties by element type\n##Chemical properties by element type\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Grusch's story has garnered significant attention from the media, the public, and experts in the field, leading to a mix of fascination, skepticism, and debate. This article provides an overview of Grusch's background, his public claims, and the responses from relevant experts, the United States government, and the media.\n\n#Background\n\nDavid Grusch is a former employee of a private aerospace company, where he claims to have worked on reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Grusch's background and credentials have not been publicly verified, but he has stated that he has a degree in mechanical engineering and has worked on various projects related to aerospace and defense.\n\n#Grusch's public claims\n\nGrusch's claims include working on a secret government program that involved reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology, including propulsion systems and materials. He has also claimed to have seen and worked on extraterrestrial spacecraft, which he describes as being made of unknown materials and having advanced propulsion systems. Grusch has stated that he was part of a team of scientists and engineers who were brought in to study and replicate the technology, but that the program was shut down due to concerns about the implications of the technology.\n\nGrusch has also claimed that he has been in contact with extraterrestrial beings and has received messages from them, which he believes are related to the technology he worked on. He has stated that he believes the extraterrestrial beings are peaceful and are trying to communicate with humanity, but that the government has been trying to cover up the truth.\n\n#Response from relevant experts\n\nExperts in the fields of aerospace, engineering, and physics have expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims. Many have pointed out that the technology he describes is not possible with our current understanding of physics and materials science. Others have questioned the lack of evidence and the fact that Grusch's claims have not been peer-reviewed or published in any reputable scientific journals.\n\nSome experts have also pointed out that Grusch's claims are similar to those made by other self-proclaimed UFO whistleblowers, who have been debunked as hoaxers or fantasists. They have also noted that Grusch's story has many of the hallmarks of a classic UFO tale, including the claim of being part of a secret government program and the alleged contact with extraterrestrial beings.\n\n#United States government responses\n\n##Department of Defense and NASA statements\n\nThe United States Department of Defense and NASA have both issued statements denying any involvement in a secret government program to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial technology. The Department of Defense has stated that it has no evidence to support Grusch's claims and that it is not aware of any secret program related to extraterrestrial technology.\n\nNASA has also issued a statement saying that it has no evidence to support Grusch's claims and that it is not involved in any program related to extraterrestrial technology. NASA has also pointed out that the technology Grusch describes is not possible with our current understanding of physics and materials science.\n\n##Congressional action and comments from members\n\nIn 2023, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing on the topic of UFO sightings and alleged extraterrestrial technology. The hearing included testimony from Grusch, as well as other self-proclaimed UFO whistleblowers.\n\nSome members of Congress have expressed skepticism about Grusch's claims, while others have called for further investigation into the matter. Representative Mark Walker (R-NC) has called for a full investigation into Grusch's claims, saying that \"the American people deserve to know the truth.\"\n\n##2023 House Committee Oversight and Accountability hearing\n\nDuring the 2023 House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing, Grusch testified about his claims of working on reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology. Grusch was questioned by members of the committee, including Representative Walker, who asked him to provide evidence to support his claims.\n\nGrusch provided no new evidence during the hearing, but instead reiterated his previous claims. He also stated that he had been in contact with extraterrestrial beings and had received messages from them, which he believed were related to the technology he worked on.\n\n#Sean Kirkpatrick\n\nSean Kirkpatrick is a physicist who has been involved in the study of UFO sightings and alleged extraterrestrial technology. Kirkpatrick has been critical of Grusch's claims, saying that they are not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nKirkpatrick has also pointed out that Grusch's story has many of the hallmarks of a classic UFO tale, including the claim of being part of a secret government program and the alleged contact with extraterrestrial beings. Kirkpatrick has stated that he believes Grusch's claims are likely the result of a hoax or a fantasy.\n\n#Media reporting on Grusch's claims\n\n##Connections to studies funded by Robert Bigelow\n\nSome media outlets have reported on the connections between Grusch's claims and studies funded by Robert Bigelow, a billionaire entrepreneur who has funded research into UFO sightings and alleged extraterrestrial technology.\n\nBigelow's company, Bigelow Aerospace, has funded research into the study of UFO sightings and alleged extraterrestrial technology. Grusch has stated that he has worked with Bigelow Aerospace on projects related to reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology.\n\n##Reporting on psychiatric treatment received by Grusch\n\nSome media outlets have reported on Grusch's history of psychiatric treatment, including his admission to a psychiatric hospital in 2019. Grusch has stated that he was treated for anxiety and depression, but that his treatment was unrelated to his claims of working on reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology.\n\n##News stories and commentary\n\nMany news outlets have reported on Grusch's claims, with some outlets expressing skepticism about his story. Some commentators have pointed out that Grusch's claims are not supported by scientific evidence and that his story has many of the hallmarks of a classic UFO tale.\n\n##Disinformation campaign allegations from media pundits\n\nSome media pundits have alleged that Grusch's claims are part of a disinformation campaign to distract from real issues.

The storm caused widespread damage, power outages, and loss of life, making it one of the most significant weather events of the year.\n\n#Meteorology\n\nStorm Eunice was a complex low-pressure system that developed over the North Atlantic Ocean on February 14, 2022. The storm rapidly intensified as it moved eastwards, driven by a strong jet stream and a contrast between cold Arctic air and mild air from the Gulf Stream. Eunice's central pressure dropped to around 960 mbar, making it a deep and powerful storm.\n\nAs Eunice approached the European coast, it began to undergo a process called \"explosive cyclogenesis,\" where the storm's central pressure drops rapidly, leading to a significant increase in wind speed. This process resulted in hurricane-force winds, with gusts exceeding 150 km/h (93 mph) in some areas.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe impact of Storm Eunice was felt across many countries in Western and Central Europe.

The riots were characterized by widespread looting, arson, and clashes between protesters and police, resulting in significant damage to property and cultural sites.\n\n# Background\n\n## Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Nahel Merzouk, a 17-year-old French teenager of Algerian descent, was shot and killed by a police officer in the commune of Nanterre, a suburb of Paris. The incident occurred during a traffic stop, and the police officer claimed that Merzouk had attempted to drive away and had threatened him with a screwdriver. However, eyewitnesses disputed this account, stating that Merzouk had been unarmed and had not posed a threat to the officer.\n\n## 2017 law concerning traffic stops\n\nIn 2017, the French government passed a law allowing police officers to conduct traffic stops and identity checks without suspicion of a crime. The law was intended to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks, but it has been criticized for leading to increased racial profiling and police brutality.\n\n## Civil unrest related to policing\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots were not an isolated incident of civil unrest related to policing in France. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of police brutality and racial profiling, leading to widespread protests and calls for reform.\n\n## Police brutality in France\n\nPolice brutality is a significant problem in France, with many cases of excessive force and racial profiling reported in recent years. In 2020, the French government was forced to apologize for the beating of a black man by police officers, which was captured on video and sparked widespread outrage.\n\n## Racial profiling and false reporting\n\nRacial profiling is a widespread problem in France, with many minority communities reporting that they are disproportionately targeted by police. In addition, there have been several cases of false reporting by police officers, which has further eroded trust in the police.\n\n## Social problems\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots also highlighted deeper social problems in France, including poverty, unemployment, and lack of opportunities for minority communities. Many of the rioters were young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who felt that they had been left behind by society.\n\n# Events\n\n## Metropolitan France\n\n### 27–28 June\n\nThe riots began on June 27, 2023, in the commune of Nanterre, where Nahel Merzouk was killed. Protesters clashed with police, and several vehicles were set on fire. The riots quickly spread to other parts of metropolitan France, including Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\n\n### 29–30 June\n\nOn June 29, 2023, the riots intensified, with widespread looting and arson reported in several cities. The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, but were often outnumbered by the protesters.\n\n### 1–2 July\n\nOn July 1, 2023, the French government deployed the military to help restore order. However, the riots continued, with protesters targeting police stations and other government buildings.\n\n### 3–4 July\n\nOn July 3, 2023, the French government announced a curfew in several cities, but the riots continued. The police reported that they had arrested several hundred people, but many more remained at large.\n\n### 8 July\n\nOn July 8, 2023, the riots began to subside, with fewer incidents reported. However, the damage had already been done, with many businesses and cultural sites destroyed.\n\n### 10 July\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the French government announced that it would establish a commission to investigate the causes of the riots and recommend reforms.\n\n## Overseas France\n\nThe riots also spread to overseas France, including the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. Protesters clashed with police, and several buildings were set on fire.\n\n## International\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots attracted international attention, with many countries expressing concern about the violence and calling for calm. The United States, in particular, issued a statement condemning the violence and calling for reforms.\n\n# Damage to cultural sites\n\nThe Nahel Merzouk riots resulted in significant damage to cultural sites, including museums, libraries, and historic buildings. Many of these sites were looted or set on fire, resulting in the loss of irreplaceable cultural artifacts.\n\n# Estimated cost of the riots\n\nThe estimated cost of the riots is difficult to determine, but it is likely to be in the billions of euros. Many businesses were destroyed, and several cities are still recovering from the damage.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Public officials and media\n\nPublic officials and media outlets were quick to condemn the violence, calling for calm and an end to the riots. However, many also acknowledged that the riots were a symptom of deeper social problems that needed to be addressed.\n\n## Police violence\n\nThe police were criticized for their handling of the riots, with many accusing them of using excessive force. However, the police also reported that they had been subjected to violence and intimidation by protesters.\n\n## Police revolt\n\nIn the aftermath of the riots, several police unions called for a revolt, accusing the government of failing to support them. The government responded by promising to increase funding for the police and to provide them with more resources.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThe riots were also marked by widespread misinformation, with many false reports and rumors circulating on social media. This further fueled the violence and made it more difficult for authorities to respond.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racial profiling in France\n* Social unrest in France\n* List of riots in France", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nahel_Merzouk_riots\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Killing of Nahel Merzouk\n##2017 law concerning traffic stops\n##Civil unrest related to policing\n##Police brutality in France\n##Racial profiling and false reporting\n##Social problems\n#Events\n##Metropolitan France\n###27–28 June\n###29–30 June\n###1–2 July\n###3–4 July\n###8 July\n###10 July\n##Overseas France\n##International\n#Damage to cultural sites\n#Estimated cost of the riots\n#Reactions\n##Public officials and media\n##Police violence\n##Police revolt\n##Misinformation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The path is a popular route for both recreational and commuter cyclists, providing a scenic and relatively flat route through the Sepulveda Basin and the Ballona Wetlands.\n\n#Route\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the intersection of National Boulevard and Duquesne Avenue in Culver City and ends at the Marina del Rey shoreline. The path follows the Ballona Creek channel, which is a concrete-lined waterway that drains into the Santa Monica Bay. Along the way, the path passes through the Sepulveda Basin, a large flood control basin that is also home to several parks and recreational facilities.\n\n##Airport\n\nOne of the notable features of the Ballona Creek Bike Path is its proximity to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The path passes under several airport runways, providing a unique perspective on air travel. However, this also means that the path can be noisy, especially during peak flight hours.\n\n#Conditions\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally well-maintained and suitable for riders of all skill levels. However, there are some conditions that riders should be aware of.\n\n##Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and parks along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area and the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve. These areas provide amenities such as restrooms, drinking water, and picnic tables.\n\n##Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has a history of homeless camping. While efforts have been made to address the issue, riders may still encounter homeless encampments along the path. This can be a concern for safety, especially at night.\n\n#Access gates\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has several access gates, which are designed to prevent vehicles from entering the path. However, these gates can also be a barrier for cyclists with disabilities or those who are towing trailers. Riders should be aware of the location of these gates and plan their route accordingly.\n\n#History\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a long history, dating back to the 1930s when the Ballona Creek channel was first constructed. The path was originally designed as a utility corridor for the creek, but it soon became popular with cyclists and pedestrians. Over the years, the path has been improved and expanded, with the addition of amenities such as rest stops and lighting.\n\n#Improvements\n\nThere have been several improvements to the Ballona Creek Bike Path in recent years. These include the installation of new lighting and signage, as well as the repair of damaged pavement. Additionally, there have been efforts to address the issue of homeless camping along the path.\n\n#Proposed extensions\n\nThere are currently several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path. These include a connection to the Expo Line bike path and an extension to the Venice Beach Bike Path. These extensions would provide a more seamless and convenient route for cyclists, as well as improve access to local destinations.\n\n#Gallery\n\n[Insert images of the Ballona Creek Bike Path]\n\n#See also\n\n* Ballona Creek\n* Sepulveda Basin\n* Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Expo Line bike path\n* Venice Beach Bike Path\n\n#References\n\n[Insert references]\n\n#External links\n\n* Los Angeles County Department of Public Works: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* City of Los Angeles: Ballona Creek Bike Path\n* Ballona Creek Renaissance: Ballona Creek Bike Path", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquakes were felt across the region, with the epicenter located near the city of Gaziantep, Turkey. The disaster is considered one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 21st century, with thousands of people killed and many more injured or displaced.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\n## Geology\n\nThe region where the earthquakes occurred is located near the boundary between the Arabian and Anatolian tectonic plates. The Arabian plate is moving northwards towards the Eurasian plate, resulting in a zone of deformation that is characterized by faulting, folding, and volcanism. The Anatolian plate is being pushed westwards by the Arabian plate, resulting in a zone of extensional tectonics.\n\n## Seismicity\n\nThe region has a long history of seismic activity, with many significant earthquakes occurring in the past. The North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is a major transform fault that runs east-west across northern Turkey, and is responsible for many of the region's largest earthquakes. The East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) is another major fault zone that runs northeast-southwest across eastern Turkey, and is also capable of producing large earthquakes.\n\n# Earthquake Sequence\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe initial earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, with many of these being significant in their own right. The aftershocks continued to occur in the days and weeks following the initial earthquake, with some being strong enough to cause additional damage and injuries.\n\n## Seismology\n\nThe earthquakes were characterized by a complex rupture process, with multiple faults being involved. The initial earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8, with a focal depth of approximately 18 km. The earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, including one with a magnitude of 7.5.\n\n## Rupture Propagation\n\nThe rupture propagation of the earthquake was complex, with multiple faults being involved. The initial rupture occurred on a previously unknown fault, with the rupture then propagating onto the EAFZ. The rupture propagation was characterized by a series of jumps, with the rupture jumping from one fault to another.\n\n## Surface Rupture\n\nThe earthquake resulted in significant surface rupture, with many roads and buildings being damaged or destroyed. The surface rupture was characterized by a series of fissures and scarps, with some being several meters high.\n\n## Ground Motion\n\nThe earthquake resulted in significant ground motion, with many areas experiencing strong shaking. The ground motion was characterized by a series of peaks and troughs, with some areas experiencing shaking that was strong enough to cause liquefaction.\n\n## Geological Effects\n\nThe earthquake resulted in significant geological effects, including landslides and rockfalls. Many areas experienced liquefaction, with some areas experiencing subsidence.\n\n## Tsunami\n\nThere was no tsunami associated with the earthquake, as the epicenter was located inland.\n\n## Effects on Other Faults\n\nThe earthquake may have had an impact on other faults in the region, with some faults being loaded or unloaded by the earthquake. The earthquake may have also triggered earthquakes on other faults, although this is not yet clear.\n\n# Damage and Casualties\n\n## In Turkey\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread damage and loss of life in Turkey, with many buildings being destroyed or damaged. The city of Gaziantep was particularly hard hit, with many buildings collapsing. The city of Kahramanmaraş was also severely affected, with many buildings being destroyed.\n\n## In Syria\n\nThe earthquake also caused significant damage and loss of life in Syria, with many buildings being destroyed or damaged. The city of Aleppo was particularly hard hit, with many buildings collapsing. The city of Idlib was also severely affected, with many buildings being destroyed.\n\n## Foreign Casualties\n\nThere were also foreign casualties, with many people from other countries being killed or injured. The majority of foreign casualties were from countries in the Middle East and Europe.\n\n## Effects in Other Countries\n\nThe earthquake was felt in many other countries, with some countries experiencing significant shaking. The earthquake was felt as far away as Greece and Cyprus.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe aftershocks continued to occur in the days and weeks following the initial earthquake, with some being strong enough to cause additional damage and injuries.\n\n## Estimations of Losses\n\nThe estimations of losses are still being calculated, but it is clear that the earthquake has caused significant economic and human losses. The Turkish government has estimated that the earthquake has caused over $10 billion in damages.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Turkey\n\n### Search and Rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were led by the Turkish government, with many teams being deployed to affected areas. The search and rescue efforts were hampered by the scale of the disaster, with many areas being difficult to access.\n\n### Charity and Volunteer Campaigns\n\nThere were many charity and volunteer campaigns, with many organizations providing aid and support to affected areas. The Turkish Red Crescent was one of the main organizations providing aid and support.\n\n### Government Assistance\n\nThe Turkish government provided significant assistance, with many resources being deployed to affected areas. The government also provided financial assistance to affected families.\n\n### Incidents\n\nThere were many incidents, including looting and violence. The Turkish government deployed security forces to affected areas to maintain order.\n\n### Crime and Conflict\n\nThere were also reports of crime and conflict, with some areas experiencing clashes between rival groups.\n\n### Floods\n\nThere were also floods, with some areas experiencing significant flooding.\n\n### 2023 Elections\n\nThe earthquake had an impact on the 2023 Turkish presidential election, with the election being postponed due to the disaster.\n\n### Education\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on education, with many schools being destroyed or damaged. The Turkish government provided alternative education arrangements for affected students.\n\n### Sports\n\nThe earthquake had an impact on sports, with many sports events being cancelled or postponed.\n\n## Syria\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on Syria, with many areas experiencing significant damage and loss of life. The Syrian government provided significant assistance, with many resources being deployed to affected areas.\n\n# International Humanitarian Efforts\n\n## Countries\n\nMany countries provided humanitarian aid and support, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n## Arab League\n\nThe Arab League provided significant humanitarian aid and support, with many member states providing assistance.\n\n## ASEAN\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) provided humanitarian aid and support, with many member states providing assistance.\n\n## European Union (EU)\n\nThe European Union provided significant humanitarian aid and support, with many member states providing assistance.\n\n## North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) provided humanitarian aid and support, with many member states providing assistance.\n\n## United Nations (UN)\n\nThe United Nations provided significant humanitarian aid and support, with many agencies providing assistance.\n\n## World Bank\n\nThe World Bank provided financial assistance, with a significant loan being provided to Turkey.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Criticism of the Turkish Government\n\nThere was significant criticism of the Turkish government, with many accusing the government of being slow to respond to the disaster.\n\n### Disaster Management\n\nThere was criticism of the government's disaster management, with many accusing the government of being unprepared for the disaster.\n\n### Media\n\nThere was also criticism of the government's media response, with many accusing the government of censoring news and restricting access to affected areas.\n\n## Criminal Investigation in Turkey\n\nThere was a criminal investigation in Turkey, with many officials being investigated for negligence and corruption.\n\n## National Mourning\n\nThere was a national mourning period, with many flags being flown at half-mast.\n\n## Criticism by the Syrian Government and Opposition\n\nThere was criticism of the Syrian government and opposition, with many accusing them of being slow to respond to the disaster.\n\n## Health Concerns\n\nThere were significant health concerns, with many people being treated for injuries and illnesses.\n\n# Commemorations\n\nThere were many commemorations, with many services being held to remember the victims of the earthquake.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Turkey\n* List of earthquakes in Syria\n* 1999 İzmit earthquake\n* 2011 Van earthquake\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Turkey-Syria Earthquake: A Review of the Disaster\".

Locke was not the target of the search warrant, but he was present in the apartment where the warrant was executed.\n\nThe Minneapolis police officer who shot Locke was Mark Hanneman, a 13-year veteran of the force. Hanneman was part of the SWAT team that executed the search warrant.\n\n### Search warrant\n\nThe search warrant was issued by a Hennepin County judge in connection with a St. Paul homicide investigation. The warrant was for the apartment where Locke lived, which was also occupied by his cousin, Mekhi Camden Speed. Speed was a suspect in the homicide investigation.\n\nIncident\n\nOn February 2, 2022, at around 6:48 a.m., the Minneapolis Police Department's SWAT team executed a no-knock search warrant at the apartment where Locke lived. Locke was asleep on the couch when the officers entered the apartment. He was holding a firearm, which he was licensed to own.\n\nAccording to body camera footage, Locke was shot by Officer Hanneman within 10 seconds of the officers entering the apartment. Locke died shortly after being shot.\n\nInvestigations\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Investigation (BCA) launched an investigation into Locke's death. The BCA reviewed body camera footage, interviewed witnesses, and collected evidence from the scene.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department also launched an internal investigation into the incident. The department's Office of Police Conduct Review examined the actions of the officers involved and the policies and procedures that governed their conduct.\n\nNo-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n\nFollowing Locke's death, the Minneapolis City Council imposed a moratorium on the use of no-knock warrants. The council also called for reforms to the city's policing policies, including greater transparency and accountability.\n\nIn response to Locke's killing, the Minnesota state legislature introduced bills to restrict the use of no-knock warrants and to increase transparency and accountability in policing.\n\nReaction\n\n### Family\n\nLocke's family was devastated by his death. His mother, Karen Locke, described him as a \"beautiful soul\" who was \"taken from us too soon.\"\n\nThe family's lawyer, Ben Crump, criticized the Minneapolis Police Department for its handling of the incident. Crump argued that the department's use of a no-knock warrant was \"reckless and irresponsible.\"\n\n### Officials\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo faced criticism for their handling of the incident. Frey and Arradondo defended the department's actions, but acknowledged that the incident had raised concerns about policing policies and practices.\n\n### Community groups\n\nCommunity groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the NAACP, condemned Locke's killing. The groups argued that the incident highlighted the need for policing reforms, including greater transparency and accountability.\n\nProtests\n\n### In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis and St. Paul following Locke's death. Demonstrators called for justice and reforms to policing policies and practices.\n\nThe protests were largely peaceful, but some demonstrators clashed with police. The Minneapolis Police Department deployed riot control agents and arrested several protesters.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nProtests also took place in other cities, including New York City and Los Angeles. Demonstrators in these cities called for justice and reforms to policing policies and practices.\n\nCivil lawsuit\n\nLocke's family filed a civil lawsuit against the City of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Police Department. The lawsuit alleged that the department's use of a no-knock warrant was \"reckless and irresponsible\" and that the officers involved had violated Locke's civil rights.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of unarmed African Americans killed by law enforcement officers in the United States\n* Police brutality in the United States\n* Racial profiling in the United States\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Amir_Locke\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Persons involved\n##Search warrant\n#Incident\n#Investigations\n#No-knock warrant moratorium and restrictions\n#Reaction\n##Family\n##Officials\n##Community groups\n#Protests\n##In Minneapolis—Saint Paul\n##Elsewhere\n#Civil lawsuit\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The piece consists of a silkscreen print of a Campbell's soup can, repeated in a grid pattern, and is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential works of the 20th century.\n\n# Early Career\n\nBefore creating Campbell's Soup Cans, Warhol was a successful commercial illustrator, producing work for major magazines and advertising agencies. However, he had always harbored a desire to become a fine artist.\n\n## New York art scene\n\nWarhol arrived in New York City in 1949, where he quickly became a part of the city's vibrant art scene. He befriended artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and began to explore new ways of creating art.\n\n## Pop art\n\nIn the early 1960s, Warhol became fascinated with the emerging pop art movement, which celebrated the banality and ubiquity of consumer culture. He began to experiment with silkscreen printing, using images from advertising and consumer products to create his artworks.\n\n# Premiere\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans premiered in July 1962 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, California. The exhibition was a major success, with many of the works selling to prominent collectors.\n\n## Subsequent publicity\n\nThe exhibition generated a significant amount of publicity, with many critics and art historians hailing Warhol as a major new talent. The work was seen as a bold statement about the nature of art and commerce, and its use of everyday imagery was seen as a radical departure from the dominant abstract expressionist movement.\n\n# Campbell's Soup Company\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell, and quickly became one of the largest and most successful food companies in the United States.\n\n## Can and label history\n\nThe iconic Campbell's soup can was designed in 1898 by Herberton Williams, a company executive. The can featured a distinctive red and white label, which has remained largely unchanged to this day.\n\n## Relation to Warhol's art\n\nWarhol was fascinated by the Campbell's soup can, seeing it as a symbol of American consumer culture. He was drawn to the can's ubiquity and familiarity, and saw it as a way to explore the relationship between art and commerce.\n\n# Inspiration\n\nWarhol's inspiration for Campbell's Soup Cans came from a variety of sources, including his own experiences as a consumer and his fascination with the banality of everyday life.\n\n## Artist colleagues\n\nWarhol was influenced by his artist colleagues, including Rauschenberg and Johns, who were also exploring the use of everyday imagery in their work. He was also influenced by the emerging pop art movement, which celebrated the power of consumer culture.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans has been interpreted in many ways over the years, with some seeing it as a celebration of consumer culture and others as a critique of it.\n\n## Celebration of consumer culture\n\nSome see the work as a celebration of the power and ubiquity of consumer culture, and the way that it shapes our lives and our perceptions.\n\n## Critique of consumer culture\n\nOthers see the work as a critique of the banality and superficiality of consumer culture, and the way that it can stultify our creativity and our critical faculties.\n\n# Variations\n\nOver the years, Warhol created many variations of Campbell's Soup Cans, using different colors and techniques to explore the possibilities of the image.\n\n## Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n\nIn 1962, Warhol created two series of Campbell's Soup Cans, known as Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II. The two series feature different colors and arrangements of the cans.\n\n## Colored soup cans\n\nWarhol also created a series of colored soup cans, using bright and bold colors to add a new level of depth and complexity to the image.\n\n## Unauthorized versions\n\nOver the years, many unauthorized versions of Campbell's Soup Cans have been created, often using Warhol's image without permission.\n\n## Other variations\n\nWarhol also created many other variations of Campbell's Soup Cans, using different techniques and materials to explore the possibilities of the image.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCampbell's Soup Cans is a seminal work of American pop art, and one of the most influential and iconic works of the 20th century. Its use of everyday imagery and its exploration of the relationship between art and commerce have made it a landmark of modern art.\n\n# See also\n\n* Pop art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Silkscreen printing\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on a variety of sources, including books and articles about Warhol and his work.\n* The article is intended to provide a general overview of Campbell's Soup Cans, rather than a detailed analysis of the work.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Campbell's_Soup_Cans\" following this outline:\n\n#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mission serves as a crucial step in testing the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the associated ground systems. Artemis I will lay the groundwork for future crewed missions to the Moon and beyond.\n\nMission Profile\n---------------\n\nArtemis I is designed to be a 26-day mission, with the primary objectives of demonstrating the SLS rocket's performance, testing the Orion spacecraft's reentry and recovery capabilities, and validating the mission's ground systems. The mission will follow a complex trajectory, including a lunar flyby, a distant retrograde orbit, and a high-speed reentry into Earth's atmosphere.\n\n### Mission Profile Animation\n\nA detailed animation of the Artemis I mission profile is available, illustrating the spacecraft's trajectory, key events, and milestones. The animation provides a visual representation of the complex mission architecture and highlights the challenges involved in sending a spacecraft to the Moon and back.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Artemis I mission has its roots in NASA's plans to return humans to the lunar surface by 2025. In 2019, NASA announced the Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface by 2028. Artemis I is a critical step in achieving this goal, as it will test the necessary technologies and systems for future crewed missions.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nPrior to the launch, NASA conducted extensive ground testing of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. The testing included a series of integrated tests, where the rocket and spacecraft were assembled and tested together. These tests validated the performance of the rocket's engines, the spacecraft's systems, and the mission's ground support equipment.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe assembly of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft took place at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket's core stage was assembled first, followed by the installation of the solid rocket boosters and the upper stage. The Orion spacecraft was then integrated with the rocket's upper stage.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nLaunch preparations for Artemis I began several months prior to the scheduled launch date. The rocket and spacecraft were rolled out to the launch pad, where they underwent final checks and preparations. The launch team conducted a series of dress rehearsals, simulating the launch countdown and liftoff.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nArtemis I was initially scheduled to launch on August 29, 2022. However, the launch was scrubbed due to technical issues with the rocket's engines. A second launch attempt was made on September 3, 2022, but it was also scrubbed due to weather conditions. The mission finally launched on November 16, 2022.\n\nFlight\n------\n\n### Launch\n\nArtemis I launched on November 16, 2022, at 1:47 a.m. EST from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39B. The SLS rocket lifted off with a combined thrust of 1.6 million pounds, sending the Orion spacecraft on its journey to the Moon.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nAfter liftoff, the Orion spacecraft separated from the rocket's upper stage and began its outbound journey to the Moon. The spacecraft performed a series of engine burns to adjust its trajectory and gain speed. During this phase, the spacecraft's systems and instruments were checked and validated.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the Orion spacecraft entered into a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon. The spacecraft remained in this orbit for several days, testing its systems and instruments in the lunar environment.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nAfter completing its lunar orbit, the Orion spacecraft began its return journey to Earth. The spacecraft performed a series of engine burns to adjust its trajectory and gain speed. During this phase, the spacecraft's systems and instruments were checked and validated.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nOn December 11, 2022, the Orion spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The spacecraft was recovered by NASA's recovery team, marking the end of the Artemis I mission.\n\nPayloads\n--------\n\n### Cubesats\n\nArtemis I carried a total of 10 cubesats, small satellites that were deployed during the mission.

It is the most accurate type of clock in the world, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. Atomic clocks are used as reference points for modern civil time and have numerous applications in science, technology, and industry.\n\n# History\n\nThe development of atomic clocks began in the 1940s, when physicist Isidor Rabi proposed the idea of using atomic energy levels to regulate a clock. The first atomic clock was built in 1949 by Louis Essen and Jack Parry at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Definition of the second\n\nIn 1967, the definition of the second was redefined in terms of the caesium atom. The second was defined as the time it takes for a caesium-133 atom to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. This definition was chosen because it is a fundamental constant of nature and is not subject to change.\n\n## Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n\nIn the 1990s, the development of optical clocks began. Optical clocks use the vibrations of atoms at optical frequencies, which are much higher than the microwave frequencies used in traditional atomic clocks. This allows for even greater accuracy and precision. The development of optical clocks has led to significant advancements in metrology, the science of measurement.\n\n## Chip-scale atomic clocks\n\nIn recent years, researchers have developed chip-scale atomic clocks, which are tiny atomic clocks that can be integrated into small devices. These clocks have numerous applications, including in telecommunications and navigation.\n\n# Measuring time with atomic clocks\n\nAtomic clocks measure time by using the vibrations of atoms to regulate a clock. The clock mechanism consists of a few key components.\n\n## Clock mechanism\n\nThe clock mechanism consists of a group of atoms, typically caesium or rubidium, which are excited by a beam of light. The atoms vibrate at a specific frequency, which is used to regulate the clock. The clock is typically a quartz crystal oscillator, which is used to generate a clock signal.\n\n## Tuning and optimization\n\nThe clock is tuned and optimized by adjusting the frequency of the light beam that excites the atoms. This is done to ensure that the clock is accurate and stable.\n\n# Accuracy\n\nAtomic clocks are incredibly accurate, with an error of only one second over tens of millions of years. This is because the vibrations of the atoms are a fundamental constant of nature, and are not subject to change.\n\n# Comparing atomic clocks\n\nAtomic clocks are compared to each other to ensure that they are accurate and consistent.\n\n## Time standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used as time standards, which are reference points for modern civil time. The time standards are used to coordinate clocks around the world.\n\n## Synchronization with satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are used to synchronize clocks with satellites, which are used for navigation and communication.\n\n## International timekeeping\n\nAtomic clocks are used for international timekeeping, which is the coordination of clocks around the world.\n\n## Fiber Optics\n\nAtomic clocks are also used in fiber optic communications, where they are used to synchronize clocks and ensure accurate data transmission.\n\n# Microwave atomic clocks\n\nMicrowave atomic clocks use the vibrations of atoms at microwave frequencies to regulate a clock. There are several types of microwave atomic clocks.\n\n## Caesium\n\nCaesium atomic clocks are the most common type of microwave atomic clock. They use the vibrations of caesium-133 atoms to regulate a clock.\n\n### Block diagram\n\nA block diagram of a caesium atomic clock is shown below:\n```\n+---------------+\n|  Caesium     |\n|  atoms        |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Microwave    |\n|  radiation     |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Detector     |\n+---------------+\n       |\n       |\n       v\n+---------------+\n|  Clock signal  |\n+---------------+\n```\n## Rubidium\n\nRubidium atomic clocks are another type of microwave atomic clock. They use the vibrations of rubidium-87 atoms to regulate a clock.\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen atomic clocks are also used, which use the vibrations of hydrogen-1 atoms to regulate a clock.\n\n# Other types of atomic clocks\n\nThere are several other types of atomic clocks, including quantum clocks and nuclear clocks.\n\n## Quantum clocks\n\nQuantum clocks use the principles of quantum mechanics to regulate a clock. They are still in the experimental stage, but have the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n## Nuclear clock concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept uses the vibrations of the nucleus of an atom to regulate a clock. This is still in the theoretical stage, but has the potential to be even more accurate than traditional atomic clocks.\n\n# Potential for redefining the second\n\nThe development of new types of atomic clocks has the potential to redefine the second.\n\n## Rydberg constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that could be used to redefine the second.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAny new definition of the second would require a clock that is accurate and stable, and that can be reproduced around the world.\n\n## Secondary representations of the second\n\nSecondary representations of the second, such as the use of optical clocks, could also be used to redefine the second.\n\n# Applications\n\nAtomic clocks have numerous applications in science, technology, and industry.\n\n## Global navigation satellite systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems, such as GPS, to provide accurate location and time information.\n\n### Experimental space clock\n\nAn experimental space clock was launched in 2014 to test the accuracy of atomic clocks in space.\n\n### Military usage\n\nAtomic clocks are used by the military for navigation and communication.\n\n## Time signal radio transmitters\n\nAtomic clocks are used to transmit time signals around the world, which are used to synchronize clocks.\n\n## General relativity\n\nAtomic clocks are used to test the principles of general relativity, which is the theory of gravity developed by Albert Einstein.\n\n## Financial systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to synchronize clocks and ensure accurate data transmission.\n\n## Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nTransportable optical clocks are used to provide accurate time information in remote locations.\n\n# See also\n\n* Time\n* Clock\n* Metrology\n* General relativity\n\n# Explanatory notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of atomic clocks, including their history, mechanism, accuracy, and applications.

She is the first person from the tribal community to hold the office and the second woman to become the President of India. Prior to her presidency, she served as the Governor of Jharkhand from 2015 to 2021.\n\n#Personal life\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born on 20 June 1958 in Uparbeda, a small village in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha, India. She belongs to the Santhal tribe, one of the largest tribal communities in India. Her father, Biranchi Narayan Tudu, was a farmer and a veteran of the Indian National Army. Murmu's mother, Tarini Tudu, was a homemaker. She has two brothers and two sisters.\n\nMurmu completed her primary education in her village and later attended the Rama Devi Women's College in Bhubaneswar, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. She is married to Shyam Charan Murmu, a banker, and has two sons, Laxman and Sipun. Her husband passed away in 2014.\n\n#Early career\n\nBefore entering politics, Murmu worked as a clerk in the State Electricity Board of Odisha and later as a teacher at the Sri Aurobindo Integral Education and Research Center in Rairangpur, Odisha. She also worked as a junior assistant in the Irrigation Department of the Government of Odisha.\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was inspired by her brother, Tudu, who was a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She joined the BJP in 1997 and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly in 2000.\n\n#Political career\n\nMurmu served as a member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly from 2000 to 2009, representing the Rairangpur constituency. During her tenure, she held various portfolios, including Transport and Commerce, and was also the Minister of State for Fisheries and Animal Husbandry.\n\nIn 2009, Murmu lost her seat in the Odisha Legislative Assembly but continued to work for the BJP, serving as the party's district president for Mayurbhanj. She was also a member of the BJP's National Executive Committee.\n\n#Governor of Jharkhand (2015–2021)\n\nOn 18 May 2015, Murmu was appointed as the Governor of Jharkhand, becoming the first woman from the tribal community to hold the office. She served as the Governor until 12 July 2021, when she resigned to contest the presidential election.\n\n##Pathalgadi movement\n\nDuring her tenure as Governor, Murmu faced a major challenge in the form of the Pathalgadi movement, a tribal uprising against the government's land acquisition policies. The movement, which began in 2017, saw widespread protests and violence across Jharkhand, with tribals demanding greater autonomy and control over their land.\n\nMurmu played a key role in addressing the concerns of the tribals and worked closely with the state government to find a solution. She also met with tribal leaders and listened to their grievances, helping to reduce tensions and promote peace in the region.\n\n##Religion and land bill\n\nIn 2017, the Jharkhand government passed the Jharkhand Religious Freedom Bill, which aimed to restrict conversions from one religion to another. The bill was opposed by Christian groups, who claimed it was discriminatory and would lead to persecution of minorities.\n\nMurmu, who is a devout Hindu, faced criticism for her role in passing the bill. However, she maintained that the bill was necessary to protect the rights of tribals and prevent forced conversions.\n\n#Presidential campaign\n\nOn 21 June 2022, Murmu was announced as the BJP's candidate for the presidential election, with the party's allies, including the Janata Dal (United) and the Shiv Sena, extending their support. Her candidacy was seen as a strategic move by the BJP to woo tribal voters and consolidate its support base in eastern India.\n\nMurmu's campaign focused on her humble background, her experience as a governor, and her commitment to the welfare of tribals and marginalized communities. She also highlighted her vision for India's development and her pledge to work for the unity and integrity of the country.\n\n#Presidency (2022–present)\n\nOn 21 July 2022, Murmu was elected as the President of India, defeating her rival, Yashwant Sinha, by a margin of over 1.3 million votes. She was sworn in as the President on 25 July 2022, becoming the first tribal person to hold the office.\n\nAs President, Murmu has emphasized the importance of promoting unity and integrity in the country. She has also stressed the need to address the concerns of marginalized communities and to work towards inclusive development.\n\n#Electoral performance\n\n| Election | Party | Result |\n| 2000 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Bharatiya Janata Party | Won |\n| 2004 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Bharatiya Janata Party | Won |\n| 2009 Odisha Legislative Assembly election | Bharatiya Janata Party | Lost |\n| 2022 Indian presidential election | National Democratic Alliance | Won |\n\n#State honours\n\nMurmu has received several state honors and awards for her contributions to public service and social welfare. These include:\n\n* Odisha Legislative Assembly's Best MLA Award (2007)\n* Nilakantha Award for Best MLA (2007)\n* Vanbandhu Award for her services to tribals (2015)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Presidents of India\n* List of Governors of Jharkhand\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Droupadi Murmu\", which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"Droupadi Murmu: From tribal village to Raisina Hill\".

Discovery\n=====================\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. It was formed in 2021 through the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. The company is one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with a diverse portfolio of brands and assets in film, television, streaming, and publishing.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nWarner Bros. was founded in 1923 by four brothers: Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner. The company started as a small film production studio in Burbank, California, and quickly grew to become one of the major film studios in Hollywood. In the 1950s and 1960s, Warner Bros. expanded into television production, producing popular shows such as \"Cheyenne\" and \"Maverick.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Warner Bros. began to expand its operations into other areas, including music and publishing. The company acquired Atlantic Records in 1967 and established Warner Books in 1970.\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn 1979, Warner Bros. merged with Time Inc. to form Time Warner, one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. The merger brought together Warner Bros.' film and television production studios with Time Inc.'s publishing and cable television assets.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Time Warner expanded its operations into new areas, including cable television and theme parks. The company acquired HBO in 1980 and established Warner Bros. Studios in Florida in 1990.\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), which included the Turner cable networks, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, and the MGM film library. The acquisition brought together Warner Bros.' film and television production studios with Turner's cable networks and film library.\n\nIn 2001, Time Warner merged with AOL to form AOL Time Warner. The merger was widely seen as a failure, and the company spun off AOL in 2009.\n\nIn 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner for $85.4 billion, renaming the company WarnerMedia. The acquisition brought together Warner Bros.' film and television production studios with AT&T's telecommunications assets.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, AT&T announced that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery, Inc. to form a new company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger was completed in April 2022, and the new company began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is led by CEO David Zaslav, who previously served as the CEO of Discovery, Inc. The company's leadership team includes a number of former WarnerMedia and Discovery executives.\n\nIn its first year of operation, Warner Bros. Discovery focused on integrating the WarnerMedia and Discovery assets and developing a new strategy for the company. The company announced plans to launch a new streaming service, which would combine the content of HBO Max and Discovery+.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a significant restructuring of the company, which included the elimination of a number of senior executive positions and the consolidation of several business units.\n\nThe company also announced plans to cut costs and reduce its debt, which had increased significantly as a result of the merger. The cost-cutting measures included the elimination of a number of jobs and the closure of several offices.\n\nDespite the challenges, Warner Bros. Discovery remains one of the largest and most successful media conglomerates in the world, with a diverse portfolio of brands and assets in film, television, streaming, and publishing.\n\nAssets\n------\n\nWarner Bros.
