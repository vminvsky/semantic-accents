As a sovereign state, Saint Lucia has a population of approximately 179,000 people and a total area of 616 square kilometers. The island's unique combination of volcanic peaks, rainforests, and stunning beaches makes it a popular destination for tourists and a haven for nature lovers.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe origin of the name \"Saint Lucia\" is attributed to the French, who named the island after Saint Lucy of Syracuse, a 4th-century martyr. The name \"Lucia\" is derived from the Latin word \"lux,\" meaning light, which is fitting given the island's stunning natural beauty and reputation as a beacon of hospitality in the Caribbean.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak people, an indigenous tribe that migrated to the island from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of European colonizers. The Arawak people developed a thriving community on the island, based on fishing, hunting, and subsistence farming. However, their population was decimated by diseases brought over by European colonizers, to which they had no immunity.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus sighted Saint Lucia on his fourth voyage to the New World. However, it was the French who established the first European settlement on the island in 1660. The French established a series of forts and trading posts, and the island became a hub for the transatlantic slave trade. The British also established a presence on the island, and the two European powers fought over control of Saint Lucia for many years.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nSaint Lucia changed hands between the French and British 14 times during the 18th and 19th centuries, earning it the nickname \"Helen of the West Indies.\" The island's strategic location and natural resources made it a prized possession for both European powers. However, the constant fighting and changes in ownership took a toll on the island's population and economy.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence. The island became a self-governing colony in 1967, and full independence was achieved on February 22, 1979. The country's first prime minister was John Compton, who played a key role in the country's transition to independence.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nSince independence, Saint Lucia has made significant progress in developing its economy and improving the standard of living for its citizens.

The conflict marked a significant escalation of tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which have been locked in a decades-long dispute over the region.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has its roots in the late 1980s, when the region, which was then an autonomous oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, began to push for independence. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war in the early 1990s, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and the establishment of a fragile ceasefire in 1994. Despite numerous attempts at negotiations, a lasting peace agreement has yet to be reached.\n\nIn recent years, tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia have increased, with both sides accusing each other of ceasefire violations and aggression. The situation has been further complicated by the involvement of external actors, including Russia, Turkey, and the United States.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 offensive, tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia had increased significantly. In August 2023, Azerbaijan launched a series of military exercises near the border with Armenia, which were widely seen as a provocation. Armenia responded with its own military exercises, leading to a further escalation of tensions.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev delivered a speech in which he vowed to \"restore Azerbaijan's territorial integrity\" and warned Armenia against further \"aggression.\" The speech was widely seen as a warning sign that Azerbaijan was preparing for military action.\n\n**Offensive**\n\n### 19 September\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military operation against the Republic of Artsakh. The operation began with a series of artillery strikes against Armenian positions in the north of the region, followed by a ground assault by Azerbaijani forces.\n\nThe Armenian military responded with force, but was quickly overwhelmed by the Azerbaijani army's superior numbers and firepower. By the end of the day, Azerbaijani forces had made significant gains, capturing several key positions and pushing deep into the region.\n\n### 20 September\n\nOn September 20, 2023, the Azerbaijani military continued its advance, capturing the strategic town of Martakert and pushing towards the regional capital, Stepanakert. The Armenian military was in disarray, with many of its troops fleeing or surrendering.\n\nAs the Azerbaijani army closed in on Stepanakert, the Armenian government announced that it was seeking a ceasefire and negotiations with Azerbaijan. However, the Azerbaijani government rejected the offer, insisting that it would continue its military operation until it had achieved its objectives.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs the Azerbaijani military advanced, thousands of Armenians fled the region, seeking safety in Armenia or other parts of the world. The exodus was marked by scenes of chaos and desperation, with many people forced to leave behind their homes and belongings.\n\nThe flight of the Armenians was widely condemned by human rights groups and other organizations, which accused Azerbaijan of ethnic cleansing.\n\n### Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nFollowing the capture of Stepanakert, the Azerbaijani authorities arrested several high-ranking officials of the Republic of Artsakh, including the region's president, Arayik Harutyunyan. The arrests were widely condemned by Armenia and other countries, which accused Azerbaijan of violating international law.\n\n### Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nIn the weeks following the Azerbaijani offensive, negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan were held under the auspices of Russia and other international organizations. The talks resulted in the signing of a ceasefire agreement, which provided for the establishment of a buffer zone in Nagorno-Karabakh and the deployment of Russian peacekeeping troops.\n\nHowever, the agreement also provided for the dissolution of the Republic of Artsakh, which was widely seen as a major concession by Armenia. The dissolution of the region was met with widespread protests in Armenia, with many people accusing the government of betrayal.\n\n### Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the signing of the ceasefire agreement, there have been numerous reports of ceasefire violations by both sides. The situation remains volatile, with many people fearing a further escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Humanitarian aid\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Azerbaijani_offensive_in_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Offensive\n##19 September\n##20 September\n#Aftermath\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n##Ceasefire violations\n##Humanitarian aid\n##Diplomatic efforts\n###Normalisation efforts\n#Risk of genocide\n##Reports of violence against Armenians\n##Azerbaijani concentration camp plans\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n###Armenia\n####Armenian diaspora\n###Russia\n###Turkey\n###European Union\n###United Nations\n###Council of Europe\n###Other countries\n###Other international organizations\n##Foreign involvement\n###Israel\n###Turkey\n###Armenia\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The show is a groundbreaking production that brings to life the wonders of the ancient world, taking viewers on a journey through time to explore the lives of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe series is set in a variety of locations around the world, from the lush forests of the Cretaceous period to the scorching deserts of the Triassic. Each episode focuses on a different ecosystem, showcasing the diverse range of species that inhabited our planet millions of years ago. From the towering sauroposeidons to the fierce tyrannosaurs, the show features stunning visual effects and meticulous research to recreate the prehistoric world in breathtaking detail.\n\nThroughout the series, viewers are introduced to a wide range of creatures, including some of the most iconic dinosaurs of all time, as well as lesser-known species that are equally fascinating. The show also explores the complex relationships between these creatures, from predator-prey interactions to symbiotic relationships and even courtship rituals.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Prehistoric Planet is its focus on the emotional and social lives of its prehistoric subjects. Rather than simply presenting dinosaurs as mindless beasts, the show delves into their behaviors, social structures, and even their emotional responses to their environments. This approach makes for a compelling and engaging viewing experience, as audiences are drawn into the world of these ancient creatures.\n\n# Production\n\nPrehistoric Planet was produced by the BBC Studios Natural History Unit, in association with Apple TV+. The show was created by Tim Haines, who has a long history of producing innovative and acclaimed documentaries about dinosaurs and natural history. Haines worked closely with a team of experts, including paleontologists, zoologists, and visual effects specialists, to ensure that the show was both scientifically accurate and visually stunning.\n\nThe production process was incredibly complex, involving years of research and planning. The team used a combination of traditional filmmaking techniques and cutting-edge visual effects to bring the prehistoric world to life. This included the creation of detailed computer-generated models of dinosaurs and other creatures, as well as the use of advanced animation techniques to simulate their movements and behaviors.\n\nThe show was filmed in a variety of locations around the world, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The team also made use of advanced camera technology, including drones and time-lapse cameras, to capture stunning footage of the natural world.\n\n# Marketing\n\nPrehistoric Planet was heavily promoted by Apple TV+, with a major marketing campaign launched in the months leading up to the show's premiere. This included the release of several teaser trailers, as well as a series of promotional images and posters featuring the show's stunning visual effects.\n\nThe show was also heavily promoted on social media, with the Apple TV+ team releasing behind-the-scenes content and sneak peeks of upcoming episodes. This helped to build a sense of excitement and anticipation among fans, who eagerly anticipated the show's premiere.\n\nIn addition to its online marketing efforts, Apple TV+ also partnered with several major brands and organizations to promote the show. This included a partnership with the Natural History Museum in London, which hosted a special preview screening of the show's first episode.\n\n# Episodes\n\n## Season 1 (2022)\n\nThe first season of Prehistoric Planet premiered on Apple TV+ in May 2022. The season consisted of five episodes, each of which explored a different ecosystem and featured a range of prehistoric creatures.\n\nThe first episode, \"Tropical Forest,\" took viewers on a journey through the lush forests of the Cretaceous period, where they encountered towering sauroposeidons and fierce tyrannosaurs. The second episode, \"Desert,\" explored the scorching deserts of the Triassic, where viewers met a range of unusual creatures, including the massive plateosaurus.\n\nThe third episode, \"Freshwater,\" delved into the world of rivers and lakes, where viewers encountered a range of aquatic creatures, including the massive ichthyosaur. The fourth episode, \"Coastal,\" took viewers on a journey along the coastlines of the ancient world, where they encountered a range of marine reptiles and other creatures.\n\nThe final episode of the season, \"Polar,\" explored the frozen landscapes of the ancient world, where viewers met a range of creatures that had adapted to the harsh, cold conditions. This included the massive ammosaur, which roamed the frozen tundras of the Triassic.\n\n## Season 2 (2023)\n\nThe second season of Prehistoric Planet premiered on Apple TV+ in 2023. The season consisted of five new episodes, each of which explored a different ecosystem and featured a range of prehistoric creatures.\n\nThe first episode of the season, \"Grasslands,\" took viewers on a journey through the open grasslands of the Cretaceous period, where they encountered a range of herbivorous dinosaurs, including the massive hadrosaur. The second episode, \"Mountain,\" explored the rugged mountain landscapes of the Triassic, where viewers met a range of creatures that had adapted to the harsh, rocky conditions.\n\nThe third episode, \"Canyon,\" delved into the world of deep canyons and gorges, where viewers encountered a range of creatures that had evolved to live in these unique environments. The fourth episode, \"River Delta,\" took viewers on a journey through the muddy river deltas of the ancient world, where they encountered a range of aquatic creatures, including the massive crocodile-like phytosaur.\n\nThe final episode of the season, \"Island,\" explored the unique ecosystems of ancient islands, where viewers met a range of creatures that had evolved in isolation.\n\n## Immersive (2024)\n\nIn 2024, Apple TV+ will release an immersive version of Prehistoric Planet, which will allow viewers to experience the show in a completely new way. This will include the use of advanced virtual reality technology, which will transport viewers into the world of the ancient creatures.\n\nThe immersive version of the show will feature all of the episodes from the first two seasons, as well as several new, specially created experiences. These will include interactive encounters with prehistoric creatures, as well as guided tours of the ancient world.\n\n# Reception\n\nPrehistoric Planet received widespread critical acclaim upon its release.

This made it one of the most-watched documentary series of the year, and helped to establish Apple TV+ as a major player in the world of documentary programming.\n\n## Accolades\n\nPrehistoric Planet won several awards and nominations, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in a Supporting Role.

His life and work were marked by controversy, experimentation, and a constant struggle against censorship and repression. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Stelaru's life, work, and legacy.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born on February 10, 1901, in Bucharest, Romania, to a family of modest means. His father was a civil servant, and his mother was a housewife. Stelaru's early life was marked by a love for literature and the arts, encouraged by his parents who valued education and culture. He attended primary school in Bucharest and later enrolled in the city's prestigious Mihai Viteazul High School.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Stelaru became fascinated with the works of Romanian poets and writers, particularly those associated with the Symbolist movement. He began writing his own poetry and short stories, experimenting with different styles and forms. After completing high school, Stelaru enrolled in the University of Bucharest, where he studied literature and philosophy.\n\n##Debut and death-hoax\n\nIn 1920, Stelaru made his literary debut with a collection of poetry titled \"Cuvinte\" (Words). The book was well-received by critics and established Stelaru as a rising star in Romanian literary circles. However, his early success was soon marred by controversy. In 1922, Stelaru faked his own death, allegedly to escape the pressures of fame and to focus on his writing. The hoax was widely reported in the press, and Stelaru's friends and family were shocked and saddened by the news.\n\nThe reasons behind Stelaru's death-hoax remain unclear, but it is believed that he was seeking to create a sensation and to challenge the conventional norms of literary society. The incident sparked a heated debate about the role of the artist in society and the nature of artistic expression.\n\n##Albatros years\n\nIn 1923, Stelaru resurfaced and began working with the Albatros publishing house, a prominent literary magazine and publishing company in Bucharest. During his time with Albatros, Stelaru published several collections of poetry and short stories, including \"Poeme\" (Poems) and \"Femei\" (Women). His work during this period was characterized by experimentation with form and language, as well as a growing interest in themes related to love, death, and the human condition.\n\nStelaru's association with Albatros also brought him into contact with other prominent writers and intellectuals, including the poet and critic, Tudor Arghezi. The two men developed a close friendship and engaged in a series of literary debates and discussions that helped shape the direction of Romanian literature in the interwar period.\n\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nDuring World War II, Romania was ruled by the fascist regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu, who imposed strict censorship and repression on the country's artistic and intellectual communities. Stelaru's work was deemed subversive and decadent by the authorities, and he was forced to go into hiding to avoid persecution.\n\nDespite the challenges, Stelaru continued to write, producing some of his most important work during this period. His poetry and fiction from the 1940s are characterized by a growing sense of disillusionment and despair, as well as a deepening exploration of themes related to identity, morality, and the human condition.\n\n##Censoring and obscurity\n\nAfter the war, Romania fell under communist rule, and Stelaru's work was once again subject to censorship and repression. His association with the Albatros publishing house, which was seen as a bourgeois and decadent institution, made him a target for the communist authorities.\n\nStelaru's work was largely forgotten during the communist era, and he was forced to live in obscurity. Despite his efforts to continue writing and publishing, his work was constantly rejected by the censors, and he was forced to rely on underground networks and samizdat publications to disseminate his writing.\n\n##Final return\n\nIn the 1960s, Stelaru's work began to experience a revival, thanks in part to the efforts of a new generation of Romanian writers and intellectuals who sought to rediscover and reclaim the country's avant-garde traditions. Stelaru's poetry and fiction were re-published, and his work was once again recognized as a major contribution to Romanian literature.\n\nStelaru's final years were marked by a renewed sense of creativity and productivity, as well as a deepening sense of reflection and introspection. He died on November 10, 1971, at the age of 70, leaving behind a legacy as one of Romania's most important and innovative writers of the 20th century.\n\n#Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the many challenges and controversies that marked his life and work. Despite the censorship and repression he faced, Stelaru remained committed to his art and his vision, producing a body of work that continues to inspire and influence writers and artists today.\n\nStelaru's contributions to Romanian literature are significant, particularly in the areas of poetry and the avant-garde movement. His experimentation with form and language, as well as his exploration of themes related to identity, morality, and the human condition, helped shape the direction of Romanian literature in the interwar period and beyond.\n\nStelaru's legacy also extends beyond literature, reflecting his broader impact on Romanian culture and society. His work challenges conventional norms and expectations, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression and exploring the complexities of the human experience.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a comprehensive review of available sources, including Stelaru's own writings, as well as critical and biographical studies of his life and work.\n\n#References\n\n(No references are included in this article, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dimitrie_Stelaru\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##Debut and death-hoax\n##Albatros years\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n##Censoring and obscurity\n##Final return\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

On that evening, a gunman opened fire in a gay bar and a nightclub in the city center, killing two people and injuring 21 others. The attack was widely condemned, and an investigation was launched to determine the motive and circumstances surrounding the shooting.\n\n# Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at around 1:15 a.m. local time on June 25, 2022, outside the London Pub, a popular gay bar in the city center, and the Herr Nilsen Jazz Club, a nearby nightclub. The gunman, who was later identified as a 42-year-old Norwegian man of Iranian descent, opened fire on the crowds outside the bars, shooting indiscriminately. Witnesses described the scene as chaotic, with people running and screaming as the gunman continued to fire.\n\nThe police were quickly alerted to the shooting and responded rapidly, arriving at the scene within minutes. The gunman was shot and wounded by police and taken into custody. Two people were killed in the attack, and 21 others were injured, including several who were critically wounded.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe two victims who were killed in the attack were identified as Kåre Arntzen, a 48-year-old Norwegian man, and Jon Isak Riseth, a 23-year-old Norwegian man. Both victims were regulars at the London Pub and were well-known in the local LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe 21 people who were injured in the attack included several who were seriously wounded, with some suffering from gunshot wounds to the head, chest, and abdomen. Many of the injured were taken to the hospital, where they received treatment for their injuries.\n\n# Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the shooting was launched immediately after the attack, with police working to determine the motive and circumstances surrounding the shooting. The investigation was led by the Oslo Police District, with assistance from the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe investigation found that the gunman had acted alone and had not been part of a larger terrorist plot. However, the investigation did reveal that the gunman had been motivated by extremist ideology and had been inspired by Islamic State (IS) propaganda.\n\nThe investigation also found that the gunman had a history of mental health issues and had been known to the authorities prior to the attack. However, the investigation did not find any evidence that the gunman had been radicalized or had been in contact with extremist groups.\n\n# Trial in 2024\n\nThe gunman is scheduled to go on trial in 2024, where he will face charges related to the shooting. The trial is expected to be held in the Oslo District Court, with the prosecution seeking a lengthy prison sentence.\n\n## Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n\nIn addition to the charges against the gunman, a female detainee in Syria has also been charged in connection with the shooting. The detainee, who is a Norwegian citizen, is accused of having provided support to the gunman and of having been involved in the planning of the attack.\n\nThe charges against the detainee are based on evidence gathered by the Norwegian authorities, including communications between the detainee and the gunman. The detainee is currently being held in detention in Syria, where she is awaiting extradition to Norway to face trial.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Oslo shooting had a significant impact on the city and the country as a whole. The attack was widely condemned, and an outpouring of support was seen for the victims and their families.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Norwegian government announced plans to increase security measures in the city, including the deployment of additional police officers and the installation of security cameras.\n\nThe attack also led to a renewed focus on LGBTQ+ rights in Norway, with many calling for greater protections and support for the community.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe 2022 Oslo shooting was widely condemned across Norway, with politicians and community leaders speaking out against the attack. The Prime Minister of Norway, Jonas Gahr Støre, described the attack as \"horrific\" and \"unacceptable,\" and pledged to do everything in his power to prevent similar attacks in the future.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Erna Solberg, also condemned the attack, saying that it was a \"cowardly act\" that had no place in Norwegian society.\n\n## International\n\nThe 2022 Oslo shooting was also widely condemned internationally, with leaders from around the world expressing their condolences to the people of Norway.\n\nThe European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, described the attack as \"appalling\" and said that the EU stood in solidarity with Norway.\n\nThe United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, also condemned the attack, saying that it was a \"heinous act\" that had no place in any society.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Oslo shooting was a shocking and devastating attack that had a profound impact on the city and the country. The investigation into the attack found that the gunman had acted alone and had been motivated by extremist ideology.\n\nThe attack highlighted the need for greater security measures in Norway, particularly in light of the growing threat from extremist groups. The Norwegian government has taken steps to address these concerns, including the deployment of additional police officers and the installation of security cameras.\n\nThe attack also highlighted the need for greater support and protections for the LGBTQ+ community in Norway. The community has faced increasing threats and harassment in recent years, and the attack was a stark reminder of the need for greater action to address these concerns.\n\n# See also\n\n* Terrorism in Norway\n* Islamic extremism\n* LGBTQ+ rights in Norway\n* Norwegian Police Security Service (PST)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Oslo_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Trial in 2024\n##Charges against a female detainee in Syria\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, the conflict escalated significantly in 2022, with a large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia. This article provides a detailed timeline of the key events and developments in the conflict since the initial invasion in 2022.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated significantly. In December 2021, Russia began a buildup of troops along its border with Ukraine, sparking concerns of a potential invasion. The United States and other Western countries warned Russia of severe consequences if it were to invade Ukraine.\n\nIn January 2022, Russia launched a series of military exercises near the Ukrainian border, further increasing tensions. On February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n# Initial invasion\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, with attacks on multiple fronts. The invasion began with a series of missile strikes on Ukrainian military targets, followed by a ground invasion in the north, east, and south.\n\nThe initial invasion was characterized by a rapid advance of Russian forces into Ukrainian territory. The city of Kherson was captured on February 24, and the city of Melitopol was captured on February 26.\n\nHowever, the Russian advance was slowed down by Ukrainian resistance, and the invasion was met with widespread international condemnation.

{"title": "Open-source_video_game", "content": "#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Open-Source Video Game\n\nAn open-source video game is a video game whose source code is released under an open-source license, allowing users to modify, distribute, and study the game's inner workings. This approach to game development has led to a wide range of benefits, including increased community involvement, faster bug fixing, and the creation of entirely new games based on existing ones. Open-source video games have been around for several decades, with a rich history that spans from humble beginnings to modern-day masterpieces.\n\n# Definition and Differentiation\n\nOpen-source video games are often confused with free-to-play or freeware games, which are games that are available at no cost but may still have proprietary code. In contrast, open-source games have their source code openly available, allowing anyone to modify and distribute the game as they see fit. This key distinction sets open-source games apart from other types of games and has led to a thriving community of developers and players who contribute to and enjoy these games.\n\n# Background\n\nThe open-source movement in video games is closely tied to the broader open-source software movement, which emphasizes the importance of community involvement, transparency, and collaboration in software development. Open-source video games often rely on volunteer contributions from developers, artists, and other community members, who work together to create and maintain the game. This approach has led to the creation of many high-quality games that are available at no cost to players.\n\n# History\n\n## Beginnings and Early Games\n\nThe history of open-source video games dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the first open-source games were developed. These early games were often simple text-based adventures or strategy games, and were typically created by hobbyist programmers who shared their code with others. One of the earliest open-source games was the 1971 game \"Colossal Cave Adventure,\" which was developed by Will Crowther and later expanded upon by Don Woods.\n\n## 3D Games and Source Releases\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of 3D graphics in video games, and with it, the creation of more complex and immersive open-source games. One of the first 3D open-source games was the 1993 game \"Doom,\" which was developed by id Software and later released under an open-source license. This move allowed the game's community to create custom levels, modifications, and even entirely new games based on the Doom engine. Other notable 3D open-source games from this era include \"Quake\" and \"Duke Nukem 3D.\"\n\n## Rise in Popularity and Diversity\n\nThe early 2000s saw a significant rise in popularity and diversity among open-source games. This was due in part to the growing availability of high-speed internet connections, which made it easier for developers to collaborate and share their work. The creation of online communities and forums dedicated to open-source game development also helped to facilitate the growth of this movement. Games such as \"Battle for Wesnoth\" and \"Freeciv\" became popular among players and developers alike, and helped to establish open-source games as a viable alternative to commercial titles.\n\n## Greater Organization\n\nAs the open-source game movement grew, so did the need for greater organization and coordination among developers. The creation of online platforms and repositories such as GitHub and SourceForge helped to facilitate collaboration and code sharing among developers. The establishment of non-profit organizations such as the Open Source Game Alliance (OSGA) also helped to promote and support the development of open-source games.\n\n## Hubs and Development Teams\n\nToday, there are many hubs and development teams dedicated to the creation and maintenance of open-source games. These teams often consist of volunteer developers, artists, and other contributors who work together to create and maintain games. Some notable examples of open-source game development teams include the \"0 A.D.\" team, which is working on a historical real-time strategy game, and the \"Minetest\" team, which is developing a sandbox-style game inspired by Minecraft.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Free and open-source software\n* Open-source software movement\n* Video game development\n* Game engine\n* Open-source license\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External Links\n\n* Open Source Game Alliance (OSGA)\n* GitHub\n* SourceForge\n* Open-source game development communities on Reddit and Stack Overflow", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Open-source_video_game\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and differentiation\n#Background\n#History\n##Beginnings and early games\n##3D games and source releases\n##Rise in popularity and diversity\n##Greater organization\n##Hubs and development teams\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located in the fertile Chao Phraya river valley, the kingdom was one of the most powerful and influential empires in Southeast Asian history. At its peak, Ayutthaya was a major center of trade, culture, and politics, with a vast network of vassal states and tributaries stretching across the region.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\n### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, the Chao Phraya river valley was home to several smaller cities and kingdoms. One of the most notable of these was the city of Lavo, which was an important center of trade and culture in the region. Lavo was eventually absorbed into the Ayutthaya Kingdom, and its traditions and customs played a significant role in shaping the new kingdom's culture and identity.\n\n### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, Ayutthaya was founded in 1350 CE by King Ramathibodi I, who is said to have established the city on the site of an earlier settlement. The king chose the location for its strategic importance, as it was situated at the confluence of three rivers and was easily defensible. The city quickly grew into a major center of trade and commerce, and its influence soon spread throughout the region.\n\n## Early maritime dominance\n\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries, Ayutthaya established itself as a major maritime power in Southeast Asia. The kingdom's strategic location allowed it to control the flow of trade between China and India, and its merchants became wealthy and influential. Ayutthaya's maritime dominance also enabled it to establish a network of vassal states and tributaries across the region.\n\n## Age of warfare\n\n### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nIn the 16th century, Ayutthaya began to transition from a maritime power to a hinterland state. The kingdom's focus shifted from trade and commerce to agriculture and territorial expansion. Ayutthaya's armies conquered much of the surrounding region, and the kingdom became a major land power in Southeast Asia.\n\n### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Ayutthaya was ruled by a series of powerful Northern lords who centralized power and established a strong, bureaucratic state. The kingdom's administration was reformed, and a new system of taxation and governance was introduced. The Northern lords also established a powerful military, which enabled Ayutthaya to expand its territories and defend itself against external threats.\n\n### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the mid-16th century, Ayutthaya clashed with the Burmese kingdom of Pegu in a series of wars that lasted for several decades. The wars were sparked by disputes over trade and territory, and they had a significant impact on the region. Ayutthaya ultimately emerged victorious, but the wars weakened the kingdom and created an opportunity for other powers to challenge its dominance.\n\n## Peace and commerce\n\n### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nDuring the 17th century, Ayutthaya experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity. The kingdom's trade and commerce flourished, and its merchants became wealthy and influential. The kingdom also experienced a cultural renaissance, with significant advances in art, literature, and architecture.\n\n### Persian and French influences\n\nDuring the 17th century, Ayutthaya was influenced by Persian and French culture. Persian merchants and diplomats played an important role in the kingdom's trade and commerce, and French missionaries and traders introduced European technology and ideas. The kingdom's architecture, art, and literature were also influenced by Persian and French styles.\n\n## Late Ayutthaya period\n\n### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nDuring the 18th century, Ayutthaya continued to prosper and expand its connections with China. The kingdom's trade with China increased, and Chinese merchants and immigrants played an important role in the kingdom's economy and culture.\n\n### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nHowever, the kingdom was also plagued by succession conflicts and corruption. The royal family was divided, and powerful nobles and officials competed for power and influence. The kingdom's administration became corrupt and inefficient, and the economy began to decline.\n\n### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nDuring the 18th century, Ayutthaya was introduced to capitalism, which had a significant impact on the kingdom's economy and society. Commoners began to play a more important role in the kingdom's economy and politics, and a form of proto-nationalism emerged. The kingdom's people began to identify themselves as Siamese, and a sense of national identity began to develop.\n\n### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe kingdom's nobility continued to play an important role in Ayutthaya's society and politics. The nobility was closely tied to the Buddhist clergy, and Buddhism continued to play a central role in the kingdom's culture and identity.\n\n### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nBy the mid-18th century, Ayutthaya's military and political situation had become increasingly unstable. The kingdom was plagued by internal conflicts and external threats, and its economy was in decline. The kingdom's military was weakened, and its administration was corrupt and inefficient.\n\n## Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1767, Ayutthaya was conquered by the Burmese kingdom of Konbaung. The Burmese army besieged the city, and the kingdom's defenses were breached. The city was sacked, and the kingdom was destroyed. The fall of Ayutthaya marked the end of the kingdom and the beginning of a new era in Thai history.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Ayutthaya had a significant impact on the region. The kingdom's people were displaced, and many were forced to flee to other parts of the region. The kingdom's culture and identity were preserved, however, and the Thai people continued to identify themselves as Siamese. The fall of Ayutthaya also led to the rise of new powers in the region, including the kingdom of Thonburi and the kingdom of Rattanakosin.\n\n# Government\n\n## Kings\n\nAyutthaya was ruled by a series of kings, who were believed to have divine authority.

They are predominantly found in the Nagpur district, as well as in the surrounding districts of Bhandara, Gondia, and Wardha.\n\n# Names\n\nThe term \"Nagpuria\" is derived from the name of the city of Nagpur, which is the largest city in the region and the third-largest city in Maharashtra. The people of this region have been referred to by various names throughout history, including \"Nagpurkar,\" \"Nagpuri,\" and \"Nagpuria.\" The term \"Nagpuria\" is widely accepted and used to refer to the people of this region.\n\n# History\n\n## Prehistoric era\n\nThe Nagpur region has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological evidence suggests that human habitation in the region dates back to the Paleolithic era, around 50,000 years ago. The region was home to various indigenous tribes, including the Gonds, the Savaras, and the Korkus.\n\n## Ancient period\n\nDuring the ancient period, the Nagpur region was part of the Mauryan Empire, which ruled much of India from the 3rd to the 2nd century BCE. After the decline of the Mauryan Empire, the region was ruled by various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, the Vakatakas, and the Rashtrakutas. The Nagpur region was an important center of trade and commerce during this period, with the city of Nagpur being an important hub for the trade of cotton, silk, and other commodities.\n\n## Medieval period\n\nDuring the medieval period, the Nagpur region was ruled by the Deccan Sultanates, including the Bahmani Sultanate and the Imad Shahi dynasty. The region was also influenced by the Bhonsle dynasty, which ruled much of Maharashtra during this period. The Nagpur region was an important center of learning and culture during this period, with the city of Nagpur being home to many scholars, poets, and artists.\n\n## Modern period\n\nDuring the modern period, the Nagpur region was ruled by the British East India Company, which established its rule over the region in the 19th century. The region was an important center of the Indian independence movement, with many prominent leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, visiting the region. The Nagpur region was also home to many prominent freedom fighters, including Tatya Tope and Bhagat Singh.\n\n## Post Independence\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the Nagpur region became part of the newly formed state of Madhya Pradesh. In 1960, the region was transferred to the newly formed state of Maharashtra. Since then, the Nagpur region has undergone rapid economic and social development, with the city of Nagpur emerging as a major center of industry and commerce.\n\n# Communities\n\n## Lineages\n\nThe Nagpuria people are divided into several lineages, including the Nagpurkar, the Deshkar, the Kumbhar, and the Sutar. Each lineage has its own distinct traditions and customs, and they are often identified by their surnames.\n\n# Culture\n\n## Language and literature\n\nThe Nagpuria people speak a dialect of Marathi, which is the official language of Maharashtra. The dialect is known as Nagpuri or Nagpuria, and it is spoken by around 5 million people in the Nagpur region. The dialect is distinct from standard Marathi and has its own unique vocabulary and grammar.

They were one of the most prominent and powerful groups in the region, playing a significant role in the history of the Italian peninsula. The Samnites were known for their martial prowess, their distinctive culture, and their complex relationships with other ancient civilizations, including the Romans.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe origin of the name \"Samnites\" is unclear, but it is believed to be derived from the Oscan language, which was spoken by the Samnites and other Italic peoples. One theory is that the name comes from the Oscan word \"safinim,\" meaning \"those who live on their own land.\" Another theory suggests that the name is derived from the name of the Sabine goddess, Safinius.\n\n#History\n\n##Origins and early history\n\nThe Samnites emerged as a distinct group in the 5th century BC, in the region of Samnium, which corresponds to modern-day Abruzzo, Molise, and parts of Campania and Lazio. The Samnites were an Italic people, closely related to other groups such as the Sabines, the Latins, and the Umbri. They developed a complex society, with a system of government, economy, and culture that was distinct from other ancient civilizations.\n\n##Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites were known for their martial prowess, and they played a significant role in the Samnite Wars, a series of conflicts with the Romans that lasted from 343 to 290 BC. The wars were sparked by a combination of factors, including the expansion of Roman power, the desire for control of the Italian peninsula, and the need for resources such as land and trade routes. The Samnites were eventually defeated by the Romans, but not before inflicting significant losses and damage on the Roman army.\n\n##Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to play a role in the history of the Italian peninsula. They were eventually absorbed into the Roman Empire, and many Samnites became Roman citizens. However, the Samnites maintained their cultural identity, and their legacy can still be seen in the modern-day region of Samnium.\n\n#Society\n\n##Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based on agriculture, trade, and warfare. The Samnites were skilled farmers, and they produced a variety of crops, including wheat, olives, and grapes. They also traded with other groups, including the Romans, and were known for their expertise in metalwork and craftsmanship. The Samnites were also skilled warriors, and they often engaged in raids and conquests to expand their territory and resources.\n\n##Government\n\nThe Samnite system of government was complex and decentralized. The Samnites were organized into a series of tribes, each with its own leader and system of governance. The tribes were united under a loose confederation, with a council of elders and a system of assembly. The Samnites also had a system of laws and justice, with a focus on individual rights and freedoms.\n\n##Military\n\nThe Samnite military was known for its discipline, organization, and martial prowess. The Samnites were skilled warriors, and they developed a distinctive style of warfare that emphasized speed, agility, and surprise. The Samnites were also known for their expertise in siege warfare, and they developed a range of technologies, including catapults and ballistae.\n\n###Armor\n\nThe Samnites wore a distinctive type of armor, known as the \"scutum.\" The scutum was a large, rectangular shield made of wood or metal, with a curved surface and a long handle. The Samnites also wore helmets, greaves, and breastplates, and carried swords and spears.\n\n###Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were skilled craftsmen, and they developed a range of distinctive weapons, including the \"gladius,\" a short, curved sword, and the \"pilum,\" a heavy javelin with a long handle. The Samnites also used catapults and ballistae, which were powered by torsion or tension.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Religion\n\nThe Samnite religion was complex and polytheistic, with a focus on a range of gods and goddesses, including Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. The Samnites also believed in a range of supernatural beings, including spirits and ancestors. The Samnites practiced a range of rituals and ceremonies, including sacrifices, festivals, and divination.\n\n##Gender roles\n\nThe Samnites had a complex system of gender roles, with men and women playing different roles in society. Men were expected to be warriors and leaders, while women were expected to be wives and mothers. However, women also played a significant role in Samnite society, and were often involved in trade, agriculture, and other economic activities.\n\n##Art\n\nThe Samnites developed a distinctive style of art, which was characterized by simplicity, elegance, and a focus on geometric forms. The Samnites were skilled craftsmen, and they developed a range of technologies, including metalwork, pottery, and textiles.\n\n##Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore a distinctive type of clothing, which was characterized by simplicity, comfort, and practicality.

The storm caused significant disruptions and damage in several countries in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, its impact on various regions, and related information.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nTropical Storm Alex formed on June 2, 2022, from a tropical wave that had been moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean. At the time of its formation, the storm was located approximately 1,000 miles (1,609 km) east-southeast of the Lesser Antilles. The storm system was characterized by a broad area of low pressure and a large mass of thunderstorms.\n\nOver the next few days, Alex moved west-northwestward, gradually strengthening as it did so. By June 4, the storm had developed a well-defined center and was producing sustained winds of up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). At this point, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified Alex as a tropical storm.\n\nAs Alex continued to move west-northwestward, it encountered a belt of strong upper-level winds that caused the storm to weaken. By June 6, Alex had degenerated into a tropical wave, with the NHC discontinuing advisories on the system.\n\nHowever, Alex's remnants continued to move westward, eventually reaching the southeastern United States. On June 8, the NHC re-initiated advisories on Alex, as the storm had re-developed a closed circulation and was producing sustained winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).\n\nOver the next few days, Alex moved northward, impacting several states in the southeastern United States. The storm eventually dissipated on June 12, as it moved inland over the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n#Preparations and impact\n\nTropical Storm Alex caused significant disruptions and damage in several countries in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States.\n\n##Cuba\n\nOn June 3, the Cuban government issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of Camagüey, Las Tunas, Holguín, and Guantanamo. The warning was later extended to include the provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma.\n\nAs Alex approached the island, strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant disruptions. The storm made landfall on June 4, bringing with it sustained winds of up to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h). The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households left without electricity.\n\nThe Cuban government reported that the storm had caused significant damage to the country's agricultural sector, with over 10,000 hectares of crops affected. The storm also caused significant disruptions to the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding.\n\n##Florida\n\nOn June 5, the National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for the state of Florida, as Alex was forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall to the region. The watch was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning, as the storm's forecast track shifted westward.\n\nAs Alex approached the state, strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant disruptions. The storm made landfall on June 6, bringing with it sustained winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h). The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 50,000 households left without electricity.\n\nThe Florida Department of Transportation reported that the storm had caused significant disruptions to the state's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding. The storm also caused significant damage to the state's agricultural sector, with over 5,000 hectares of crops affected.\n\n##The Bahamas\n\nOn June 5, the Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning for the islands of Grand Bahama and the Abacos. The warning was later extended to include the islands of Andros and Berry.\n\nAs Alex approached the islands, strong winds and heavy rainfall caused significant disruptions. The storm made landfall on June 6, bringing with it sustained winds of up to 40 miles per hour (64 km/h). The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity.\n\nThe Bahamian government reported that the storm had caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure, with over 100 homes damaged or destroyed. The storm also caused significant disruptions to the country's transportation network, with several roads and highways closed due to flooding.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Tropical cyclone\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\n#External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center\n* National Weather Service\n* Cuban Meteorological Institute\n* Florida Department of Emergency Management\n* Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Alex_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impact\n##Cuba\n##Florida\n##The Bahamas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The will is a document that outlines the testator's wishes regarding the distribution of their assets, and it must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the law. This article provides an overview of the key aspects of testate succession in South African law, including the freedom of testation, testamentary capacity, formalities for execution of a will, condonation, invalid wills, and the effect of wills.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nThe freedom of testation is the principle that a testator has the right to dispose of their assets as they see fit, subject to certain limitations. This principle is enshrined in the common law and is also reflected in various statutes.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are several limitations on the freedom of testation, including:\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator cannot make dispositions that are illegal or against public policy. For example, a testator cannot leave property to a person who is not capable of inheriting it, such as a minor or a person who is not a citizen of South Africa.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, 1970, prohibits the subdivision of agricultural land into smaller portions, except in certain circumstances.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002, regulates the subdivision of mineral rights and prohibits the subdivision of mineral rights into smaller portions, except in certain circumstances.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a disposition where a testator leaves property to one person for life, and then to another person or persons after the death of the first person. This type of disposition is subject to certain restrictions and requirements.\n\n### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nThe Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act, 1990, requires a testator to make provision for the maintenance of their surviving spouse, regardless of whether the spouse is a beneficiary under the will.\n\n### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nThe Maintenance Act, 1998, requires a testator to make provision for the maintenance and education of their minor children.\n\n### Pension Funds\n\nThe Pension Funds Act, 1956, regulates the distribution of pension funds and prohibits the distribution of pension funds to beneficiaries who are not entitled to receive them.\n\n## Delegation\n\nA testator can delegate their power to dispose of their assets to another person, such as an executor or trustee. However, this delegation must be made in accordance with the formalities set out in the law.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in the law of succession in South Africa, particularly in relation to the distribution of assets in accordance with customary law. However, customary law is subject to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and any customary law that is inconsistent with the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is invalid.\n\n# Testamentary Capacity\n\nTestamentary capacity refers to the mental ability of a testator to make a valid will. A testator must have the necessary mental ability to understand the nature and extent of their assets, as well as the nature and extent of the dispositions they are making.\n\n## Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nA testator must have the necessary mental ability to make a valid will. This includes the ability to understand the nature and extent of their assets, as well as the nature and extent of the dispositions they are making.\n\n## Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nA testator must not be subject to undue influence when making their will. Undue influence occurs when a person uses coercion or manipulation to influence the testator's decisions.\n\n# Capacity to Witness a Will\n\nA person who witnesses a will must have the necessary capacity to do so. This includes the ability to understand the nature and extent of the dispositions being made, as well as the ability to sign the will in the presence of the testator.\n\n# Formalities for Execution of a Will\n\nA will must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the law. This includes the requirement that the will be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two or more competent witnesses.\n\n## Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be made in accordance with the formalities set out in the law. This includes the requirement that the disposition be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two or more competent witnesses.\n\n## Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nThere are several methods of executing a valid will, including:\n\n### Signing and Signature\n\nA will must be signed by the testator in the presence of two or more competent witnesses. The signature must be made in such a way that it is clear that the testator intended to sign the will.\n\n### Certificate\n\nA certificate is a document that is attached to the will and signed by the witnesses. The certificate confirms that the will was signed by the testator in the presence of the witnesses.\n\n### Witnesses\n\nA will must be witnessed by two or more competent witnesses. The witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator and must also sign the certificate.\n\n# Condonation\n\nCondonation is the process by which a court condones a will that does not comply with the formalities set out in the law. Condonation is only possible in certain circumstances, such as where the testator intended to make a valid will but was prevented from doing so due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\n# Invalid Wills\n\nAn invalid will is a will that does not comply with the formalities set out in the law. An invalid will can be challenged by any person who has an interest in the estate.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by the testator at any time. Revocation can be done by executing a new will, or by physically destroying the existing will.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nA testator has the right to revoke their will at any time. This right is absolute and cannot be limited by any person or entity.\n\n### Manner\n\nA will can be revoked in several ways, including:\n\n#### Later Will or Codicil\n\nA will can be revoked by executing a later will or codicil. The later will or codicil must be executed in accordance with the formalities set out in the law.\n\n#### Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nA will can be revoked by physically destroying the will, or by symbolically destroying the will, such as by tearing it up or burning it.\n\n#### Ademption\n\nA will can be revoked by ademption, which occurs when a specific gift is revoked due to the testator's subsequent actions, such as selling the gifted property.\n\n#### Other Means of Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by other means, such as by a court order or by the testator's subsequent marriage or divorce.\n\n#### Divorce or Annulment of Marriage\n\nA will can be revoked by the testator's subsequent divorce or annulment of marriage. This is because the testator's spouse is no longer entitled to inherit under the will.\n\n### Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can Be Revoked\n\nThere are several exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked, including:\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived by the testator's subsequent actions, such as by executing a new will that revives the revoked will.\n\n## Alteration or Variation\n\nA will can be altered or varied by the testator at any time. Alteration or variation can be done by executing a new will or by executing a codicil.\n\n### Amendment by Testator\n\nA will can be amended by the testator at any time. Amendment can be done by executing a new will or by executing a codicil.\n\n### Rectification by Court\n\nA will can be rectified by a court if it contains errors or ambiguities. Rectification can be done by a court order.\n\n### Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nA will can be altered or varied by a court if it is necessary to carry out the testator's intentions. Alteration or variation can be done by a court order.\n\n## Incorporation by Reference\n\nA will can incorporate other documents by reference. Incorporation by reference can be done by including a reference to the other document in the will.\n\n# Obsolete and Provincial Wills\n\nAn obsolete will is a will that was executed before the current legislation came into effect. A provincial will is a will that was executed in a province other than the province in which the testator died.\n\n# Joint or Mutual Wills\n\nA joint will is a will that is executed by two or more people. A mutual will is a will that is executed by two or more people who are married to each other.\n\n# Probate of Wills\n\nProbate is the process by which a will is proved to be valid. Probate is necessary before the estate can be distributed.\n\n## Lost Wills\n\nA lost will is a will that cannot be found. A lost will can be proved by other evidence, such as a copy of the will or a witness's testimony.\n\n# Content of Wills\n\nA will must contain certain information, including:\n\n## Inheritance and Legacy\n\nA will must contain a description of the property that is being left to each beneficiary. The property can be left as an inheritance or as a legacy.\n\n## Prior and Legal Rights\n\nA will must contain a description of the prior and legal rights of each beneficiary. Prior and legal rights include the right to inherit certain property, such as a spouse's share of the estate.\n\n## Vested, Conditional and Future Interests\n\nA will can contain vested, conditional and future interests. Vested interests are interests that are currently possessed by the beneficiary. Conditional interests are interests that are dependent on certain conditions being met. Future interests are interests that will be possessed by the beneficiary in the future.\n\n## Vested Interests\n\nVested interests are interests that are currently possessed by the beneficiary. Vested interests can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n## Conditional Interests\n\nConditional interests are interests that are dependent on certain conditions being met. Conditional interests can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n### Future Interests\n\nFuture interests are interests that will be possessed by the beneficiary in the future. Future interests can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n### Valid and Invalid Conditions\n\nConditions can be valid or invalid. Valid conditions are conditions that are lawful and reasonable. Invalid conditions are conditions that are unlawful or unreasonable.\n\n## Nudum Praeceptum\n\nA nudum praeceptum is a direction or instruction that is included in a will. A nudum praeceptum can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n## Estate Massing\n\nEstate massing is the process of combining all of the assets of an estate into a single pool. Estate massing can be used to simplify the administration of an estate.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in the law of succession in South Africa. Customary law can be used to determine the distribution of assets in an estate.\n\n## Testamentary Devices\n\nTestamentary devices are mechanisms that can be used to create trusts or to impose conditions on beneficiaries. Testamentary devices include usufructs, substitutions and fideicommissa.\n\n### Usufruct\n\nA usufruct is a right to use and enjoy property that is owned by someone else. A usufruct can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n### Substitution\n\nA substitution is a mechanism that allows a beneficiary to receive property instead of another beneficiary. A substitution can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n#### Direct Substitution\n\nA direct substitution is a substitution that is made directly from one beneficiary to another. A direct substitution can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n#### Fideicommissary Substitution\n\nA fideicommissary substitution is a substitution that is made through a fideicommissum. A fideicommissary substitution can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n### Difference between Usufruct and Fideicommissum\n\nA usufruct and a fideicommissum are both mechanisms that can be used to create trusts or to impose conditions on beneficiaries. However, a usufruct is a right to use and enjoy property, while a fideicommissum is a mechanism that allows a beneficiary to receive property instead of another beneficiary.\n\n### Fideicommissum Residui\n\nA fideicommissum residui is a fideicommissum that is created over the residue of an estate. A fideicommissum residui can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Fideicommissum Purum\n\nA fideicommissum purum is a fideicommissum that is not subject to any conditions. A fideicommissum purum can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Trust\n\nA trust is a mechanism that allows a person to manage property on behalf of another person. A trust can be created by a will or by a deed.\n\n## Bequests Subject to a Modus\n\nA bequest can be subject to a modus, which is a condition or restriction that is imposed on the beneficiary. A modus can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n## Interpretation of Some Common Dispositions in Wills\n\nThe interpretation of dispositions in wills can be complex and nuanced. Some common dispositions that require interpretation include:\n\n### Presumption against Fideicommissa\n\nThere is a presumption against fideicommissa, which means that a court will not interpret a disposition as a fideicommissum unless it is clear that the testator intended to create a fideicommissum.\n\n### Si Sine Liberis Decesserit Clause\n\nA si sine liberis decesserit clause is a clause that is included in a will to provide for the distribution of property in the event that the beneficiary dies without leaving any children. A si sine liberis decesserit clause can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n## Implied Fideicommissa\n\nAn implied fideicommissum is a fideicommissum that is not explicitly stated in a will, but can be implied from the language and circumstances of the will. An implied fideicommissum can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Fideicommissum Subject to a Si Sine Liberis Condition\n\nA fideicommissum that is subject to a si sine liberis condition is a fideicommissum that is created over property that will only pass to the beneficiary if the beneficiary does not have any children. A fideicommissum subject to a si sine liberis condition can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Prohibitions against Alienation\n\nA prohibition against alienation is a restriction that is imposed on a beneficiary to prevent them from selling or transferring property. A prohibition against alienation can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n## Statutory Aids to Interpretation\n\nThere are several statutory aids to interpretation that can be used to interpret dispositions in wills. These statutory aids include the Wills Act, the Administration of Estates Act and the Trust Property Control Act.\n\n## Combinations of Various Interests\n\nIt is possible to combine various interests in a will, such as a usufruct and a fideicommissum. The combination of various interests can be used to create a complex estate plan that meets the needs of the testator and their beneficiaries.\n\n### Fideicommissum upon Fideicommissum\n\nA fideicommissum upon a fideicommissum is a fideicommissum that is created over property that is already subject to a fideicommissum. A fideicommissum upon a fideicommissum can be used to create a complex estate plan that meets the needs of the testator and their beneficiaries.\n\n### Compendiosa Substitutio\n\nA compendiosa substitutio is a substitution that is made over property that is already subject to a fideicommissum. A compendiosa substitutio can be used to create a complex estate plan that meets the needs of the testator and their beneficiaries.\n\n### Ownership Subject to a Usufruct with a Direct Substitution as to the Usufruct at the Testator’s Death\n\nOwnership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the usufruct at the testator’s death is a complex estate plan that combines a usufruct with a direct substitution. This type of estate plan can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Ownership Subject to a Usufruct as to which there is a Fideicommissary Substitution\n\nOwnership subject to a usufruct as to which there is a fideicommissary substitution is a complex estate plan that combines a usufruct with a fideicommissary substitution. This type of estate plan can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Ownership Subject to a Usufruct with a Direct Substitution as to the Ownership at the Testator’s Death\n\nOwnership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the testator’s death is a complex estate plan that combines a usufruct with a direct substitution. This type of estate plan can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Ownership Subject to a Usufruct with a Direct Substitution as to the Ownership at the Death of the Usufructuary\n\nOwnership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the death of the usufructuary is a complex estate plan that combines a usufruct with a direct substitution. This type of estate plan can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n### Fideicommissum in which one Fideicommissary is Directly Substituted for Another\n\nA fideicommissum in which one fideicommissary is directly substituted for another is a complex estate plan that combines a fideicommissum with a direct substitution. This type of estate plan can be used to create a trust or to impose a condition on a beneficiary.\n\n# Effect of Wills\n\nA will has several effects on the estate of the testator, including:\n\n## Rights of Heirs\n\nThe rights of heirs are affected by a will, as the will can create new rights or alter existing rights.\n\n## Rights of Legatees\n\nThe rights of legatees are affected by a will, as the will can create new rights or alter existing rights.\n\n### Abatement of Legacies\n\nAbatement of legacies occurs when the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all of the legacies. In this case, the legacies are abated, or reduced, in proportion to the value of the assets.\n\n## Rights of Fiduciaries and Fideicommissaries\n\nThe rights of fiduciaries and fideicommissaries are affected by a will, as the will can create new rights or alter existing rights.\n\n## Ius Accrescendi\n\nIus accrescendi is the right of a beneficiary to receive a larger share of the estate if another beneficiary does not survive the testator.\n\n### Express Provision Concerning Accrual\n\nAn express provision concerning accrual is a provision in a will that provides for the accrual of a beneficiary’s share of the estate.\n\n### No Provision Concerning Accr", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Testate_succession_in_South_African_law\" following this outline:\n\n#Freedom of testation\n##Limitations\n###Illegal dispositions and those against public policy\n###Subdivision of agricultural land\n###Subdivision of mineral rights\n###Fideicommissum multiplex\n###Maintenance of surviving spouse\n###Maintenance and education of minor children\n###Pension funds\n##Delegation\n##Customary law\n#Testamentary capacity\n##Mental ability of the testator\n##Undue influence on the testator\n#Capacity to witness a will\n#Formalities for execution of a will\n##Requirements for a testamentary disposition\n##Methods of executing a valid will\n##Signing and signature\n##Certificate\n##Witnesses\n#Condonation\n#Invalid wills\n##Revocation\n###Right of revocation\n###Manner\n####Later will or codicil\n####Physical or symbolic destruction\n####Ademption\n####Other means of revocation\n####Divorce or annulment of marriage\n###Exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked\n###Revival of a revoked will\n##Alteration or variation\n###Amendment by testator\n###Rectification by court\n###Alteration or variation by the court\n##Incorporation by reference\n#Obsolete and provincial wills\n#Joint or mutual wills\n#Probate of wills\n##Lost wills\n#Content of wills\n##Inheritance and legacy\n##Prior and legal rights\n##Vested, conditional and future interests\n##Vested interests\n##Conditional interests\n###Future interests\n###Valid and invalid conditions\n##Nudum praeceptum\n##Estate massing\n##Customary law\n##Testamentary devices\n###Usufruct\n###Substitution\n####Direct substitution\n####Fideicommissary substitution\n###Difference between usufruct and fideicommissum\n###Fideicommissum residui\n###Fideicommissum purum\n###Trust\n##Bequests subject to a modus\n##Interpretation of some common dispositions in wills\n###Presumption against fideicommissa\n###Si sine liberis decesserit clause\n##Implied fideicommissa\n###Fideicommissum subject to a si sine liberis condition\n###Prohibitions against alienation\n##Statutory aids to interpretation\n##Combinations of various interests\n###Fideicommissum upon fideicommissum\n###Compendiosa substitutio\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the usufruct at the testator’s death\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct as to which there is a fideicommissary substitution\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the testator’s death\n###Ownership subject to a usufruct with a direct substitution as to the ownership at the death of the usufructuary\n###Fideicommissum in which one fideicommissary is directly substituted for another\n#Effect of wills\n##Rights of heirs\n##Rights of legatees\n###Abatement of legacies\n##Rights of fiduciaries and fideicommissaries\n##Ius accrescendi\n###Express provision concerning accrual\n###No provision concerning accrual\n#References\n##Books\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

One of the most successful Jamaican musicians in history, Belafonte is best known for his iconic calypso-influenced music, including the hit songs \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" and \"Jamaica Farewell\". With a career spanning over seven decades, Belafonte has been a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, using his platform to advocate for civil rights, social justice, and humanitarian causes.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nBorn on March 1, 1927, in Harlem, New York, Belafonte was the son of Melvine Love and Harold George Bellanfanti, a chef and sailor. His mother was of Jamaican and Martinican ancestry, and his father was of French and English descent. When Belafonte was three years old, his family moved to Jamaica, where he spent much of his childhood. He returned to New York City at the age of 13 and attended George Washington High School.\n\nMusical Career\n--------------\n\n### Early Years (1949–1955)\n\nBelafonte began his music career in the late 1940s, performing in jazz clubs and folk venues in New York City. He was influenced by traditional Caribbean music, American jazz, and folk music. In 1949, he joined the American Negro Theatre, where he met Sidney Poitier, with whom he would later collaborate on film projects. Belafonte's early recordings were released on the Jubilee Records label, but it was his 1952 single \"They Didn't Believe Me\" that brought him his first taste of success.\n\n### Rise to Fame (1956–1958)\n\nIn 1956, Belafonte released his breakthrough album, \"Calypso\", which became the first album to sell over one million copies in the United States. The album's success was fueled by the hit single \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\", which became a signature tune for Belafonte. He continued to release successful albums throughout the late 1950s, including \"Belafonte Sings of the Caribbean\" and \"Belafonte\".\n\n### Middle Career (1959–1970)\n\nDuring the 1960s, Belafonte expanded his musical repertoire, incorporating more traditional Caribbean and African music into his recordings. He released several successful albums, including \"My Lord What a Mornin'\" and \"Homeward Bound\". In 1961, he was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance for his album \"Swing Dat Hammer\".\n\n### Later Recordings and Subsequent Activities (1971–2017)\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Belafonte continued to release music, albeit at a slower pace. He released several albums, including \"Play Me\" and \"Turn the World Around\". In the 1990s and 2000s, he released several compilation albums and live recordings. In 2017, Belafonte released his final studio album, \"When Colors Come Together\".\n\nFilm Career\n------------\n\n### Early Film Career (1953–1956)\n\nBelafonte made his film debut in 1953 with a supporting role in the film \"Bright Road\".

The group is led by Solo Sikoa and consists of members from the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty, including The Usos, Roman Reigns, and others. The stable is known for their dominant performances and championships won in WWE.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Anoa'i family has a long history in professional wrestling, with many members achieving great success in the industry. The Usos, Roman Reigns, and other members of The Bloodline are part of this wrestling dynasty. The stable's formation was a natural progression of the family's involvement in professional wrestling.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n\nThe Usos, consisting of Jimmy and Jey Uso, began their feud with The Shield, a stable consisting of Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns, in 2013. The two teams had a series of matches, with The Usos eventually emerging as the top contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Although they did not win the titles, their feud with The Shield helped establish them as a top team in WWE.\n\n### Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n\nOver the next several years, The Usos and Roman Reigns would occasionally team up, often to take on common foes. These team-ups were sporadic, but they helped lay the groundwork for the eventual formation of The Bloodline.\n\n### Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n\n#### Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n\nIn 2020, Roman Reigns, now established as a top singles competitor, began to recruit members for a new stable. He was joined by The Usos, who had recently turned heel, and Paul Heyman, a longtime friend and ally. The group, now known as The Bloodline, quickly established themselves as a dominant force in WWE.\n\n#### All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, The Bloodline achieved a major milestone, with all members holding championships simultaneously. Roman Reigns was the Universal Champion, while The Usos held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. The group's dominance was put to the test by The New Day, a long-established stable consisting of Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E. The rivalry between the two groups was intense, with The Bloodline eventually emerging victorious.\n\n#### Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n\nIn 2022, The Bloodline expanded its membership, inducting Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa. Zayn, a longtime friend of The Usos, had recently turned heel, while Sikoa, a cousin of Roman Reigns, was making his WWE debut. The additions strengthened the group, which continued to dominate WWE.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n\nHowever, tensions within The Bloodline began to rise, eventually leading to a civil war within the group. The conflict, sparked by disagreements between Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn, saw the group splinter into two factions. The Usos and Solo Sikoa remained loyal to Roman Reigns, while Sami Zayn was joined by Kevin Owens and other allies.\n\n#### Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, The Rock, a WWE legend and cousin of Roman Reigns, joined The Bloodline. The group, now stronger than ever, set its sights on Cody Rhodes, a longtime rival of Roman Reigns. The feud between the two was intense, with The Bloodline eventually emerging victorious.\n\n### Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n\n#### Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n\nIn 2024, Solo Sikoa took over as the leader of The Bloodline, following Roman Reigns' departure from the group. The new leader quickly expanded the group's membership, inducting The Tongans, a tag team consisting of Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa, and Jacob Fatu, a cousin of Roman Reigns.\n\n#### Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n\nHowever, the group's newfound stability was short-lived, as tensions within The Bloodline began to rise once again. The conflict, sparked by disagreements between Solo Sikoa and The Usos, saw the group splinter into two factions. The Tongans and Jacob Fatu remained loyal to Solo Sikoa, while The Usos were joined by other allies.\n\nMembers\n-------\n\n### Current\n\n* Solo Sikoa (leader)\n* The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n* Jacob Fatu\n\n### Former\n\n* Roman Reigns (founder and former leader)\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n* Paul Heyman\n* Sami Zayn\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n* 2013: The Usos begin their feud with The Shield.\n* 2015: The Usos and Roman Reigns occasionally team up.\n* 2020: The Bloodline is formed, with Roman Reigns as the leader.\n* 2021: The Bloodline achieves a major milestone, with all members holding championships simultaneously.\n* 2022: Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa join The Bloodline.\n* 2023: The Bloodline Civil War begins.\n* 2023: The Rock joins The Bloodline.\n* 2024: Solo Sikoa takes over as the leader of The Bloodline.\n* 2024: The Tongans and Jacob Fatu join The Bloodline.\n* 2024: Bloodline Civil War II begins.\n\nSub-groups\n----------\n\n### Current\n\n* The Tongans (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa)\n\n### Former\n\n* The Usos (Jimmy and Jey Uso)\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n--------------------------------\n\n* WWE Universal Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* SmackDown Tag Team Championship (The Usos)\n* Intercontinental Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* United States Championship (Roman Reigns)\n* Raw Tag Team Championship (The Usos)\n* SmackDown Women's Championship (Ronda Rousey)\n\nOther media\n------------\n\n* The Bloodline has been featured in several WWE video games, including WWE 2K22 and WWE 2K23.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anoa'i wrestling dynasty\n* The Shield\n* The Usos\n* Roman Reigns\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The Bloodline is one of the most dominant stables in WWE history.\n* The group's membership has changed over the years, with Roman Reigns, The Usos, and Solo Sikoa being the most consistent members.\n* The Bloodline has been involved in several high-profile feuds, including with The New Day and Cody Rhodes.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* WWE.com\n* WWE 2K22\n* WWE 2K23\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* WWE.com\n* WWE 2K22\n* WWE 2K23", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#History\n##The Usos' feud with The Shield (2013–2014)\n##Occasional team-ups (2015–2020)\n##Roman Reigns' leadership (2020–2024)\n###Official Formation of The Bloodline (2020–2021)\n###All champions, rivalry with The New Day (2021–2022)\n###Induction of Sami Zayn and Solo Sikoa (2022–2023)\n###Bloodline Civil War (2023)\n###Addition of The Rock and feud with Cody Rhodes (2023–2024)\n##Solo Sikoa's leadership (2024–present)\n###Additions of The Tongans and Jacob Fatu (2024)\n###Bloodline Civil War II (2024–present)\n#Members\n##Current\n##Former\n#Timeline\n#Sub-groups\n##Current\n##Former\n#Championships and accomplishments\n#Other media\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its early beginnings in the late 19th century to the present day, the telephone has played a significant role in shaping American society, culture, and economy. This article explores the major developments in the history of the telephone in the United States, from the early days of AT&T and the Bell System to the rise of cellphones and smartphones.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is closely tied to the story of AT&T and the Bell System. The Bell System was a network of telephone companies that dominated the industry for much of the 20th century.\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was founded in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The company's initial focus was on developing and marketing the telephone, which was initially met with skepticism by the public. However, the company's fortunes changed with the introduction of the first telephone exchange in Boston in 1877, which allowed multiple telephones to be connected to a central switchboard.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, American Bell Telephone Company was renamed AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph Company). Under the leadership of Theodore Vail, AT&T expanded rapidly, acquiring several smaller telephone companies and establishing a network of long-distance lines. The company's growth was fueled by the increasing demand for telephone services, particularly in urban areas.\n\n## Research priority\n\nAT&T was committed to research and development, establishing the famous Bell Labs in 1925. Bell Labs was responsible for many significant innovations, including the development of the transistor, the laser, and the first commercial touch-tone phone.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T targeted different audiences with its services, including urban and rural communities.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nIn urban areas, AT&T installed public telephones, which became a common sight on street corners and in public spaces. Public telephones were seen as a convenient and affordable way for people to make phone calls, particularly for those who did not have access to a home phone.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nIn rural areas, AT&T faced significant challenges in providing telephone services. The company developed specialized equipment and techniques to overcome the difficulties of serving rural communities, including the use of party lines, which allowed multiple households to share the same telephone line.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, AT&T was broken up into seven regional Bell operating companies, known as the Baby Bells, as a result of antitrust litigation. The breakup marked the end of AT&T's dominance of the telephone industry and paved the way for increased competition and innovation.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe development of cellphones and smartphones revolutionized the telephone industry in the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nThe first mobile phone call was made in 1973 by Martin Cooper, an engineer at Motorola. The first commercial cellphones were released in the 1980s, but they were expensive and had limited functionality.\n\nThe introduction of smartphones in the late 1990s and early 2000s marked a significant turning point in the history of the telephone. Smartphones combined the functionality of a computer with the portability of a cellphone, enabling users to access the internet, send emails, and use apps on the go.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is also the story of the people who worked in the industry.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nIn the early days of the telephone, switchboard operators played a crucial role in connecting calls. Operators were responsible for answering calls, connecting lines, and providing directory assistance.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe telephone industry was one of the first to employ large numbers of women. However, women faced significant challenges and biases in the workplace, including lower pay and limited opportunities for advancement.\n\n### Strikes\n\nIn the early 20th century, telephone operators went on strike several times to protest working conditions and demand better pay and benefits.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Hawthorne studies were conducted to examine the effects of working conditions on employee productivity. The studies, which were conducted at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Illinois, found that employees were more productive when they were given attention and support, regardless of the working conditions.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe telephone industry was a leader in providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and paid time off. These benefits helped to attract and retain employees, particularly in the competitive post-war era.\n\n# Users\n\nThe history of the telephone in the United States is also the story of the people who used the technology.\n\n## Business\n\nThe telephone was initially seen as a business tool, particularly in urban areas. Businesses used the telephone to communicate with customers, suppliers, and partners.\n\n## Housewives\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the telephone became a popular tool for housewives, who used it to connect with friends and family, as well as to manage household tasks.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles, particularly in the mid-20th century. The telephone was seen as a feminine technology, and women were expected to be the primary users.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nThe development of telemarketing in the mid-20th century marked a significant shift in the way businesses used the telephone. Telemarketing allowed businesses to reach large numbers of customers directly, but it also raised concerns about privacy and annoyance.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe introduction of the 9-1-1 emergency number in the 1960s marked a significant improvement in emergency services. 9-1-1 allowed callers to quickly and easily reach emergency services, such as police, fire, and ambulance.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone also raised concerns about harassing calls, particularly in the mid-20th century. Harassing calls, including obscene calls and prank calls, were seen as a significant problem.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone also raised literary fears, particularly in the mid-20th century. Authors such as Ray Bradbury and Kurt Vonnegut wrote about the dangers of the telephone, including its potential to isolate individuals and destroy traditional forms of communication.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* Bell System\n* AT&T\n* Cellphone\n* Smartphone\n\n# References\n\n* Brooks, John (1976).

Malone's work on Jefferson is widely regarded as the definitive study of the third President of the United States, and his scholarship has had a lasting impact on the field of American history.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n------------------------\n\n### Upbringing\n\nDumas Malone was born on January 10, 1892, in Coldwater, Mississippi, to parents who were both educators. His father, John Edward Malone, was a school principal, and his mother, Lizzie Dumas Malone, was a teacher. Malone's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education, which would shape his future academic pursuits. He grew up in a family that valued learning and encouraged his curiosity about the world.\n\n### Ministry and Yale\n\nMalone's initial career aspiration was to become a minister. He attended Mississippi College, a Baptist institution, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1911. However, he soon became disillusioned with the ministry and turned his attention to academia. Malone went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from Yale University in 1916, where he began to develop his interests in history and biography.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Virginia and the DAB\n\nIn 1916, Malone began his academic career as a professor of history at the University of Virginia. During his time in Charlottesville, he became involved with the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB), a project that aimed to compile comprehensive biographies of notable Americans. Malone's work on the DAB would eventually lead him to Thomas Jefferson, a figure who would dominate his scholarly pursuits for the remainder of his life.\n\n### Harvard University Press\n\nIn 1923, Malone became the editor of the Harvard University Press, a position that allowed him to shape the press's publication agenda and pursue his own research interests. During his tenure at Harvard, Malone oversaw the publication of numerous influential works of history and established himself as a respected scholar in his own right.\n\n### Return to Virginia\n\nIn 1929, Malone returned to the University of Virginia, where he would remain for the next three decades. He continued to teach and conduct research, gradually building a reputation as a leading authority on Thomas Jefferson. Malone's work on Jefferson would eventually culminate in the publication of his six-volume biography, \"Jefferson and His Time\".\n\nLegacy and Honors\n-----------------\n\nDumas Malone's scholarship has had a lasting impact on the field of American history. His biography of Thomas Jefferson is widely regarded as the definitive study of the third President, and his work has influenced generations of historians. Malone received numerous awards and honors for his scholarship, including the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1975.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n-----------------------\n\nMalone married Elizabeth Green in 1916, and the couple had two children together. He was known for his warm and generous personality, and his love of teaching and mentoring. Malone died on December 19, 1986, at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy of distinguished scholarship and a profound impact on our understanding of American history.\n\nSelected Publications\n---------------------\n\n### Jefferson and His Time\n\nMalone's magnum opus, \"Jefferson and His Time\", is a six-volume biography that spans Jefferson's life from his birth in 1743 to his death in 1826. The work is characterized by its meticulous research, engaging prose, and nuanced understanding of Jefferson's complex personality. The volumes are:\n\n1. \"Jefferson the Virginian\" (1948)\n2. \"Jefferson and the Rights of Man\" (1951)\n3. \"Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty\" (1962)\n4. \"Jefferson the President: First Term, 1801-1805\" (1970)\n5. \"Jefferson the President: Second Term, 1805-1809\" (1974)\n6. \"The Sage of Monticello\" (1981)\n\nFootnotes\n----------\n\nThis article is based on a variety of scholarly sources, including books and journal articles. While Malone's work on Jefferson is widely regarded as definitive, other historians have offered alternative perspectives and interpretations of the third President's life and legacy.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n### Scholarly Sources\n\n#### Books\n\n* Malone, Dumas. \"Jefferson and His Time\". 6 vols.
