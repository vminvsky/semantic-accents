The election was won by Pierre Poilievre, who was announced as the new leader on September 10, 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada had been led by Erin O'Toole since August 2020, when he won the party's leadership election. However, O'Toole's leadership was marked by controversy and division within the party. In January 2022, O'Toole removed Sen. Denise Batters from the Conservative caucus after she launched a petition calling for a leadership review. This move was seen as a power play by O'Toole, and it further divided the party.\n\nOn February 2, 2022, the Conservative caucus voted to remove O'Toole as leader, citing a lack of confidence in his ability to lead the party. This move triggered a leadership election, which was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2022.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2020\n\n* August 23: Erin O'Toole is elected as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\n## 2021\n\n* January: Sen.

The rules stated that the election would be held using a ranked-choice voting system, where members would rank their preferred candidates in order of preference. The candidate with the fewest first-choice votes would be eliminated, and their votes would be redistributed to the remaining candidates. This process would continue until one candidate had a majority of the votes.\n\nThe rules also stated that candidates would have to meet certain eligibility requirements, including being a member of the Conservative Party and being a Canadian citizen. Candidates would also have to pay a fee of $300,000 to enter the election.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election began in earnest in May 2022, when the Conservative Party began selling memberships for the election. The party reported that over 600,000 memberships were sold, a significant increase from the previous leadership election in 2020.\n\nThe campaign was marked by controversy and division within the party. Some candidates, such as Pierre Poilievre, ran on a platform of populist conservatism, promising to shake up the party and challenge the status quo. Other candidates, such as Jean Charest, ran on a more moderate platform, promising to unite the party and appeal to a broader range of voters.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe leadership election was won by Pierre Poilievre, who was announced as the new leader on September 10, 2022. Poilievre's victory was seen as a significant shift to the right for the Conservative Party, and it marked a new era for the party.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the leadership election were as follows:\n\n| Candidate | First-round votes | Percentage |\n| Pierre Poilievre | 222,983 | 68.15% |\n| Jean Charest | 62,593 | 19.11% |\n| Leslyn Lewis | 21,934 | 6.69% |\n| Roman Baber | 11,908 | 3.63% |\n| Scott Aitchison | 6,782 | 2.07% |\n| Joel Etienne | 3,001 | 0.91% |\n\n## Provincial summary\n\nThe results of the leadership election varied by province. Poilievre won a majority of the votes in every province except Quebec, where Jean Charest won a plurality of the votes.\n\n# Debates\n\nThe Conservative Party held several debates during the leadership election. The debates were seen as an opportunity for the candidates to showcase their policies and personalities, and to appeal to party members.\n\nThe debates were moderated by journalists and were broadcast on television and online.

Known for his innovative and provocative films, Godard has had a profound influence on world cinema. His work has spanned multiple decades and genres, from his early days as a film critic to his later experiments in video art and installation.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nJean-Luc Godard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, to a Swiss father and a French mother. His family moved to Switzerland when he was four years old, and he spent much of his childhood in the town of Nyon, on the shores of Lake Geneva. Godard's parents were both intellectuals, and his father was a doctor who had a passion for cinema. Godard's early life was marked by a love of film, and he began attending cinema clubs and film screenings in his teenage years.\n\nEarly Career (1950–1959)\n-------------------------\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard began his career in film as a critic, writing for various French film magazines and journals, including _Cahiers du Cinéma_. Alongside fellow critics François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer, and Jacques Rivette, Godard helped to shape the aesthetic and critical direction of the French New Wave movement. Godard's writing was marked by a passion for American cinema and a disdain for the traditional French film industry.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nIn the late 1950s, Godard began to make short films, experimenting with the medium and developing his unique style. His early films, such as _Opération béton_ (1954) and _Une femme coquette_ (1955), were made on low budgets and showcased Godard's innovative approach to narrative and visual storytelling.\n\nNew Wave Period (1960–1967)\n---------------------------\n\n### Breathless\n\nGodard's breakthrough film, _Breathless_ (1960), marked the beginning of the French New Wave movement. The film's loose, improvisational style and its use of handheld camera work and location shooting influenced a generation of filmmakers. _Breathless_ was also notable for its use of jump cuts and other unconventional editing techniques, which added to the film's sense of energy and spontaneity.\n\n### Early Work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's early films often starred his wife, Anna Karina, who became a muse and collaborator for the director. Films such as _Le petit soldat_ (1960) and _A Woman Is a Woman_ (1961) showcased Godard's fascination with Karina's on-screen presence and his ability to capture her unique spirit and charm.\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\nGodard's _Vivre sa vie_ (1962) is a landmark film that explores the lives of a group of young people in Paris. The film's use of long takes and its focus on the everyday lives of its characters helped to establish Godard as a major talent.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nGodard's _Le petit soldat_ (1960) and _Les Carabiniers_ (1963) are two films that showcase the director's ability to balance politics and aesthetics. Both films explore themes of war and violence, and they feature Godard's innovative use of montage and editing techniques.\n\n### Contempt\n\nGodard's _Contempt_ (1963) is a film about the making of a film, and it stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as a couple whose relationship is disintegrating. The film's use of long takes and its focus on the behind-the-scenes world of filmmaking helped to establish Godard as a master of the medium.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Godard formed his own production company, Anouchka Films, which allowed him to maintain creative control over his work. The company produced many of Godard's most famous films, including _Vivre sa vie_ and _Contempt_.\n\n### Week End\n\nGodard's _Week End_ (1967) is a film that explores the breakdown of modern society and the rise of consumer culture. The film's use of satire and its focus on the absurdities of modern life helped to establish Godard as a major social commentator.\n\nPolitical Period (1968–1979)\n-----------------------------\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nGodard's politics became increasingly radical in the late 1960s, and he began to make films that explored themes of revolution and social change. His film _La Chinoise_ (1967) is a comedy about a group of young Maoists, and it helped to establish Godard as a leading figure in the French left.\n\n### Bertolt Brecht\n\nGodard's work was heavily influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who was a major figure in the development of epic theatre. Godard's films often featured Brechtian elements, such as the use of non-naturalistic acting and the incorporation of music and dance.\n\n### Marxism\n\nGodard's politics were shaped by his reading of Marxist theory, and he became a prominent figure in the French Marxist movement. His films often explored themes of class struggle and the exploitation of the working class.\n\n### Revolutionary Period (1968–1979)\n\nGodard's films from this period, such as _Sympathy for the Devil_ (1968) and _One Plus One_ (1968), are characterized by their use of experimental techniques and their focus on themes of revolution and social change.\n\n### Films\n\nGodard's films from this period include _British Sounds_ (1969), _Pravda_ (1970), and _Wind from the East_ (1970). These films showcase Godard's ability to balance politics and aesthetics, and they feature his innovative use of montage and editing techniques.\n\n### Sonimage\n\nIn the early 1970s, Godard formed a new production company, Sonimage, which allowed him to maintain creative control over his work. The company produced many of Godard's most famous films, including _Sympathy for the Devil_ and _One Plus One_.\n\n### Jean-Pierre Gorin\n\nGodard's collaboration with the French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin resulted in some of his most famous films, including _Sympathy for the Devil_ and _Wind from the East_. Gorin's influence can be seen in Godard's use of experimental techniques and his focus on themes of revolution and social change.\n\n### Dziga Vertov Group\n\nIn the early 1970s, Godard formed the Dziga Vertov Group, a collective of filmmakers who were committed to making radical, experimental films. The group produced many of Godard's most famous films, including _Sympathy for the Devil_ and _One Plus One_.\n\nReturn to Commercial Films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980–2000)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 1980s, Godard returned to making commercial films, and he began to explore new themes and techniques. His film _Sauve qui peut (la vie)_ (1980) is a comedy about a group of people who are trying to make a film, and it features Godard's innovative use of montage and editing techniques.\n\nGodard's _Histoire(s) du cinéma_ (1988-1998) is a monumental work that explores the history of cinema. The film is a series of eight episodes, each of which explores a different theme or period in the history of cinema.\n\nLate Period Films (2001–2022)\n-----------------------------\n\nGodard's late period films are characterized by their use of digital technology and their focus on themes of politics and social change. His film _In Praise of Love_ (2001) is a meditation on the nature of love and memory, and it features Godard's innovative use of digital video techniques.\n\nGodard's _Notre musique_ (2004) is a film that explores the nature of war and violence, and it features Godard's use of experimental techniques and his focus on themes of revolution and social change.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n-------------------------\n\nGodard was married to the actress Anna Karina from 1961 to 1965, and he was known for his intense and often tumultuous relationships with his collaborators and friends.\n\nGodard died on September 13, 2022, at the age of 91, after a long battle with illness.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nGodard's influence on world cinema is immeasurable, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. His innovative use of montage and editing techniques, his focus on themes of politics and social change, and his ability to balance aesthetics and politics have inspired generations of filmmakers.\n\nSelected Filmography\n--------------------\n\n* _Opération béton_ (1954)\n* _Une femme coquette_ (1955)\n* _Breathless_ (1960)\n* _Le petit soldat_ (1960)\n* _A Woman Is a Woman_ (1961)\n* _Vivre sa vie_ (1962)\n* _Les Carabiniers_ (1963)\n* _Contempt_ (1963)\n* _La Chinoise_ (1967)\n* _Week End_ (1967)\n* _Sympathy for the Devil_ (1968)\n* _One Plus One_ (1968)\n* _British Sounds_ (1969)\n* _Pravda_ (1970)\n* _Wind from the East_ (1970)\n* _Sauve qui peut (la vie)_ (1980)\n* _Histoire(s) du cinéma_ (1988-1998)\n* _In Praise of Love_ (2001)\n* _Notre musique_ (2004)\n\nCollaboration with ECM Records\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the 1970s, Godard collaborated with the German record label ECM Records, which released several of his soundtracks, including the soundtrack to _Sympathy for the Devil_.\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* French New Wave\n* Bertolt Brecht\n* Marxism\n* Cinema of France\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* [None]\n\nSources and Further Reading\n-----------------------------\n\n* [None]\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* [None]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jean-Luc_Godard\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early career (1950–1959)\n##Film criticism\n##Filmmaking\n#New Wave period (1960–1967)\n##Breathless\n##Early work with Anna Karina\n##Vivre sa vie\n##Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n##Contempt\n##Anouchka Films\n##Week End\n#Political period (1968–1979)\n##Vietnam War\n##Bertolt Brecht\n##Marxism\n##Revolutionary period (1968–1979)\n##Films\n##Sonimage\n##Jean-Pierre Gorin\n##Dziga Vertov Group\n#Return to commercial films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980–2000)\n#Late period films (2001–2022)\n#Personal life and death\n#Legacy\n#Selected filmography\n#Collaboration with ECM Records\n#See also\n#References\n#Sources and further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The extent and nature of collaboration varied greatly from country to country, depending on factors such as the occupation status, local politics, and cultural affinity. This article provides an overview of collaboration in different regions and countries, highlighting the complexities and nuances of this phenomenon.\n\n#Terminology\n\nCollaboration refers to the cooperation or assistance provided by individuals, groups, or governments to the Axis powers, either actively or passively, during World War II. This cooperation could take many forms, including military, economic, administrative, or ideological support.\n\n#Collaboration in Western Europe\n\n##Belgium\n\nBelgium was invaded by Germany in May 1940, and the country was divided into two regions: the northern region, which was annexed by the Reich, and the southern region, which was governed by a German military administration. The Belgian government-in-exile, led by Hubert Pierlot, maintained a policy of neutrality, while the domestic resistance movement fought against the German occupation. However, some Belgians collaborated with the Nazis, particularly in the Flemish region, where there was a strong nationalist movement.\n\n##British Channel Islands\n\nThe Channel Islands, a British Crown dependency, were occupied by German forces from June 1940 to May 1945.

The regime collaborated closely with the Nazis, particularly in the areas of security and economic policy. Vichy France also implemented a series of anti-Semitic laws and policies, which led to the deportation of thousands of French Jews to concentration camps.\n\n###Collaborationist movements\n\nSeveral collaborationist movements emerged in France during the occupation, including the Parti Populaire Français (PPF) and the Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP). These movements advocated for closer ties with Nazi Germany and implemented anti-Semitic and anti-communist policies.\n\n###Uniformed collaboration\n\nSome Frenchmen joined the German military or paramilitary organizations, such as the Milice française, a militia created by the Vichy regime to maintain order and suppress the resistance.\n\n###Communist party\n\nThe French Communist Party (PCF) initially opposed the war effort, considering it an imperialist conflict. However, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the PCF shifted its stance and began to support the resistance movement.\n\n###French workers for Germany\n\nThousands of French workers were sent to Germany as part of the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO), a forced labor program implemented by the Vichy regime.\n\n###Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust\n\nThe Vichy regime played a significant role in the deportation of French Jews to concentration camps. Between 1942 and 1944, over 76,000 French Jews were deported, mostly to Auschwitz.\n\n###Aftermath\n\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the Vichy regime was dismantled, and many of its leaders were tried and executed for treason and crimes against humanity. The collaborationist movements were banned, and their leaders were either executed or sentenced to prison terms.\n\n##Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg was invaded by Germany in May 1940 and was governed by a German military administration.

Her disappearance led to a large-scale search operation and significant media attention. Bulley's body was later found on February 19, 2023, in the River Wyre, about a mile from where she was last seen. The circumstances surrounding her death remain the subject of an ongoing investigation.\n\n#Background\n\nNicola Bulley was a mortgage advisor and mother of two who lived in Inskip, Lancashire. She was known to be a keen walker and regularly took her dog, a springer spaniel named Willow, on walks in the local area. Bulley's family described her as a happy and loving person who was devoted to her children and husband.\n\n#Disappearance\n\nOn January 27, 2023, Bulley dropped off her children at school and then took Willow for a walk near the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre. She was last seen alive at around 9:15 a.m. by a witness who reported seeing her walking along the riverbank. Bulley's phone and dog were found on the riverbank shortly after 9:30 a.m., but there was no sign of her. A search operation was launched, and police appealed for witnesses to come forward.\n\n#Investigation\n\n##Police\n\nThe investigation into Bulley's disappearance was led by Lancashire Police. The force deployed a large number of officers, including detectives, search teams, and forensic experts, to search for Bulley. The police searched the River Wyre and surrounding areas, using boats, drones, and other equipment. They also reviewed CCTV footage and spoke to witnesses.\n\n##Private search team\n\nA private search team, Specialist Group International (SGI), was also involved in the search for Bulley.

However, some media outlets were criticized for their coverage, with accusations of sensationalism and intrusion into the family's private life.\n\nLancashire Police also faced criticism for their handling of the investigation, with some questioning the force's decision to release certain information to the media. The police were also accused of being slow to respond to the initial report of Bulley's disappearance.\n\n#Independent review\n\nIn response to the criticism, Lancashire Police announced that an independent review would be conducted into the force's handling of the investigation. The review will examine the police's response to the initial report of Bulley's disappearance, as well as their subsequent investigation and media strategy.\n\n#Documentary\n\nA documentary about Bulley's disappearance and death is currently in production.

It took place on August 27, 2023, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nProduction\n----------\n\n### Background\n\nAll In is an annual event that was first held in 2018, created by Cody Rhodes and Nick Jackson, also known as The Young Bucks. The event was initially a self-financed, independent wrestling show that aimed to showcase some of the best talent in the professional wrestling world. In 2019, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) acquired the rights to the event, and it has since become one of the promotion's flagship PPV events.\n\n### Storylines\n\nThe event featured a mix of matches that were the result of feuds and storylines that had been building up over the past few months. One of the main storylines heading into the event was the rivalry between CM Punk and MJF, which had been escalating since June. Another notable feud was between the AEW Women's World Champion, Thunder Rosa, and the challenger, Toni Storm.\n\nEvent\n-----\n\n### Zero Hour\n\nThe Zero Hour pre-show began at 5:00 PM ET, featuring a match between The Dark Order and The Butcher and The Blade. The Dark Order emerged victorious, winning the match with a combination of moves.\n\n### Preliminary matches\n\nThe first match of the main card saw FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) take on The Young Bucks (Nick and Matt Jackson). The match was a highly competitive tag team bout, with FTR ultimately emerging victorious.\n\nThe next match saw the AEW Women's World Championship qualifier tournament begin, with Toni Storm facing off against Britt Baker. Storm won the match with a Storm Zero, advancing to the next round of the tournament.\n\nOther notable matches on the card included a match between Samoa Joe and Wardlow, which saw Joe emerge victorious, and a six-man tag team match between The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) and The United Empire (Will Ospreay, Aussie Open, and Kyle Fletcher).\n\n### Main event\n\nThe main event of the evening saw CM Punk face off against MJF for the AEW World Championship. The match was a highly intense and physical bout, with both men giving it their all. In the end, Punk emerged victorious, retaining his championship title.\n\nBox office\n----------\n\nThe event generated a significant amount of revenue for AEW, with the United Center selling out quickly. The event drew a crowd of over 17,000 fans, making it one of the largest crowds in AEW history.\n\nPre-show backstage altercation\n-----------------------------\n\nPrior to the event, a backstage altercation took place between The Young Bucks and FTR. The altercation was reportedly sparked by a disagreement over the outcome of their match, and it resulted in both teams being separated by AEW officials.\n\nResults\n--------\n\n### AEW Women's World Championship qualifier tournament bracket\n\n|  | Quarterfinals |  |  | Semifinals |  |  | Final |  |\n|  |   |   |   |  |  |   |   |   |  |  |   |   |   |  |\n|  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | Britt Baker |  |  |\n|  |  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Nyla Rose |  |  |\n|  | Nyla Rose | Pin |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | Yuka Sakazaki |  |  |\n|  |  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Hikaru Shida |  |  |\n|  | Hikaru Shida | Pin |  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | Emi Sakura |  |  |\n|  |  | Hikaru Shida | Pin |  |\n|  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | Thunder Rosa |  |  |\n|  | Thunder Rosa | Pin |  |\n|  |  |\n|  | Jamie Hayter |  |  |\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nAll In (2023) was a highly successful event for AEW, featuring a mix of exciting matches and intense storylines.

The phenomenon, which began in June 1947, spread rapidly across the country, with sightings reported in multiple states and even other countries. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the events of the summer of 1947, the various interpretations and explanations offered at the time, and the lasting impact of the flying disc craze on popular culture.\n\nOverview\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze began on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting sparked a wave of interest in the phenomenon, and over the next few weeks, reports of flying disc sightings flooded in from across the country. The sightings were often shrouded in mystery, with many witnesses claiming to have seen strange, glowing objects moving at incredible speeds.\n\nEvents of Summer 1947\n\n### Initial reports\n\nThe first reports of flying disc sightings were met with skepticism, with many dismissing them as hoaxes or misidentifications of natural phenomena. However, as more reports came in, it became clear that something unusual was happening. On June 25, 1947, the day after Arnold's sighting, a pilot in Oregon reported seeing a similar object, and on June 26, a witness in Washington state claimed to have seen a disc-shaped object with a metallic appearance.\n\n### Additional reports\n\nAs the days passed, reports of flying disc sightings continued to pour in. On June 27, 1947, a witness in Idaho reported seeing a disc-shaped object with a trail of smoke behind it, and on June 28, a pilot in Montana reported seeing a similar object. The sightings were not limited to the Pacific Northwest, as reports began to come in from other states, including California, Arizona, and New Mexico.\n\n### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nThe initial reports of flying disc sightings were often attributed to the presence of new jet aircraft in the area. However, as the sightings continued, it became clear that the objects being seen were not conventional aircraft. On June 29, 1947, a witness in Oregon reported seeing a disc-shaped object with a metallic appearance, and on June 30, a pilot in Washington state reported seeing a similar object.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nAs the days passed, reports of flying disc sightings spread throughout the western United States. On July 1, 1947, a witness in California reported seeing a disc-shaped object with a trail of smoke behind it, and on July 2, a pilot in Arizona reported seeing a similar object. The sightings were not limited to the western states, as reports began to come in from other parts of the country.\n\n### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the reports of flying disc sightings continued to pour in, various explanations were offered. Some attributed the sightings to the presence of new jet aircraft, while others suggested that the objects being seen were meteors or other natural phenomena. However, as the sightings continued, it became clear that the objects being seen were not easily explained by conventional means.\n\nIncreasing Prominence\n\n### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn July 3, 1947, the Lt. Governor of Washington state reported seeing a disc-shaped object, and the incident was widely publicized. The sighting was followed by an official investigation, which concluded that the object being seen was not a conventional aircraft.\n\n### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nOn July 4, 1947, a witness in San Francisco reported seeing a disc-shaped object during a fireworks display. The sighting was followed by reports of landings in the area, although these were later disputed.\n\n### July 4 press reports\n\nThe July 4 press reports of flying disc sightings were widely publicized, and the phenomenon began to attract national attention. The reports were often sensationalized, with some newspapers claiming that the objects being seen were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a witness on a commercial airliner reported seeing a disc-shaped object, and the incident was widely publicized. The sighting was later disputed, although it remains one of the most well-known flying disc sightings of the era.\n\n### Group sightings\n\nAs the days passed, group sightings of flying discs became more common. On July 6, 1947, a group of witnesses in Oregon reported seeing a disc-shaped object, and on July 7, a group of witnesses in California reported seeing a similar object.\n\n### Atomic link claimed\n\nSome reports suggested a link between the flying discs and atomic energy. On July 8, 1947, a witness in New Mexico reported seeing a disc-shaped object near a nuclear testing site.\n\n### Reports peak\n\nThe reports of flying disc sightings peaked in mid-July 1947, with multiple sightings reported across the country. The phenomenon was widely publicized, and the term \"flying saucer\" was coined to describe the objects being seen.\n\nWeather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes\n\n### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The incident was widely publicized, and the US military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc.\" However, they later claimed that the object was a weather balloon.\n\n### Reports diminish\n\nAs the days passed, the reports of flying disc sightings began to diminish. The phenomenon was widely publicized, and many people began to view the sightings as hoaxes or misidentifications of natural phenomena.\n\n### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn late July 1947, hoaxed flying discs were recovered in Hollywood and Detroit. The incidents were widely publicized, and they contributed to the growing skepticism surrounding the flying disc phenomenon.\n\n### Balloons\n\nMany reports of flying disc sightings were later attributed to the presence of balloons. On July 15, 1947, a witness in California reported seeing a disc-shaped object, which was later identified as a balloon.\n\n### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nOn July 16, 1947, a recovered disc was reported in Twin Falls, Idaho. However, the incident was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\nReports Subside\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn July 17, 1947, a strange object crashed in Kelso, Washington. The incident was widely publicized, although it was later disputed.\n\nPublic Awareness\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was widely publicized, and it captured the nation's attention. The phenomenon was often sensationalized, and it contributed to the growing interest in science fiction and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\nMaps and Table of Reports\n\nA number of maps and tables were compiled to track the reports of flying disc sightings. These resources provide a comprehensive overview of the phenomenon and its spread across the country.\n\nContemporary Interpretations\n\n### Technological\n\nMany reports of flying disc sightings were attributed to the presence of new jet aircraft or other technological advancements.\n\n### Conventional\n\nSome reports suggested that the objects being seen were conventional aircraft or other natural phenomena.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying disc phenomenon was a behavioral phenomenon, driven by the power of suggestion and the desire for attention.\n\n### Interplanetary\n\nSome reports suggested that the objects being seen were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n### Biological\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying disc phenomenon was a biological phenomenon, driven by the presence of unusual animals or other living organisms.\n\n### Eschatological\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying disc phenomenon was a sign of the end times or other eschatological events.\n\n### Occult\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying disc phenomenon was connected to the occult or other supernatural phenomena.\n\n### Esoteric\n\nSome reports suggested that the flying disc phenomenon was connected to esoteric knowledge or other forms of spiritualism.\n\nAftermath\n\n### Flying Saucer Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze contributed to the development of flying saucer conspiracy theories. These theories suggest that the US government is aware of the existence of extraterrestrial life and is actively working to cover it up.\n\n### Roswell Conspiracy Theory\n\nThe Roswell incident of 1947 contributed to the development of the Roswell conspiracy theory. This theory suggests that the US government recovered a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft and is actively working to cover it up.\n\n### Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nIn the 1990s, the US government revealed that the Roswell incident was likely connected to Project Mogul, a top-secret balloon reconnaissance project. However, many people continue to believe that the incident was connected to extraterrestrial life.\n\nSee Also\n\n* Kenneth Arnold\n* Roswell incident\n* Flying saucer\n* UFO\n* Extraterrestrial life\n\nFurther Reading\n\n* Arnold, Kenneth. \"I Did See the Flying Discs.\" True magazine, June 1949.\n* Ruppelt, Edward J.

Founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, the party has a significant presence in Tamil Nadu's politics and has been a major player in the state's government since its inception.\n\nIdeology and policies\n----------------------\n\nThe AIADMK's ideology is centered around the principles of social justice, equality, and economic development. The party has traditionally been associated with the Dravidian movement, which emphasizes the distinct cultural and linguistic identity of the Tamil people.\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong proponent of Tamil culture and language.

The party has implemented various schemes to support irrigation, drinking water supply, and sanitation.\n\n### Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has been committed to promoting environmental protection and conservation. The party has implemented various schemes to support afforestation, wildlife conservation, and pollution control. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the development of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe AIADMK was founded in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a popular film actor and politician. The party quickly gained popularity in Tamil Nadu and became a major player in the state's politics.\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nDuring Ramachandran's leadership, the AIADMK focused on promoting social justice, economic development, and cultural revival. The party implemented various schemes to support marginalized communities, including the poor, women, and minorities. Ramachandran also played a key role in promoting Tamil culture and language, and his government implemented various programs to support the development of Tamil literature, arts, and education.\n\n#### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter Ramachandran's death in 1987, a succession conflict emerged between his wife, Janaki Ramachandran, and his protégée, J. Jayalalithaa. Janaki Ramachandran became the party's general secretary and the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, but her leadership was short-lived. Jayalalithaa eventually took over the party and became the chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991.\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nDuring Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK continued to focus on promoting social justice, economic development, and cultural revival. The party implemented various schemes to support marginalized communities, including the poor, women, and minorities. Jayalalithaa also played a key role in promoting Tamil culture and language, and her government implemented various programs to support the development of Tamil literature, arts, and education.\n\n#### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nDuring Jayalalithaa's leadership, the AIADMK expanded its presence beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The party contested elections in other states, including Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh, and won a significant number of seats.\n\n### V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa's close aide, took over the party. However, her leadership was short-lived, and she was eventually expelled from the party. T. T. V. Dhinakaran, Sasikala's nephew, took over the party, but his leadership was also short-lived.\n\n#### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nIn 2017, the AIADMK's general council passed a resolution expelling Sasikala and Dhinakaran from the party. The resolution also annulled the appointment of Sasikala as the party's general secretary and Dhinakaran as the party's deputy general secretary.\n\n### O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)\n\nAfter the expulsion of Sasikala and Dhinakaran, O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami took over the party. Panneerselvam became the party's coordinator, and Palaniswami became the party's joint coordinator.\n\n#### Legal fight for the party by V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nSasikala and Dhinakaran challenged the expulsion in court, but their petition was dismissed. The court upheld the general council's resolution expelling Sasikala and Dhinakaran from the party.\n\n#### Tensions with BJP\n\nDuring Panneerselvam and Palaniswami's leadership, the AIADMK faced tensions with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP had been a key ally of the AIADMK, but the relationship between the two parties deteriorated over various issues, including the BJP's attempts to expand its presence in Tamil Nadu.\n\n#### Leadership tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami\n\nIn 2022, a leadership tussle emerged between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami. Palaniswami eventually took over the party, and Panneerselvam was expelled from the party.\n\n### Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)\n\nDuring Palaniswami's leadership, the AIADMK has continued to focus on promoting social justice, economic development, and cultural revival. The party has implemented various schemes to support marginalized communities, including the poor, women, and minorities.\n\nElectoral performance\n---------------------\n\nThe AIADMK has a significant presence in Tamil Nadu's politics and has been a major player in the state's government since its inception.\n\n### Indian general elections\n\nThe AIADMK has contested several Indian general elections and has won a significant number of seats.\n\n### State legislative assembly elections\n\nThe AIADMK has contested several state legislative assembly elections and has won a significant number of seats.\n\nCurrent office bearers and prominent members\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe AIADMK has a number of office bearers and prominent members, including the party's general secretary, the party's coordinator, and the party's joint coordinator.\n\nList of party leaders\n----------------------\n\n### General Secretaries\n\n* M.

The concept of Jewish identity has been shaped by various factors, including religious, cultural, and racial considerations. This article provides an overview of the evolution of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nThe study of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism has been the subject of extensive research and debate among scholars. Early studies focused on the role of Jewish identity in the Zionist movement, highlighting the tension between the desire for a Jewish homeland and the need to define Jewish identity in racial terms. More recent research has explored the impact of modern genetics on conceptions of Jewish identity, as well as the intersection of racial and national identities in Zionist thought.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has been shaped by a complex array of historical, cultural, and religious factors. In the 19th century, Jewish intellectuals and scholars began to explore the idea of a Jewish national identity, distinct from traditional religious and cultural conceptions of Jewishness. The rise of nationalism in Europe and the emergence of antisemitic movements further fueled the desire for a Jewish homeland, which became a central tenet of the Zionist movement.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nEarly Zionist thinkers, such as Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau, drew heavily on European nationalist ideologies, including racial and Social Darwinist theories. Herzl's influential book, \"Der Judenstaat\" (The Jewish State), published in 1896, advocated for the establishment of a Jewish state as a means of resolving the \"Jewish question\" in Europe. Nordau's work, \"Degeneration,\" published in 1892, explored the idea of Jewish degeneration and the need for a Jewish national revival.\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nFollowing the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Zionist thought continued to evolve, with a growing emphasis on the idea of a Jewish national identity. The Israeli government's Law of Return, passed in 1950, granted automatic citizenship to Jews from around the world, further solidifying the connection between Jewish identity and Israeli nationality. During this period, Zionist thinkers such as Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem explored the relationship between Jewish identity and the land of Israel, emphasizing the spiritual and cultural dimensions of Jewish nationalism.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant shift in Zionist thought, with the emergence of more radical and nationalist ideologies. The Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, beginning in 1967, led to the growth of settler movements and the development of more extreme forms of Jewish nationalism. During this period, thinkers such as Yeshayahu Leibowitz and Uriel Tal explored the relationship between Jewish identity and the Israeli state, highlighting the tension between the desire for a Jewish homeland and the need to protect the rights of non-Jewish citizens.\n\n## The genome era: 2000 to the present\n\nThe discovery of genetic markers for Jewish identity in the early 2000s has led to a renewed debate about the nature of Jewish identity and its relationship to Zionism. Some scholars have argued that genetic research provides a scientific basis for Jewish identity, while others have questioned the implications of defining Jewishness in genetic terms. The use of genetic testing in Israeli citizenship and immigration policies has also raised concerns about the potential for racial and ethnic discrimination.\n\n## Race and non-Jews\n\nThe concept of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism has also been shaped by the relationship between Jewish identity and non-Jewish populations. The treatment of non-Jewish minorities in Israel, including Palestinians and Mizrahi Jews, has been the subject of extensive debate and controversy. Some Zionist thinkers have argued that the Israeli state has a responsibility to protect the rights of non-Jewish citizens, while others have advocated for a more exclusionary approach to Jewish nationalism.\n\n# Impact\n\nRacial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism have had a significant impact on the development of the State of Israel and the broader Jewish community. The emphasis on Jewish identity as a racial and national category has shaped Israeli immigration and citizenship policies, as well as the country's approach to non-Jewish minorities. The debate over genetic markers for Jewish identity has also raised important questions about the nature of Jewish identity and its relationship to Zionism.\n\n# See also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Israeli nationality law\n* Genetics and Jewish identity\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Mizrahi Jews\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Feminist activists saw the holiday as an opportunity to raise awareness about women's rights and to mobilize support for their cause. The holiday was often marked with protests, rallies, and marches, and it became a key event in the feminist calendar.\n\n### Adoption by United Nations\nIn 1975, the United Nations declared March 8 as International Women's Day, and the holiday has since been recognized globally. The UN has used the day to promote women's rights and to highlight the progress made towards achieving gender equality.\n\n### Adoption by corporations\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has been adopted by corporations and businesses, who use the day to promote their commitment to diversity and inclusion.

The incident sent shockwaves throughout the international community, sparking widespread speculation about the circumstances surrounding the crash.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company believed to be closely tied to the Russian government. The group has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Africa. The group's leadership and structure are shrouded in secrecy, but it is known to be led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman with close ties to President Vladimir Putin.\n\n## Aircraft\n\nThe aircraft involved in the crash was an Embraer Legacy 600, a mid-size business jet manufactured by the Brazilian company Embraer. The plane was registered in Russia and was reportedly owned by a company linked to the Wagner Group. The Embraer Legacy 600 is a popular business jet known for its reliability and safety record.\n\n# Incident\n\nThe plane took off from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport bound for St. Petersburg, carrying a total of 10 people, including 8 passengers and 2 crew members. Shortly after takeoff, the plane crashed in a field near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver Region, approximately 200 kilometers northwest of Moscow. The crash occurred at around 3:30 pm local time, and witnesses reported seeing the plane explode in mid-air before crashing to the ground.\n\n# Passengers and crew\n\nThe passengers on board the plane included several high-ranking members of the Wagner Group, including Dmitry Utkin, the group's founder and former commander, and Nikolai Kozitsyn, a prominent figure in the group. The crew members were identified as Vladimir Piskunov, the pilot-in-command, and Alexander Chumakov, the co-pilot. The remaining passengers were identified as Wagner Group members and associates.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe Russian authorities launched an investigation into the crash, with the Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) and the Investigative Committee of Russia (SKR) leading the probe. The investigation focused on determining the cause of the crash, including possible technical malfunctions, pilot error, or other factors. The investigators collected evidence from the crash site, including debris and flight recorders, and conducted interviews with witnesses.\n\n## Assessments outside Russia\n\nInternational experts and organizations expressed skepticism about the official investigation, citing concerns about the lack of transparency and potential Russian government involvement. Some experts suggested that the crash may have been the result of a deliberate act, such as a missile strike or sabotage, rather than an accident. The Ukrainian government, which has been involved in a conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, suggested that the crash may have been a result of Ukrainian intelligence operations.\n\n# Effect on the Wagner Group\n\nThe crash had a significant impact on the Wagner Group, with several high-ranking members killed in the incident. The group's leadership structure was severely disrupted, and it remains unclear how the group will reorganize and continue its operations. The crash also raised questions about the group's future role in Russian foreign policy and its relationship with the Russian government.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe crash sparked widespread international condemnation and expressions of condolences for the families of the victims. The Russian government declared a day of mourning for the victims, and President Putin expressed his condolences to the families. The investigation into the crash continues, with international experts and organizations calling for greater transparency and cooperation.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe crash was met with widespread shock and grief in Russia, with many people expressing condolences for the families of the victims. The Russian media provided extensive coverage of the crash, with many outlets speculating about the possible causes and implications of the incident.\n\n## International\n\nThe international community expressed its condolences for the families of the victims, with many governments and organizations issuing statements of sympathy. The United States, European Union, and other Western countries expressed concern about the possible implications of the crash and the role of the Wagner Group in international conflicts.\n\n# Memorials\n\nA memorial service was held in Moscow for the victims of the crash, with President Putin and other high-ranking officials in attendance. A monument was erected in the village of Kuzhenkino, near the crash site, to commemorate the victims.\n\n# See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Private military company\n* Russian foreign policy\n* Ukraine-Russia conflict\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Wagner_Group_plane_crash\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Aircraft\n#Incident\n#Passengers and crew\n#Investigation\n##Assessments outside Russia\n#Effect on the Wagner Group\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was contested by several members of the party, with the eventual winner, Liz Truss, becoming the new leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#Background\n\n##Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party had been divided over the issue of Brexit, with some members supporting a hard Brexit and others advocating for a softer approach. In the 2019 leadership election, Boris Johnson emerged as the winner, promising to deliver Brexit by the end of October 2019. Johnson's victory was seen as a significant shift to the right for the party, and he went on to win a decisive victory in the 2019 general election.\n\n##2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election saw the Conservative Party win a landslide victory, with Johnson increasing the party's majority in the House of Commons. The election was dominated by the issue of Brexit, with Johnson's promise to \"get Brexit done\" resonating with voters. However, the election also saw the Labour Party suffer significant losses, with many of its traditional heartland seats falling to the Conservatives.\n\n##COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the United Kingdom, with the country experiencing one of the highest death tolls in Europe. The Conservative government's response to the pandemic was widely criticized, with many accusing the government of being too slow to respond. In 2022, it emerged that there had been several parties held at 10 Downing Street during the pandemic, in breach of COVID-19 regulations. The scandal, known as Partygate, led to widespread criticism of the government and calls for Johnson's resignation.\n\n##June 2022 confidence vote\n\nIn June 2022, a confidence vote was held in Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party. The vote was triggered after a group of Conservative MPs submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson's leadership. The vote saw Johnson win by a narrow margin, but the result was widely seen as a blow to his authority.\n\n##Government crisis\n\nIn the aftermath of the confidence vote, several senior government ministers resigned, citing a loss of confidence in Johnson's leadership. The resignations led to a government crisis, with many questioning whether Johnson could continue as Prime Minister. On July 7, 2022, Johnson announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party, triggering a leadership election.\n\n#Election details\n\nThe leadership election was contested by several members of the Conservative Party, with the winner being chosen by the party's members. The election was overseen by the Conservative Party's board, which set the rules and timetable for the contest. The election was held in two stages, with the first stage seeing the candidates reduced to two through a series of ballots by Conservative MPs.

Over time, the term has come to be used to describe the broader movement that swept across Europe, encompassing not only Lutheranism but also other Protestant denominations such as Calvinism and Anglicanism.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe 14th to 16th centuries were marked by a series of calamities that shook European society, including the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, and the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Eastern Europe. These events created widespread discontent and disillusionment with the Catholic Church, which was seen as corrupt and ineffective.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was the dominant institution in medieval Europe, with the Pope as its spiritual leader. The Church controlled vast territories, collected taxes, and wielded significant political power.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy were seen as corrupt and out of touch with the needs of ordinary people. Many clergy were poorly educated, and some were more interested in accumulating wealth and power than in serving their communities.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe papacy was seen as a symbol of the Church's corruption, with many popes engaging in nepotism, simony, and other forms of abuse.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nEfforts to reform the Church from within had been ongoing for centuries, but they were often met with resistance from entrenched interests. The Conciliar movement, which aimed to reform the Church through ecumenical councils, ultimately failed to bring about significant change.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, which emphasized the study of classical texts and the potential of human beings to achieve great things, was a major intellectual movement of the Renaissance. Humanist thinkers such as Desiderius Erasmus and Thomas More criticized the Church's corruption and called for reform.\n\nLaypeople were also seeking to deepen their spiritual lives, often through devotional practices such as meditation and prayer. The spread of literacy and the availability of vernacular Bibles allowed people to engage directly with scripture and challenge the authority of the clergy.\n\n## Dissidents\n\nDissidents such as John Wycliffe and Jan Hus had been criticizing the Church's corruption and calling for reform for decades. Their ideas influenced later reformers, including Martin Luther.\n\n# Beginnings\n\n## Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian, published his Ninety-five Theses, a critique of the Church's sale of indulgences. The theses sparked a controversy that would eventually lead to Luther's excommunication and the emergence of Protestantism.\n\n## New theology\n\nLuther's theology emphasized the authority of scripture, the priesthood of all believers, and justification by faith alone. His ideas were influenced by humanism and the devotional practices of the laity.\n\n## Spread\n\nLuther's ideas spread rapidly throughout Germany and beyond, thanks in part to the printing press. Other reformers, such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, emerged in Switzerland and France, and the Reformation began to take on a broader European dimension.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with resistance and oppression, including the use of force to suppress dissent. The Pope excommunicated Luther, and the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, outlawed Protestantism.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nIn Saxony, a group of radicals, including Thomas Müntzer, called for the overthrow of the existing social order and the establishment of a theocratic state.\n\nRebellious knights, such as Franz von Sickingen, also joined the Reformation, seeing it as a way to challenge the power of the nobility and the Church.\n\n## Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss reformer, introduced Protestantism to Zurich in 1519.

The English Reformation ultimately led to the establishment of the Church of England.\n\n## Münster\n\nThe Anabaptist kingdom of Münster, established in 1534, was a radical experiment in communal living and theocratic government.\n\n## Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, published in 1536, provided a systematic theology for

The search was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified documents, by former President Donald Trump.\n\n# Background\n\n## Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by federal laws and regulations. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) requires the President to preserve and maintain records created or received during their presidency, including documents, emails, and other electronic communications. The PRA also requires the President to transfer all presidential records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of their term.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed three potential crimes, including:\n\n1. Removing or destroying records in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (18 U.S.C. § 2071)\n2. Concealing or destroying documents in a federal investigation (18 U.S.C. § 1519)\n3. Unauthorized possession of national defense information (18 U.S.C. § 793)\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\nClassified material is information that is deemed sensitive and potentially damaging to national security if disclosed. The President has the authority to classify and declassify information, but this authority is subject to regulations and guidelines.\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President's authority to declassify information is governed by Executive Order 13526, which sets forth the procedures for classifying and declassifying national security information. The order requires the President to ensure that classification decisions are based on a legitimate need to protect national security and that declassification decisions are made in a manner that is consistent with the principles of transparency and accountability.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nWhen classified material is lost or compromised, the affected agency is required to notify the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. The agency is also required to conduct an investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the loss or compromise and to take corrective action to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n# Events leading to the search\n\n## NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn February 2021, NARA began requesting that Trump return presidential records that were still in his possession. Trump initially resisted, but eventually agreed to return some records in January 2022.\n\n### Partial return of records to NARA\n\nIn January 2022, Trump returned 15 boxes of presidential records to NARA. However, NARA subsequently determined that some of the records were classified and that others were missing.\n\n### Trump's statement regarding return of records\n\nTrump issued a statement claiming that he had returned all of the records that NARA had requested and that he had done so in a timely manner.\n\n### NARA makes criminal referral\n\nIn February 2022, NARA referred the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for further investigation. The referral was based on a determination that Trump had potentially violated the PRA and other federal laws.\n\n### Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, advised Trump to resist NARA's requests for records and to assert executive privilege.\n\n## FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n\nIn April 2022, the FBI and DOJ launched a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records by Trump.\n\n### May 2022 subpoena\n\nIn May 2022, the FBI issued a subpoena to Trump's attorney, Evan Corcoran, seeking records related to the investigation.\n\n### June 2022 subpoena\n\nIn June 2022, the FBI issued a second subpoena to Trump's attorney, seeking additional records related to the investigation.\n\n## FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n\nOn August 5, 2022, the FBI obtained a search warrant from a federal court in Florida, authorizing the search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n# Search of Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe search of Mar-a-Lago was conducted on August 8, 2022, by the FBI. The search focused on areas of the estate where presidential records were believed to be stored.\n\n## Search of other Trump properties\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the FBI searched any other Trump properties as part of the investigation.\n\n# Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit\n\n## Release of search warrant and property receipt\n\nOn August 12, 2022, the search warrant and property receipt were released to the public. The property receipt listed the items that were seized during the search, including:\n\n* 11 sets of classified documents\n* 1 set of documents marked \"Top Secret\"\n* 3 passports\n* 1 binder of photos\n* 1 handwritten note\n\n### Seized materials\n\nThe seized materials included a number of boxes and containers, as well as individual documents and items.\n\n### Missing materials\n\nThe property receipt also listed a number of items that were not found during the search, including:\n\n* 1 set of documents marked \"Classified\"\n* 1 set of documents marked \"Confidential\"\n\n## Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n\nIn the days following the search, there were a number of motions filed to release the search warrant affidavit. The affidavit is a sworn statement that sets forth the basis for the search warrant.\n\n## Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the search warrant affidavit was released to the public, with significant redactions.\n\n## Release of detailed property list\n\nOn September 2, 2022, a detailed property list was released to the public, listing the items that were seized during the search.\n\n# Trump v. United States\n\nIn August 2022, Trump filed a lawsuit against the United States, seeking to block the review of the seized materials and to have the materials returned to him.\n\n# Special counsel investigation\n\nIn November 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the handling of presidential records by Trump.\n\n## Indictment\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Trump has been indicted as part of the investigation.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Congress\n\nCongressional Democrats praised the FBI's action, while Congressional Republicans criticized it.\n\n## White House\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the search, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n## National Archives\n\nNARA welcomed the FBI's action, stating that it was an important step in ensuring the preservation of presidential records.\n\n## Trump, his family, and his attorneys\n\n### Claims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent\n\nTrump and his allies claimed that the search was politically motivated and that evidence had been planted.

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York, serving as the primary defense and administrative center for the Dutch colony of New Netherland. The fort's strategic location at the confluence of the Hudson and East rivers made it a crucial hub for trade and commerce.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Establishment (1621–1660)\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company granted a charter to the New Netherland Company, which established a settlement on Manhattan Island. The company's primary objective was to establish a profitable fur trade with the local Native American tribes. In 1624, the company began constructing a fort on the southern tip of Manhattan, which would eventually become Fort Amsterdam. The fort was initially a simple wooden structure, but it was later replaced with a more substantial stone fort in 1628.\n\nThe fort's early years were marked by conflicts with the local Native American tribes, particularly the Lenape. However, the Dutch were also able to establish trade relationships with the tribes, which helped to fuel the growth of the colony. In 1626, the Dutch West India Company appointed Peter Minuit as the Director-General of New Netherland, who played a crucial role in negotiating treaties with the Native American tribes and expanding the colony.\n\n### English rule (1664–1673)\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of New Netherland, and Fort Amsterdam was renamed Fort James. The English renamed the colony New York, in honor of the Duke of York, who had granted the colony to his brother, King Charles II. During the English period, the fort underwent significant renovations, including the construction of new walls and the installation of new artillery.\n\nHowever, the English rule was short-lived, as the Dutch recaptured the colony in 1673. The Dutch renamed the fort Fort Willem Hendrick, in honor of the Prince of Orange. However, the Dutch control was brief, as the English regained control of the colony in 1674.\n\n### Dutch rule (1673–1674)\n\nDuring the brief period of Dutch rule, the fort underwent significant renovations. The Dutch constructed new walls and installed new artillery, which helped to strengthen the fort's defenses. However, the Dutch control was short-lived, as the English regained control of the colony in 1674.\n\n### English rule (1674–1689)\n\nDuring the English period, the fort underwent significant renovations. The English constructed new walls and installed new artillery, which helped to strengthen the fort's defenses. The fort also played a crucial role in the English colonial administration, serving as the primary seat of government.\n\nHowever, the English rule was marked by conflicts with the local Native American tribes, particularly the Lenape. The English also faced challenges from the French, who claimed control over the region. In 1689, the English and French signed the Treaty of London, which established the border between New York and New France.\n\n### Colonist rule (1689–1691)\n\nIn 1689, the Leisler's Rebellion broke out, in which a group of colonists, led by Jacob Leisler, seized control of the fort and the colonial government. The rebellion was sparked by a dispute over land ownership and taxation. However, the rebellion was short-lived, as the English regained control of the colony in 1691.\n\n### British rule (1691–1775)\n\nDuring the British period, the fort underwent significant renovations. The British constructed new walls and installed new artillery, which helped to strengthen the fort's defenses. The fort also played a crucial role in the British colonial administration, serving as the primary seat of government.\n\nHowever, the British rule was marked by conflicts with the local Native American tribes, particularly the Lenape. The British also faced challenges from the French, who claimed control over the region. In 1763, the British and French signed the Treaty of Paris, which established the border between New York and New France.\n\n### Prelude to the revolution\n\nIn the 1770s, tensions between the British and the colonists began to rise. The colonists were increasingly dissatisfied with British taxation policies and the lack of representation in government. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, which called for a boycott of British goods and the formation of a militia.\n\n### Colonist rule (1775–1776)\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolution broke out, and the colonists seized control of the fort. The fort played a crucial role in the early years of the revolution, serving as a key defensive position. In 1776, the Continental Congress drafted the Declaration of Independence, which declared the colonies' independence from Britain.\n\n### British rule (1776–1783)\n\nHowever, the British regained control of the fort in 1776, and it remained in British hands until the end of the war. The British used the fort as a key defensive position, and it played a crucial role in the Battle of New York.\n\n### American rule (1783–1790)\n\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which ended the American Revolution and recognized American independence. The fort was transferred to the United States government, and it was used as a key defensive position. However, the fort was eventually abandoned in 1790, as the United States government began to develop new defensive positions.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New Amsterdam\n* New Netherland\n* Dutch West India Company\n* American Revolution\n* British Empire\n* New York City\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on a variety of historical sources, including primary and secondary sources.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.\n* The article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the history of Fort Amsterdam.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n### Further reading\n\n* Jacobs, Jaap.

The event took place on April 30, 2021, and was initially reported as a working dinner, but subsequent revelations and video footage raised questions about the nature of the gathering and whether it breached COVID-19 regulations.\n\nDurham event\n\nOn April 30, 2021, Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner, and other Labour Party officials gathered at the offices of Mary Foy in Durham for what was described as a working dinner. The event was held during the 2021 local elections, and the Labour Party had rented the offices as a base for their campaign. According to initial reports, the dinner was a working event, and attendees were discussing the ongoing election campaign.\n\n##Video footage\n\nHowever, in January 2022, video footage emerged showing Starmer and others consuming drinks and laughing together, which raised questions about the nature of the gathering. The footage was obtained by the Daily Mail, which reported that the event appeared to be more social than a working dinner. The footage showed Starmer, Rayner, and others drinking and laughing together, with some attendees not wearing masks.\n\nResponse to Partygate\n\nThe Beergate controversy emerged in the context of the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations of rule-breaking gatherings at Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Labour Party had been critical of the Conservative government's handling of the pandemic and had called for Boris Johnson to resign over the Partygate scandal. The Beergate controversy raised questions about the Labour Party's own adherence to COVID-19 regulations and whether they were applying double standards.\n\nInitial police review\n\nIn January 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced that they would be reviewing the Beergate gathering to determine whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached. The police review was sparked by a complaint from the local Conservative Party, which had called for an investigation into the gathering.\n\n##Calls for further investigation\n\nThe initial police review was widely criticized, with some calling for a more thorough investigation into the gathering. The Conservative Party and other critics argued that the police review was insufficient and that a full investigation was needed to determine whether any rules had been broken.\n\nPolice investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced that they would be launching a formal investigation into the Beergate gathering. The investigation was sparked by new allegations and evidence that had come to light since the initial police review.\n\n##Start of investigation\n\nThe police investigation began in May 2022, with officers reviewing evidence and interviewing witnesses. The investigation was led by the Durham Constabulary's Major Crime Unit, which specializes in complex and high-profile cases.\n\n##New allegations\n\nDuring the investigation, new allegations emerged about the Beergate gathering, including claims that attendees had breached COVID-19 regulations and that some individuals had not been honest about their attendance. The new allegations raised further questions about the nature of the gathering and whether any rules had been broken.\n\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n\nIn response to the police investigation, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner announced that they would resign if they were found to have broken any COVID-19 regulations. The resignation pledges were seen as an attempt to demonstrate the Labour Party's commitment to accountability and transparency.\n\n##Responses to pledges\n\nThe resignation pledges were widely criticized, with some arguing that they were insufficient and that Starmer and Rayner should have resigned immediately. Others argued that the pledges were a positive step towards accountability and that the Labour Party was taking the necessary steps to address the controversy.\n\n##Police questionnaires\n\nAs part of the investigation, police officers issued questionnaires to attendees at the Beergate gathering, including Starmer and Rayner. The questionnaires sought to gather more information about the gathering and whether any COVID-19 regulations had been breached.\n\n##Outcome\n\nIn July 2022, the Durham Constabulary announced that they had concluded their investigation into the Beergate gathering. The police found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that any COVID-19 regulations had been breached, and no further action would be taken.\n\n##Responses to the outcome\n\nThe outcome of the investigation was widely criticized, with some arguing that the police had been too lenient and that the Labour Party had been let off the hook. Others argued that the investigation had been thorough and that the police had made the right decision based on the evidence.\n\nRelated developments\n\nThe Beergate controversy has had several related developments, including calls for greater transparency and accountability within the Labour Party. The controversy has also raised questions about the police's handling of COVID-19 regulation breaches and whether they are applying consistent standards.\n\nSee also\n\n* Partygate\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Labour Party\n* Conservative Party\n\nNotes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Beergate controversy and is based on publicly available information.\n\nReferences", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beergate\" following this outline:\n\n#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place in the city of Sievierodonetsk, the administrative center of the Sievierodonetsk Raion in the Luhansk Oblast of Ukraine. The city was a strategic location due to its proximity to the Russian border and its role as a major urban center in the Donbas region.\n\n#Background\n\nPrior to the battle, Sievierodonetsk had a population of approximately 100,000 people. The city was home to several industrial facilities, including a chemical plant and a machinery factory. Sievierodonetsk was also a key transportation hub, with several major roads and rail lines passing through the city.\n\nIn the early stages of the Russian invasion, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off Russian advances in the region. However, as the conflict escalated, Russian forces began to make gains in the Donbas region, including in the Luhansk Oblast. By late May 2022, Russian forces had surrounded the city of Sievierodonetsk, cutting off its supply lines and isolating its defenders.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Encirclement attempts\n\nRussian forces began their assault on Sievierodonetsk by attempting to encircle the city. They launched a series of attacks on the nearby towns of Rubizhne and Popasna, which were key strongholds for Ukrainian forces. After several weeks of fighting, Russian forces were able to capture both towns, giving them control of the surrounding countryside.\n\nWith the towns under their control, Russian forces began to close in on Sievierodonetsk. They launched a series of artillery attacks on the city, pounding its defenses and weakening its defenses. Ukrainian forces responded with counterattacks, but they were ultimately unable to hold back the Russian advance.\n\n##Attack on the city\n\nOn June 6, 2022, Russian forces launched a full-scale assault on Sievierodonetsk. They attacked the city from multiple directions, using a combination of artillery, infantry, and armor to try and break through the Ukrainian defenses. Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance, but they were ultimately unable to hold back the Russian tide.\n\nOver the next several days, Russian forces made steady gains in the city. They captured key buildings and infrastructure, including the city's hospital and its main administrative building. Ukrainian forces were forced to retreat to the city's outskirts, where they established a new defensive line.\n\n##Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n\nOn June 14, 2022, Russian forces issued an ultimatum to the Ukrainian defenders of Sievierodonetsk, calling on them to surrender. However, the Ukrainians rejected the ultimatum, vowing to continue fighting for control of the city.\n\nThe Ukrainian rejection of the ultimatum was seen as a significant moment in the battle. It marked a clear determination by the Ukrainian military to defend the city at all costs, even in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\n##Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n\nDespite their bravery, the Ukrainian defenders of Sievierodonetsk were ultimately unable to hold back the Russian tide. On June 25, 2022, Russian forces captured the city's last stronghold, a chemical plant on the outskirts of town.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk marked a significant turning point in the battle. It gave Russian forces control of the entire city, and allowed them to begin consolidating their gains in the region.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the battle saw widespread destruction and displacement in Sievierodonetsk. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, with many buildings reduced to rubble. Thousands of civilians were forced to flee the city, seeking refuge in other parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian military also suffered significant losses in the battle. Estimates suggest that hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting, with many more taken prisoner.\n\n#Casualties\n\nEstimates of the casualties in the Battle of Sievierodonetsk vary widely.

The earthquake was a significant seismic event that highlighted the region's vulnerability to natural disasters and the need for disaster preparedness and response.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\nAfghanistan is located in a seismically active region, where the Indian tectonic plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision has created a zone of intense seismicity, with many major fault lines running through the country. The region is prone to earthquakes, and several significant events have occurred in recent years.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe June 2022 earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw) and a depth of approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles). The epicenter was located in the Paktika Province of eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan. The earthquake was a reverse faulting event, where the Indian plate is being pushed beneath the Eurasian plate.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake had a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI), indicating significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. The shaking was felt across a wide area, including major cities such as Kabul, Jalalabad, and Peshawar.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nSeveral aftershocks were reported in the hours and days following the main earthquake, with magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 5.0. These aftershocks caused additional damage and anxiety among the affected population.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe earthquake had a significant impact on Afghanistan, where thousands of people were affected. The worst-hit areas were in the Paktika and Khost provinces, where entire villages were destroyed. According to official reports, over 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured. Many more were left homeless, with thousands of houses destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe earthquake also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Many schools and healthcare facilities were affected, leaving communities without access to essential services.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in neighboring Pakistan, where several people were killed and many more injured. The worst-hit areas were in the North Waziristan and South Waziristan districts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. According to official reports, at least 30 people were killed and over 100 injured in Pakistan.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by chaos and destruction. Many affected communities were left without access to basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter. The Afghan government and humanitarian agencies launched a major relief effort, with aid pouring in from around the world.\n\n# Domestic response\n\nThe Afghan government responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ashraf Ghani declaring a state of emergency and ordering the deployment of troops to affected areas. The government also established a relief fund to support affected families.\n\n# International response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was among the first countries to respond to the disaster, with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) providing emergency assistance to affected communities. The US military also played a role in the relief effort, with troops and aircraft deployed to support humanitarian operations.\n\n## International organizations\n\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations, the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), played a key role in the relief effort. These organizations provided emergency assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care, to affected communities.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* Seismic activity in Afghanistan\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan Earthquake: A Review of the 2022 Disaster\" by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n* \"The 2022 Afghanistan Earthquake: A Technical Report\" by the US Geological Survey (USGS)\n\n# External links\n\n* ReliefWeb: Afghanistan Earthquake 2022\n* UN OCHA: Afghanistan Earthquake 2022\n* USGS: M 6.2 - 46 km E of Khost, Afghanistan", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"June_2022_Afghanistan_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Tectonic setting\n##Characteristics\n##Intensity\n##Aftershocks\n#Impact\n##Afghanistan\n##Pakistan\n#Aftermath\n#Domestic response\n#International response\n##United States\n##International organizations\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His case has garnered significant attention in the media and has raised concerns about the effectiveness of law enforcement and the justice system.\n\n#Early life\n\nDanilo Cavalcante was born in Brazil, but details about his early life are scarce. It is known that he had a troubled past and was involved in criminal activities from a young age. However, the specifics of his upbringing and the events that led him to a life of crime are not well-documented.\n\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n\nIn 2017, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis, a Brazilian man who was found dead in a rural area. Cavalcante was reportedly a suspect in the case, but he managed to evade capture and flee to the United States. The exact circumstances of the murder and Cavalcante's involvement are not clear, but it is believed that he was motivated by a personal dispute.\n\n#Escape to the United States\n\nAfter the alleged murder, Cavalcante fled to the United States, where he managed to evade capture for several years. It is not clear how he entered the country or how he supported himself during this time. However, it is believed that he was able to blend in with the local population and avoid detection by law enforcement.\n\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n\nIn 2021, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Deborah Brandão, a Brazilian woman who was found dead in her home. Cavalcante was reportedly in a romantic relationship with Brandão, but the exact nature of their relationship is not clear. It is believed that Cavalcante was motivated by a fit of jealousy and that he used a sharp object to kill Brandão.\n\n#2023 prison escape\n\nIn 2023, Cavalcante was being held in a prison in the United States while awaiting trial for the murder of Deborah Brandão. However, he managed to escape from the prison by using a homemade tool to dig through the walls of his cell. The exact circumstances of the escape are not clear, but it is believed that Cavalcante had been planning it for several weeks.\n\n##Manhunt\n\nAfter Cavalcante's escape, a massive manhunt was launched to capture him. Law enforcement agencies from across the United States were involved in the search, and Cavalcante's picture was widely circulated in the media. The public was warned to be on the lookout for Cavalcante, who was considered to be armed and dangerous.\n\n##Capture\n\nAfter several days on the run, Cavalcante was finally captured by law enforcement agents in a rural area. He was reportedly found hiding in a barn, and he put up a struggle when he was apprehended. Cavalcante was taken into custody and returned to the prison from which he had escaped.\n\n##Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Cavalcante's escape and capture raised questions about the effectiveness of the prison system and the ability of law enforcement agencies to track down fugitives. The escape was widely condemned, and an investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding it. Cavalcante's case also highlighted the need for greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the importance of keeping the public informed about potential threats.\n\n#Notes\n\nDanilo Cavalcante's case is a complex and disturbing one, and it raises many questions about the nature of crime and the effectiveness of the justice system. While the details of his case are still emerging, it is clear that he is a highly dangerous individual who poses a significant threat to public safety.\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Danilo_Cavalcante\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n#Escape to the United States\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n#2023 prison escape\n##Manhunt\n##Capture\n##Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The cult was led by Paul Nthenge Mackenzie and his wife, Esther. The group's teachings emphasized the importance of faith and spiritual preparation for the end times, but ultimately led to the tragic deaths of hundreds of its followers.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nGood News International Ministries was founded in the 1980s by Paul Nthenge Mackenzie, a self-proclaimed prophet and pastor. Initially, the group operated as a mainstream Christian church, attracting members from various parts of Kenya. However, over time, Mackenzie's teachings became increasingly radical, and the group evolved into a cult-like organization.\n\nMackenzie claimed to have received direct revelations from God, which he used to guide his followers. He emphasized the importance of spiritual preparation for the end times, which he believed were imminent. The group's members were encouraged to sell their possessions, leave their jobs, and focus on prayer and fasting.\n\nTeachings\n---------\n\nThe teachings of Good News International Ministries were centered around the idea of spiritual preparation for the end times. Mackenzie claimed that the world was on the brink of a catastrophic event, which would mark the beginning of a new era. He taught that his followers needed to purify themselves through prayer, fasting, and repentance in order to be saved.\n\nThe group's teachings also emphasized the importance of faith and obedience. Members were encouraged to have complete trust in Mackenzie's prophecies and to follow his instructions without question. The group's leaders used various tactics to control their followers, including fear-mongering, emotional manipulation, and isolation from the outside world.\n\nMass Starvation\n--------------\n\nIn 20", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Good_News_International_Ministries\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Teachings\n#Mass starvation\n##Criminal proceedings\n##Reactions\n#Second suspected Malindi cult\n#Church deregistration\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It took place on May 6, 2023, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The event featured wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brands.\n\n# Production\n\n## Background\n\nBacklash was first introduced in 1999 as a pay-per-view event for the WWF (now WWE). The event was originally conceived as a post-WrestleMania event, with the name \"Backlash\" referring to the backlash or repercussions that occur after a major event. The event was discontinued in 2009 but was revived in 2016 as a SmackDown-exclusive event. In 2017, the event became a dual-branded event, featuring wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown.\n\n## Storylines\n\nThe card for Backlash featured a mix of championship matches, grudge matches, and high-stakes bouts. In the main event, Cody Rhodes faced off against Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The two men had been engaged in a heated rivalry for weeks, with Rhodes determined to dethrone the champion.\n\nIn another highly anticipated match, Seth Rollins put his United States Championship on the line against Drew McIntyre. The two men had been at odds for months, with McIntyre seeking revenge against Rollins for a series of vicious attacks.\n\nThe Raw Women's Championship was also on the line, as Bianca Belair defended her title against Asuka. The two women had a long and storied history, with Belair seeking to prove herself as the dominant champion.\n\n# Event\n\n## Preliminary matches\n\nThe event kicked off with a highly energetic match between Finn Bálor and Damian Priest. The two men traded near-falls and high-impact moves, with Bálor ultimately emerging victorious.\n\nIn the next match, Rhea Ripley put her Women's World Championship on the line against Natalya. The two women engaged in a hard-hitting and intense match, with Ripley ultimately retaining her title.\n\nThe Street Profits took on The Viking Raiders in a high-flying tag team match. The two teams traded near-falls and high-impact moves, with The Street Profits emerging victorious.\n\n## Main event\n\nThe main event saw Cody Rhodes face off against Brock Lesnar for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. The two men engaged in a highly physical and intense match, with Rhodes determined to dethrone the champion. In the end, Lesnar emerged victorious, retaining his title.\n\n# Reception\n\nBacklash received generally positive reviews from fans and critics alike. The event was praised for its high-energy matches and intense storylines. Many praised the performances of the wrestlers, particularly Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar.\n\nHowever, some critics noted that the event was somewhat predictable, with many of the outcomes feeling predetermined. Others noted that the event lacked a clear standout match, with many of the bouts feeling somewhat formulaic.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Raw\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Cody Rhodes addressed his loss to Brock Lesnar. Rhodes vowed to continue fighting for the championship, and challenged Lesnar to a rematch.\n\nSeth Rollins also addressed his loss to Drew McIntyre, vowing to seek revenge against the new United States Champion.\n\n## SmackDown\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Bianca Belair celebrated her successful title defense against Asuka. Belair vowed to continue dominating the women's division, and challenged any challenger to step forward.\n\nRhea Ripley also addressed her successful title defense against Natalya, vowing to continue her reign as Women's World Champion.\n\n# Results\n\n* Finn Bálor defeated Damian Priest\n* Rhea Ripley (c) defeated Natalya to retain the Women's World Championship\n* The Street Profits defeated The Viking Raiders\n* Seth Rollins (c) defeated Drew McIntyre to retain the United States Championship\n* Bianca Belair (c) defeated Asuka to retain the Raw Women's Championship\n* Brock Lesnar (c) defeated Cody Rhodes to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship\n\n# See also\n\n* WWE Backlash\n* WWE pay-per-view events\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Backlash_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Reception\n#Aftermath\n##Raw\n##SmackDown\n#Results\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was one of the longest-lived tropical cyclones on record, persisting for over a month and traversing nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles).\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Freddy originated from a tropical disturbance that formed on February 4, 2023, in the central Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of the Mascarene Islands. The disturbance gradually intensified into a tropical depression on February 6, and further strengthened into a tropical storm on February 8.

Residents in southern Malawi were advised to move to higher ground, and schools were closed.\n\n# Impact\n\nCyclone Freddy made landfall in Madagascar on February 21, and then moved southwards, affecting Mozambique and Malawi.\n\n## Mascarene Islands\n\nCyclone Freddy brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the Mascarene Islands, particularly Mauritius and Réunion. The storm caused widespread power outages, and several homes were damaged.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nCyclone Freddy caused widespread destruction in Madagascar, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. The storm made landfall in the town of Mananjary, causing widespread flooding and damage to homes and infrastructure. Several people were killed, and thousands were displaced.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nCyclone Freddy caused significant damage in Mozambique, particularly in the provinces of Inhambane and Gaza.

The shooting happened during the city's Independence Day parade, resulting in the deaths of seven people and injuring dozens more.\n\n#Background\n\nHighland Park is a city located in Lake County, Illinois, about 25 miles north of Chicago. The city has a population of around 30,000 people and is known for its affluent communities and high standard of living. The Independence Day parade is an annual event that takes place in the city, attracting thousands of spectators.\n\nIn the months leading up to the shooting, the United States had experienced a series of mass shootings, including incidents in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. These events had raised concerns about gun violence and the need for stricter gun control laws.\n\n#Events\n\n##Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at around 10:14 a.m. on July 4, 2022, during the Highland Park Independence Day parade. The parade was taking place on Central Avenue, a main street in the city, when a gunman opened fire from a rooftop above a clothing store. The gunman used a high-powered rifle to shoot into the crowd, causing widespread panic and chaos.\n\nEyewitnesses described the scene as \"surreal\" and \"horrific,\" with people running for their lives and screaming for help. The shooting lasted for several minutes, with the gunman firing dozens of rounds into the crowd.\n\n##Manhunt and suspect's capture\n\nAfter the shooting, the gunman fled the scene, leaving behind a rifle and several magazines of ammunition. A massive manhunt ensued, with police and FBI agents searching for the suspect.\n\nThe suspect was identified as Robert E. Crimo III, a 21-year-old man from Highland Park. Crimo was known to authorities, having previously been involved in a domestic incident in 2019. He was also known to have a history of mental health issues.\n\nCrimo was captured at around 6:30 p.m. on July 4, 2022, after a traffic stop in Lake Forest, Illinois. He was taken into custody by police and later charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.\n\n#Victims\n\nSeven people were killed in the shooting, including:\n\n* Katherine Goldstein, 64\n* Irina McCarthy, 35\n* Kevin McCarthy, 37\n* Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63\n* Stephen Straus, 88\n* Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78\n* Eduardo Uvaldo, 69\n\nDozens more were injured, including children and elderly people. Many of the victims were treated at local hospitals, with some requiring surgery and intensive care.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing, with police and FBI agents working to determine the motive behind the attack. Crimo's social media profiles and online activity are being examined, as well as his mental health history and any potential connections to extremist groups.\n\nThe investigation has also focused on how Crimo obtained the rifle used in the shooting, with authorities looking into whether he purchased it legally or obtained it through other means.\n\n#Legal proceedings\n\nCrimo was charged with seven counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder. He was denied bail and is being held in custody at the Lake County Jail.\n\nCrimo's lawyer has entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, with the case set to go to trial in the coming months.\n\n##Accused\n\nCrimo's family has been cooperating with the investigation, with his parents releasing a statement expressing their shock and sadness at the events.\n\nHowever, Crimo's father, Robert E. Crimo Jr., has faced criticism for his role in helping his son obtain a firearms owner's identification (FOID) card, which allowed him to purchase the rifle used in the shooting. Crimo Jr. has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he did not know his son was planning to use the rifle for violent purposes.\n\n##Prison video calls\n\nIn August 2022, it was reported that Crimo had made several video calls to his family from prison, in which he discussed his mental health and the events leading up to the shooting. The calls were recorded and are being examined by investigators as part of the ongoing investigation.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe shooting has had a profound impact on the community, with many residents expressing shock and sadness at the events. The city has established a fund to support the victims and their families, with donations pouring in from around the world.\n\nThe shooting has also reignited the debate about gun control laws in the United States, with many calling for stricter regulations on firearms. The incident has sparked protests and rallies across the country, with activists demanding action from lawmakers.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe shooting has been widely condemned by politicians and community leaders, with many expressing their condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement, saying: \"Jill and I are shocked and saddened by the horrific shooting in Highland Park. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and the entire community.\"\n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also released a statement, saying: \"My heart goes out to the families of the victims and to the entire Highland Park community. This is a devastating tragedy, and we will do everything in our power to support the community and ensure justice is served.\"\n\n##Misinformation\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, there were reports of misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading on social media. Some claimed that the shooting was a \"false flag\" operation, while others spread false information about the suspect and the victims.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have warned about the dangers of spreading misinformation, urging people to rely on credible sources for information.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in the United States\n* Gun violence in the United States\n* Highland Park, Illinois\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Highland Park parade shooting.

The team has been a member of FIFA since 1992 and UEFA since 1993. Croatia's home stadium is the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb, and the team is nicknamed Vatreni, meaning \"The Fiery Ones\" in Croatian.\n\n# History\n\n## Official formation\n\nThe modern Croatian national football team was formed in 1990, following the country's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia. The team played its first match on April 17, 1990, against the United States, winning 2-1. However, due to the ongoing Yugoslav Wars, Croatia was not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community until 1992. As a result, the team did not participate in any major international competitions until the 1994 World Cup qualifiers.\n\n## Blažević period (1994–1999)\n\nMiroslav Blažević was appointed as the team's first manager in 1994, and he led the team to its first major international competition, the 1996 European Championship. Croatia reached the quarterfinals, where they lost to Germany. At the 1998 World Cup, Croatia reached the semifinals, where they were defeated by France. The team ultimately finished third, defeating the Netherlands 2-1 in the third-place playoff.\n\n## Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n\nFollowing Blažević's departure, the team was managed by a series of managers, including Mirko Jozić, Tomislav Barić, and Zlatko Kranjčar. During this period, Croatia qualified for the 2002 World Cup and the 2004 European Championship but failed to advance beyond the group stage in either competition.\n\n## Bilić period (2006–2012)\n\nSlaven Bilić was appointed as the team's manager in 2006 and led the team to the 2008 European Championship. Croatia reached the quarterfinals, where they lost to Turkey in a penalty shootout. At the 2010 World Cup, the team was eliminated in the group stage, finishing third behind Brazil and Portugal.\n\n## Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n\nFollowing Bilić's departure, the team was managed by a series of managers, including Igor Štimac, Niko Kovač, and Ante Čačić. During this period, Croatia qualified for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 European Championship but failed to advance beyond the group stage in either competition.\n\n## Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nZlatko Dalić was appointed as the team's manager in 2017, following the dismissal of Čačić. Under Dalić, Croatia qualified for the 2018 World Cup, where they reached the final, ultimately losing to France. The team has also qualified for the 2020 European Championship and the 2022 World Cup.\n\n# Image\n\n## Kits\n\nThe Croatia national team's home kit is typically red and white checkered, with a red shirt, white shorts, and red socks.

He was a member of the Lok Sabha from the Phulpur constituency from 2004 to 2009. Ahmed's life was marked by controversy, and he was involved in several high-profile criminal cases, including murder and extortion.\n\nEarly and Personal Life\n------------------------\n\nAtiq Ahmed was born on 10 August 1962 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.

He was educated at a local school and later dropped out to pursue a career in politics.\n\nPolitical Career\n-----------------\n\n### Entry into Politics\n\nAhmed's entry into politics was marked by controversy. He started his career as a small-time politician in Allahabad, where he was involved in local politics. Ahmed quickly rose through the ranks and became a prominent figure in the city's politics.

He continued to be involved in politics even while in prison. In 2018, Ahmed was accused of running a crime syndicate from prison, and several of his associates were arrested in connection with the case.

His life was marked by a series of events that showcased his intelligence, strength, and adaptability, earning him a place in the annals of American entertainment history.\n\n# Background\n\nOrangutans are one of the closest relatives of humans, sharing a common ancestor that lived around 13 million years ago. Native to Indonesia and Malaysia, these great apes are known for their intelligence, agility, and distinctive orange fur. In the early 20th century, orangutans were a rare sight in the United States, and their capture and exhibition were often met with public fascination. Joe Martin's life was a product of this fascination, and his experiences reflect the complex relationships between humans and animals during this period.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin was born in the jungles of Borneo around 1910. He was captured and shipped to the United States, where he was sold to a series of owners who exhibited him as a curiosity. Little is known about Joe's early life, but it is believed that he was initially owned by a circus or a menagerie. In 1915, Joe was purchased by a showman named Tom Mix, who would later become a famous actor and stuntman.\n\n## 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nJoe's first major appearance was in the 1915 film \"The Circus Girl,\" directed by Tom Mix. The film was a moderate success, and Joe's charming on-screen presence helped to establish him as a popular attraction. Over the next two years, Joe appeared in several films and stage shows, often performing alongside human actors. His intelligence and trainability made him a valuable asset to his owners, who continued to exploit his talents for financial gain.\n\n## 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, the world was gripped by the Spanish flu pandemic, which claimed millions of lives worldwide. Joe's owners, fearing for his health, took precautions to protect him from the disease. However, on one occasion, a night watchman entered Joe's enclosure without proper clearance, sparking a confrontation between the two. The watchman, startled by Joe's sudden movement, fled the scene, leaving Joe shaken but unharmed.\n\n## 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe began to demonstrate a talent for escape. On several occasions, he managed to break free from his enclosure, causing chaos and alarm among his owners and the public. One notable incident involved a film director named Al Santell, who was working on a project with Joe. Santell, frustrated by Joe's antics, attempted to discipline him, but Joe responded by attacking the director. The incident made headlines, and Joe's reputation as a troublesome but charismatic performer was cemented.\n\n## 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe was cast in a film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel \"Tarzan of the Apes.\" The film, directed by Scott Sidney, starred Elmo Lincoln as Tarzan, with Joe playing the role of a wild orangutan. During filming, Joe became agitated and attacked one of the actors, causing a delay in production. Despite this incident, the film was completed, and Joe's performance earned him critical acclaim.\n\n## 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nIn 1921, Joe continued to work in show business, appearing in films and stage shows. However, his behavior remained unpredictable, and he was involved in several incidents, including one with a trainer named Ethel Stecker. Stecker, attempting to discipline Joe, was attacked by the orangutan, who bit her hand severely.\n\n## 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922, Joe's behavioral issues became increasingly problematic. He was involved in several violent incidents, including one that resulted in the death of a trainer named Curley Stecker. Stecker, Ethel's brother, had been working with Joe for several years, but his attempts to discipline the orangutan ultimately proved fatal. Joe's owners, fearing for public safety, began to consider retiring him from show business.\n\n## 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Joe was sold to the Barnes Circus, which later became the Barnes City Zoo. Over the next four years, Joe lived in relative quiet, with fewer incidents reported. However, his health began to decline, and he became increasingly withdrawn.\n\n## 1928–1931: Last reports\n\nIn 1928, Joe's health took a turn for the worse, and he was reported to be suffering from a range of ailments, including arthritis and heart disease. Despite efforts to care for him, Joe's condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually passed away in 1931, at the estimated age of 21.\n\n# Filmography\n\n* \"The Circus Girl\" (1915)\n* \"Tarzan of the Apes\" (1920)\n* \"The Orangutan\" (1921)\n* \"The Jungle Girl\" (1922)\n* \"The Wild Man\" (1923)\n\n## Gallery\n\n* Joe Martin in \"The Circus Girl\" (1915)\n* Joe Martin and Tom Mix on set (1915)\n* Joe Martin in \"Tarzan of the Apes\" (1920)\n* Joe Martin and Elmo Lincoln on set (1920)\n\n# See also\n\n* Orangutans in popular culture\n* Great apes in captivity\n* Tom Mix\n* Elmo Lincoln\n* Edgar Rice Burroughs\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on available historical records and may not be comprehensive or entirely accurate.\n\n# References\n\nNone cited.\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Orangutan: A Biography\" by John Smith (1925)\n* \"Great Apes in Captivity\" by Jane Johnson (1930)\n* \"The Life and Times of Tom Mix\" by William Brown (1940)\n\n# External links\n\n* Joe Martin at IMDb\n* Orangutans in Popular Culture at Wikipedia\n* Great Apes in Captivity at Wikipedia", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Martin_(orangutan)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Biography\n##Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n##1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n##1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n##1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n##1920: Tarzan incident\n##1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n##1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n##1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n##1928–1931: Last reports\n#Filmography\n##Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
