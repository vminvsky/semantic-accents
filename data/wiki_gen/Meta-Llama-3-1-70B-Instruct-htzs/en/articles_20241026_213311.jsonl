She was the longest-reigning British monarch, serving for over 70 years.\n\n#Early life\n\nElizabeth was born in London as the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and at the time of her birth, there was little expectation that she would inherit the throne. She had one younger sister, Princess Margaret. Elizabeth was educated at home, with a governess and private tutors, and developed a strong interest in dogs, horses, and the outdoors.\n\n#Heir presumptive\n\n##Second World War\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth and her sister were evacuated to the countryside for their safety. In 1940, Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities. She began to take on more public duties, accompanying her parents to events and visiting troops.\n\n##Marriage\n\nIn 1947, Elizabeth married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark. The couple had met while Elizabeth was still a princess, and Philip had renounced his Greek and Danish titles to become a British citizen. They had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\n\n#Reign\n\n##Accession and coronation\n\nElizabeth's father died on 6 February 1952, and she ascended to the throne at the age of 25. Her coronation took place on 2 June 1953, at Westminster Abbey, and was broadcast on television for the first time. Elizabeth's reign was marked by significant changes in British society, including the decolonization of Africa and Asia, the rise of the welfare state, and the emergence of the United Kingdom as a global economic power.\n\n##Early reign\n\nIn the early years of her reign, Elizabeth faced several challenges, including the Suez Crisis in 1956, which damaged British relations with the United States and the Commonwealth. She also had to navigate the complex relationships between the British government, the Commonwealth, and the European Economic Community (EEC), the precursor to the European Union.\n\n##Political reforms and crises\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw significant social and cultural changes in the United Kingdom, including the decriminalization of homosexuality, the abolition of capital punishment, and the rise of the feminist movement. Elizabeth's government also faced several crises, including the miners' strike of 1972 and the three-day week of 1973-74.\n\n##Perils and dissent\n\nIn the 1980s, Elizabeth faced several challenges to her authority, including the Falklands War with Argentina, the miners' strike of 1984-85, and the poll tax riots of 1989. She also had to navigate the complex relationships between the British government, the European Union, and the Commonwealth, particularly during the Maastricht Treaty negotiations.\n\n##Turbulent years\n\nThe 1990s were marked by significant personal and professional challenges for Elizabeth, including the divorce of her son Charles from Diana, Princess of Wales, and the subsequent death of Diana in a car accident in Paris. Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis\" speech in 1992, in which she described the year as \"horrible,\" was seen as a rare moment of public candor from the monarch.\n\n##Dawn of the new millennium\n\nIn the 2000s, Elizabeth's reign was marked by several significant events, including the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the introduction of the euro currency in several European countries, and the war in Iraq. Elizabeth also celebrated several significant milestones, including her Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne in 2012.\n\n##Diamond Jubilee and milestones\n\nIn 2012, Elizabeth celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years since her accession to the throne. The celebrations included a flotilla on the River Thames, a concert at Buckingham Palace, and a tour of the United Kingdom. Elizabeth also celebrated several other milestones, including the birth of her great-grandson Prince George in 2013 and the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in 2014.\n\n##Pandemic and widowhood\n\nIn 2020, the United Kingdom was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country's economy, healthcare system, and society. Elizabeth's government implemented several measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, including lockdowns, social distancing measures, and vaccination programs. In 2021, Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip died at the age of 99, after a long illness.\n\n##Platinum Jubilee and beyond\n\nIn 2022, Elizabeth celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years since her accession to the throne. The celebrations included a pageant, a concert, and a tour of the United Kingdom. However, Elizabeth's health began to decline, and she was forced to cancel several engagements. She died on 8 September 2022, at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\n#Death\n\nElizabeth died on 8 September 2022, at the age of 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Her death was announced by the Royal Family, and tributes poured in from around the world. Elizabeth's funeral took place on 19 September 2022, at Westminster Abbey, and she was buried in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\n#Legacy\n\nElizabeth's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the changing times and circumstances of her long reign. She was a symbol of stability and continuity, and her dedication to duty and service was widely admired.\n\n##Beliefs, activities, and interests\n\nElizabeth was a devout Christian, and her faith played an important role in her life and reign. She was also a keen supporter of the arts, and her patronage of music, theater, and visual arts helped to promote British culture around the world. Elizabeth was also a passionate advocate for animal welfare, and her love of dogs and horses was well-known.\n\n##Media depiction and public opinion\n\nElizabeth's depiction in the media was often complex and multifaceted, reflecting the changing times and circumstances of her reign. She was portrayed as a symbol of tradition and continuity, but also as a modernizing force who helped to promote British culture and interests around the world. Public opinion of Elizabeth was generally positive, with many people admiring her dedication to duty and service.\n\n#Titles, styles, honours, and arms\n\n##Titles and styles\n\nElizabeth's titles and styles were:\n\n* Elizabeth II (1952-2022)\n* Defender of the Faith (1952-2022)\n* Supreme Governor of the Church of England (1952-2022)\n* Head of the Commonwealth (1952-2022)\n\n##Arms\n\nElizabeth's arms were:\n\n* The Royal Arms of the United Kingdom (1952-2022)\n* The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom (1952-2022)\n\n#Issue\n\nElizabeth's children were:\n\n* Charles, Prince of Wales (b. 1948)\n* Anne, Princess Royal (b. 1950)\n* Prince Andrew, Duke of York (b. 1960)\n* Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (b. 1964)\n\n#Ancestry\n\nElizabeth's ancestry was:\n\n* Father: King George VI (1895-1952)\n* Mother: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (1900-2002)\n* Paternal grandfather: King George V (1865-1936)\n* Paternal grandmother: Queen Mary (1867-1953)\n* Maternal grandfather: Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne (1855-1944)\n* Maternal grandmother: Cecilia Cavendish-Bentham (1862-1938)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of monarchs of the United Kingdom\n* List of monarchs of England\n* List of monarchs of Scotland\n* List of monarchs of Wales\n\n#Notes\n\nNote: This article is a general overview of Elizabeth II's life and reign, and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account.\n\n#References\n\nNote: This article does not include references or citations, as per the request of the author.\n\n#External links\n\nNote: This article does not include external links, as per the request of the author.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Elizabeth_II\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Heir presumptive\n##Second World War\n##Marriage\n#Reign\n##Accession and coronation\n##Early reign\n##Political reforms and crises\n##Perils and dissent\n##Turbulent years\n##Dawn of the new millennium\n##Diamond Jubilee and milestones\n##Pandemic and widowhood\n##Platinum Jubilee and beyond\n#Death\n#Legacy\n##Beliefs, activities, and interests\n##Media depiction and public opinion\n#Titles, styles, honours, and arms\n##Titles and styles\n##Arms\n#Issue\n#Ancestry\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The search was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of an ongoing investigation into Trump's handling of presidential records, including classified documents.\n\nBackground\n\nHandling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978 requires the President to maintain custody and control of presidential records, which include documents, photographs, and other materials created or received by the President or his staff. The PRA also requires the President to transfer all presidential records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at the end of his term.\n\nCriminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed three potential crimes: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice, and concealment or removal of presidential records.\n\nClassified material and the presidency\n\nDeclassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President has the authority to classify and declassify national security information. However, there are regulations and protocols in place to ensure that classified material is handled and stored properly. The President's authority to declassify material is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations and requirements.\n\nProtocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nWhen classified material is lost or compromised, there are protocols in place to report and respond to the incident. These protocols include notifying the relevant authorities, such as the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence, and conducting an investigation to determine the cause of the loss or compromise.\n\nEvents leading to the search\n\nNARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n\nIn January 2022, NARA requested that Trump's representatives return all presidential records in their possession.

United States\n\nIn August 2022, Trump filed a lawsuit against the United States, seeking to block the release of the search warrant affidavit and to obtain the return of the seized materials.\n\nSpecial counsel investigation\n\nIndictment\n\nOn August 25, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted a former Trump advisor, Stephen Bannon, for contempt of Congress.\n\nReactions\n\nCongress\n\nMembers of Congress reacted to the search, with some Democrats praising the DOJ's actions and some Republicans criticizing them.\n\nWhite House\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the search, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\nNational Archives\n\nNARA released a statement, saying that it was cooperating with the DOJ's investigation and that it had referred the matter to the DOJ.\n\nTrump, his family, and his attorneys\n\nClaims of political motivation, planted evidence, and Obama precedent\n\nTrump and his attorneys claimed that the search was motivated by politics and that the DOJ had \"planted\" evidence at Mar-a-Lago. They also claimed that President Obama had done the same thing.\n\nClaims of declassifying all documents\n\nTrump claimed that he had declassified all of the documents at Mar-a-Lago, but this claim was disputed by the DOJ.\n\nLawsuit\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit against the United States, seeking to block the release of the search warrant affidavit and to obtain the return of the seized materials.\n\nTrump allies and supporters\n\nThreats against government officials\n\nSome Trump allies and supporters made threats against government officials, including the judge who signed the search warrant.\n\nFBI field office attack\n\nOn August 11, 2022, an armed man attacked an FBI field office in Cincinnati, Ohio, in apparent response to the search.\n\nRepublican elected officials and candidates\n\nMany Republican elected officials and candidates criticized the search, with some calling for the impeachment of Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nCongressional Democrats\n\nMany Congressional Democrats praised the DOJ's actions, saying that they were necessary to protect national security.\n\nScholars and former officials\n\nMany scholars and former officials praised the DOJ's actions, saying that they were necessary to enforce the law.\n\nIntelligence community\n\nThe intelligence community praised the DOJ's actions, saying that they were necessary to protect national security.\n\nFormer Trump administration figures\n\nSome former Trump administration figures, including former Attorney General William Barr, praised the DOJ's actions.\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n\n* Mar-a-Lago\n* Donald Trump\n* Presidential Records Act\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FBI_search_of_Mar-a-Lago\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n###Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n###Classified material and the presidency\n####Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n####Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n#Events leading to the search\n##NARA actions to retrieve presidential records from Mar-a-Lago\n###Partial return of records to NARA\n###Trump's statement regarding return of records\n###NARA makes criminal referral\n###Tom Fitton's advice to Trump\n##FBI/DOJ launches criminal investigation and issues subpoenas\n###May 2022 subpoena\n###June 2022 subpoena\n##FBI/DOJ obtains search warrant from federal court\n#Search of Mar-a-Lago\n##Search of other Trump properties\n#Release of search warrant, property receipt, and affidavit\n##Release of search warrant and property receipt\n###Seized materials\n###Missing materials\n##Motions to release search warrant affidavit\n##Release of redacted search warrant affidavit\n##Release of detailed property list\n#Trump v.

The conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n#Background\n\n##War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe war in Darfur, which began in 2003, led to the formation of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti. The RSF was initially formed as a militia group to fight against rebel groups in Darfur, but it has since evolved into a powerful force with its own military equipment and personnel.\n\n##Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan for over three decades. A transitional government was formed, led by a sovereign council consisting of military and civilian leaders. However, the transitional government struggled to maintain stability and address the country's economic and social challenges.\n\n##Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) are two rebel groups that have been fighting against the Sudanese government for years. The SPLM-N was formed in 2011, after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The SLM was formed in 2002, during the war in Darfur.\n\n##Prelude\n\nTensions between the SAF and the RSF had been building for months before the conflict began. In March 2023, the RSF seized control of a key military base in Khartoum, leading to clashes between the two groups. The conflict escalated in April 2023, when the RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum.\n\n#Course of the war\n\n##April–May 2023\n\n###Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe battle of Khartoum was a key turning point in the conflict. The RSF launched a surprise attack on the SAF in Khartoum, catching the military off guard. The SAF responded with airstrikes and artillery fire, but the RSF was able to hold its ground. The battle lasted for several days, resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides.\n\n###Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn May 11, 2023, the SAF and the RSF signed the Treaty of Jeddah, a ceasefire agreement brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The treaty called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of RSF forces from Khartoum. However, the treaty was short-lived, and fighting resumed in June 2023.\n\n##June–September 2023\n\n###Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the Treaty of Jeddah, fighting continued in Khartoum, with both sides accusing each other of violating the ceasefire. The RSF launched a series of attacks on SAF positions in the city, while the SAF responded with airstrikes and artillery fire.\n\n###Diplomatic efforts\n\nInternational efforts to broker a peace agreement between the SAF and the RSF continued throughout June and July 2023. The African Union and the United Nations led diplomatic efforts, but a breakthrough was not achieved.\n\n###SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N, led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, announced its support for the RSF.

Born in the jungles of Borneo, Joe was captured and brought to the United States, where he became a popular attraction in the entertainment industry. His life was marked by numerous incidents, escapes, and behavioral issues, which ultimately led to his decline and disappearance from public records.\n\n#Background\n\nOrangutans, native to Indonesia and Malaysia, were highly sought after as exotic animals in the early 20th century. The demand for these great apes was driven by the growing entertainment industry, which saw them as a lucrative attraction. Many orangutans, including Joe Martin, were captured from the wild and brought to the United States, where they were trained to perform tricks and stunts for audiences.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin was born in the jungles of Borneo around 1910. He was captured by animal traders and shipped to the United States, where he was sold to a exotic animal dealer. Joe's first owners were a family who kept him as a pet, but soon realized that caring for an orangutan was a significant challenge. They eventually sold Joe to a film production company, which saw potential in the charismatic ape.\n\n##1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nJoe's film career began in 1915, when he appeared in a series of short films produced by the Thanhouser Company. His breakout film, \"The Orangutan,\" was released in 1916 and showcased Joe's agility and intelligence. The film was a commercial success, and Joe became a sought-after actor in the film industry. He went on to appear in numerous films, often playing the role of a mischievous ape.\n\n##1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, the United States was hit by the Spanish flu pandemic, which affected millions of people. Joe's owners, fearing for his health, took extra precautions to protect him from the disease. However, Joe's curiosity and mischievous nature led him to escape from his enclosure, where he encountered a night-watchman. The incident ended with Joe being subdued and returned to his enclosure, but it marked the beginning of his reputation as a troublesome ape.\n\n##1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe escaped from his enclosure on multiple occasions, causing chaos and concern among his owners. One notable incident involved Al Santell, a film director who was working with Joe on a project. Santell claimed that Joe had attacked him, but witnesses disputed the account, suggesting that Joe was simply playing a prank on the director.\n\n##1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe was cast in a film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' \"Tarzan of the Apes.\" The film was a major production, and Joe's scenes were highly publicized. However, during filming, Joe became agitated and attacked one of the actors, causing a significant delay in production.\n\n##1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nDespite the incidents, Joe continued to work in the entertainment industry, appearing in films and stage shows. In 1921, he was involved in an incident with Ethel Stecker, a actress who claimed that Joe had bitten her. The incident led to a lawsuit, which was eventually settled out of court.\n\n##1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922, Joe's behavioral issues became more pronounced, and he was involved in several incidents that raised concerns about his safety and the safety of those around him. Tragedy struck in 1923, when Curley Stecker, a animal trainer who had worked with Joe, died from injuries sustained while working with the ape.\n\n##1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Joe was sold to the Barnes Circus, where he became a main attraction. He spent several years with the circus, performing tricks and stunts for audiences. In 1927, the circus was sold to the Barnes City Zoo, where Joe was kept in a large enclosure.\n\n##1928–1931: Last reports\n\nThe last reports of Joe Martin date back to 1931, when he was still living at the Barnes City Zoo. However, his condition had deteriorated significantly, and he was no longer performing in public. The exact circumstances of his death are unknown, but it is believed that he died in the early 1930s.\n\n#Filmography\n\n* The Orangutan (1916)\n* Tarzan of the Apes (1920)\n* The Ape Man (1921)\n* The Jungle King (1922)\n* The Missing Link (1923)\n\n##Gallery\n\n* Joe Martin in his enclosure at the Barnes City Zoo (1928)\n* Joe Martin performing in a stage show (1920)\n* Joe Martin with his trainer, Curley Stecker (1922)\n\n#See also\n\n* Orangutans in popular culture\n* Great apes in entertainment\n* Animal training\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is based on historical records and accounts of Joe Martin's life.\n* The accuracy of some events and incidents may be disputed due to the passage of time and the lack of primary sources.\n\n#References\n\n* (None)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Orangutan in Captivity\" by H.

The conflict has its roots in the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia, which led to a protracted conflict in eastern Ukraine. This article provides an overview of the key events and developments that led up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Background\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014, when pro-Russian separatists declared independence from Ukraine in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Ukrainian government responded with force, leading to a prolonged conflict that has resulted in over 14,000 deaths. The conflict has been fueled by Russian support for the separatists, including the provision of military equipment and personnel. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 further strained relations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n# Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n\nIn March 2021, tensions began to escalate along the Russia–Ukraine border, with a significant increase in ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of attempting to provoke a conflict, while Russia claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the escalation.\n\n## First Russian military buildup\n\nIn late March 2021, Russia began a large-scale military buildup along the Russia–Ukraine border. The buildup included the deployment of tanks, artillery, and infantry, as well as the construction of field hospitals and other military infrastructure. The Ukrainian government expressed concern about the buildup, which it saw as a threat to its national security.\n\n## Continued violence and escalation\n\nDespite international calls for a ceasefire, violence continued to escalate in eastern Ukraine. In April 2021, a Ukrainian soldier was killed in a skirmish with separatist forces, leading to a significant increase in tensions. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of attempting to escalate the conflict, while Russia claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the violence.\n\n## Partial withdrawal\n\nIn late April 2021, Russia announced a partial withdrawal of its troops from the Russia–Ukraine border. However, the withdrawal was limited, and many of the troops remained in place. The Ukrainian government expressed skepticism about the withdrawal, which it saw as a tactical move rather than a genuine attempt to reduce tensions.\n\n# Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n\nIn October 2021, tensions began to escalate once again along the Russia–Ukraine border. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of attempting to provoke a conflict, while Russia claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the escalation.\n\n## Second Russian military buildup\n\nIn late October 2021, Russia began a second large-scale military buildup along the Russia–Ukraine border. The buildup included the deployment of additional troops, tanks, and artillery, as well as the construction of new military infrastructure.\n\n### November 2021–December 2021\n\nIn November and December 2021, the Russian military buildup continued, with the deployment of additional troops and equipment. The Ukrainian government expressed concern about the buildup, which it saw as a threat to its national security.\n\n### January 2022\n\nIn January 2022, the Russian military buildup continued, with the deployment of additional troops and equipment. The Ukrainian government accused Russia of attempting to provoke a conflict, while Russia claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the escalation.\n\n### February 2022\n\nIn February 2022, the Russian military buildup reached its peak, with over 150,000 troops deployed along the Russia–Ukraine border.

Ron Hubbard. The Church of Scientology, which is the primary organization promoting and practicing Scientology, claims that it is a new religious movement that has attracted millions of followers worldwide. However, Scientology has been the subject of intense controversy and criticism, with many regarding it as a cult or a pseudoscientific theory.\n\nDefinition and Classification\n-----------------------------\n\nScientology is often described as a self-help system, a philosophy, or a spiritual movement. However, its exact classification is a matter of debate.\n\n### Debates over Classification\n\nSome scholars and experts consider Scientology to be a new religious movement, while others view it as a cult or a pseudoscientific theory. The Church of Scientology claims that it is a legitimate religion, but many governments and organizations have rejected this classification.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" is derived from the Latin word \"scientia,\" meaning \"knowledge,\" and the Greek word \"logos,\" meaning \"study\" or \"science.\" Hubbard coined the term in 1952, and it first appeared in his book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.\"\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nScientology has its roots in Hubbard's earlier self-help system, Dianetics, which he developed in the 1940s. Dianetics was a system of psychotherapy that claimed to help individuals overcome psychological traumas and achieve spiritual enlightenment. However, the system was widely criticized, and Hubbard was accused of making false claims about its effectiveness.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hubbard began to develop Scientology, which he claimed was a more advanced and spiritual system than Dianetics. He founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles in 1954, and the movement quickly gained a following.\n\nBeliefs and Practices\n----------------------\n\nScientology is a complex and multifaceted system of beliefs and practices. At its core, it is a self-help system that claims to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and overcome psychological traumas.\n\n### Auditing\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology. It involves a process of counseling and self-reflection, in which an individual (known as a \"preclear\") is guided by a trained auditor to confront and overcome past traumas and negative experiences.\n\n### Soul\n\nScientologists believe in the concept of a spiritual soul, which they call the \"thetan.\" According to Scientology, the thetan is an immortal, spiritual being that has lived multiple lives and has accumulated various spiritual traumas and negative experiences.\n\n### Space Opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nOne of the most distinctive and controversial aspects of Scientology is its space opera mythology. According to Hubbard, 75 million years ago, an alien warlord named Xenu brought billions of aliens to Earth and killed them using hydrogen bombs. The souls of these aliens, known as \"thetans,\" were then trapped on Earth and have been reincarnated into human bodies ever since.\n\n### The Operating Thetan Levels\n\nScientologists believe that through auditing and other spiritual practices, individuals can achieve a state of spiritual enlightenment known as \"Operating Thetan\" (OT). There are eight levels of OT, each of which is said to confer greater spiritual abilities and knowledge.\n\n### Ethics\n\nScientologists believe in a strict code of ethics, which emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and responsibility. However, critics have accused the Church of Scientology of using its ethics code to control and manipulate its members.\n\n### Symbology\n\nScientology has a distinctive symbology, which includes the use of various logos, symbols, and rituals. The most famous symbol of Scientology is the \"Dianetics symbol,\" which features two interlocking triangles.\n\n### Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychosis\n\nScientologists are strongly opposed to psychiatry and psychology, which they view as pseudoscientific and oppressive. Hubbard was a vocal critic of psychiatry, and his views on the subject have been widely criticized as uninformed and misleading.\n\n### Views on Hubbard\n\nScientologists view Hubbard as a spiritual leader and a visionary. However, critics have accused him of being a cult leader and a charlatan.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\n-------------------------\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the primary organization promoting and practicing Scientology. It was founded by Hubbard in 1954 and is headquartered in Los Angeles.\n\n### Internal Organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a complex internal organization, which includes various departments, committees, and councils. At the top of the organization is the \"Chairman of the Board,\" who is currently David Miscavige.\n\n### Promotional Material\n\nThe Church of Scientology produces a vast amount of promotional material, including books, videos, and websites. Much of this material is designed to attract new members and promote the benefits of Scientology.\n\n### Social Outreach\n\nThe Church of Scientology engages in various social outreach programs, including disaster relief, education, and human rights advocacy. However, critics have accused the church of using these programs as a front for recruitment and propaganda.\n\n### Responses to Opponents\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for being hostile and aggressive towards its opponents. Critics have accused the church of using harassment, intimidation, and litigation to silence its critics.\n\n### Suppressive Persons and Fair Game\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Scientology is its concept of \"suppressive persons\" (SPs). According to Scientology, SPs are individuals who are opposed to the church and its teachings. The church has a policy of \"fair game,\" which allows its members to use any means necessary to attack and discredit SPs.\n\nFree Zone and Independent Scientology\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, a movement known as the \"Free Zone\" has emerged, which consists of individuals who practice Scientology outside of the official Church of Scientology. These individuals often reject the church's authoritarianism and dogmatism, and instead emphasize the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Scientology.\n\nControversies\n--------------\n\nScientology has been the subject of intense controversy and criticism over the years.\n\n### Hubbard's Motives\n\nCritics have accused Hubbard of being a cult leader and a charlatan, who used Scientology to manipulate and control his followers.\n\n### Criminal Behavior\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been involved in various criminal activities, including tax evasion, embezzlement, and harassment.\n\n### Organized Harassment\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for using organized harassment and intimidation to silence its critics. This has included the use of private investigators, lawsuits, and other forms of coercion.\n\n#### Mistreatment of Members\n\nCritics have accused the Church of Scientology of mistreating its members, including physical and emotional abuse.\n\n### Violation of Auditing Confidentiality\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of violating the confidentiality of its auditing sessions, which has led to the publication of sensitive and personal information about its members.\n\n### Allegations of Coerced Abortions\n\nFormer members of the Church of Scientology have accused the church of coercing women into having abortions, in order to prevent them from becoming pregnant while working for the church.\n\n### Allegation of Human Trafficking and Other Crimes Against Women\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been accused of human trafficking and other crimes against women, including forced labor, physical abuse, and emotional manipulation.\n\n### Scientology, Litigation, and the Internet\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for using litigation to silence its critics and control the flow of information about Scientology on the internet.\n\nDisputes over Legal Status\n---------------------------\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been involved in various disputes over its legal status, including its tax-exempt status and its right to practice as a religion.\n\nScientology in Religious Studies\n--------------------------------\n\nScientology has been the subject of study in the field of religious studies.\n\n### Influences\n\nScientology has been influenced by various spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and science fiction.\n\nDemographics\n-------------\n\nThe demographics of Scientology are difficult to determine, due to the church's secrecy and lack of transparency.\n\n### Recruitment\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for being aggressive and manipulative in its recruitment practices.\n\nReception and Influence\n-------------------------\n\nScientology has had a significant impact on popular culture and society.\n\n### Media, Popular Culture, and Academia\n\nScientology has been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows, and has been studied by scholars in various fields.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Dianetics\n* L.

The album was initially teased in August 2021, when Kendrick Lamar announced that he was working on his final album for Top Dawg Entertainment, the record label that signed him in 2009. In a statement on the label's website, Kendrick expressed his gratitude to the label and its founder, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, while also hinting at a new chapter in his career.\n\nIn the months leading up to the album's release, Kendrick Lamar remained relatively quiet, fueling speculation about the album's content and direction. However, in April 2022, he broke his silence with a series of cryptic posts on social media, including a photo of a handwritten note that read, \"All factual information is given through Compton, California.\"\n\n#Recording\n\nThe recording process for Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was marked by a period of intense creativity and experimentation.

The album's sound is characterized by its use of live instrumentation, including piano, bass, and drums, as well as a range of electronic and sampled elements.\n\nThe album's production is notable for its use of unconventional sounds and textures, including distorted synths, eerie sound effects, and manipulated vocal samples. This approach creates a sense of tension and unease, which is reflective of the album's themes of anxiety, self-doubt, and social commentary.\n\n##Themes\n\nThe album's lyrics are marked by a sense of introspection and self-awareness, as Kendrick Lamar grapples with themes of identity, morality, and personal growth. He explores topics such as toxic masculinity, racism, and the pressures of fame, often using humor and irony to make pointed social commentary.\n\nThroughout the album, Kendrick Lamar also engages with themes of family, relationships, and community, often drawing on his own experiences growing up in Compton. These themes are woven together with a sense of storytelling and narrative, which is a hallmark of Kendrick Lamar's songwriting style.\n\n##Songs\n\nThe album's tracklist is notable for its diversity and range, with each song offering a unique perspective on the album's themes. Some of the standout tracks include \"N95,\" which features a haunting piano riff and a scathing critique of racism and police brutality; \"Die Hard,\" which features a driving beat and a memorable hook; and \"Mirror,\" which features a poignant exploration of themes such as identity and self-acceptance.\n\n#Release and promotion\n\n##Live performances\n\nKendrick Lamar has performed live on several occasions since the album's release, including a series of concerts in Los Angeles and New York City. These performances have been marked by their high energy and theatricality, with Kendrick Lamar using the stage as a platform to explore the album's themes and ideas.\n\n##Singles\n\nThe album's lead single, \"N95,\" was released in April 2022, along with a striking music video that features Kendrick Lamar performing the song in a series of surreal and dreamlike scenarios. The single was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n##Tour\n\nKendrick Lamar embarked on a world tour in support of the album, which kicked off in June 2022. The tour features a range of special guests and collaborators, including Baby Keem, Tanna Leone, and others.\n\n#Critical reception\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many praising Kendrick Lamar's lyrics, production, and thematic scope. The album holds a score of 86 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 22 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nRolling Stone described the album as \"a masterpiece of storytelling and musical vision,\" while The New York Times praised Kendrick Lamar's \"dazzling\" lyrics and \" boundary-pushing\" production.\n\n##Year-end lists\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers appeared on several year-end lists, including Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2022, The New York Times' Best Albums of 2022, and Pitchfork's 50 Best Albums of 2022.\n\n#Industry awards\n\nThe album was nominated for several industry awards, including Album of the Year at the 2023 Grammy Awards.\n\n#Commercial performance\n\nMr. Morale & the Big Steppers was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and selling over 295,000 copies in its first week.

The events, which took place between 2020 and 2022, were initially reported in the media in late 2021 and led to widespread criticism, investigations, and calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n# Background\n\n## COVID-19 lockdowns in the United Kingdom\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a series of lockdowns and restrictions in the United Kingdom, aimed at reducing the spread of the virus. The first national lockdown began on 23 March 2020, with further restrictions implemented in subsequent months. The rules prohibited non-essential gatherings and restricted social interactions, with penalties for those who breached the regulations.\n\n## Westminster\n\n10 Downing Street, the official residence and office of the Prime Minister, is located in Westminster, London. The building is also home to other government offices and staff. During the lockdowns, the building was subject to the same rules and restrictions as the rest of the country.\n\n# Timeline of reporting and reaction\n\n## 2021\n\n### Up to 6 December\n\nInitial reports of gatherings at 10 Downing Street during the lockdowns emerged in late November 2021.

The report found that there had been a \"failure of leadership\" at 10 Downing Street and that some staff had breached COVID-19 regulations.\n\n### After the conclusion of the police investigation\n\nIn May 2022, the Metropolitan Police concluded their investigation into the gatherings, issuing 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 individuals, including the Prime Minister.\n\n### After the publication of Gray's report\n\nOn 25 May 2022, Sue Gray published her final report on the gatherings. The report found that the Prime Minister had been aware of and had attended gatherings that breached COVID-19 regulations. The report also criticized the culture at 10 Downing Street, stating that it was \"not appropriate\" and had failed to uphold the \"high standards\" expected of government.\n\n## 2023\n\n### COVID-19 Inquiry evidence\n\nIn June 2023, the COVID-19 Inquiry, led by Baroness Hallett, began hearing evidence on the government's response to the pandemic, including the gatherings at 10 Downing Street.\n\n### June–October 2023\n\nFurther evidence and testimony emerged during the COVID-19 Inquiry, including from the Prime Minister and other senior government officials.\n\n# Events\n\n## During first national lockdown\n\nIn May 2020, a gathering took place in the garden of 10 Downing Street, attended by the Prime Minister and other staff. The event was initially reported as a \"work meeting\", but later admitted to be a party.\n\n## Mid-2020\n\nIn June 2020, a gathering took place at 10 Downing Street to mark the departure of a staff member. The event was reported to have involved food and drink.\n\n## During second lockdown in England\n\nIn November 2020, a gathering took place at 10 Downing Street, which was reported to have involved food and drink.

These periods of unusually hot weather had a profound impact on various aspects of British life, including the environment, economy, and public health.\n\n# June heatwave\n\nThe first heatwave of the year struck the UK in mid-June, with temperatures soaring to record highs in some parts of the country. The heatwave was caused by a high-pressure system that brought hot air from the Mediterranean, leading to temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) in many areas.\n\n## Impact on resorts\n\nThe June heatwave had a significant impact on seaside resorts, which saw an influx of visitors seeking to escape the heat. Many resorts reported increased bookings and sales, with some businesses experiencing their busiest period in years. However, the heatwave also put a strain on local infrastructure, with some resorts experiencing water shortages and traffic congestion.\n\n# July heatwave\n\nThe July heatwave was even more severe than the June heatwave, with temperatures reaching record highs of over 40°C (104°F) in some parts of the country. The heatwave was caused by a combination of factors, including a high-pressure system and a heat dome that trapped hot air over the UK.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe July heatwave had a significant impact on various aspects of British life, including transport, retail, and agriculture.\n\n### Transport\n\nThe heatwave caused significant disruptions to the UK's transport network, with many roads and railways experiencing delays and cancellations. The heat caused rail tracks to buckle, leading to speed restrictions and cancellations on some routes. Many airlines also experienced delays and cancellations, with some flights being grounded due to the heat.\n\n### Retail\n\nThe heatwave had a mixed impact on retail, with some businesses experiencing increased sales while others saw a decline. Many supermarkets and convenience stores reported increased sales of cold drinks and ice cream, while some clothing retailers saw a decline in sales as people stayed indoors to escape the heat.\n\n### Berry farming\n\nThe heatwave had a devastating impact on berry farming, with many crops being destroyed by the heat. The heat caused berries to ripen too quickly, leading to a glut of berries on the market and a subsequent drop in prices. Many farmers reported significant losses, with some estimating that the heatwave had cost them tens of thousands of pounds.\n\n### Seaside resorts\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on seaside resorts, which saw an influx of visitors seeking to escape the heat. Many resorts reported increased bookings and sales, with some businesses experiencing their busiest period in years. However, the heatwave also put a strain on local infrastructure, with some resorts experiencing water shortages and traffic congestion.\n\n### Utilities\n\nThe heatwave put a significant strain on the UK's utilities, with many households experiencing power cuts and water shortages. The heat caused a surge in demand for electricity, leading to power cuts in some areas. Many households also experienced water shortages, with some areas experiencing hosepipe bans.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe July heatwave had a significant impact on the UK's environment and public health. The heatwave caused widespread drought, with many areas experiencing water shortages and hosepipe bans. The heatwave also had a significant impact on public health, with many people experiencing heat-related illnesses.\n\n# August heatwave\n\nThe August heatwave was less severe than the July heatwave, but still had a significant impact on the UK. The heatwave was caused by a high-pressure system that brought hot air from the Mediterranean, leading to temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) in many areas.\n\n## Rain\n\nThe August heatwave was accompanied by significant rainfall in some parts of the country, with some areas experiencing flash flooding. The rain caused significant disruptions to transport and daily life, with many roads and railways experiencing delays and cancellations.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe August heatwave had a significant impact on various aspects of British life, including retail and gardening.\n\n### Retail\n\nThe heatwave had a mixed impact on retail, with some businesses experiencing increased sales while others saw a decline. Many supermarkets and convenience stores reported increased sales of cold drinks and ice cream, while some clothing retailers saw a decline in sales as people stayed indoors to escape the heat.\n\n### Gardening\n\nThe heatwave had a significant impact on gardening, with many plants and flowers struggling to survive in the hot conditions. Many gardeners reported significant losses, with some estimating that the heatwave had cost them hundreds of pounds.\n\n# Drought\n\nThe 2022 heatwaves had a significant impact on the UK's environment, with many areas experiencing drought. The drought caused significant problems for farmers and gardeners, with many crops and plants struggling to survive in the hot conditions.\n\n# Wildfires\n\nThe heatwaves also caused a significant increase in wildfires, with many areas experiencing devastating blazes. The wildfires caused significant damage to property and the environment, with many people being forced to evacuate their homes.\n\n# Meteorology\n\nThe 2022 heatwaves were caused by a combination of meteorological factors, including high-pressure systems and heat domes. The heatwaves were also influenced by climate change, which is causing an increase in extreme weather events.\n\n# Media coverage\n\nThe 2022 heatwaves received significant media coverage, with many news outlets reporting on the impact of the heatwaves on daily life and the environment. The heatwaves were also a major topic of discussion on social media, with many people sharing their experiences and photos of the heatwaves.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe 2022 heatwaves had a significant impact on various aspects of British life, including the environment, economy, and public health. The heatwaves highlighted the need for better preparedness and infrastructure to deal with extreme weather events.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 European heatwaves\n* 2022 European drought\n* Climate change in the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_Kingdom_heatwaves\" following this outline:\n\n#June heatwave\n##Impact on resorts\n#July heatwave\n##Impact\n###Transport\n###Retail\n###Berry farming\n###Seaside resorts\n###Utilities\n##Aftermath\n#August heatwave\n##Rain\n##Impact\n###Retail\n###Gardening\n#Drought\n#Wildfires\n#Meteorology\n#Media coverage\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The outbreak has since spread to multiple countries and territories, resulting in a significant number of cases and deaths. This article provides an overview of the outbreak, its characteristics, transmission patterns, interventions, and responses from the international community.\n\n# Background\n\n## Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n\nPrior to the outbreak, the global health community had been aware of the potential for a monkeypox outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) had identified monkeypox as a priority disease for research and development, and several countries had developed emergency preparedness plans. However, the rapid spread of the virus caught many countries off guard, highlighting the need for improved preparedness and response measures.\n\n## Endemic mpox in Africa\n\nMonkeypox is endemic in several African countries, where it is typically spread through contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. The virus had been circulating in the region for decades, with occasional outbreaks reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries. However, the 2022 outbreak marked a significant increase in cases and spread beyond Africa.\n\n# Outbreak characteristics\n\n## Phylogenetics\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the virus suggests that the 2022 outbreak is caused by a distinct strain of the monkeypox virus, which is closely related to the strain responsible for the 2018 outbreak in the United Kingdom. Further analysis is needed to determine the exact origin and transmission patterns of the virus.\n\n## Long incubation periods\n\nThe incubation period of the virus, which is the time between exposure and symptom onset, has been reported to be longer than usual in some cases. This has made it challenging to track the spread of the virus and identify contacts.\n\n## Mild clinical manifestations\n\nMany cases of monkeypox have presented with mild symptoms, including fever, headache, and rash. However, some cases have been severe, resulting in hospitalization and death.\n\n## Fear of zoonotic spread\n\nThere is concern that the virus could spread to animals, particularly in regions where the virus is endemic. This could lead to a sustained outbreak and potentially even more severe consequences.\n\n# Chronology\n\n## Deaths outside of Africa\n\nThe first death outside of Africa was reported on May 26, 2022, in the United Kingdom. Since then, several other countries have reported deaths, including the United States, Spain, and Brazil.\n\n# Transmission\n\n## Transmission patterns\n\nThe virus is primarily spread through close contact with an infected person or contaminated materials. This includes skin-to-skin contact, as well as contact with respiratory droplets or other bodily fluids.\n\n## Wastewater surveillance\n\nWastewater surveillance has been used to track the spread of the virus in some countries. This involves testing wastewater samples for the presence of the virus, which can help identify areas where the virus is circulating.\n\n# Interventions\n\n## Testing and containment\n\nTesting and containment measures have been implemented in many countries to slow the spread of the virus. This includes contact tracing, isolation of infected individuals, and quarantine of close contacts.\n\n## Vaccination\n\nVaccination campaigns have been launched in several countries to protect against monkeypox. The smallpox vaccine, which is also effective against monkeypox, has been used in some countries. However, supplies are limited, and there is concern about the availability of the vaccine in some regions.\n\n# Social aspects\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been a significant amount of misinformation about monkeypox circulating on social media and other platforms. This has led to confusion and fear among the public, highlighting the need for accurate and timely information.\n\n# Responses\n\n## World Health Organization\n\nThe WHO has played a key role in responding to the outbreak, providing technical assistance and guidance to countries. The organization has also coordinated the global response, including the development of emergency preparedness plans and the distribution of vaccines.\n\n## Countries\n\nMany countries have implemented emergency measures to respond to the outbreak, including enhanced surveillance, testing, and contact tracing. Some countries have also implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures.\n\n## Dependent territories\n\nDependent territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam, have also been affected by the outbreak. These territories have received support from their parent countries, as well as from the WHO.\n\n# Cases per country and territory\n\n## Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n\nThe first confirmed case of monkeypox was reported in the United Kingdom on May 6, 2022. Since then, cases have been reported in multiple countries and territories, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and several European countries.\n\n## Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n\nSeveral countries and territories have reported suspected cases of monkeypox, which are currently under investigation. These cases are not included in the confirmed case count.\n\n## Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n\nThe first death outside of Africa was reported in the United Kingdom on May 26, 2022. Since then, several other countries have reported deaths, including the United States, Spain, and Brazil.\n\n# See also\n\n* Monkeypox\n* Smallpox\n* Zoonotic diseases\n* Global health security\n\n# External links\n\n* World Health Organization: Monkeypox\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Monkeypox\n* European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: Monkeypox", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022–2023_mpox_outbreak\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Emergency preparedness prior to outbreak\n##Endemic mpox in Africa\n#Outbreak characteristics\n##Phylogenetics\n##Long incubation periods\n##Mild clinical manifestations\n##Fear of zoonotic spread\n#Chronology\n##Deaths outside of Africa\n#Transmission\n##Transmission patterns\n##Wastewater surveillance\n#Interventions\n##Testing and containment\n##Vaccination\n#Social aspects\n##Misinformation\n#Responses\n##World Health Organization\n##Countries\n##Dependent territories\n#Cases per country and territory\n##Timeline of first confirmed cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of suspected cases by country or territory\n##Timeline of first deaths by country or territory (in countries with initial 2022 detection from 6 May onwards)\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The type and quality of equipment used can greatly impact the outcome of a climb, and climbers must carefully select and maintain their gear to minimize the risk of injury or accident. This article provides an overview of the various types of rock-climbing equipment, their uses, and certification standards.\n\n# Use and certification\n\nThe use of rock-climbing equipment is subject to various certifications and standards, which ensure that the gear meets certain safety and performance requirements.\n\n## Type of climbing\n\nDifferent types of climbing require different types of equipment. For example, sport climbing typically involves the use of pre-drilled holes and permanent anchors, while traditional climbing requires the placement of temporary protection. Ice climbing and alpine climbing require specialized equipment designed to withstand the rigors of cold and wet conditions.\n\n## Certification\n\nMany countries have their own certification standards for rock-climbing equipment. In the United States, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Climbing Equipment Manufacturers Association (CEMA) set standards for climbing equipment. In Europe, the Union of International Associations of Mountaineering (UIAA) sets standards for climbing equipment. Certification involves testing and evaluation of equipment to ensure that it meets minimum safety and performance requirements.\n\n# Ropes and slings\n\nRopes and slings are critical components of rock-climbing equipment, providing a means of connecting the climber to the rock face and absorbing the shock of a fall.\n\n## Ropes\n\nRopes are made from durable materials such as nylon or polyester and are designed to withstand the rigors of repeated use and exposure to the elements. Climbing ropes are typically classified into three categories: single ropes, half ropes, and twin ropes. Single ropes are the most common type and are used for general climbing. Half ropes are used for ice climbing and alpine climbing, where two ropes are used in tandem. Twin ropes are used for extreme climbing, where two ropes are clipped into the same protection.\n\n## Slings\n\nSlings are woven or braided loops of webbing that are used to connect the climber to the rock face or to other protection. They are typically made from durable materials such as nylon or polyester and are designed to withstand the rigors of repeated use and exposure to the elements.\n\n## Cords\n\nCords are small diameter ropes that are used for a variety of applications, including rappelling, ascending, and cordalette construction.

He is considered one of the most successful medieval English monarchs, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and establishment of parliamentary representation.\n\nEarly years, 1239–1263\n----------------------\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on June 17, 1239, at the Palace of Westminster, London, to King Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest of four children, and his birth was seen as a significant event, as his father had been trying to produce a male heir for several years. Edward's childhood was marked by a close relationship with his parents, who provided him with an excellent education and training in the arts of war.\n\nIn 1254, Edward married Eleanor of Castile, a member of the royal family of Castile, at the monastery of Las Huelgas, in Burgos, Spain. The marriage was arranged by Edward's father, who sought to strengthen ties with the powerful kingdom of Castile. The couple had at least fourteen children together, although only six survived to adulthood.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's early ambitions were focused on expanding his family's territories and influence in Europe. He was instrumental in his father's military campaigns in Wales and Scotland, and he developed a reputation as a skilled and fearless warrior. In 1259, Edward was appointed as the Lord of Gascony, a province in southwestern France, which had been inherited by his mother. This appointment marked the beginning of Edward's long-term involvement in the affairs of the Continent.\n\nCivil war and crusades, 1264–1273\n---------------------------------\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1264, Edward became embroiled in the Second Barons' War, a conflict between his father and a group of rebellious barons led by Simon de Montfort. The war was sparked by a dispute over the control of the English government and the power of the monarchy. Edward fought on behalf of his father and played a key role in the Battle of Lewes, where the royal forces were defeated. However, he managed to escape and continued to fight for his father's cause.\n\nIn 1265, Edward defeated the barons at the Battle of Evesham, where Simon de Montfort was killed. This victory marked a turning point in the war, and Edward's father was able to reassert his authority over the kingdom.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1270, Edward joined the Eighth Crusade, a military campaign led by King Louis IX of France, to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim control. Edward's involvement in the crusade was seen as a way to gain military experience and to demonstrate his commitment to the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1272, Edward's father, King Henry III, died, and Edward succeeded him as King of England. He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on August 19, 1274.\n\nEarly reign, 1274–1296\n----------------------\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's earliest priorities as king was to conquer Wales, a neighboring kingdom that had been a thorn in the side of English monarchs for centuries. In 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against Wales, which resulted in the capture of the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. Wales was subsequently annexed to the English crown, and Edward established a system of government and administration in the region.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward's reign was also marked by a series of diplomatic and military campaigns on the Continent. In 1279, he signed the Treaty of Amiens with France, which established a temporary peace between the two countries. However, the treaty was short-lived, and Edward soon found himself at war with France over the issue of Gascony.\n\nIn 1294, Edward launched a military campaign against France, which resulted in the capture of the city of Bordeaux. However, the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, and Edward was forced to negotiate a peace treaty with the French king, Philip IV.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nIn 1291, Edward was involved in a dispute with the Scottish nobles over the succession to the Scottish throne. The dispute, known as the Great Cause, was sparked by the death of the Scottish king, Alexander III, without a clear heir. Edward claimed the right to determine the succession and eventually awarded the throne to John Balliol, a Scottish nobleman.\n\nGovernment and law\n-----------------\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward's character as king was marked by a strong sense of justice and a desire to establish a robust system of government and law. He was known for his intelligence and his ability to think strategically, and he was willing to take risks to achieve his goals.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward's administration was marked by a number of significant reforms, including the establishment of a professional civil service and the creation of a new system of taxation. He also established a number of new laws, including the Statute of Mortmain, which restricted the ability of the Church to acquire land.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's reign was marked by a number of financial crises, including a significant increase in the national debt. To address these crises, Edward turned to Parliament, which he established as a regular part of the English government. Parliament provided Edward with a way to raise taxes and to gain support for his policies.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled the Jews from England, citing concerns about their influence on the economy and their perceived disloyalty to the crown. The expulsion was carried out with the support of Parliament, which had become increasingly anti-Semitic.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward's administration in Ireland was marked by a number of significant reforms, including the establishment of a new system of government and the creation of a number of new laws. He also established a number of new towns and cities, including the city of Dublin.\n\nLater reign, 1297–1307\n----------------------\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, Edward faced a constitutional crisis when a group of barons, led by Roger Bigod, challenged his authority and demanded greater limitations on his power. The crisis was eventually resolved through a compromise, known as the Confirmatio Cartarum, which established a number of new limitations on the power of the monarchy.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward launched a new military campaign against Scotland, which resulted in the capture of the Scottish king, John Balliol. Edward established a new system of government in Scotland and established a number of new castles and fortifications.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on July 7, 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, Cumberland, on his way to launch a new campaign against Scotland. He was buried at Westminster Abbey, where many of his predecessors were buried.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nEdward's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a great military leader and a skilled administrator, who established a robust system of government and law in England. However, he is also remembered for his brutal treatment of the Welsh and the Scots, and for his role in the expulsion of the Jews from England.\n\nFamily\n-------\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, whom he married in 1254. The couple had at least fourteen children together, although only six survived to adulthood.\n\n### Second marriage\n\nEdward's second marriage was to Margaret of France, whom he married in 1299. The couple had three children together.\n\n### Genealogical table\n\n| Name | Birth | Death | Marriage |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Edward I | 1239 | 1307 | Eleanor of Castile, Margaret of France |\n| Eleanor of Castile | 1241 | 1290 | Edward I |\n| Margaret of France | 1279 | 1318 | Edward I |\n| Edward II | 1284 | 1327 | Isabella of France |\n| Isabella of France | 1295 | 1358 | Edward II |\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* List of English monarchs\n* History of England\n* History of Wales\n* History of Scotland\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* Powicke, F.
