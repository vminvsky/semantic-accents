{"title": "Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory", "content": "#See also\n#Bibliography\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Indeterminacy Debate in Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory is a longstanding controversy among legal scholars, philosophers, and theorists about the nature and limits of legal interpretation. At its core, the debate centers on the question of whether the meaning of laws and legal texts is determinate or indeterminate. This article provides an overview of the indeterminacy debate, its key arguments, and the implications for legal theory and practice.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe indeterminacy debate in legal theory has its roots in the early 20th century, when legal scholars began to question the notion of objective interpretation of laws. The debate gained momentum in the 1980s with the publication of several influential works, including those by Ronald Dworkin, Stanley Fish, and Duncan Kennedy. Since then, the debate has continued to evolve, with new arguments and perspectives emerging from various fields, including philosophy, linguistics, and sociology.\n\n## The Challenge of Indeterminacy\n\nThe indeterminacy debate is premised on the idea that the meaning of laws and legal texts is not fixed or determinate. Instead, the meaning is subject to multiple interpretations, and the outcome of any given case is uncertain. This uncertainty arises from several sources, including the ambiguity of language, the complexity of social and cultural contexts, and the subjective perspectives of judges and lawyers.\n\n## Determinacy and Objectivity\n\nProponents of determinacy argue that the meaning of laws and legal texts can be determined through objective interpretation. According to this view, the meaning of a law is fixed at the time of its creation and can be discovered through careful analysis of the text, its legislative history, and the intentions of its drafters. Determinacy is often seen as essential to the rule of law, as it provides a basis for predictable and consistent application of laws.\n\n## Indeterminacy and Subjectivity\n\nIn contrast, proponents of indeterminacy argue that the meaning of laws and legal texts is inherently subjective and context-dependent. According to this view, the meaning of a law is not fixed and can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on the perspectives and values of the interpreter. Indeterminacy is often seen as a necessary consequence of the complexity and ambiguity of human language and social reality.\n\n## Critiques of Determinacy\n\nCritics of determinacy argue that the idea of objective interpretation is unrealistic and ignores the complexities of human language and social context. They point out that laws and legal texts are often ambiguous, vague, or open-ended, leaving room for multiple interpretations. Moreover, the intentions of lawmakers and the legislative history of a law can be unclear or contested, making it difficult to determine the \"true\" meaning of a law.\n\n## Critiques of Indeterminacy\n\nCritics of indeterminacy argue that the idea of subjective interpretation undermines the rule of law and leads to arbitrary and unpredictable application of laws. They point out that indeterminacy can result in conflicting interpretations and inconsistent application of laws, which can erode public trust in the legal system. Moreover, indeterminacy can be exploited by powerful interests to manipulate the interpretation of laws for their own benefit.\n\n## Implications for Legal Theory\n\nThe indeterminacy debate has significant implications for legal theory and practice. If the meaning of laws and legal texts is indeterminate, then the traditional notion of objective interpretation must be revised. This may require new approaches to legal interpretation, such as a more nuanced understanding of the role of context, culture, and power in shaping the meaning of laws. Alternatively, if the meaning of laws and legal texts is determinate, then the traditional notion of objective interpretation must be defended against the challenges of indeterminacy.\n\n## Implications for Legal Practice\n\nThe indeterminacy debate also has significant implications for legal practice. If the meaning of laws and legal texts is indeterminate, then lawyers and judges must be more aware of the complexities and nuances of legal interpretation. This may require new skills and strategies for navigating the ambiguities and uncertainties of the law. Alternatively, if the meaning of laws and legal texts is determinate, then lawyers and judges must be more careful in their application of the law, to ensure that the \"true\" meaning of the law is respected.\n\n# See also\n\n* Critical legal studies\n* Law and economics\n* Legal positivism\n* Natural law\n* Postmodernism and law\n* Rule of law\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: The bibliography is not included in the article, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indeterminacy_debate_in_legal_theory\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n#Bibliography\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From ancient civilizations to modern-day athletes, rock climbing has evolved significantly over time, shaped by advances in technology, changes in societal attitudes, and the contributions of pioneers who pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\n# Origins\n\nThe earliest recorded evidence of rock climbing dates back to ancient civilizations in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, where people would climb rocks and mountains for spiritual, practical, and recreational purposes. In ancient Greece, for example, rock climbing was considered a form of spiritual asceticism, while in India, the practice of rock climbing was closely tied to Hinduism and the pursuit of enlightenment. Similarly, in Africa, rock climbing was used by indigenous tribes for hunting and gathering, as well as for spiritual and ceremonial purposes.\n\n## Early Climbing Techniques\n\nThe earliest rock climbing techniques were relatively simple, involving the use of hands, feet, and basic tools such as ropes and wooden pegs. Climbers would often use natural features such as cracks, ledges, and chimneys to ascend the rock face, and would rely on their own strength, agility, and balance to overcome obstacles.\n\n# 19th Century\n\nThe modern era of rock climbing began to take shape in the 19th century, with the rise of mountaineering and the development of new climbing techniques and equipment. In Europe, the Alps became a popular destination for climbers, who were drawn to the region's rugged terrain and breathtaking scenery. The first ascents of many of the Alps' most iconic peaks, including the Matterhorn and the Eiger, took place during this period.\n\n## The Golden Age of Mountaineering\n\nThe late 19th century is often referred to as the \"Golden Age of Mountaineering,\" a period of rapid progress and innovation in the sport. Climbers such as Albert Smith and Edward Whymper pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing clubs and organizations helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n# 1900s\n\nThe early 20th century saw significant advances in rock climbing technology, including the development of new types of rope, harnesses, and other equipment. Climbers such as Walter Amstutz and Alfred Couttet pushed the boundaries of what was possible, making the first ascents of many of the Alps' most challenging peaks.\n\n## The Rise of Sport Climbing\n\nThe 1900s also saw the emergence of sport climbing, a style of climbing that emphasizes speed, efficiency, and technique. Sport climbers such as Pierre Allain and René Desmaison pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing gyms and training facilities helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n# 1910s\n\nThe 1910s were marked by significant progress in rock climbing, with the first ascents of many of the Alps' most iconic peaks. Climbers such as Arnold Lunn and Geoffrey Winthrop Young pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing clubs and organizations helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n## The Impact of World War I\n\nThe outbreak of World War I had a significant impact on rock climbing, as many of the sport's leading figures were called to serve in the military. The war also led to a decline in climbing activity, as many of the Alps' most popular destinations were closed to climbers.\n\n# 1920s\n\nThe 1920s saw a resurgence in rock climbing, as the sport continued to evolve and grow in popularity. Climbers such as Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing gyms and training facilities helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n## The Rise of Bouldering\n\nThe 1920s also saw the emergence of bouldering, a style of climbing that involves ascending short, low-level rock formations without the use of ropes or other equipment. Bouldering pioneers such as Pierre Allain and René Desmaison developed new techniques and routes, and the sport quickly gained popularity among climbers.\n\n# 1930s\n\nThe 1930s were marked by significant progress in rock climbing, with the first ascents of many of the Alps' most iconic peaks. Climbers such as Anderl Heckmair and Ludwig Vörg pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing clubs and organizations helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n## The Impact of World War II\n\nThe outbreak of World War II had a significant impact on rock climbing, as many of the sport's leading figures were called to serve in the military. The war also led to a decline in climbing activity, as many of the Alps' most popular destinations were closed to climbers.\n\n# 1940s\n\nThe 1940s saw a decline in rock climbing activity, as the sport was disrupted by the war. However, the decade also saw the emergence of new climbing styles and techniques, including the development of aid climbing and the use of pitons.\n\n## The Rise of Yosemite Climbing\n\nThe 1940s also saw the emergence of Yosemite climbing, a style of climbing that emphasizes big wall ascents and the use of aid equipment. Yosemite pioneers such as John Salathé and Yvon Chouinard developed new routes and techniques, and the sport quickly gained popularity among climbers.\n\n# 1950s\n\nThe 1950s saw significant progress in rock climbing, with the first ascents of many of the Alps' most iconic peaks. Climbers such as Walter Bonatti and Gaston Rebuffat pioneered new routes and techniques, and the development of the first climbing gyms and training facilities helped to promote the sport and establish a sense of community among climbers.\n\n## The Rise of Free Climbing\n\nThe 1950s also saw the emergence of free climbing, a style of climbing that emphasizes the use of only hands, feet, and other body parts to ascend the rock face. Free climbing pioneers such as John Gill and Royal Robbins developed new techniques and routes, and the sport quickly gained popularity among climbers.\n\n# 1960s\n\nThe 1960s were marked by significant progress in rock climbing, with the first ascents of many of the Alps' most iconic peaks.

The story begins with Vikram, who is tasked with eliminating Vedha, but things take a turn when Vedha voluntarily surrenders to the police and tells Vikram a story about his past, which makes Vikram question his own morality.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Vikram becomes entangled in a web of confusion, and his perception of right and wrong begins to blur. Vedha's stories, which initially seem like mere fantasies, start to reveal the darker side of Vikram's own life, forcing him to confront his inner demons.

The film's score was composed by Sam C.S., who also worked on the Tamil original. The film's soundtrack features several popular tracks, including \"Alcoholia\" and \"Bande\".\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was handled by Yash Raj Films, who released several teasers and trailers for the film. The film's trailer was released in August 2022, and it received a positive response from audiences.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nThe film was released theatrically on September 30, 2022, in India and several other countries. The film received a wide release, with several screens dedicated to it in multiplexes and single-screen theaters.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was later released on home media platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and DVD. The film's digital rights were acquired by Amazon Prime Video for a reported sum of ₹100 crore.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nThe film was a moderate box office success, grossing over ₹150 crore worldwide.

It is one of the oldest human technologies, dating back to around 9000 BC. Pottery has played a significant role in human history, serving not only as a means of creating functional items but also as a form of artistic expression.\n\nMain Types\n------------\n\n### Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery that is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1150°C. It is often made from clay that is rich in iron oxide, which gives it a reddish-brown color. Earthenware is commonly used to create functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups. It is also used to create decorative items like vases and figurines.\n\n### Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 1150°C and 1300°C. It is made from clay that is rich in silica, which gives it a hard, non-porous surface. Stoneware is often used to create functional items like cups, bowls, and plates, as well as decorative items like vases and sculptures.\n\n### Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is fired at a very high temperature, typically above 1300°C. It is made from a type of clay called kaolin, which is rich in silica and alumina. Porcelain is known for its whiteness, translucency, and strength. It is often used to create decorative items like vases, figurines, and jewelry, as well as functional items like cups and plates.\n\nArchaeology\n------------\n\n### Fabric Analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used by archaeologists to study the composition and structure of pottery. By analyzing the fabric of pottery, archaeologists can determine the type of clay used, the firing temperature, and the techniques used to shape and decorate the pottery. This information can provide valuable insights into the culture and technology of ancient societies.\n\nClay Bodies and Raw Materials\n------------------------------\n\nClay bodies are the mixture of clay, water, and other materials used to create pottery. The type of clay used can vary depending on the desired properties of the pottery. For example, clay rich in iron oxide is often used to create earthenware, while clay rich in silica is often used to create stoneware.\n\nRaw materials used in pottery include clay, water, silica, alumina, and metal oxides. The quality and availability of these materials can affect the quality and appearance of the pottery.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\n### Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form of the pottery. There are several techniques used to shape pottery, including hand-building, throwing on a wheel, and slip-casting. Hand-building involves shaping the clay by hand, while throwing on a wheel involves using a potter's wheel to shape the clay. Slip-casting involves creating a mold of the desired shape and pouring liquid clay into it.\n\n### Drying\n\nDrying is the process of removing excess moisture from the pottery. This is typically done by air-drying the pottery or by using a drying room. The drying process can take several days or weeks, depending on the thickness of the pottery and the ambient temperature and humidity.\n\n### Firing\n\nFiring is the process of heating the pottery to a high temperature to achieve the desired properties. There are several stages to the firing process, including bisque firing, glaze firing, and reduction firing.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe temperature of the firing process can vary depending on the type of pottery being created. Earthenware is typically fired at a lower temperature than stoneware or porcelain.\n\n#### Atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere of the firing process can also vary. Oxidation firing involves firing the pottery in the presence of oxygen, while reduction firing involves firing the pottery in the absence of oxygen.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of firing pottery, including electric firing, gas firing, and wood firing. Electric firing involves using an electric kiln to heat the pottery, while gas firing involves using a gas-fired kiln. Wood firing involves using a wood-fired kiln to heat the pottery.\n\n#### Stages\n\nThe firing process typically involves several stages, including bisque firing, glaze firing, and reduction firing. Bisque firing involves firing the pottery to a low temperature to remove excess moisture and create a hard surface. Glaze firing involves firing the pottery to a higher temperature to melt and set the glaze. Reduction firing involves firing the pottery in the absence of oxygen to create a specific type of glaze.\n\n### Decorating\n\nDecorating is the process of adding color, texture, or other designs to the pottery. There are several techniques used to decorate pottery, including painting, glazing, and slip-trailing. Painting involves applying paint to the pottery, while glazing involves applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Slip-trailing involves applying a liquid clay to the pottery to create intricate designs.\n\n#### Methods\n\nThere are several methods of decorating pottery, including hand-painting, stenciling, and printing. Hand-painting involves painting the pottery by hand, while stenciling involves using a stencil to apply paint to the pottery. Printing involves using a printer to apply designs to the pottery.\n\n### Glazing\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery. Glaze is a mixture of chemicals that is applied to the pottery to create a hard, non-porous surface. There are several types of glaze, including clear glaze, colored glaze, and textured glaze.\n\n### Health and Environmental Issues\n\nThe production of pottery can involve several health and environmental issues, including the use of toxic materials and the generation of waste. Potters must take precautions to avoid exposure to toxic materials and to minimize waste.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early Pottery\n\nThe earliest pottery dates back to around 9000 BC. Early pottery was made from unglazed clay and was often used for functional purposes such as storing food and water.\n\n### History by Region\n\nThe history of pottery varies by region. Here is a brief overview of the history of pottery in different regions:\n\n#### Beginnings of Pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery date back to around 9000 BC in the Middle East.

The event occurred in the early 1990s, during the peak of the Kashmir insurgency, and resulted in the displacement of nearly 100,000 Hindus from the region. The exodus was a result of a combination of factors, including violence, intimidation, and coercion by militant groups, as well as a sense of insecurity and fear among the Kashmiri Hindu community.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kashmir Valley has historically been home to a significant population of Kashmiri Hindus, also known as Kashmiri Pandits. The community has a rich cultural and social heritage, with a distinct language, customs, and traditions. However, the region has also been plagued by communal tensions and conflicts, particularly between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Kashmir Valley began to experience a surge in militant activity, as various groups, including the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) and the Hizbul Mujahideen, started to advocate for independence from India. The militants, who were largely Muslim, began to target Kashmiri Hindus, who were seen as a symbol of Indian rule and a potential obstacle to the achievement of independence.\n\n#Insurgency activity\n\nAs the insurgency gained momentum, the Kashmir Valley became increasingly unstable. Militants began to attack and intimidate Kashmiri Hindus, forcing many to flee their homes and seek refuge in other parts of the state or in neighboring countries.\n\n##Attack and threats\n\nThe militants used various tactics to intimidate and coerce Kashmiri Hindus, including attacks on homes and businesses, kidnappings, and assassinations. Many Kashmiri Hindus were forced to pay extortion money to the militants, while others were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in other parts of the state.\n\nIn 1990, the JKLF issued a warning to Kashmiri Hindus, ordering them to leave the Kashmir Valley within 48 hours. The warning was accompanied by a series of attacks on Kashmiri Hindu homes and businesses, which resulted in the deaths of several people.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the Kashmir Valley had a profound impact on the region and its people. The displacement of nearly 100,000 Hindus resulted in a significant loss of cultural and social heritage, as well as a decline in the region's economic and educational development.\n\nMany Kashmiri Hindus were forced to live in refugee camps, where they faced significant challenges, including poverty, unemployment, and poor living conditions. The displacement also had a significant impact on the mental health of the community, with many people experiencing trauma, anxiety, and depression.\n\n#Rehabilitation\n\nIn recent years, the Indian government has taken steps to rehabilitate the Kashmiri Hindu community. In 2015, the government announced a package of Rs 1,600 crore to rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindu families who had been displaced from the Kashmir Valley.\n\nThe package includes a range of initiatives, including the construction of new homes, the provision of employment opportunities, and the establishment of educational institutions. However, many Kashmiri Hindus have expressed skepticism about the government's efforts, citing a lack of implementation and a failure to address the root causes of the displacement.\n\n#In popular culture\n\nThe exodus of Kashmiri Hindus has been the subject of several books, films, and other cultural works.\n\n##Books\n\n* \"Our Moon Has Blood Clots\" by Rahul Pandita: This book is a personal account of the author's experiences during the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus.\n* \"The Kashmiri Pandits: A Study of Their Cultural and Social Heritage\" by Kashi Nath Pandita: This book provides an overview of the cultural and social heritage of the Kashmiri Pandit community.\n\n##Movies\n\n* \"Shikara\" (2020): This film, directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu couple who are forced to flee their home during the exodus.\n* \"The Kashmir Files\" (2022): This film, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, tells the story of a Kashmiri Hindu family who are forced to flee their home during the exodus.\n\n#See also\n\n* Kashmir conflict\n* Kashmiri Pandits\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n* Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus.

The Starship is designed to take both people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the solar system. It is a key component of SpaceX's ambitious plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars and to make humanity a multi-planetary species.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is composed of two main parts: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft itself.\n\n### Super Heavy booster\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is a massive rocket that will provide the necessary thrust to lift the Starship spacecraft off the ground and propel it into space. The booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which are also used in the Starship spacecraft.\n\n#### Tanks\n\nThe Super Heavy booster has a large tank that holds the liquid methane fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer needed to power the Raptor engines. The tank is made of stainless steel and is designed to be reusable.\n\n#### Propulsion\n\nThe Super Heavy booster is powered by a cluster of Raptor engines, which are full-flow staged combustion cycle engines that use liquid methane fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. The Raptor engines are capable of producing up to 170 metric tons of thrust each.\n\n#### Interstage\n\nThe interstage is the section of the Super Heavy booster that connects the booster to the Starship spacecraft. The interstage is designed to separate from the booster after the booster has completed its job and the Starship spacecraft has reached orbit.\n\n### Starship spacecraft\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is the part of the Starship system that carries crew and cargo to their destinations. The spacecraft is designed to be reusable and can carry up to 100 passengers and cargo.\n\n#### Heat shield\n\nThe Starship spacecraft has a heat shield that protects it from the intense heat generated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The heat shield is made of a ceramic material that can withstand temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees Celsius.\n\n#### Variants\n\nThere are several variants of the Starship spacecraft, including a crewed version, a cargo version, and a tanker version. The crewed version is designed to carry astronauts to the Moon and Mars, while the cargo version is designed to carry goods and supplies to destinations in space. The tanker version is designed to carry fuel to destinations in space, where it can be used to refuel other spacecraft.\n\n### Raptor engine\n\nThe Raptor engine is a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine that uses liquid methane fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer. The engine is capable of producing up to 170 metric tons of thrust and is used in both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft.\n\nVersions\n--------\n\nThere have been several versions of the Starship spacecraft, each with its own unique features and capabilities.\n\n### Block 1\n\nThe Block 1 version of the Starship spacecraft was the first version to be developed. It had a mass of around 4,400 metric tons and was capable of carrying up to 100 passengers and cargo.\n\n### Block 2\n\nThe Block 2 version of the Starship spacecraft was an improved version of the Block 1. It had a mass of around 4,600 metric tons and was capable of carrying up to 150 passengers and cargo.\n\n### Block 3\n\nThe Block 3 version of the Starship spacecraft is the current version being developed. It has a mass of around 4,800 metric tons and is capable of carrying up to 200 passengers and cargo.\n\nPlanned launch and landing profile\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is designed to launch from a pad at the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The spacecraft will lift off the pad and ascend to an altitude of around 200 kilometers, where it will separate from the Super Heavy booster. The spacecraft will then continue on to its destination, which could be the Moon, Mars, or other destinations in the solar system. Once the spacecraft reaches its destination, it will enter into orbit and begin its mission. When the mission is complete, the spacecraft will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and land back at the launch site.\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nThe development of the Starship spacecraft has been a long and complex process.\n\n### Early design concepts (2012–2019)\n\nThe first design concepts for the Starship spacecraft were developed in 2012. At that time, the spacecraft was known as the Mars Colonial Transporter.

However, their mission is cut short when they encounter a strange anomaly that causes Marcus to disappear. Ten years later, Brian is now a recluse who has lost his reputation and his family due to his erratic behavior. He is visited by a conspiracy theorist named K.C. Houseman (John Bradley), who claims that the Moon is not what it seems.\n\nK.C. reveals that he has discovered that the Moon is not a natural satellite, but a megastructure built by an advanced civilization to monitor and control the Earth. The Moon is also on a collision course with Earth, and K.C. believes that Brian is the only one who can help him stop it. Brian is skeptical, but he is soon convinced when he sees the Moon's orbit begin to decay.\n\nThe two men recruit astronaut Jo Fowler (Halle Berry) and her son, Sonny (Charlie Plummer), to help them on their mission. They also enlist the help of General Doug Davidson (Michael Peña) and his team of astronauts. As they journey to the Moon, they encounter numerous obstacles, including treacherous asteroid fields and malfunctioning equipment.\n\nOnce they arrive at the Moon, they discover that it is indeed a megastructure, and that it is being controlled by a computer system known as \"The Megastructure.\" The team soon realizes that the only way to stop the Moon from crashing into Earth is to destroy The Megastructure, but this will also destroy the Moon and potentially harm the Earth.\n\nAs the team fights to stop the Moon, they also uncover the truth about the Moon's origins and the reason why it was built. They also encounter numerous challenges, including treacherous terrain and malfunctioning equipment. In the end, they are able to destroy The Megastructure and save the Earth, but not without sacrifices.\n\nCast\n\n* Patrick Wilson as Brian Harper\n* Halle Berry as Jo Fowler\n* John Bradley as K.C.

On the day of the match, the stadium was filled with fans of both Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, with a reported attendance of around 42,000 spectators. The match was a highly anticipated event, with Arema FC seeking to secure a vital win in the Indonesian Liga 1.\n\n#Disaster\n\nOn October 1, 2022, at around 9:30 PM local time, a violent clash broke out between fans of Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya. The disturbance began when Arema FC fans invaded the pitch, resulting in a stampede that pushed fans against the stadium's doors and walls. The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, which further exacerbated the situation. The gas caused widespread panic, leading to a massive stampede that crushed many fans.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe disaster resulted in a significant loss of life, with 135 people confirmed dead and over 500 injured. Many of the victims were trampled or suffocated in the stampede.\n\n##Ages and genders\n\nThe victims of the disaster included both men and women, with the majority being young adults.

This election coincided with the elections for other state and federal offices.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives is the lower house of the Texas Legislature. It is composed of 150 members, each representing a district in the state. The members serve two-year terms and are elected in even-numbered years. The 2022 election was the first to be held under new district boundaries, which were redrawn following the 2020 United States Census.\n\n#Redistricting\n\n##Seats without incumbents\n\nDue to the redistricting process, some districts were created or reconfigured to have no incumbent representative seeking re-election. These districts were:\n\n* District 37: A new district created in the Rio Grande Valley.\n* District 38: A new district created in the Houston area.\n* District 70: A reconfigured district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\n##Double-bunked incumbents\n\nIn some cases, the redistricting process resulted in two incumbent representatives being drawn into the same district. These districts were:\n\n* District 19: Incumbents Terry Wilson and Ellen Troxclair were both drawn into this district.\n* District 24: Incumbents Greg Bonnen and Mayes Middleton were both drawn into this district.\n\n#Retirements\n\nSeveral incumbent representatives announced their retirement prior to the election. These included:\n\n* District 4: Lance Gooden announced his retirement to run for the U.S. House of Representatives.\n* District 17: John Cyrier announced his retirement to run for the Texas Senate.\n* District 60: Mike Lang announced his retirement to run for the Texas Senate.\n\n#Special elections\n\nThere were no special elections held in 2022 to fill vacant seats in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\n#Incumbents defeated\n\n##In primaries\n\n###Democrats\n\n* District 27: Incumbent Ron Reynolds lost the primary to challenger Steve Brown.\n* District 46: Incumbent Sheryl Cole lost the primary to challenger Jose Velasquez.\n\n###Republicans\n\n* District 12: Incumbent Kyle Kacal lost the primary to challenger Ben Bius.\n* District 64: Incumbent Lynn Stucky lost the primary to challenger David Spiller.\n\n#Predictions\n\n##Statewide\n\nMost predictions indicated that the Republican Party would maintain its majority in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\n##Competitive districts\n\nSeveral districts were identified as competitive, including:\n\n* District 21: A swing district in the Houston area.\n* District 28: A swing district in the Houston area.\n* District 65: A swing district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\n#Summary of results\n\n##Statewide\n\nThe Republican Party maintained its majority in the Texas House of Representatives, winning 86 seats to the Democratic Party's 64 seats.\n\n##Close races\n\nSeveral districts had close results, including:\n\n* District 21: The Republican candidate won by a margin of 1.2%.\n* District 28: The Republican candidate won by a margin of 2.1%.\n* District 65: The Democratic candidate won by a margin of 1.5%.\n\n##Results by district\n\n#Detailed results\n\n##District 1\n\n* Republican: Gary VanDeaver (incumbent) - 83.1%\n* Democratic: Sam Smith - 16.9%\n\n##District 2\n\n* Republican: Bryan Slaton (incumbent) - 81.4%\n* Democratic: Bill Brannon - 18.6%\n\n##District 3\n\n* Republican: Cecil Bell Jr. (incumbent) - 82.2%\n* Democratic: Martin Shultz - 17.8%\n\n##District 4\n\n* Republican: Keith Bell - 81.1%\n* Democratic: Jennifer Rodgers - 18.9%\n\n##District 5\n\n* Republican: Cole Hefner (incumbent) - 83.5%\n* Democratic: Bill Lawrence - 16.5%\n\n##District 6\n\n* Republican: Matt Schaefer (incumbent) - 82.9%\n* Democratic: Colin Montoya - 17.1%\n\n##District 7\n\n* Republican: Jay Dean (incumbent) - 83.2%\n* Democratic: Nikema Williams - 16.8%\n\n##District 8\n\n* Republican: Cody Harris (incumbent) - 81.5%\n* Democratic: Wesley Ratcliff - 18.5%\n\n##District 9\n\n* Republican: Chris Paddie (incumbent) - 82.3%\n* Democratic: John Wray - 17.7%\n\n##District 10\n\n* Republican: John Wray (incumbent) - 81.8%\n* Democratic: Kristin Albracht - 18.2%\n\n##District 11\n\n* Republican: Travis Clardy (incumbent) - 83.1%\n* Democratic: Alec Johnson - 16.9%\n\n##District 12\n\n* Republican: Ben Bius - 81.9%\n* Democratic: Jessica Rodriguez - 18.1%\n\n##District 13\n\n* Republican: Cecil Webster (incumbent) - 82.1%\n* Democratic: LaTronda Young - 17.9%\n\n##District 14\n\n* Republican: John Raney (incumbent) - 81.4%\n* Democratic: Janet Dudding - 18.6%\n\n##District 15\n\n* Republican: Steve Toth (incumbent) - 82.9%\n* Democratic: Lorena Perez McGill - 17.1%\n\n##District 16\n\n* Republican: Will Metcalf (incumbent) - 83.5%\n* Democratic: Jennifer Pool - 16.5%\n\n##District 17\n\n* Republican: Stan Gerdes - 81.2%\n* Democratic: Madeline Eden - 18.8%\n\n##District 18\n\n* Republican: Ernest Bailes (incumbent) - 82.5%\n* Democratic: Debra Davison - 17.5%\n\n##District 19\n\n* Republican: Ellen Troxclair (incumbent) - 81.1%\n* Democratic: Pamela Waggoner - 18.9%\n\n##District 20\n\n* Republican: Terry Wilson (incumbent) - 82.3%\n* Democratic: Jessica Tiedt - 17.7%\n\n##District 21\n\n* Republican: Harlon Unger - 50.6%\n* Democratic: Robert Guerra - 49.4%\n\n##District 22\n\n* Democratic: Christian Manuel (incumbent) - 81.1%\n* Republican: Elisa Cardnell - 18.9%\n\n##District 23\n\n* Democratic: Sergio Munoz Jr. (incumbent) - 80.9%\n* Republican: Aaron Peña - 19.1%\n\n##District 24\n\n* Republican: Greg Bonnen (incumbent) - 82.1%\n* Democratic: Brian Rogers - 17.9%\n\n##District 25\n\n* Republican: Cody Vasut (incumbent) - 81.8%\n* Democratic: Patrick Henry - 18.2%\n\n##District 26\n\n* Republican: Rick Miller (incumbent) - 82.5%\n* Democratic: L.

The team has a rich history, having been founded in 1966 and having experienced various periods of success and decline over the years.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966, and the team quickly established itself as a dominant force in Cypriot basketball. During the 1970s and 1980s, AEL won numerous domestic titles, including several championships and cups. The team's success during this period was largely due to the presence of talented players such as Andreas Paschalidis and Giorgos Stylianou.\n\n### Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nIn the late 1980s, AEL experienced a decline in fortunes, which resulted in the team being relegated to the second division. However, the team bounced back in the early 1990s, winning promotion back to the top division and eventually claiming several more domestic titles. During this period, AEL also began to participate in European competitions, competing in the FIBA European Cup and the FIBA Korać Cup.\n\n### Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)\n\n#### The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)\n\nIn 2002, AEL appointed Dragan Raca as head coach, marking the beginning of a new era of success for the team. Under Raca's guidance, AEL won several domestic titles and enjoyed success in European competitions, including a quarterfinal appearance in the FIBA EuroCup.\n\n#### Organising the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol & interest to join Greek A1 Basketball League (2006–2008)\n\nIn 2006, AEL hosted the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day, a prestigious event that brought together some of the top players in European basketball. The team also expressed interest in joining the Greek A1 Basketball League, one of the top leagues in Europe. Although the move ultimately did not materialize, it reflected the team's ambition and desire to compete at the highest level.\n\n#### Transformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)\n\nIn 2008, AEL began to participate in the FIBA EuroChallenge, a competition that pitted the team against some of the top clubs in Europe. Under the guidance of coach Raca, AEL quickly established itself as a contender, reaching the quarterfinals in 2009 and the semifinals in 2010.\n\n### Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nIn 2011, AEL experienced a decline in fortunes, which resulted in the team being relegated to the second division. The team eventually ceased operations, only to be reformed in 2017.\n\n### Recent history (2018–present)\n\n#### Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nIn 2018, AEL returned to the top division and quickly established itself as a contender, reaching two cup finals in 2019 and 2020.\n\n#### Gradual improvements & participation in the Balkan League (2023–)\n\nIn 2023, AEL began to participate in the Balkan League, a regional competition that pitted the team against some of the top clubs in the region. The team has continued to show gradual improvements, reflecting its commitment to developing young players and competing at the highest level.\n\nStadium\n-------\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. plays its home games at the Nicos Solomonides Indoor Stadium, a state-of-the-art facility that has a seating capacity of over 2,500 spectators.\n\nSupporters & rivalries\n----------------------\n\nAEL has a dedicated fan base, with supporters attending games in large numbers.

It was a rebellion of gold miners against the colonial government, which culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade. The rebellion was sparked by a series of grievances, including the imposition of a mining tax, the lack of representation in the government, and the mistreatment of miners by the authorities.\n\n# Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n\nThe Victorian gold rush, which began in 1851, brought a massive influx of migrants to the colony, including many from China, Europe, and North America. The goldfields were a hotbed of activity, with thousands of miners seeking to strike it rich. However, the colonial government, led by Governor Charles La Trobe, saw the gold rush as an opportunity to raise revenue and imposed a series of taxes and regulations on the miners.\n\n## Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe miners were unhappy with the government's policies, and protests began to erupt on the goldfields. In 1851, La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which the miners saw as excessive and unfair. The tax was set at 30 shillings per month, which was a significant burden on the miners, many of whom were struggling to make a living.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nThe introduction of the mining tax sparked widespread protests on the goldfields. Miners argued that the tax was unfair and that it would drive them out of business. They also complained about the lack of representation in the government and the mistreatment of miners by the authorities.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner, Robert William Rede, arrived in Ballarat. Rede was tasked with implementing the government's policies on the goldfields, but he soon found himself at odds with the miners. The miners saw Rede as a symbol of the government's oppressive policies, and he became a target of their protests.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a group of miners in Bendigo, led by George Thomson, presented a petition to the government calling for the abolition of the mining tax and the introduction of democratic reforms. The petition was signed by thousands of miners and became known as the Bendigo Petition. The petition was accompanied by a red ribbon movement, in which miners wore red ribbons on their hats to show their support for the petition.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn response to the growing unrest on the goldfields, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the grievances of the miners. The commission was established in 1854 and was tasked with investigating the mining tax, the administration of the goldfields, and the treatment of miners by the authorities.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor La Trobe was replaced by Sir Charles Hotham. Hotham was tasked with implementing the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry, but he soon found himself facing opposition from the miners.\n\n# Tensions escalate\n\nThe tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate in the months leading up to the Eureka Rebellion. In October 1854, a group of miners attacked and burned down the Eureka Hotel, which was owned by James Bentley, a former police officer. Bentley was accused of being a government informer and of mistreating miners.\n\n## Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nThe burning of the Eureka Hotel was sparked by the murder of James Scobie, a miner who had been involved in a dispute with Bentley. Scobie's death was seen as a symbol of the government's oppression of the miners, and it sparked widespread outrage.\n\n## Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn the aftermath of the burning of the Eureka Hotel, a group of miners formed the Ballarat Reform League. The league was led by Peter Lalor, a charismatic leader who would become a key figure in the Eureka Rebellion. The league held a series of meetings, at which they called for democratic reforms and the abolition of the mining tax.\n\n## Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nAs the tensions between the miners and the government continued to escalate, violence began to break out on the goldfields. In November 1854, a military convoy was looted by a group of miners, and several soldiers were injured. The incident marked a turning point in the conflict, as it showed that the miners were willing to use violence to achieve their goals.\n\n# Open rebellion\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion began on November 29, 1854, when a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, swore allegiance to the Southern Cross flag. The flag was a symbol of the miners' rebellion against the government, and it would become a powerful symbol of Australian nationalism.\n\n## Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nThe miners, who were largely armed and organized, began to mobilize for a confrontation with the government. On November 29, they gathered at Bakery Hill, where they swore allegiance to the Southern Cross flag. The flag was a symbol of the miners' rebellion against the government, and it would become a powerful symbol of Australian nationalism.\n\n### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe miners, led by Lalor, began to fortify the Eureka lead, which was a strategic location on the goldfields. They built a stockade, which was a makeshift fortification made of wood and earth. The stockade was designed to protect the miners from the government's troops, who were expected to arrive at any moment.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nHowever, the miners' plans were compromised when a group of Irish miners, who had been involved in the rebellion, were persuaded to leave the stockade by a Catholic priest. The priest, who was sympathetic to the government's cause, told the miners that they would be committing a mortal sin if they continued to rebel against the authorities. The loss of the Irish miners weakened the rebels' position and reduced their numbers.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nA detachment of the Independent Californian Rangers, who had been sympathetic to the miners' cause, left the stockade and returned to their camp. The departure of the Rangers left a small garrison behind, which was largely made up of inexperienced miners.\n\n## Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe Battle of the Eureka Stockade took place on December 3, 1854, when a group of government troops, led by Captain John Thomas, attacked the stockade. The battle was fierce, but the miners were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. After a brief but intense battle, the stockade was breached, and the miners were defeated.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the Eureka Rebellion was marked by a series of trials and inquiries. The government, which had been shaken by the rebellion, was determined to punish the miners and to prevent future uprisings.\n\n## Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nThirteen miners were put on trial for sedition and high treason. The trials were widely publicized, and they sparked widespread outrage. The miners were defended by a team of lawyers, who argued that they had been exercising their right to protest against an unjust government.\n\n## Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry, which had been established to investigate the rebellion, published its report in 1855. The report was critical of the government's handling of the rebellion and recommended a series of reforms, including the abolition of the mining tax and the introduction of democratic reforms.\n\n## Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nPeter Lalor, who had been a key figure in the Eureka Rebellion, entered parliament in 1856. Lalor became a vocal advocate for democratic reforms and played a key role in shaping the development of Australian democracy.\n\n# Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe Eureka Stockade was located on the Eureka lead, which was a strategic location on the goldfields. The stockade was situated near Bakery Hill, which was a prominent landmark in the area. Today, the site of the Eureka Stockade is commemorated by a museum and a memorial.\n\n# Political legacy\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a profound impact on Australian politics. The rebellion marked a turning point in the development of Australian democracy, as it highlighted the need for democratic reforms and the protection of citizens' rights. The rebellion also led to the establishment of the first democratic parliament in Victoria and paved the way for the development of Australian nationalism.\n\n# Commemoration\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been commemorated in a variety of ways over the years.\n\n## 19th century\n\nIn the 19th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated by a series of anniversaries and events. The rebellion was seen as a symbol of Australian nationalism, and it was celebrated by many as a heroic event.\n\n## 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated by a series of events and exhibitions.

She was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Russia. Sorokin gained international attention for posing as a wealthy heiress and swindling numerous individuals and businesses out of thousands of dollars. Her crimes were highly publicized, and she was eventually arrested, tried, and convicted of multiple counts of grand larceny.\n\n#Early life\n\nAnna Sorokin was born in Domodedovo, Russia, a suburb of Moscow. Her father, Vladimir Sorokin, was a truck driver, and her mother, Irina Sorokina, was a homemaker. In 2007, the family moved to Germany, where Sorokin's father worked as a transportation executive. She attended a private school in Eschweiler, Germany, where she learned fluent English and developed an interest in fashion and design.\n\nIn 2011, Sorokin moved to Paris to study at a fashion school, but she dropped out after one year. She then relocated to New York City, where she began to build a reputation as a socialite and fashion influencer. Sorokin created a fake backstory, claiming to be a wealthy heiress with a trust fund, and began to attend high-end events and parties.\n\n#Fraud\n\nBetween 2013 and 2017, Sorokin committed a series of scams and thefts, targeting wealthy individuals, hotels, and businesses. She would often pose as a wealthy heiress, using fake identities and backstories to gain the trust of her victims. Sorokin would then use this trust to borrow money, secure loans, or obtain free goods and services.\n\nSome of Sorokin's notable scams included:\n\n* Convincing a private jet company to fly her and her friends to Nebraska, promising to pay $35,000 for the trip, which she never did.\n* Posing as a wealthy client to secure a $100,000 loan from a bank, which she used to fund her lavish lifestyle.\n* Staying at luxury hotels, such as the Beekman and the Mercer, without paying, and charging thousands of dollars to other people's credit cards.\n* Convincing a fashion designer to create a custom wardrobe for her, worth over $60,000, which she never paid for.\n\nSorokin's scams were often brazen and reckless, and she was eventually caught after a series of complaints and investigations.\n\n#Indictment and arrest\n\nOn November 14, 2016, Sorokin was arrested at the Beekman Hotel, where she had been staying for several weeks without paying. She was charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny.\n\nIn 2017, Sorokin was indicted on 10 counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny. She was released on bail, but failed to appear in court, leading to a warrant being issued for her arrest.\n\nSorokin was rearrested in October 2017, and held without bail. Her trial began in April 2019, and lasted for several weeks.\n\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n\nDuring her trial, Sorokin's defense team argued that she was a \"daddy's girl\" who had been led astray by her wealthy upbringing. However, prosecutors presented evidence of Sorokin's elaborate scams and thefts, and several of her victims testified against her.\n\nOn May 9, 2019, Sorokin was convicted of eight counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was acquitted of two counts of attempted grand larceny.\n\nOn May 9, 2019, Sorokin was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison, plus restitution of over $198,000. She was also ordered to pay a $24,000 fine.\n\n#ICE custody\n\nAfter serving her sentence, Sorokin was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, pending deportation to Germany. She was held at the Orange County Correctional Facility in Goshen, New York.\n\nIn October 2021, Sorokin was released from ICE custody, and deported to Germany.\n\n#Media representation\n\nSorokin's case was highly publicized, and she was featured in several media outlets, including The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and CNN.\n\nIn 2022, a Netflix series based on Sorokin's life, \"Inventing Anna,\" was released, starring Anna Chlumsky as a journalist investigating Sorokin's scams.\n\n#After prison\n\nAfter her release from prison, Sorokin attempted to rebuild her life and reputation.\n\n##Art shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be showcasing her artwork at a gallery in New York City. The show, titled \"Free Anna,\" featured a series of paintings and sculptures created by Sorokin during her time in prison.\n\n##Non-fungible tokens\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be releasing a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), featuring her artwork and personal items. The NFTs were sold online, with prices ranging from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\n##Fashion\n\nSorokin has also attempted to revive her fashion career, partnering with several brands and designers to create clothing and accessories lines.\n\n#Personal life\n\nSorokin's personal life has been highly publicized, and she has been the subject of several tabloid scandals.\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she was in a relationship with a man she met while in prison.\n\n#See also\n\n* Con artist\n* Socialite\n* Fashion influencer\n* Grand larceny\n* Theft of services\n\n#External links\n\n* Anna Sorokin's Instagram account\n* Anna Sorokin's Twitter account\n* \"Inventing Anna\" Netflix series\n* \"Free Anna\" art show", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In this article, we will explore the classification, signs and symptoms, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes of hypoxia.\n\n# Classification\n\nHypoxia can be classified in several ways, including by cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n## By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia. Ischemia occurs when the blood flow to a specific organ or tissue is reduced, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery. Hypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the oxygen levels in the blood are low, often due to respiratory disorders. Anemia occurs when the body has a reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues. Histotoxic hypoxia occurs when the tissues are poisoned by certain substances, leading to a decrease in oxygen utilization.\n\n## By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as generalized or localized, depending on the extent of the affected area.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when the entire body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as high altitude, anemia, or respiratory disorders.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific organ or tissue is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as ischemia, injury, or infection.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including the brain, cornea, uterus, tumors, and vestibular system.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, or high altitude.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as contact lens use, corneal edema, or corneal injury.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when the fetus is deprived of adequate oxygen supply during pregnancy. This can be due to various factors such as placental insufficiency, umbilical cord compression, or maternal respiratory disorders.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when the tumor is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as rapid tumor growth, inadequate blood supply, or anti-angiogenic therapy.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nVestibular hypoxia occurs when the vestibular system is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can be due to various factors such as Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or vestibular schwannoma.\n\n# Signs and symptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the affected tissues and organs. Generalized hypoxia can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. Localized hypoxia can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area.\n\n## Complications\n\nHypoxia can lead to various complications, including organ damage, tissue necrosis, and even death. In severe cases, hypoxia can lead to cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and coma.\n\n# Causes\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n## Ischemia\n\nIschemia occurs when the blood flow to a specific organ or tissue is reduced, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery. This can be due to various factors such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or embolism.\n\n## Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the oxygen levels in the blood are low, often due to respiratory disorders. This can be due to various factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, or cystic fibrosis.\n\n### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when the body is exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can cause hypoxemic hypoxia due to the lower oxygen levels in the air.\n\n### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases can cause hypoxemic hypoxia, often used in medical procedures such as anesthesia.\n\n### Other\n\nOther causes of hypoxemic hypoxia include sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and neuromuscular disorders.\n\n## Anemia\n\nAnemia occurs when the body has a reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues. This can be due to various factors such as iron deficiency, vitamin deficiency, or chronic disease.\n\n## Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when the tissues are poisoned by certain substances, leading to a decrease in oxygen utilization. This can be due to various factors such as cyanide poisoning, hydrogen sulfide poisoning, or azide poisoning.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various mechanisms, including physiological responses, acute responses, chronic responses, and pathological responses.\n\n## Physiological responses\n\nThe body responds to hypoxia by increasing blood flow to the affected area, increasing oxygen delivery, and increasing anaerobic metabolism.\n\n## Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can cause a rapid increase in blood flow to the affected area, often accompanied by pain, numbness, and weakness.\n\n## Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can lead to long-term changes in the body, including increased angiogenesis, increased anaerobic metabolism, and changes in gene expression.\n\n## Pathological responses\n\nHypoxia can lead to pathological responses, including cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, and tumor angiogenesis.\n\n### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, often leading to stroke or traumatic brain injury.\n\n### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia occurs when the heart is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, often leading to myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis occurs when the tumor is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, often leading to increased blood vessel growth and tumor progression.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of hypoxia can be made using physical examination, history, and various tests.\n\n## Physical examination and history\n\nA physical examination and history can help identify signs and symptoms of hypoxia, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion.\n\n## Tests\n\nVarious tests can be used to diagnose hypoxia, including blood tests, imaging tests, and physiological tests.\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nA differential diagnosis can help rule out other conditions that may cause similar signs and symptoms, such as anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiac disease.\n\n# Prevention\n\nPrevention of hypoxia can be achieved through various means, including prevention of altitude-induced hypoxia.\n\n## Prevention of altitude-induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia can be achieved through gradual ascent, acclimatization, and use of oxygen therapy.\n\n# Treatment and management\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia can vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition.\n\n## Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia can include oxygen therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the cause and severity of the condition. In severe cases, hypoxia can lead to organ damage, tissue necrosis, and even death.\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nHypoxia is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The prevalence of hypoxia varies depending on the population and the underlying cause.\n\n## Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia occurs when the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply without any noticeable signs or symptoms. This can be due to various factors such as high altitude, anemia, or respiratory disorders.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of hypoxia has been known for centuries, with early descriptions of mountain sickness and high-altitude illness.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term \"hypoxia\" comes from the Greek words \"hypo\" meaning \"under\" and \"oxys\" meaning \"oxygen\".\n\n# See also\n\nOther related conditions include anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides an overview of hypoxia, including its classification, signs and symptoms, causes, mechanism, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a remake of the 1940 animated film of the same name, which was based on the 1881 Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi. The film stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto, a poor woodcarver who creates a puppet that comes to life, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio, the titular character.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins with Geppetto, a poor woodcarver who lives in a small workshop in a village. He creates a puppet out of a piece of wood and names it Pinocchio. One day, a magical fairy, known as the Blue Fairy, brings Pinocchio to life. However, Pinocchio is very mischievous and gets into trouble, causing chaos in the village.\n\nGeppetto tries to discipline Pinocchio, but the puppet is too stubborn. The Blue Fairy appears and warns Pinocchio that he must behave and become a real boy. Pinocchio promises to behave, but he soon gets tempted by the evil Stromboli, a puppeteer who wants to use Pinocchio for his own gain.\n\nPinocchio runs away from Geppetto and joins Stromboli's puppet show. However, he soon realizes that Stromboli is not what he seems and that he is being used. Pinocchio tries to escape, but Stromboli catches him and locks him in a cage.\n\nMeanwhile, Geppetto sets out to find Pinocchio and rescue him from Stromboli. Along the way, he meets a friendly cricket named Jiminy, who becomes his guide and conscience. Jiminy tries to warn Pinocchio about the dangers of lying and disobedience, but Pinocchio does not listen.\n\nAs Pinocchio continues to get into trouble, his nose grows longer and longer, symbolizing the consequences of his lies. Eventually, Pinocchio is swallowed by a whale and ends up in its stomach. Geppetto and Jiminy follow him and manage to rescue him.\n\nIn the end, Pinocchio learns his lesson and becomes a real boy. He is reunited with Geppetto, and they return home, where they live happily ever after.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as the voice of Pinocchio\n* Cynthia Erivo as the Blue Fairy\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the voice of Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as the voice of Honest John\n* Luke Evans as the Coachman\n* Kyanne Lamaya as the voice of Fabiana\n* Giuseppe Battiston as Stromboli\n* Lewin Lloyd as Lampwick\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of the film began in 2015, when Disney announced plans to produce a live-action remake of Pinocchio. Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct the film, and Chris Weitz was brought on board to write the screenplay. The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and ImageMovers.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe casting process began in 2018, with Tom Hanks being the first actor to be cast as Geppetto. Benjamin Evan Ainsworth was later cast as the voice of Pinocchio.

The third named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Bonnie originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on June 29, 2022. The storm's formation and subsequent intensification were influenced by favorable environmental conditions, including low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\nBonnie's origins can be traced back to a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on June 29, 2022. The wave moved westward across the tropical Atlantic, slowly organizing into a tropical disturbance. By July 1, the disturbance had developed a closed circulation and wasdesignated as Tropical Depression Three by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie on July 2, while located about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nOver the next few days, Bonnie continued to intensify, fueled by favorable environmental conditions. The storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 60 mph (95 km/h) by July 3, and Bonnie became a hurricane on July 4, while located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) east of the Windward Islands. Bonnie's intensification was aided by low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, which allowed the storm to develop a strong inner core.\n\nAs Bonnie approached the Caribbean, it began to interact with the islands, which caused the storm to slow down and undergo a period of rapid intensification. Bonnie's maximum sustained winds increased to 120 mph (195 km/h) by July 6, and the storm became a major hurricane, reaching Category 3 strength. The storm's minimum central pressure dropped to 965 mbar (28.50 inHg) on July 7, while Bonnie was located about 500 miles (800 km) south of Jamaica.\n\nAfter reaching its peak intensity, Bonnie began to weaken due to increased wind shear and dry air. The storm's maximum sustained winds decreased to 100 mph (155 km/h) by July 9, and Bonnie became a tropical storm again on July 10. The storm continued to weaken as it interacted with the Yucatan Peninsula, and Bonnie became a tropical depression on July 11.\n\n#Preparations and impacts\n\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n\nBonnie's approach to Trinidad and Tobago prompted the government to issue a hurricane watch for the islands. Residents were advised to stock up on food and water, and to prepare for potential power outages. The Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas.\n\nAs Bonnie passed to the south of the islands, Trinidad and Tobago experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm's outer rain bands caused flooding in some areas, and power outages were reported. However, the damage was relatively minor, and no fatalities were reported.\n\n##Mexico\n\nBonnie's approach to Mexico prompted the government to issue a hurricane watch for the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan. Residents were advised to evacuate low-lying areas and to prepare for potential power outages. The Mexican Meteorological Service warned of strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas.\n\nAs Bonnie passed over the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico experienced strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm's outer rain bands caused flooding in some areas, and power outages were reported. However, the damage was relatively minor, and no fatalities were reported.\n\n##Elsewhere\n\nBonnie's outer rain bands caused flooding in some areas of Central America, including Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. The storm's strong winds and rough seas also caused damage to buildings and infrastructure.\n\nIn the United States, Bonnie's approach to the Gulf Coast prompted the National Weather Service to issue a tropical storm watch for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. However, the storm's impact was relatively minor, and no fatalities were reported.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of Category 3 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of Atlantic hurricanes\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n\n#References\n\n#External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center's advisory archive on Hurricane Bonnie (2022)\n* National Hurricane Center's graphics archive on Hurricane Bonnie (2022)\n* Weather Underground's Tropical Weather Center: Hurricane Bonnie (2022)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Bonnie_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Aveling was known for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and his efforts to popularize science among the working class. He was also a close associate of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and his wife, Eleanor Marx, was a prominent socialist and feminist.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Early years\n\nEdward Aveling was born on November 29, 1849, in Stoke Newington, London, to a family of modest means. His father was a Congregationalist minister who later became a Unitarian. Aveling's early education was at a local school, where he developed a strong interest in science and literature.\n\n### University College London\n\nAveling went on to study at University College London, where he earned a degree in science. During his time at the university, he became increasingly interested in socialism and began to attend meetings of the London Dialectical Society, where he met prominent socialists like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\n\n### Cambridge\n\nAfter completing his degree, Aveling went to Cambridge University to study theology, with the intention of becoming a clergyman. However, his growing skepticism and interest in science led him to abandon his theological studies and focus on scientific pursuits.\n\n### College of Preceptors\n\nAveling became a member of the College of Preceptors, a teacher training institution, where he earned a diploma in teaching. This qualification enabled him to secure a teaching position at a school in London.\n\n### First marriage\n\nAveling married Isabel Campbell Frank in 1872, but the marriage was short-lived and ended in divorce in 1879.\n\n### Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital\n\nIn 1878, Aveling became a lecturer on comparative anatomy at London Hospital Medical College. This position allowed him to pursue his interest in science and share his knowledge with students.\n\n### New College, London\n\nAveling became a professor at New College, London, where he taught English literature and language.\n\n### Professorship of English\n\nIn 1880, Aveling was appointed to a professorship of English at the University of London. This position gave him the opportunity to teach and research in his area of expertise.\n\n### Aveling's secularist credo\n\nAveling was a vocal advocate of secularism and atheism. He believed that science and reason should be the guiding principles of human life, rather than religious dogma. He was a strong supporter of the National Secular Society and played an active role in promoting its goals.\n\n### National Secular Society and the Hall of Science\n\nAveling was a key figure in the National Secular Society, which aimed to promote secularism and science education. He was instrumental in establishing the Hall of Science, a secularist institution that provided educational programs and lectures on scientific topics.\n\n### Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker\n\nAveling served as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker, two prominent secularist publications. During his tenure, he wrote numerous articles and editorials promoting secularism and science.\n\n### Political career\n\nAveling's involvement in politics began in the 1880s, when he became a member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). He was a strong advocate of socialism and workers' rights, and he played an active role in the SDF's activities.\n\n### The American journey of agitation 1886\n\nIn 1886, Aveling traveled to the United States, where he gave a series of lectures on socialism and science. His visit helped to promote socialist ideas among American workers and intellectuals.\n\n### Second American journey of 1888\n\nAveling returned to the United States in 1888, where he continued to promote socialism and science. His lectures and writings helped to establish him as a prominent figure in American socialist circles.\n\n### Aveling as a Playwright\n\nAveling was also a talented playwright, and his plays were performed in London and other cities. His most notable play, \"The Woman Question,\" dealt with issues of women's rights and social equality.\n\n### The Avelings and Ibsen\n\nAveling and his wife, Eleanor Marx, were great admirers of the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. They translated several of his plays into English and helped to promote his work in Britain.\n\n### Aveling and Darwin\n\nAveling was a strong supporter of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. He saw Darwin's work as a major scientific breakthrough and believed that it had significant implications for human society.\n\n### Aveling and Haeckel\n\nAveling was also influenced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, who was a prominent advocate of Darwin's theory. Aveling saw Haeckel's work as an important contribution to the development of evolutionary theory.\n\n### Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx\n\nIn 1880, Aveling published a letter that Charles Darwin had written to Karl Marx, in which Darwin expressed his admiration for Marx's work. The publication of this letter helped to establish a connection between Darwin's scientific theory and Marx's social and economic ideas.\n\n### Later life, death and legacy\n\nAveling's later life was marked by personal struggles and financial difficulties. He died on August 2, 1898, at the age of 48. Despite his personal challenges, Aveling's legacy as a socialist, secularist, and scientist continues to be felt today.\n\n### Legacy\n\nAveling's contributions to socialism, secularism, and science have had a lasting impact on British intellectual and cultural life. His advocacy of Darwin's theory of evolution and his efforts to promote science education among the working class helped to establish him as a prominent figure in British socialist circles.\n\nPublications by Edward Aveling\n-----------------------------\n\n### Selected writings\n\n* \"The Student's Darwin\" (1881)\n* \"The Darwinian Theory\" (1884)\n* \"The Woman Question\" (1887)\n* \"The Labor Movement in America\" (1888)\n\n### Scientific writings\n\n* \"Comparative Anatomy\" (1879)\n* \"The Science of Evolution\" (1882)\n* \"The Darwinian Theory and Its Critics\" (1884)\n\n### Writings coauthored with Eleanor\n\n* \"The Woman Question\" (1887)\n* \"Shelley's Socialism\" (1888)\n\n### Translations\n\n* Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" (1880)\n* Ibsen's \"Ghosts\" (1881)\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_Aveling\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early years\n##University College London\n##Cambridge\n##College of Preceptors\n##First marriage\n##Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital\n##New College, London\n##Professorship of English\n##Aveling's secularist credo\n##National Secular Society and the Hall of Science\n##Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker\n##Political career\n##The American journey of agitation 1886\n##Second American journey of 1888\n##Aveling as a Playwright\n##The Avelings and Ibsen\n##Aveling and Darwin\n##Aveling and Haeckel\n##Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx\n##Later life, death and legacy\n##Legacy\n#Publications by Edward Aveling\n##Selected writings\n##Scientific writings\n##Writings coauthored with Eleanor\n##Translations\n#Notes\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean and rapidly intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the affected regions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Hilary formed on August 15, 2023, as a tropical depression about 400 miles (645 km) southwest of the Mexican port city of Manzanillo. The depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name Hilary, and began to move northwestward towards the Mexican coast. Over the next 48 hours, Hilary underwent rapid intensification, with its maximum sustained winds increasing from 40 mph (65 km/h) to 140 mph (225 km/h). The storm's central pressure dropped to 948 mbar, making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nAs Hilary approached the Mexican coast, it began to slow down and turn northward, bringing its center within 100 miles (160 km) of the coast. The storm's outer rain bands reached the coast, causing heavy rainfall and strong winds in several states, including Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit. After reaching its peak intensity on August 18, Hilary began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mexico\n\nIn anticipation of Hilary's landfall, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for several states along the Pacific coast, including Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit. Authorities evacuated thousands of people from low-lying areas and coastal communities, relocating them to higher ground and emergency shelters. The Mexican Navy and Coast Guard were deployed to assist with evacuations and provide aid to affected areas.\n\nThe Mexican Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations prepared emergency response teams and supplies, including food, water, and medical equipment. The country's civil protection agency, CENAPRED, activated its emergency response plan, coordinating with state and local authorities to respond to the storm.\n\n## United States\n\nAs Hilary approached the U.S.-Mexico border, the National Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for southern California and Arizona, warning of potential heavy rainfall and strong winds. The U.S. Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agencies prepared for potential disruptions to border operations and increased security measures.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its regional response center in Oakland, California, to coordinate with state and local authorities and provide support to affected areas. The American Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations prepared emergency response teams and supplies, including food, water, and medical equipment.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mexico\n\nHilary brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several states in western Mexico, causing widespread damage and disruption. The states of Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit were the hardest hit, with reports of flash flooding, landslides, and power outages.\n\nIn the city of Manzanillo, strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity. The city's port was closed due to high waves and strong winds, disrupting shipping operations. In the state of Jalisco, the city of Puerto Vallarta was affected by flash flooding, with several streets and buildings inundated with water.\n\n## United States\n\n### California\n\nHilary brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to southern California, causing flash flooding and power outages. The city of San Diego was the hardest hit, with reports of flash flooding in several neighborhoods. The San Diego River overflowed its banks, causing widespread flooding and damage to homes and businesses.\n\nIn the city of Los Angeles, strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity. The city's Department of Water and Power reported that over 100,000 customers were without power due to the storm.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn Arizona, Hilary brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the southern part of the state, causing flash flooding and power outages. The city of Tucson was affected by flash flooding, with several streets and buildings inundated with water.\n\nIn Nevada, Hilary brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to the southern part of the state, causing power outages and disruptions to transportation. The city of Las Vegas reported several power outages and disruptions to flight operations at McCarran International Airport.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of Hilary, authorities in Mexico and the United States worked to assess the damage and provide aid to affected areas. The Mexican government declared several states as disaster zones, making them eligible for federal aid and assistance.\n\nIn the United States, FEMA and other agencies worked to provide support to affected areas, including food, water, and medical equipment. The American Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations continued to provide aid to affected areas, including shelter, food, and emotional support.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of California hurricanes\n* List of Arizona hurricanes\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of Hurricane Hilary and its impact on Mexico and the United States.

The controversy began with comments made by two Indian politicians from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) about the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The remarks sparked widespread outrage and protests in India, leading to violence, arrests, and diplomatic fallout.\n\nBackground\n\nThe BJP has been in power in India since 2014, and during its tenure, there have been several instances of controversy and tension related to the country's Muslim minority. The party has been accused of promoting a Hindu nationalist agenda and marginalizing Muslims. The controversy surrounding the remarks about Muhammad was the latest in a series of incidents that have strained relations between Hindus and Muslims in India.\n\nComments about Muhammad\n\nOn June 2, 2022, Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for the BJP, made comments about Muhammad during a television debate. Sharma's remarks were widely condemned as derogatory and insulting. Another BJP leader, Naveen Kumar Jindal, also made similar comments about Muhammad on social media. The comments sparked outrage and anger among Muslims in India and beyond.\n\nPolice cases\n\nFollowing the controversy, police cases were filed against Sharma and Jindal in several states across India. The cases were registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including those related to promoting enmity between different groups and making statements conducing to public mischief. Sharma and Jindal were also suspended from the BJP pending an inquiry into their conduct.\n\nProtests and violence\n\nThe controversy sparked widespread protests and violence across India, particularly in states with significant Muslim populations.\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, protests turned violent in several cities, including Kanpur and Prayagraj. Police fired tear gas and used batons to disperse the crowds, resulting in several injuries. The state government imposed Section 144, prohibiting the assembly of more than four people, in several districts.\n\nRanchi\n\nIn Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, protests turned violent, with demonstrators clashing with police. Several people were injured, and police vehicles were set on fire.\n\nHowrah\n\nIn Howrah, West Bengal, protests blocked roads and railways, causing disruptions to traffic and train services.\n\nMaharashtra\n\nIn Maharashtra, protests were held in several cities, including Mumbai and Pune. The protests were largely peaceful, but police were deployed in strength to maintain order.\n\nUdaipur\n\nIn Udaipur, Rajasthan, a tailor was beheaded by two men who claimed to be avenging the insult to Muhammad. The incident sparked widespread outrage and condemnation.\n\nKabul\n\nIn Kabul, Afghanistan, protests were held outside the Indian embassy, with demonstrators condemning the remarks about Muhammad.\n\nInternational reactions\n\nThe controversy sparked diplomatic fallout, with several countries condemning the remarks and expressing concern about the safety of Muslims in India.\n\nQatar\n\nQatar was the first country to condemn the remarks, with the Qatari foreign ministry expressing \"strong condemnation and rejection\" of the comments.\n\nOther Arab states\n\nSeveral other Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, also condemned the remarks and expressed concern about the safety of Muslims in India.\n\nOther countries\n\nPakistan, Turkey, and Bangladesh also condemned the remarks and expressed solidarity with Muslims in India.\n\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) condemned the remarks and expressed concern about the growing trend of Islamophobia in India.\n\nIndian government response\n\nThe Indian government faced criticism for its response to the controversy, with many accusing it of being slow to condemn the remarks and failing to take adequate action against those responsible.\n\nBJP response\n\nThe BJP faced criticism for its handling of the controversy, with many accusing it of promoting a culture of hate and intolerance.\n\nSee also\n\n* Islam in India\n* Hindu nationalism\n* Bharatiya Janata Party\n* Organisation of Islamic Cooperation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Muhammad_remarks_controversy\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Comments about Muhammad\n#Police cases\n#Protests and violence\n##Uttar Pradesh\n##Ranchi\n##Howrah\n##Maharashtra\n##Udaipur\n##Kabul\n#International reactions\n##Qatar\n##Other Arab states\n##Other countries\n##Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\n#Indian government response\n#BJP response\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club, founded in 1889, is one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in India. With a rich history spanning over 130 years, Mohun Bagan has become an iconic symbol of Indian football, with a massive following across the country.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded on August 15, 1889, by a group of young Bengali football enthusiasts, led by Bhupendra Nath Bose.

The exercises were widely seen as a response to the visit of United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, which China considered a serious provocation.\n\n#Background\n\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn the years leading up to the 2022 military exercises, China had increased its military activities near Taiwan, including incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is an area of airspace surrounding Taiwan where the country's air defenses are on high alert, and any aircraft entering the zone is required to identify itself and state its intentions. China's incursions into the ADIZ were seen as a way of testing Taiwan's defenses and asserting China's claims to the island.\n\n##Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan had been escalating in the months leading up to the military exercises. In June 2022, China's defense ministry warned that the PLA would \"take all necessary measures\" to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in response to what it saw as \"provocations\" by Taiwan and the United States. The warning was seen as a clear threat of military action against Taiwan.\n\n#Military exercises\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan began on August 4, 2022, and involved a series of drills and maneuvers by the PLA in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters. The exercises included the firing of ballistic missiles, the deployment of fighter jets and warships, and the conduct of amphibious landings. The exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and a warning to Taiwan and the United States not to interfere with China's claims to the island.\n\nThe exercises were conducted in several phases, with the first phase involving the firing of ballistic missiles into the waters east of Taiwan. The missiles were reportedly fired from bases on the Chinese mainland and were seen as a demonstration of China's ability to strike targets in the Taiwan Strait. The second phase of the exercises involved the deployment of fighter jets and warships to the Taiwan Strait, where they conducted maneuvers and drills.\n\nThe third phase of the exercises involved the conduct of amphibious landings on the coast of Taiwan. The landings were seen as a demonstration of China's ability to launch a military invasion of the island. The exercises also included the deployment of drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to the Taiwan Strait, where they were used to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Japan\n\nJapan was one of the first countries to react to the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. On August 4, 2022, Japan's defense ministry issued a statement condemning China's actions and calling for an immediate end to the exercises. Japan's foreign ministry also summoned China's ambassador to Japan to protest the exercises.\n\n##North Korea\n\nNorth Korea was one of the few countries to support China's military exercises around Taiwan. On August 5, 2022, North Korea's foreign ministry issued a statement praising China's actions and calling for the United States to stop interfering in the affairs of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n##Russia\n\nRussia also supported China's military exercises around Taiwan. On August 5, 2022, Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement calling for calm and restraint in the Taiwan Strait, but also criticizing the United States for its \"provocative\" actions in the region.\n\n##United States\n\nThe United States was one of the most vocal critics of China's military exercises around Taiwan. On August 4, 2022, the US State Department issued a statement condemning China's actions and calling for an immediate end to the exercises. The US military also increased its presence in the Asia-Pacific region, deploying additional warships and fighter jets to the area.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan had a significant impact on the region and the world. The exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military capabilities and a warning to Taiwan and the United States not to interfere with China's claims to the island. The exercises also led to a increase in tensions in the Taiwan Strait and a deterioration in relations between China and the United States.\n\nThe exercises also had a significant impact on Taiwan, where they were seen as a clear threat of military action by China. The exercises led to a increase in military spending by Taiwan and a strengthening of its military defenses.\n\n#See also\n\n* Taiwan Strait\n* People's Liberation Army\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* China-Taiwan relations\n* Military of Taiwan", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Zillennials", "content": "#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Zillennials\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" refers to individuals born between the late 1990s and the early 2000s, bridging the gap between the Millennials and Generation Z. This micro-generation is characterized by their unique experiences, cultural influences, and technological advancements that set them apart from their predecessors and successors. Zillennials are often described as a transitional generation, having grown up during a time of significant social, economic, and technological change.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Z\" and \"Millennials,\" indicating the overlap between the two generations. The exact origin of the term is unclear, but it gained popularity in the mid-2010s as a way to describe individuals who did not fit neatly into either the Millennial or Generation Z categories.\n\n#Birth date and age range\n\nZillennials are generally considered to be individuals born between 1992 and 1998, although some definitions extend the range to include those born as early as 1990 or as late as 2000. This age range places Zillennials in their mid-to-late 20s and early 30s, making them a key demographic in the workforce and consumer market.\n\n#Characteristics\n\nZillennials share a unique set of characteristics that reflect their experiences growing up during a time of rapid technological, social, and economic change.\n\n##Arts and culture\n\nZillennials grew up during a time of significant cultural shift, with the rise of social media, reality TV, and the internet. As a result, they have a distinct appreciation for nostalgia and retro culture, often referencing and reinterpreting icons and trends from the 1990s and early 2000s. Zillennials are also known for their love of music festivals, concerts, and other live events, which provide a sense of community and connection in a increasingly digital world.\n\n##Economic activity\n\nZillennials entered the workforce during a time of significant economic uncertainty, with the Great Recession and its aftermath having a lasting impact on their financial stability and job prospects. As a result, many Zillennials are focused on finding stable, secure employment and building long-term financial stability. However, they are also known for their entrepreneurial spirit, with many starting their own businesses or side hustles to supplement their income.\n\n##Health\n\nZillennials are often described as a \"burnout\" generation, with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including the pressure to succeed in a competitive job market, the constant connectedness of social media, and the lack of work-life balance. Zillennials are also known for their focus on mental health and wellness, with many prioritizing self-care and seeking out resources to support their mental well-being.\n\n##Personal values\n\nZillennials are known for their values-driven approach to life, with many prioritizing social justice, equality, and environmental sustainability. They are also deeply committed to their personal relationships, with many valuing close friendships and family ties. Zillennials are also known for their love of learning and personal growth, with many pursuing ongoing education and professional development.\n\n##Political activity\n\nZillennials are often described as a socially conscious generation, with many actively engaged in politics and social activism. They are known for their support of progressive causes, including climate action, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ rights. Zillennials are also active online, using social media to mobilize and raise awareness about key issues.\n\n##Social life\n\nZillennials are known for their love of socializing and community-building, with many prioritizing face-to-face connections and shared experiences. They are also active online, using social media to connect with friends and like-minded individuals. However, Zillennials are also known for their preference for small, intimate gatherings and one-on-one connections, rather than large crowds or loud events.\n\n##Technology\n\nZillennials grew up during a time of rapid technological advancement, with the widespread adoption of smartphones, social media, and the internet. As a result, they are highly tech-savvy and comfortable using digital tools to navigate their daily lives. Zillennials are also known for their love of streaming services, online shopping, and other digital conveniences.\n\n#See also\n\n* Millennials\n* Generation Z\n* Generation X\n* Baby Boomers\n* Micro-generations\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
