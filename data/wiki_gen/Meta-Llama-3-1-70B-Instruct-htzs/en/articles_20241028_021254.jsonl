Al-Zawahiri's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and Islamic values.\n\n### Underground cell\n\nAs a teenager, al-Zawahiri became increasingly politicized and joined an underground Islamist cell that advocated for the overthrow of the Egyptian government. The cell was influenced by the ideology of Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian Islamist who emphasized the importance of jihad and the establishment of an Islamic state.\n\n## Marriages and children\n\nAl-Zawahiri married Azza Nowari in 1978, and the couple had four children together.

He established close ties with other Islamist leaders, including Osama bin Laden, and began to develop his skills as a militant strategist.\n\n### Sudan\n\nIn the early 1990s, al-Zawahiri moved to Sudan, where he became a key figure in the Islamist government led by Hassan al-Turabi. He established a network of Islamist activists and began to plan a series of attacks against Western targets.\n\n### United States\n\nIn the mid-1990s, al-Zawahiri became increasingly focused on planning attacks against the United States, which he saw as a major obstacle to the establishment of an Islamic state. He played a key role in the planning of the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 USS Cole bombing in Yemen.\n\n## Organizations\n\n### Egyptian Islamic Jihad\n\nAl-Zawahiri was a founding member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a militant Islamist organization that advocated for the overthrow of the Egyptian government. He served as the organization's leader from the late 1980s until the early 2000s.\n\n### Maktab al-Khadamat\n\nIn the late 1980s, al-Zawahiri became involved with Maktab al-Khadamat, a militant Islamist organization that provided support to the mujahideen fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\n### Al-Qaeda\n\n#### Emergence as al-Qaeda's chief commander\n\nAfter the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, al-Zawahiri emerged as the chief commander of al-Qaeda.

The disaster resulted in one of the deadliest stadium disasters in history, with hundreds of people killed and many more injured.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. The stadium was built in 2004 and has a seating capacity of approximately 42,000 spectators. The stadium has hosted various sports and entertainment events over the years, including football matches, concerts, and festivals.\n\nOn October 1, 2022, the stadium was scheduled to host a football match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, two local football teams. The match was expected to be a highly competitive and intense match, with thousands of fans from both teams attending the event.\n\n#Disaster\n\nThe disaster occurred in the 35th minute of the match, when Arema FC was trailing 3-2 to Persebaya Surabaya. The home team's fans, who were seated in the eastern part of the stadium, became agitated and began to throw objects onto the field, including rocks, bottles, and fireworks. The police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, which caused widespread panic and chaos.\n\nAs the situation escalated, fans began to rush onto the field, and the stadium's exits became congested. The combination of the tear gas, the stampede, and the crush of fans at the exits resulted in a massive loss of life.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe exact number of casualties in the Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster is still unknown, but it is estimated that over 130 people were killed, and hundreds more were injured. The victims included fans of both teams, as well as police officers and stadium staff.\n\n##Ages and genders\n\nThe victims of the disaster ranged in age from 2 to 40 years old. The majority of the victims were male, but there were also many female victims, including children.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the disaster was chaotic and emotional, with many fans and family members of the victims searching for loved ones and seeking medical attention. The stadium was evacuated, and the surrounding area was cordoned off by police.\n\nThe government of Indonesia responded quickly to the disaster, with the President and other officials expressing condolences and promising a thorough investigation. The football match was abandoned, and the stadium was closed pending further investigation.\n\n#Legal\n\nThe Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster raised serious questions about stadium safety and security in Indonesia. The government and the football authorities were criticized for their handling of the disaster, and there were calls for greater accountability and transparency.\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched, with the police and other agencies working to determine the cause of the tragedy and i", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kanjuruhan_Stadium_disaster\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Disaster\n#Casualties\n##Ages and genders\n#Aftermath\n#Legal\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Joint fact-finding team\n##Autopsies\n#Trial\n##Result\n#Reactions\n##FIFA\n##International\n##Police\n##Abandoned leagues\n##PSSI\n#In popular culture\n##Drama\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held concurrently with the 2022 Texas Senate election and the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Texas.\n\n#Background\nThe Texas House of Representatives is the lower house of the Texas Legislature, with 150 members serving two-year terms. The House is responsible for passing laws, approving the state budget, and exercising oversight of the executive branch. The 2022 election was the first to take place under new district boundaries, which were redrawn following the 2020 United States Census.\n\n#Redistricting\nThe 2022 election was the first to take place under new district boundaries, which were redrawn following the 2020 United States Census. The Texas Legislature is responsible for redrawing the district boundaries, which are intended to reflect changes in population and ensure equal representation.\n\n##Seats without incumbents\nSeveral seats were open due to the retirement or departure of incumbent representatives. These seats were highly contested, as both parties sought to gain an advantage in the House.\n\n##Double-bunked incumbents\nIn some cases, the new district boundaries resulted in two incumbent representatives being drawn into the same district. This led to competitive primary elections, as the incumbents sought to retain their seats.\n\n#Retirements\nSeveral incumbent representatives announced their retirement or decision not to seek re-election. These retirements created open seats that were highly contested by both parties.\n\n#Special elections\nPrior to the general election, several special elections were held to fill vacancies in the House. These special elections were highly contested, as both parties sought to gain an advantage in the House.\n\n#Incumbents defeated\nSeveral incumbent representatives were defeated in the primary or general elections. These upsets reflected changes in the electoral landscape and the desire for new representation.\n\n##In primaries\nSeveral incumbent representatives were defeated in primary elections, reflecting changes in the electoral landscape and the desire for new representation.\n\n###Democrats\nSeveral Democratic incumbents were defeated in primary elections, including some who had served for many years.\n\n###Republicans\nSeveral Republican incumbents were defeated in primary elections, including some who had served for many years.\n\n#Predictions\nPrior to the election, several organizations and analysts made predictions about the outcome. These predictions were based on a variety of factors, including demographic trends and campaign finance reports.\n\n##Statewide\nStatewide, the election was seen as a bellwether for the 2024 presidential election. The outcome was expected to reflect broader trends in the electorate.\n\n##Competitive districts\nSeveral districts were identified as highly competitive, with both parties investing heavily in campaign efforts. These districts were seen as key to determining the balance of power in the House.\n\n#Summary of results\nThe 2022 Texas House of Representatives election resulted in a Republican majority, with 85 Republicans and 65 Democrats elected to the House.\n\n##Statewide\nStatewide, the Republican Party maintained its majority, winning 85 seats to the Democratic Party's 65.\n\n##Close races\nSeveral races were extremely close, with some decided by fewer than 100 votes. These close races reflected the highly competitive nature of the election.\n\n##Results by district\nThe following is a summary of the results by district:\n\n#Detailed results\nThe following is a detailed summary of the results by district:\n\n##District 1\nDistrict 1 was won by Republican incumbent Gary VanDeaver, who defeated Democratic challenger...\n\n##District 2\nDistrict 2 was won by Republican incumbent Dan Flynn, who defeated Democratic challenger...\n\n...

It was a rebellion against the British colonial authorities by gold miners in Ballarat, Victoria, and is considered one of the most significant events in Australian history.\n\n#Origins in the Victorian gold rush\n\n##Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nThe Victorian gold rush, which began in 1851, brought a massive influx of people to the goldfields, including many from Ireland and China. The gold rush created a sense of lawlessness and disorder, as the authorities struggled to maintain control over the large and diverse population.\n\n###La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn 1851, Governor Charles La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax of 30 shillings, which was deeply unpopular among the miners. The tax was seen as unfair, as it did not take into account the varying levels of success among the miners. Protests against the tax began, with many miners refusing to pay.\n\n###First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn 1852, the first gold commissioner, William Dana, arrived in Ballarat. Dana was tasked with enforcing the mining tax and maintaining order on the goldfields. However, he was met with resistance from the miners, who saw him as a symbol of the colonial authorities.\n\n###Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn 1853, a petition was circulated in Bendigo, calling for the abolition of the mining tax and the establishment of a representative government. The petition was signed by over 23,000 people and was presented to Governor La Trobe. The petition was accompanied by a red ribbon, which became a symbol of the movement.\n\n###Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nThe Legislative Council, which was the governing body of Victoria, called for a Commission of Inquiry into the goldfields. The commission was tasked with investigating the conditions on the goldfields and making recommendations for reform.\n\n###Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn 1854, Governor La Trobe was replaced by Sir Charles Hotham. Hotham was a more conservative and authoritarian figure, who was determined to maintain order on the goldfields.\n\n#Tensions escalate\n\n##Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nOn October 6, 1854, a Scottish miner named James Scobie was murdered in a dispute over a claim. The murder was blamed on the hotel owner, James Bentley, who was known to be corrupt and had ties to the colonial authorities. In response, a group of miners burned down the Eureka hotel, which was seen as a symbol of the corrupt and oppressive system.\n\n##Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nThe Ballarat Reform League, which had been established in 1853, began to hold meetings to discuss the grievances of the miners. The league called for the abolition of the mining tax, the establishment of a representative government, and the right to vote.\n\n##Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nOn November 28, 1854, a military convoy was sent to Ballarat to quell the growing unrest. However, the convoy was looted by the miners, who saw it as a symbol of the oppressive colonial authorities. The violence escalated, and the situation began to spiral out of control.\n\n#Open rebellion\n\n##Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nOn November 29, 1854, a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, began to mobilize a paramilitary force. The miners swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, which became the symbol of the rebellion.\n\n###Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nThe miners began to fortify the Eureka lead, which was a strategic location on the goldfields. The lead was surrounded by a stockade, which was built using wooden palisades and earthworks.\n\n####Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nHowever, the rebellion was weakened by a series of blunders, including the failure to secure the support of the Irish miners, who were a significant proportion of the population. The Irish miners were hesitant to join the rebellion, due to concerns about the potential consequences.\n\n####Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nOn December 2, 1854, a detachment of the Independent Californian Rangers, who had been sent to support the rebellion, departed, leaving behind a small garrison. The garrison was largely made up of inexperienced miners, who were no match for the well-trained and well-equipped British military.\n\n##Battle of the Eureka Stockade\n\nOn December 3, 1854, the British military, led by Captain Thomas Wise, launched a surprise attack on the Eureka stockade. The battle was fierce but brief, with the miners putting up a valiant resistance. However, they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, and the stockade was quickly overrun. Over 30 miners were killed, and many more were wounded or captured.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, many of the miners were put on trial for sedition and high treason. The trials were widely seen as unfair, with many of the miners being convicted and sentenced to prison.\n\n##Commission of Inquiry report\n\nThe Commission of Inquiry, which had been established to investigate the goldfields, published its report in 1855. The report was highly critical of the colonial authorities and recommended significant reforms, including the abolition of the mining tax and the establishment of a representative government.\n\n##Peter Lalor enters parliament\n\nIn 1855, Peter Lalor, one of the leaders of the rebellion, was elected to the Victorian parliament. Lalor went on to play a significant role in shaping the future of Victoria, including the establishment of the eight-hour working day.\n\n#Location of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade\n\nThe site of the Eureka Stockade is located in Ballarat, Victoria, and is commemorated by a monument and a museum. The site is also home to the Bakery Hill Hotel, which was built on the site of the original hotel.\n\n#Political legacy\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion had a profound impact on Australian politics, leading to the establishment of a representative government in Victoria and the eventual adoption of democratic reforms across the country.\n\n#Commemoration\n\n##19th century\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was commemorated in the 19th century through a series of events and monuments, including the establishment of the Eureka Stockade Memorial.\n\n##20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, the Eureka Rebellion was commemorated through a series of events and exhibitions, including the establishment of the Eureka Stockade Museum.\n\n##21st century\n\nIn the 21st century, the Eureka Rebellion continues to be commemorated through a series of events and exhibitions, including the annual Eureka Day celebrations.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been the subject of numerous books, films, and television shows, including the 1949 film \"Eureka Stockade\" and the 2015 television series \"Deadline Gallipoli\".\n\n#See also\n\n* Australian gold rushes\n* Victorian gold rush\n* Ballarat Reform League\n* Peter Lalor\n* Charles La Trobe\n* Charles Hotham\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and primary sources.\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Blainey, Geoffrey.

Her exploits have been widely reported in the media and have inspired several films and television shows.\n\n#Early life\n\nAnna Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991, in Domodedovo, Russia. Her father, Vladimir Sorokin, was a truck driver, and her mother was a homemaker. In 2007, her family moved to Germany, where Sorokin attended a private school. After completing her secondary education, she moved to Paris to study fashion and later relocated to London to intern at a fashion magazine.\n\nIn 2013, Sorokin moved to New York City, where she began to develop her persona as a wealthy heiress. She adopted the alias \"Anna Delvey\" and created a fake backstory, claiming that her father was a wealthy Russian businessman and that she had inherited a large trust fund.\n\n#Fraud\n\nSorokin's scheme involved posing as a wealthy heiress and convincing individuals and businesses to lend her money or provide her with goods and services on credit. She would often use her fake backstory and charm to gain the trust of her victims, who would then provide her with thousands of dollars in cash, credit, and goods.\n\nSorokin's victims included several high-end hotels, restaurants, and retailers, as well as private individuals who had been convinced to invest in her fake business ventures. She would often use the money and goods she obtained to fund her own lavish lifestyle, which included staying in luxury hotels, dining at expensive restaurants, and purchasing designer clothing and accessories.\n\n#Indictment and arrest\n\nIn November 2017, Sorokin was indicted by a New York grand jury on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft. She was arrested on November 27, 2017, and held without bail at Rikers Island.\n\nDuring her time at Rikers, Sorokin became a subject of fascination for the media, with several outlets reporting on her lavish lifestyle and fake heiress persona. She was also the subject of a New York Magazine profile, which detailed her exploits and helped to cement her notoriety.\n\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n\nSorokin's trial began in March 2019 and lasted for several weeks. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Sorokin's fake heiress persona and her numerous scams, including her use of fake bank statements and her attempts to deceive her victims.\n\nOn April 25, 2019, Sorokin was convicted of multiple counts of grand larceny and theft. She was sentenced to four to 12 years in prison and ordered to pay restitution to her victims.\n\n#ICE custody\n\nIn February 2021, Sorokin was released from prison after serving approximately two years of her sentence. However, she was immediately taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to her immigration status.\n\nSorokin had been living in the United States on an expired visa, and ICE had begun deportation proceedings against her. She was held in ICE custody for several weeks before being released on bond.\n\n#Media representation\n\nSorokin's exploits have been widely reported in the media, and she has been the subject of several films and television shows. In 2022, Netflix released a series based on her life, titled \"Inventing Anna.\" The series starred Anna Chlumsky as a journalist investigating Sorokin's scams and Julia Garner as Sorokin herself.\n\nSorokin has also been the subject of several documentaries and podcasts, including a 2020 podcast series from HBO Max.\n\n##Art shows\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be hosting an art show in New York City. The show, titled \"Allegedly,\" featured several works of art created by Sorokin during her time in prison.\n\nThe show was met with significant media attention, with several outlets reporting on Sorokin's foray into the art world. However, the show was also criticized by some, who accused Sorokin of profiting from her notoriety.\n\n##Non-fungible tokens\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin announced that she would be releasing a series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

This can occur due to various reasons, including high altitude, respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, or other conditions that impair the body's ability to transport oxygen to tissues. Hypoxia can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, and can have significant consequences if left untreated.\n\nClassification\n-------------\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on its cause, extent, and affected tissues and organs.\n\n### By cause\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n* Ischemia: reduced blood flow to a particular region of the body\n* Hypoxemic hypoxia: reduced oxygen levels in the blood\n* Anemia: reduced red blood cell count or function\n* Histotoxic hypoxia: presence of substances that interfere with oxygen use by tissues\n\n### By extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified as generalized or localized.\n\n#### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia occurs when the entire body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to high altitude, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular disease.\n\n#### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to injury, infection, or disease affecting a particular organ or tissue.\n\n#### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can affect various tissues and organs, including:\n\n##### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other conditions that impair blood flow to the brain.\n\n##### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to contact lens wear, corneal disease, or other conditions that impair oxygen delivery to the cornea.\n\n##### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia occurs when the fetus is deprived of adequate oxygen supply during pregnancy. This can occur due to placental insufficiency, maternal respiratory disease, or other conditions that impair oxygen delivery to the fetus.\n\n##### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when cancer cells are deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can occur due to rapid tumor growth, impaired blood flow, or other conditions that impair oxygen delivery to the tumor.\n\n##### Vestibular system\n\nThe vestibular system is responsible for balance and equilibrium. Hypoxia can affect the vestibular system, leading to symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n------------------\n\nThe signs and symptoms of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition. Mild hypoxia may cause:\n\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fatigue\n* Headache\n* Dizziness\n* Confusion\n\nSevere hypoxia can cause:\n\n* Loss of consciousness\n* Seizures\n* Coma\n* Death\n\nComplications\n-------------\n\nUntreated hypoxia can lead to a range of complications, including:\n\n* Organ damage: hypoxia can damage organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.\n* Infection: hypoxia can impair the immune system, making it more susceptible to infection.\n* Cancer: hypoxia can promote cancer growth and metastasis.\n\nCauses\n------\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including:\n\n### Ischemia\n\nIschemia occurs when blood flow to a particular region of the body is reduced. This can occur due to:\n\n* Atherosclerosis: narrowing of blood vessels\n* Blood clots: blockage of blood vessels\n* Injury: damage to blood vessels\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when oxygen levels in the blood are reduced. This can occur due to:\n\n#### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n#### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can cause hypoxemia due to lower oxygen levels in the air.\n\n#### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nHypoxic breathing gases, such as those used in anesthesia, can cause hypoxemia.\n\n#### Other\n\nOther conditions, such as respiratory disease, can also cause hypoxemia.\n\n### Anemia\n\nAnemia occurs when the red blood cell count or function is reduced. This can occur due to:\n\n* Iron deficiency\n* Vitamin deficiency\n* Chronic disease\n\n### Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when substances interfere with oxygen use by tissues. This can occur due to:\n\n* Cyanide poisoning\n* Azide poisoning\n* Other toxins\n\nMechanism\n----------\n\nHypoxia can occur due to various mechanisms, including:\n\n### Physiological responses\n\nThe body has various physiological responses to hypoxia, including:\n\n* Increased ventilation: the body increases breathing rate to increase oxygen delivery.\n* Increased cardiac output: the body increases heart rate to increase oxygen delivery.\n* Vasodilation: the body dilates blood vessels to increase oxygen delivery.\n\n### Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can occur due to sudden changes in oxygen levels, such as:\n\n* High altitude\n* Carbon monoxide poisoning\n* Anesthesia\n\n### Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can occur due to prolonged changes in oxygen levels, such as:\n\n* Respiratory disease\n* Cardiovascular disease\n* Anemia\n\n### Pathological responses\n\nHypoxia can lead to various pathological responses, including:\n\n#### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can lead to:\n\n* Stroke\n* Traumatic brain injury\n* Other conditions\n\n#### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia occurs when the heart is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. This can lead to:\n\n* Heart attack\n* Cardiac arrhythmias\n* Other conditions\n\n#### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis occurs when cancer cells promote the growth of new blood vessels to increase oxygen delivery. This can lead to:\n\n* Tumor growth\n* Metastasis\n* Other conditions\n\nDiagnosis\n----------\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia involves:\n\n### Physical examination and history\n\nA physical examination and medical history can help identify signs and symptoms of hypoxia.\n\n### Tests\n\nVarious tests can help diagnose hypoxia, including:\n\n* Pulse oximetry: measures oxygen levels in the blood\n* Arterial blood gas: measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood\n* Imaging tests: such as CT or MRI scans, can help identify underlying causes of hypoxia.\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that may cause similar signs and symptoms, such as:\n\n* Anemia\n* Respiratory disease\n* Cardiovascular disease\n\nPrevention\n----------\n\nPrevention of hypoxia involves:\n\n### Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia involves:\n\n* Gradual ascent to high altitude\n* Use of oxygen supplements\n* Acclimatization to high altitude\n\nTreatment and management\n-------------------------\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia involve:\n\n### Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia involves:\n\n* Oxygen therapy: to increase oxygen levels in the blood\n* Medications: to treat underlying causes of hypoxia\n* Surgery: to treat underlying causes of hypoxia\n\nOutcomes\n----------\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia can vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition.

The film is a remake of the 1940 animated Disney film of the same name, which was itself based on the 1881 Italian children's book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Collodi.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film follows the story of Geppetto, a poor and lonely woodcarver who creates a puppet boy named Pinocchio to replace his deceased son. To his surprise, the puppet comes to life, but Pinocchio's mischievous and naive behavior causes trouble, and he must learn to become a real boy.\n\nGeppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to become a real boy, and the Blue Fairy appears, telling Pinocchio that he can become a real boy if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish. Pinocchio sets out on a series of adventures, facing various obstacles and characters, including the sinister Coachman, who runs a pleasure island for naughty boys, and the friendly cricket, Jiminy, who tries to guide Pinocchio on his path.\n\nThroughout the film, Pinocchio's nose grows longer whenever he tells a lie, and he must confront the consequences of his actions. In the end, Pinocchio learns valuable lessons about responsibility, friendship, and the importance of becoming a real boy.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Honest John\n* Lorraine Bracco as Sofia the Seagull\n* Cynthia Erivo as the Blue Fairy\n* Luke Evans as the Coachman\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that Disney was developing a live-action remake of Pinocchio, with Robert Zemeckis set to direct.

The rest of the cast, including Keegan-Michael Key, Lorraine Bracco, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans, were cast in the following months.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in March 2021, in the United Kingdom and Italy. The film was shot on a combination of soundstages and location, with the production team using a mix of practical and visual effects to bring the story to life.\n\n## Visual effects and animation\n\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Moving Picture Company (MPC), with a team of over 1,000 artists and technicians working on the project. The animation of Pinocchio and other characters was created using a combination of motion capture and keyframe animation.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Alan Silvestri, who has collaborated with Robert Zemeckis on numerous projects. The score features a mix of orchestral and choral elements, with several original songs written for the film.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in May 2022, with the release of the first trailer. The trailer received widespread attention and acclaim, with many praising the film's visuals and faithfulness to the original story.\n\n# Release\n\nPinocchio was released on September 8, 2022, on Disney+, with a limited theatrical release in select countries.

The storm formed as a tropical depression on July 2, 2022, and gradually intensified into a hurricane, becoming the second named storm of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season. Bonnie brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several countries in Central America and the Caribbean, causing significant disruptions and damage.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Bonnie originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on June 22, 2022. The wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific on June 28, where it began to show signs of organization. A low-pressure system developed on July 1, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system as a tropical depression on July 2. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, earning the name Bonnie.\n\nOver the next few days, Bonnie continued to intensify, fueled by warm ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. The storm reached hurricane strength on July 4, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Bonnie's intensity fluctuated over the next 48 hours, but it eventually reached its peak intensity on July 6, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 969 mbar.\n\nBonnie maintained hurricane strength for several days, moving west-northwestward across the eastern Pacific. The storm began to weaken on July 9, due to increasing wind shear and cooler ocean temperatures. Bonnie degenerated into a tropical depression on July 11 and dissipated later that day.\n\n# Preparations and impacts\n\n## Trinidad and Tobago\n\nBonnie brought heavy rainfall to Trinidad and Tobago, with accumulations ranging from 2-4 inches (50-100 mm) across the islands. The rain caused flooding in several areas, including the capital city of Port of Spain. Strong winds also affected the islands, with gusts reaching up to 60 mph (97 km/h). The Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service issued a flood watch for the entire country, and several schools were closed due to the inclement weather.\n\n## Mexico\n\nBonnie's outer rainbands affected the southern Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds. The storm caused significant disruptions in the region, including power outages and transportation disruptions. The Mexican government deployed troops to assist with relief efforts, and several shelters were established for affected residents.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nBonnie's impacts were also felt in other countries in Central America and the Caribbean. In Costa Rica, the storm caused heavy rainfall and flooding in several provinces, including Limón and Puntarenas. In Panama, Bonnie brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing power outages and transportation disruptions. The storm also affected several Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, where strong winds and heavy rainfall were reported.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Pacific hurricane season\n* List of Category 1 Pacific hurricanes\n* Hurricane season\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n* National Hurricane Center (NHC)\n* National Weather Service (NWS)\n* Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Bonnie_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations and impacts\n##Trinidad and Tobago\n##Mexico\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused catastrophic damage and flooding in several regions, resulting in significant economic losses and displacement of thousands of people. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nHurricane Hilary originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 10, 2023. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, developing a closed circulation on August 15. The system strengthened into a tropical depression on August 17, approximately 1,000 miles southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression rapidly intensified, becoming a tropical storm on August 18 and a hurricane on August 19.\n\nHilary moved northwestward, parallel to the Mexican coast, and reached Category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale on August 20. The storm's maximum sustained winds peaked at 140 mph (220 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 944 mbar (27.88 inHg). Hilary maintained its intensity as it approached the Baja California Peninsula, making landfall on August 21 near the town of Los Cabos.\n\nAfter crossing the peninsula, Hilary re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean and continued northwestward, eventually making a second landfall on August 22 near the city of San Quintín, in the state of Baja California. The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland, dissipating on August 23 over the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mexico\n\nMexican authorities issued a hurricane warning for the Baja California Peninsula and the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora on August 18. A tropical storm watch was also issued for the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. The Mexican government evacuated over 10,000 people from coastal areas and set up shelters for those displaced by the storm.\n\nThe Mexican Navy and National Guard were deployed to assist with evacuations and provide support to affected communities. The country's civil protection agency, COEP, activated its emergency response protocol, mobilizing personnel and resources to respond to the storm.\n\n## United States\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tropical storm watch for the southwestern coast of California on August 19. A flash flood watch was also issued for the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated its emergency operations center in response to the storm, deploying personnel and resources to support state and local authorities. The California National Guard was also activated to assist with evacuations and provide support to affected communities.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mexico\n\nHilary caused widespread destruction and flooding in the Baja California Peninsula and surrounding states. The storm's powerful winds and heavy rainfall caused power outages, damaged buildings, and disrupted transportation services.\n\nThe city of Los Cabos was severely affected, with widespread flooding and damage to homes and businesses. The city's airport was also closed due to the storm. In the state of Baja California Sur, the storm caused significant damage to the agricultural sector, with losses estimated in the millions of dollars.\n\n## United States\n\n### California\n\nHilary brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to southern California, causing flash flooding and power outages. The storm's heavy rainfall caused the Los Angeles River to overflow, resulting in significant flooding in the San Fernando Valley and other areas.\n\nThe city of San Diego was also affected, with heavy rainfall causing flooding and damage to homes and businesses. The San Diego River overflowed, causing significant flooding in the surrounding areas.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nHilary's outer rain bands also affected other parts of the southwestern United States, including Arizona and Nevada. The storm caused flash flooding and power outages in these areas, although the impact was less severe than in California.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Hilary was marked by widespread relief efforts and cleanup operations. In Mexico, the government deployed troops and emergency responders to affected areas, providing aid and support to those displaced by the storm.\n\nIn the United States, FEMA and other agencies provided support to affected communities, assisting with debris removal and providing aid to those affected by the storm. The California National Guard was also deployed to assist with relief efforts.\n\nThe economic impact of the storm was significant, with estimated losses in the billions of dollars. The storm also caused significant disruption to transportation services and commerce in the affected regions.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Category 4 Pacific hurricanes\n* List of California hurricanes\n* List of Baja California Peninsula hurricanes\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full extent of the storm's impact.\n\n# References\n\n* National Hurricane Center (2023).

The season began on March 26, 2022, and concluded on May 29, 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 IPL season was originally scheduled to take place in 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed and eventually took place in 2022. This season also saw the introduction of two new teams, the Gujarat Titans and the Lucknow Super Giants, which replaced the Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals, who were suspended for two years. The season was played with a total of ten teams, with each team playing the other nine teams twice in the league stage, followed by the playoffs.\n\n**Personnel changes**\n\nThere were several personnel changes before the start of the 2022 season. The Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals, who were suspended for two years, were replaced by the Gujarat Titans and the Lucknow Super Giants. The Mumbai Indians, who were the defending champions, retained their core team, while the Royal Challengers Bangalore made several changes to their squad. The Delhi Capitals, who finished runners-up in the previous season, also made some changes to their team.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe 2022 IPL season followed the same format as the previous seasons. The ten teams played each other twice in the league stage, with the top four teams qualifying for the playoffs. The playoffs consisted of two Qualifiers, an Eliminator, and the Final. The winners of the two Qualifiers played each other in the Final, while the losers of the two Qualifiers played each other in the Eliminator. The winner of the Eliminator played the loser of the first Qualifier in the second Qualifier.\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe 2022 IPL season was played at several venues across India. The league stage was played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, and the MCA International Stadium in Pune. The playoffs were played at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata and the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.\n\n**Incident**\n\nDuring the season, there was a controversy surrounding the usage of the Decision Review System (DRS) by the on-field umpires. There were several instances where the on-field umpires made incorrect decisions, which were later overturned by the third umpire. This led to criticism from several teams and players, who felt that the on-field umpires were not using the DRS effectively.\n\n**Points table**\n\n| Position | Team | Played | Won | Lost | No Result | Points | Net Run Rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Gujarat Titans | 14 | 10 | 4 | 0 | 20 | +0.316 |\n| 2 | Rajasthan Royals | 14 | 9 | 5 | 0 | 18 | +0.298 |\n| 3 | Lucknow Super Giants | 14 | 9 | 5 | 0 | 18 | +0.251 |\n| 4 | Royal Challengers Bangalore | 14 | 8 | 6 | 0 | 16 | -0.253 |\n| 5 | Delhi Capitals | 14 | 7 | 7 | 0 | 14 | +0.204 |\n| 6 | Punjab Kings | 14 | 7 | 7 | 0 | 14 | +0.126 |\n| 7 | Kolkata Knight Riders | 14 | 6 | 8 | 0 | 12 | +0.146 |\n| 8 | Sunrisers Hyderabad | 14 | 6 | 8 | 0 | 12 | -0.379 |\n| 9 | Chennai Super Kings | 14 | 4 | 10 | 0 | 8 | -0.203 |\n| 10 | Mumbai Indians | 14 | 4 | 10 | 0 | 8 | -0.506 |\n\n**Match summary**\n\nThe league stage saw several exciting matches, with many teams winning and losing closely contested games. The Gujarat Titans, who were one of the new teams, had a great season, winning ten out of their fourteen matches. The Rajasthan Royals and the Lucknow Super Giants also had a good season, winning nine out of their fourteen matches.

The exercises were a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and were widely seen as a response to the visit of United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan earlier in the month.\n\n# Background\n\n## Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military activity around Taiwan, including incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The ADIZ is an area around Taiwan where the Taiwanese military monitors and responds to aircraft that enter the zone without permission. China has been regularly sending military aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ, which has raised concerns about the risk of conflict.\n\n## Escalation of tensions\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating in recent years, with China increasing its military pressure on the island. In 2020, China passed a national security law that gave it the power to impose its own laws on Taiwan, which Taiwan saw as a threat to its sovereignty. Since then, China has increased its military activity around Taiwan, including sending warships and aircraft into the area.\n\n# Military exercises\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan began on August 4, 2022, and lasted for several days. The exercises involved a range of military activities, including live-fire drills, missile tests, and amphibious landings. The exercises were conducted in several areas around Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.\n\nThe exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military power and its ability to encircle and blockade Taiwan. The exercises also included a number of unprecedented actions, including the firing of ballistic missiles over Taiwan and the deployment of drones into Taiwan's airspace.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Japan\n\nJapan was one of the first countries to respond to the Chinese military exercises. Japan's Defense Minister, Nobuo Kishi, issued a statement condemning China's actions and calling for restraint. Japan also scrambled fighter jets to monitor the exercises and to be prepared to respond if necessary.\n\n## North Korea\n\nNorth Korea, which has close ties with China, issued a statement supporting China's actions and condemning the United States and other countries for interfering in China's internal affairs.\n\n## Russia\n\nRussia, which has also been increasing its military cooperation with China, issued a statement calling for calm and restraint. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said that Russia was monitoring the situation closely and was ready to help resolve any disputes through diplomatic means.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the most vocal critics of China's military exercises. The White House issued a statement condemning China's actions and calling for restraint. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, also issued a statement saying that the United States was committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan marked a significant escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, and between China and the United States. The exercises were widely seen as a demonstration of China's military power and its ability to encircle and blockade Taiwan.\n\nThe exercises also raised concerns about the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, and about the ability of the United States and other countries to respond to a potential crisis. The exercises were widely condemned by countries around the world, and were seen as a challenge to the international rules-based order.\n\n# See also\n\n* Taiwan Strait\n* People's Liberation Army\n* United States-Taiwan relations\n* China-Taiwan relations\n* Taiwan independence movement", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This micro-generation is characterized by its unique blend of Millennial and Gen Z traits, bridging the gap between the two. Zillennials are often considered to be a bridge between the analog and digital worlds, having grown up during a time of significant technological change.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe term \"Zillennials\" is a portmanteau of \"Z\" (referring to Generation Z) and \"Millennials\". It was first used in 2017 to describe individuals born between 1992 and 1998, who were considered to be a mix of both generations. The term gained popularity on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter and TikTok, where users began to identify themselves as Zillennials.\n\n#Birth date and age range\n\nZillennials are typically defined as individuals born between 1995 and 2000, although some definitions extend the range to 1992-2002. This birth date range places Zillennials at the cusp of two distinct generations, making them a unique demographic. As of 2023, Zillennials are approximately 23-28 years old.\n\n#Characteristics\n\n##Arts and culture\n\nZillennials have a distinct cultural identity shaped by their exposure to both analog and digital media. Growing up, they consumed a mix of traditional TV shows, movies, and music, as well as online content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. This blend of media consumption has influenced their creative expression, with many Zillennials pursuing careers in the arts, music, and entertainment.\n\n##Economic activity\n\nZillennials entered the workforce during a time of significant economic uncertainty, with many facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. As a result, they are often characterized as financially cautious and risk-averse, prioritizing job security and stability over entrepreneurial ventures. However, this generation is also known for its adaptability and willingness to pivot, with many Zillennials exploring alternative career paths and side hustles.\n\n##Health\n\nZillennials have grown up with a unique set of health concerns, including increased awareness of mental health, anxiety, and depression. This generation is also more likely to prioritize wellness and self-care, with many incorporating mindfulness, meditation, and exercise into their daily routines. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated these trends, with Zillennials seeking to maintain their physical and mental health in the face of uncertainty.\n\n##Personal values\n\nZillennials are often characterized as socially conscious and environmentally aware, with many prioritizing sustainability and social justice. This generation is also known for its emphasis on individuality and self-expression, with many Zillennials embracing their unique identities and personal styles.\n\n##Political activity\n\nZillennials are increasingly engaged in politics, with many participating in social movements and activism. This generation is often characterized as progressive and open-minded, with many advocating for issues such as climate change, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n##Social life\n\nZillennials have a unique social dynamic, with many balancing online and offline relationships. This generation is often characterized as highly connected, with many using social media platforms to maintain relationships and connect with others. However, Zillennials are also known for their desire for authenticity and depth in their relationships, seeking meaningful connections in a digital age.\n\n##Technology\n\nZillennials have grown up during a time of rapid technological change, with many experiencing the transition from dial-up internet to smartphones and social media. This generation is often characterized as tech-savvy and digitally literate, with many using technology to navigate their daily lives, work, and relationships.\n\n#See also\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennials\n* Generation X\n* Generation Y\n* Micro-generation\n* Social media\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for hosting the tabloid talk show \"The Jerry Springer Show\" from 1991 to 2018.\n\n#Early life\n\nJerry Springer was born on February 13, 1944, in Highgate, London, England, to Richard and Margot Springer, Jewish refugees from Germany. His parents had escaped Nazi Germany before the start of World War II. Springer's grandmother, Marie Kallmann, was killed in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.\n\nWhen Springer was five years old, his family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he grew up. He attended Forest Hills High School in Cincinnati and later enrolled at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965. Springer then attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1968.\n\n#Career\n\n##Kennedy campaign and early law career\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Springer worked as a campaign aide for Senator Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1968. Following Kennedy's assassination, Springer returned to Cincinnati, where he worked as a lawyer and became involved in local politics.\n\n##Political career\n\nIn 1971, Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council, where he served for five years. He was known for his liberal views and his advocacy for the rights of women and minorities. In 1977, Springer was elected as the mayor of Cincinnati, a position he held for one year.\n\n##Broadcast career\n\n###Jerry Springer (1991–2018)\n\nIn 1991, Springer began hosting \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" a tabloid talk show that became known for its outrageous and often violent episodes. The show was a huge success, and it ran for 27 seasons, making it one of the longest-running talk shows in television history.\n\nThe show's format typically featured Springer mediating disputes between guests, often with chaotic and confrontational results. The show became infamous for its use of security guards, known as the \"Springer Security Team,\" who were often called in to intervene in the conflicts.\n\nDespite the show's popularity, it was also widely criticized for its perceived exploitation of its guests and its portrayal of working-class Americans. Many critics accused Springer of perpetuating a voyeuristic and degrading form of entertainment.\n\n###Judge Jerry (2019–2022)\n\nIn 2019, Springer began hosting \"Judge Jerry,\" a courtroom-based reality show where he presided over small claims cases. The show was a more subdued and less confrontational affair than \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" but it still maintained a similar tabloid-style format.\n\n###Other\n\nIn addition to his work on \"The Jerry Springer Show\" and \"Judge Jerry,\" Springer has appeared on numerous other television shows, including \"Dancing with the Stars,\" \"America's Got Talent,\" and \"The Simpsons.\"\n\n###UK\n\nIn the UK, Springer has hosted several television shows, including \"The Springer Show\" and \"Tabloid Tales with Jerry Springer.\" He has also made numerous appearances on British television, including on the BBC's \"Have I Got News for You\" and \"QI.\"\n\n##In the media\n\n###Acting\n\nSpringer has appeared in several films and television shows as an actor, including \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,\" \"Ringmaster,\" and \"The X-Files.\"\n\n###Television appearances\n\nSpringer has made numerous television appearances, including on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\" \"The Late Late Show with James Corden,\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\n##Other projects\n\nIn addition to his work in television, Springer has also been involved in several other projects, including a stint as a radio host and a series of comedy tours.\n\n#Personal life\n\nSpringer has been married to Micki Velton since 1973, and the couple has one child, a daughter named Katie. Springer is known for his charitable work, particularly in the area of education, and he has been involved in several high-profile fundraising campaigns.\n\n#Death and legacy\n\nOn April 27, 2023, Jerry Springer passed away at the age of 79, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most iconic and enduring figures in American television.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: References are not included in this article)\n\n#Bibliography\n\n(Note: Bibliography is not included in this article)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: External links are not included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jerry_Springer\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Kennedy campaign and early law career\n##Political career\n##Broadcast career\n###Jerry Springer (1991–2018)\n###Judge Jerry (2019–2022)\n###Other\n###UK\n##In the media\n###Acting\n###Television appearances\n##Other projects\n#Personal life\n#Death and legacy\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The issue sparked widespread protests, debates, and violence, and was eventually taken up by the Karnataka High Court and the Supreme Court of India.\n\n# Background\n\nIn Karnataka, a southern state in India, there has been a long-standing tradition of students wearing the uniform prescribed by their educational institutions. However, in recent years, some Muslim girl students had started wearing the hijab, a headscarf, as part of their attire. The issue gained prominence in January 2022, when a group of students at a pre-university college in Udupi, a coastal town in Karnataka, were denied entry to their classroom for wearing the hijab.\n\n# Events\n\n## Udupi dispute\n\nThe controversy began on January 1, 2022, when a group of six Muslim girl students at the Government Pre-University College for Girls in Udupi were refused entry to their classroom by the college authorities for wearing the hijab. The students claimed that they had been wearing the hijab for several years without any issues, but the college authorities argued that it was not part of the prescribed uniform. The students then approached the college principal, who refused to allow them to wear the hijab, citing the uniform policy.\n\n## Saffron protests\n\nIn response to the hijab controversy, a group of Hindu students at the college began protesting, wearing saffron shawls and scarves, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. The protests soon spread to other colleges and institutions in Karnataka, with Hindu students demanding that the hijab be banned. The protests were supported by right-wing Hindu groups, which saw the hijab as a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism.\n\n## Government reaction\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), initially supported the college authorities' decision to ban the hijab. The government argued that the uniform policy was in place to promote unity and equality among students, and that the hijab was not part of the prescribed uniform. However, as the protests escalated, the government was forced to intervene, and on January 11, 2022, it issued an order allowing students to wear the hijab, but only in classrooms and not in public areas.\n\n## Fallout\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked widespread violence and protests across Karnataka, with Muslim and Hindu groups clashing in several towns and cities. The violence resulted in several injuries and arrests, and the government was forced to impose curfews in several areas. The controversy also sparked a national debate on the issue of religious freedom and the role of the state in regulating personal attire.\n\n# Petitions in the High Court\n\n## Religious rights\n\nA group of Muslim girl students, including the six students from Udupi, approached the Karnataka High Court, challenging the college authorities' decision to ban the hijab. The students argued that the hijab was an essential part of their religious attire, and that the ban was a violation of their right to freedom of religion, guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The students also argued that the uniform policy was discriminatory, as it allowed Hindu students to wear saffron shawls and scarves, but not Muslim students to wear the hijab.\n\n## Government order\n\nThe Karnataka government defended its order allowing students to wear the hijab, arguing that it was a balance between the rights of Muslim students and the need to maintain unity and equality among students. The government also argued that the hijab was not an essential part of Islamic attire, and that it was not necessary for Muslim students to wear it.\n\n## College development committees\n\nThe Karnataka High Court also heard arguments from college development committees, which argued that the hijab was a distraction, and that it was not in the best interests of the students. The committees also argued that the uniform policy was in place to promote discipline and unity among students.\n\n## Udupi college and other institutions\n\nThe Karnataka High Court also heard arguments from the Udupi college and other institutions, which argued that the hijab was not part of the prescribed uniform, and that it was not necessary for Muslim students to wear it. The institutions also argued that the uniform policy was in place to promote unity and equality among students.\n\n# High Court verdict\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Karnataka High Court delivered its verdict, dismissing the petitions filed by the Muslim girl students. The court held that the hijab was not an essential part of Islamic attire, and that it was not necessary for Muslim students to wear it. The court also held that the uniform policy was not discriminatory, as it applied equally to all students, regardless of their religion. The court's verdict was seen as a setback for Muslim students, who had been wearing the hijab as part of their attire.\n\n# Supreme Court\n\nThe Muslim girl students then approached the Supreme Court of India, challenging the Karnataka High Court's verdict. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and on September 1, 2022, it delivered its verdict, upholding the Karnataka High Court's decision. The Supreme Court held that the hijab was not an essential part of Islamic attire, and that it was not necessary for Muslim students to wear it. The court also held that the uniform policy was not discriminatory, as it applied equally to all students, regardless of their religion.\n\n# Violence\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked widespread violence and protests across Karnataka, with Muslim and Hindu groups clashing in several towns and cities. The violence resulted in several injuries and arrests, and the government was forced to impose curfews in several areas.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Domestic\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a national debate on the issue of religious freedom and the role of the state in regulating personal attire. Several opposition parties, including the Indian National Congress, criticized the Karnataka government's decision to ban the hijab, arguing that it was a violation of the rights of Muslim students. Several Muslim organizations also criticized the government's decision, arguing that it was an attack on the rights of Muslim students.\n\n## International\n\nThe hijab controversy also sparked international attention, with several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, expressing concern over the issue. Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, also criticized the Karnataka government's decision, arguing that it was a violation of the rights of Muslim students.\n\n## Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) responded to the international criticism, arguing that the issue was an internal matter, and that the government was committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of their religion. The MEA also argued that the hijab controversy was a complex issue, and that it was being blown out of proportion by some sections of the media.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe hijab controversy had a significant impact on the social and political landscape of Karnataka, with several Muslim students being denied entry to their classrooms for wearing the hijab. The controversy also sparked widespread violence and protests, resulting in several injuries and arrests. The controversy also had a national and international impact, with several countries and human rights organizations expressing concern over the issue.\n\n# Rescission\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Karnataka government rescinded its order allowing students to wear the hijab, citing the Supreme Court's verdict. The government argued that the order was no longer valid, and that the hijab was not an essential part of Islamic attire.\n\n# See also\n\n* Islam in India\n* Hinduism in India\n* Uniform policy in India\n* Freedom of religion in India\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2022 Karnataka hijab row, and does not express any opinion or bias.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nThis article does not include any bibliography.\n\n# External links\n\nThis article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was a unique and powerful administrative entity that played a significant role in the region's history. This article will explore the history, administration, and legacy of the County Palatine of Durham.\n\n# History\n\n## Early History\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has its roots in the early medieval period. In the 7th century, the Kingdom of Northumbria, which included the area now known as County Durham, was a major power in northern England. Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, the region was divided into smaller administrative units, with the Bishop of Durham emerging as a key figure.\n\nIn the 11th century, the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, played a crucial role in the region's history. He was a powerful and influential figure who served as the chief advisor to King William II of England. De St-Calais's authority and influence helped establish the Bishop of Durham as a major power in the region.\n\n## Establishment and Consolidation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham was formally established in the 12th century. In 1153, King Stephen of England granted the Bishop of Durham, Hugh de Puiset, a charter that recognized the bishop's authority over the region. This charter gave the bishop the power to govern the region, collect taxes, and maintain law and order.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, the County Palatine of Durham continued to grow in power and influence. The bishops of Durham played a significant role in regional politics, often serving as advisors to the English monarchy. The county's unique status as a palatinate, a region under the direct authority of a noble or bishop, allowed it to maintain a degree of autonomy from the English crown.\n\n## Decline and Abolition\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham began to decline in the 16th century. The English Reformation and the subsequent dissolution of the monasteries led to a significant reduction in the bishop's power and influence. The county's unique status as a palatinate was also challenged by the English crown, which sought to assert its authority over the region.\n\nIn 1836, the County Palatine of Durham was formally abolished, and the region was divided into two separate counties: County Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire. The bishop's authority was significantly reduced, and the region was brought under the direct control of the English crown.\n\n# Administration\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own unique system of taxation. The bishop was responsible for collecting taxes from the region's inhabitants, which were used to fund the county's administration and the bishop's own authority.\n\nThe county's taxation system was based on the medieval concept of \"tallage,\" which required the region's inhabitants to pay a portion of their income to the bishop. This system was often criticized for being unfair and oppressive, leading to tensions between the bishop and the region's inhabitants.\n\n## Government and Courts\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had its own system of government and courts. The bishop served as the chief administrator of the county, responsible for maintaining law and order and governing the region.\n\nThe county's courts were responsible for trying cases and dispensing justice. The bishop's court, known as the \"Court of the Bishop's Palatinate,\" had jurisdiction over the region and was responsible for trying cases involving the bishop's authority.\n\n# St Cuthbert and the Haliwerfolc\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham had a unique relationship with St Cuthbert, a 7th-century saint who was revered in the region. The bishop of Durham served as the guardian of St Cuthbert's shrine, which was located in Durham Cathedral.\n\nThe haliwerfolc, a group of devout followers of St Cuthbert, played a significant role in the county's history. They were responsible for maintaining the saint's shrine and promoting his cult throughout the region.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe County Palatine of Durham has left a lasting legacy in the region. The county's unique history and culture continue to shape the identity of County Durham and the surrounding area.\n\nThe bishop of Durham remains a significant figure in the region, serving as the head of the Church of England in the Diocese of Durham. Durham Cathedral, which was built in the 11th century, continues to be an important place of worship and pilgrimage.\n\nThe county's history and culture are also celebrated through various festivals and events, including the Durham Miners' Gala, which commemorates the region's mining heritage.\n\n# References\n## Citations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"County_Palatine_of_Durham\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Early history\n##Establishment and consolidation\n##Decline and abolition\n#Administration\n##Taxation\n##Government and courts\n#St Cuthbert and the haliwerfolc\n#Legacy\n#References\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The work is a comprehensive compilation of engravings and written descriptions of monarchs, nobles, and other distinguished individuals from various parts of the world.\n\n# Iconographic bases and authorship\n\n## Development and conception\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was conceived and developed by Guillaume Rouillé, a French publisher and bookseller. Rouillé was a prominent figure in the Lyon publishing scene, and his workshop was renowned for producing high-quality engravings and printed materials. The idea for the Promptuarium was likely inspired by the growing demand for iconographic collections and the increasing interest in portraiture during the Renaissance.\n\n## Collaborations and contributions\n\nRouillé collaborated with several artists and engravers to create the illustrations for the Promptuarium. The most notable contributor was Jean-Jacques Boissard, a French engraver and illustrator who provided many of the portraits featured in the collection. Boissard's engravings were highly regarded for their accuracy and attention to detail, and his contributions to the Promptuarium were instrumental in shaping the work's visual identity.\n\n## Authorship and editorial responsibilities\n\nRouillé was the primary author and editor of the Promptuarium. He was responsible for researching and compiling the biographical information, as well as overseeing the production of the engravings and written descriptions. Rouillé's editorial approach was meticulous, and he ensured that the information presented in the Promptuarium was accurate and up-to-date.\n\n# Publication history\n\n## First edition (1553)\n\nThe first edition of the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum was published in 1553 by Rouillé's workshop in Lyon. The initial print run consisted of 500 copies, and the work was met with immediate success. The Promptuarium was praised for its comprehensive coverage of notable figures and its high-quality illustrations.\n\n## Subsequent editions and revisions\n\nOver the years, the Promptuarium underwent several revisions and updates. Rouillé published a second edition in 1555, which included additional portraits and biographies. The third edition, published in 1577, featured significant revisions and expansions, including new engravings and written descriptions.\n\n## Translations and adaptations\n\nThe Promptuarium was translated into several languages, including Latin, Italian, and German. These translations helped to further disseminate the work and introduced the Promptuarium to new audiences.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Initial reception\n\nThe Promptuarium was well-received by scholars and collectors upon its initial release. The work was praised for its accuracy, comprehensiveness, and the high quality of its illustrations. The Promptuarium quickly became a standard reference work in the field of iconography.\n\n## Influence and impact\n\nThe Promptuarium had a significant impact on the development of iconography and portraiture during the Renaissance. The work's influence can be seen in numerous subsequent iconographic collections and publications. The Promptuarium also played a role in shaping the visual identity of monarchs and nobles, as the engravings and written descriptions presented in the work helped to establish a standardized visual language.\n\n## Criticisms and limitations\n\nWhile the Promptuarium was widely praised, it was not without its limitations and criticisms. Some scholars noted that the work's focus on European monarchs and nobles was too narrow, and that the inclusion of figures from other parts of the world was limited. Additionally, the Promptuarium's reliance on secondary sources and lack of primary research were seen as limitations.\n\n# See also\n\n* Iconography\n* Portraiture\n* Renaissance art\n* Guillaume Rouillé\n* Jean-Jacques Boissard\n\n# Notes\n\nThe Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum is a significant work in the field of iconography, offering a comprehensive collection of portraits and biographies of notable figures from ancient and modern times.

He is one of the most influential and controversial figures in Italian politics, known for his business acumen, charismatic personality, and numerous scandals. Berlusconi's career spans over five decades, during which he has built a vast business empire and held various public offices, including Prime Minister of Italy three times.\n\n#Family background and personal life\n\nSilvio Berlusconi was born on September 29, 1936, in Milan, Italy, to Luigi Berlusconi and Rosa Bossi. His father was a bank employee, and his mother was a housewife. Berlusconi has two younger siblings, Paolo and Maria. He grew up in a middle-class family and was raised in a devout Catholic household.\n\nBerlusconi married Carla Elvira Lucia Dall'Oglio in 1965, and they had two children, Maria and Pier Silvio. The couple divorced in 1985. In 1990, Berlusconi married Veronica Lario, with whom he had three children: Barbara, Eleonora, and Luigi. Berlusconi and Lario divorced in 2010.\n\nBerlusconi is known for his flamboyant lifestyle, which includes a collection of luxurious properties, private jets, and high-end cars. He is also a fan of football and has owned several football clubs, including AC Monza and AC Milan.\n\n#Business career\n\n##Milano Due\n\nBerlusconi's business career began in the 1960s, when he founded a construction company called Edilnord. The company's first major project was the development of a residential complex called Milano Due, which was completed in 1979. Milano Due was a groundbreaking project that set the standard for modern residential developments in Italy.\n\n##TeleMilano\n\nIn the 1970s, Berlusconi expanded his business interests into the media sector. He founded a television station called TeleMilano, which later became Canale 5. TeleMilano was the first private television station in Italy and marked the beginning of Berlusconi's media empire.\n\n##Fininvest\n\nIn 1978, Berlusconi founded Fininvest, a holding company that controlled his various business interests. Fininvest was listed on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1986 and quickly became one of the largest companies in Italy. Fininvest's portfolio included media companies, construction firms, and financial institutions.\n\n#Political career\n\n##Beginnings\n\nBerlusconi's entry into politics was sudden and unexpected. In 1993, he announced his candidacy for the 1994 general election, just a few months before the election. Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, was founded in December 1993 and quickly gained popularity.\n\n##1994 electoral victory\n\nBerlusconi's Forza Italia party won the 1994 general election, and he became Prime Minister of Italy for the first time. Berlusconi's government implemented several reforms, including the privatization of state-owned companies and the reduction of bureaucracy.\n\n##Fall of the Berlusconi I Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's first government was short-lived. In December 1994, his coalition partner, the Northern League, withdrew its support, and Berlusconi was forced to resign.\n\n##2001 electoral victory\n\nBerlusconi returned to power in 2001, when his Forza Italia party won the general election. Berlusconi's second government implemented several reforms, including the introduction of a new electoral law and the reduction of taxes.\n\n##Berlusconi II Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's second government was marked by controversy and scandal. In 2002, Berlusconi was accused of corruption and was forced to appear in court. He was later acquitted, but the scandal damaged his reputation.\n\n##Subsequent elections\n\nBerlusconi's Forza Italia party won the 2008 general election, and he became Prime Minister of Italy for the third time. Berlusconi's third government implemented several reforms, including the introduction of a new electoral law and the reduction of taxes.\n\n##Berlusconi III Cabinet\n\nBerlusconi's third government was marked by controversy and scandal. In 2009, Berlusconi was accused of having an affair with a teenage girl, and he was later accused of corruption. Berlusconi was forced to resign in 2011, when his government lost a confidence vote.\n\n##Attempt to reform the Italian constitution\n\nIn 2016, Berlusconi's Forza Italia party proposed a referendum to reform the Italian constitution. The referendum was rejected by voters, and Berlusconi's party was defeated in the subsequent general election.\n\n##2006 general election and opposition\n\nBerlusconi's Forza Italia party lost the 2006 general election, and he became leader of the opposition. Berlusconi's party won the 2008 general election, and he became Prime Minister of Italy for the third time.\n\n##2008 electoral victory\n\nBerlusconi's Forza Italia party won the 2008 general election, and he became Prime Minister of Italy for the third time. Berlusconi's third government implemented several reforms, including the introduction of a new electoral law and the reduction of taxes.\n\n##The People of Freedom split\n\nIn 2013, Berlusconi's Forza Italia party split, and a new party, The People of Freedom, was formed.

The storm brought severe winds, heavy rainfall, and significant damage to the affected regions.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nCyclone Batsirai formed as a tropical disturbance on January 24, 2022, approximately 1,200 km (750 mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. The system gradually intensified as it moved westward, and by January 27, it had developed into a tropical depression. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 06S, while the Mauritius Meteorological Service (MMS) named it Batsirai.\n\nOver the next few days, Batsirai continued to intensify, fueled by warm waters and low wind shear. On February 1, the storm reached tropical cyclone strength, with sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Batsirai then underwent rapid intensification, reaching Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale by February 3.\n\nAs Batsirai approached the coast of Madagascar, it reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds of 235 km/h (145 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940 hPa (27.36 inHg). The storm then began to weaken due to interaction with the coastline and increasing wind shear.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mauritius\n\nIn Mauritius, the government issued a Class III cyclone warning on January 31, indicating that the storm was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall. The authorities evacuated approximately 2,000 people from low-lying areas and placed the island's emergency services on high alert.\n\nThe Mauritius Meteorological Service issued regular updates on the storm's progress, warning of potential flash flooding, landslides, and power outages. The government also activated its emergency response plan, which included the deployment of military personnel and emergency responders.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn Madagascar, the National Bureau of Meteorology (BNGRC) issued a cyclone warning on January 30, indicating that the storm was expected to bring strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. The authorities evacuated approximately 10,000 people from coastal areas and placed the country's emergency services on high alert.\n\nThe government also activated its emergency response plan, which included the deployment of military personnel and emergency responders. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) also activated its emergency response plan, which included the deployment of humanitarian personnel and resources.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Mauritius\n\nBatsirai made landfall in Mauritius on February 2, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant damage. The storm caused widespread power outages, with approximately 70% of the island's electricity grid affected. The authorities reported that 12 people were injured, and one person was killed.\n\nThe storm also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The government estimated that the damage was in excess of Rs 1 billion (approximately USD 25 million).\n\n## Réunion\n\nBatsirai passed close to the French overseas department of Réunion on February 2, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The authorities reported that 10 people were injured, and one person was killed.\n\nThe storm also caused widespread power outages, with approximately 50% of the island's electricity grid affected. The government estimated that the damage was in excess of €10 million (approximately USD 11 million).\n\n## Madagascar\n\nBatsirai made landfall in Madagascar on February 5, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant damage. The storm caused widespread power outages, with approximately 80% of the country's electricity grid affected. The authorities reported that 20 people were killed, and 60 people were injured.\n\nThe storm also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The government estimated that the damage was in excess of MGA 10 billion (approximately USD 2.5 million).\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Mauritius\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the government of Mauritius declared a state of emergency and deployed military personnel to assist with relief efforts. The authorities also established a relief fund to support affected communities.\n\nThe government also activated its disaster recovery plan, which included the deployment of emergency responders and the provision of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) also provided support to the government's relief efforts.\n\n## Madagascar\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the government of Madagascar declared a state of emergency and deployed military personnel to assist with relief efforts. The authorities also established a relief fund to support affected communities.\n\nThe government also activated its disaster recovery plan, which included the deployment of emergency responders and the provision of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) also provided support to the government's relief efforts.\n\n### International response\n\nThe international community responded to the disaster with offers of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) provided support to the governments of Mauritius and Madagascar, including the deployment of humanitarian personnel and resources.\n\nThe European Union also provided humanitarian assistance, including funding and personnel. The governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States also provided support, including funding and personnel.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cyclone Idai\n* Cyclone Kenneth\n* Cyclone Irina\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of Cyclone Batsirai and its impact on the island nations of Mauritius, Réunion, and Madagascar.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n* Mauritius Meteorological Service\n* National Bureau of Meteorology (BNGRC)\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cyclone_Batsirai\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n#Impact\n##Mauritius\n##Réunion\n##Madagascar\n#Aftermath\n##Mauritius\n##Madagascar\n###International response\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The theory centers around the idea that a secret group of individuals, known as \"Q,\" are working to take down a supposed deep state, often referred to as \"the cabal.\" QAnon adherents believe that this cabal is responsible for various crimes, including child sex trafficking, and that Q is working to bring them to justice.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Pizzagate\n\nQAnon has its roots in the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged in 2016. Pizzagate posited that high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party, including Hillary Clinton, were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C. The theory was thoroughly debunked, but it laid the groundwork for QAnon's later claims.\n\n### Influence of 4chan culture\n\nQAnon also draws heavily from the culture of 4chan, an imageboard website known for its anonymous posting and memes. QAnon's use of cryptic messages, codes, and symbolism is reminiscent of 4chan's style. Additionally, QAnon's emphasis on the idea of a collective, anonymous effort to uncover truth is also reflective of 4chan's ethos.\n\n### Previous \"anons\"\n\nQAnon is not the first conspiracy theory to emerge from the \"anon\" community. Previous \"anon\" movements, such as Anonymous and the \"anon\" hackers of the 1990s, also emphasized collective action and anonymity. However, QAnon's focus on a specific, supposed cabal is unique.\n\nOrigin and spread\n-----------------\n\nQAnon emerged in October 2017 on 4chan's /pol/ board, where an individual or group of individuals began posting as \"Q.\" These posts, known as \"Q drops,\" were cryptic and often contained codes and symbolism. The posts quickly gained attention, and QAnon began to spread to other social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook.\n\n### Mainstream attention\n\nQAnon gained mainstream attention in 2018, as major news outlets began to cover the theory. This attention helped to fuel QAnon's growth, as more and more people became aware of the theory.\n\n### International following\n\nQAnon has attracted a significant following outside of the United States. The theory has been particularly popular in Europe, where it has been linked to various far-right movements. QAnon has also been popular in Australia and Japan.\n\n### Pastel QAnon\n\nIn 2020, a variant of QAnon known as \"Pastel QAnon\" emerged. Pastel QAnon is characterized by its use of softer, more pastel colors and a focus on more mainstream, conspiracy-friendly topics, such as anti-vaccinationism. Pastel QAnon has been seen as an attempt to make QAnon more palatable to a wider audience.\n\nClaims\n------\n\nQAnon's claims are vast and varied, but they can be broadly categorized into several key areas.\n\n### Q's posts\n\nQ's posts are the foundation of QAnon. These posts are often cryptic and contain codes and symbolism. Q uses these posts to communicate with QAnon adherents, providing them with information and guidance.\n\n### The cabal and \"the Storm\"\n\nQAnon's central claim is that a secret group of individuals, known as the cabal, is working to control the world. QAnon adherents believe that this cabal is responsible for various crimes, including child sex trafficking. QAnon also claims that a major event, known as \"the Storm,\" will soon occur, in which the cabal will be brought to justice.\n\n### Child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice\n\nQAnon adherents believe that the cabal is involved in widespread child sex trafficking and satanic sacrifice. These claims are often linked to Pizzagate and other conspiracy theories.\n\n### Other QAnon beliefs\n\nQAnon adherents also believe in a range of other conspiracy theories, including the idea that the moon landing was faked and that the Earth is flat.\n\nAnalysis\n--------\n\n### Identity of Q\n\nQ's identity is unknown, but there are several theories. Some believe that Q is a single individual, while others believe that Q is a group of people.\n\n#### Multiple people\n\nOne theory is that Q is a group of people, possibly with different areas of expertise. This would explain the varying styles and content of Q's posts.\n\n#### Paul Furber and the Watkins family\n\nAnother theory is that Q is linked to Paul Furber, a South African man who has been involved in various conspiracy theories. Furber has denied any involvement with QAnon. Some also believe that the Watkins family, who own 4chan, are involved with QAnon.\n\n### Slogans and vocabulary\n\nQAnon has its own unique slogans and vocabulary. Adherents often use phrases such as \"Where we go one, we go all\" and \"The Great Awakening.\" QAnon also uses a range of codes and symbolism, including the use of \"Q\" and other letters and numbers.\n\n### Derivative elements\n\nQAnon has borrowed elements from various other conspiracy theories and ideologies.\n\n#### Christian themes\n\nQAnon often incorporates Christian themes, including the idea of a coming apocalypse and the struggle between good and evil.\n\n#### Antisemitism\n\nQAnon has also been linked to antisemitism, with some adherents promoting conspiracy theories about Jewish people.\n\n### Appeal\n\nQAnon's appeal is complex and multifaceted.\n\n#### Disillusionment\n\nMany QAnon adherents are disillusioned with mainstream politics and society.

This election marked the third direct presidential election in Turkey, following the constitutional referendum in 2017 that transformed the country's parliamentary system into a presidential one. The election was crucial in determining the next president of Turkey, who would serve a five-year term.\n\n#Background\n\n##2018 elections\n\nThe previous presidential election in Turkey took place on June 24, 2018, in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan won with 52.6% of the vote in the first round. The election was held simultaneously with the parliamentary elections, which resulted in the Justice and Development Party (AKP) losing its parliamentary majority. The 2018 election was significant as it marked the beginning of the presidential system in Turkey, which granted the president extensive executive powers.\n\n#Date\n\n##Discussion on snap elections\n\nThere were speculations about the possibility of snap elections in 2022, but they did not materialize. The government and opposition parties engaged in discussions about the election date, with some suggesting that the election could be held earlier than scheduled.\n\n##Discussion on postponing election date\n\nIn 2022, there were reports that the government was considering postponing the election date due to the economic situation in the country. However, the opposition parties opposed any attempts to delay the election, arguing that it would be undemocratic.\n\n##Election calendar\n\nThe Supreme Election Council (YSK) announced the election calendar on January 10, 2023, which included the following key dates:\n\n* January 15, 2023: Start of candidate nominations\n* January 22, 2023: End of candidate nominations\n* March 10, 2023: Start of election campaign\n* May 14, 2023: First round of presidential election\n* May 28, 2023: Potential second round of presidential election\n\n#Electoral system\n\nThe presidential election in Turkey is held using a two-round system. In the first round, voters cast their ballots for their preferred candidate. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a second round is held between the top two candidates. The candidate who receives the most votes in the second round is declared the winner.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Candidates\n\nSeveral candidates announced their intention to run in the presidential election. The main candidates included:\n\n* Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Justice and Development Party, AKP)\n* Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu (Republican People's Party, CHP)\n* Sinan Oğan (ATA Alliance)\n* Muharrem İnce (Homeland Party, MP)\n* Meral Akşener (Good Party, İYİ)\n\n##Nominations\n\nThe nomination process began on January 15, 2023, and ended on January 22, 2023. The candidates submitted their nomination papers to the YSK, which verified their eligibility to run in the election.\n\n##Endorsements\n\nSeveral parties and alliances announced their endorsement of candidates. The Nation Alliance, which includes the CHP, İYİ, and other opposition parties, endorsed Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as their joint candidate. The ATA Alliance, which includes several smaller parties, endorsed Sinan Oğan as their candidate.\n\n#Second round\n\n##Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n\nAfter the first round, Sinan Oğan and Ümit Özdağ, the leader of the Zafer Party, engaged in negotiations about a potential alliance in the second round. However, the talks ultimately failed to produce an agreement.\n\n###Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n\nThe ATA Alliance, which had endorsed Sinan Oğan, dissolved itself after the first round, allowing its members to make their own decisions about who to support in the second round.\n\n###Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n\nSinan Oğan announced that he would endorse Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the second round, citing the need to prevent a CHP victory.\n\n###Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n\nÜmit Özdağ, on the other hand, announced that he would support Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu in the second round, arguing that Erdoğan's re-election would be disastrous for Turkey.\n\n##Erdoğan's strategy\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan's strategy in the second round focused on appealing to conservative voters and emphasizing his economic achievements. He also sought to portray himself as a strong leader who could maintain stability in the country.\n\n##Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy\n\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy in the second round focused on appealing to a broader coalition of voters, including those who had supported other opposition candidates in the first round. He emphasized his commitment to democracy and the rule of law, and sought to portray himself as a unifying figure who could bring the country together.\n\n##Potential debate\n\nThere were speculations about a potential debate between the two candidates in the second round, but it ultimately did not take place.\n\n#Controversies\n\n##Erdoğan's right to seek re-election\n\nThere were controversies surrounding Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's right to seek re-election, with some arguing that he had already served two terms as president and was therefore ineligible to run again.\n\n##Political violence\n\nThere were reports of political violence during the election campaign, including clashes between supporters of different parties.\n\n##Erdoğan's photo on ballot paper\n\nThere were controversies surrounding the inclusion of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's photo on the ballot paper, with some arguing that it gave him an unfair advantage.\n\n##Fake videos\n\nThere were reports of fake videos being circulated on social media, which sought to discredit certain candidates.\n\n##Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n\nThe Turkish authorities blocked access to the popular social media platform Ekşi Sözlük during the election campaign, citing concerns about the spread of misinformation.\n\n##Reporting of the results\n\nThere were controversies surrounding the reporting of the election results, with some arguing that the state-run Anadolu Agency had delayed announcing the results in order to give Recep Tayyip Erdoğan an advantage.\n\n##Azerbaijani and Russian interference allegations\n\nThere were allegations of interference in the election by Azerbaijan and Russia, with some arguing that they had sought to influence the outcome in favor of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\n#Opinion polls\n\n##First round\n\nOpinion polls before the first round showed Recep Tayyip Erdoğan leading, but with a significant number of undecided voters.\n\n##Second round\n\nOpinion polls before the second round showed a closer contest between Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, with some polls suggesting that Kılıçdaroğlu had a narrow lead.\n\n#Results\n\nThe official results of the election were announced by the YSK on May 29, 2023.\n\n##Analysis\n\nThe results of the election were seen as a significant victory for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had managed to win re-election despite a strong challenge from Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. The election was also seen as a test of the Turkish electoral system, which had been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw a significant response from the opposition, which argued that the election had been rigged in favor of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. There were also reports of celebrations by Erdoğan's supporters, who saw his re-election as a victory for stability and continuity.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community responded to the election result with a mix of congratulations and concern. Some countries, including the United States and the European Union, congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on his re-election, while others expressed concern about the conduct of the election and the state of democracy in Turkey.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2018 Turkish presidential election\n* 2023 Turkish general election\n* Turkish politics\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Turkish_presidential_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##2018 elections\n#Date\n##Discussion on snap elections\n##Discussion on postponing election date\n##Election calendar\n#Electoral system\n#Candidates\n##Candidates\n##Nominations\n#Endorsements\n##Parties and alliances\n#Second round\n##Negotiations by Oğan and Özdağ\n###Dissolution of ATA Alliance\n###Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan\n###Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu\n##Erdoğan's strategy\n##Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy\n##Potential debate\n#Controversies\n##Erdoğan's right to seek re-election\n##Political violence\n##Erdoğan's photo on ballot paper\n##Fake videos\n##Block of Ekşi Sözlük\n##Reporting of the results\n##Azerbaijani and Russian interference allegations\n#Opinion polls\n##First round\n##Second round\n#Results\n##Analysis\n#Aftermath\n##Domestic\n##International\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
