They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the region and have a long and storied history that dates back to the early days of the Austronesian migration. Known for their seafaring skills, martial prowess, and rich cultural heritage, the Bugis have played a significant role in shaping the history and identity of the region.\n\n# Origins and antecedents\n\n## Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of South Sulawesi were the Toalean people, a pre-Austronesian group that lived in the region from around 8000 to 1000 BCE. The Toalean people were hunter-gatherers who lived in small settlements and were skilled in the use of stone tools. They are believed to have migrated to the region from mainland Southeast Asia and are thought to be the ancestors of the modern-day Torajan people.\n\n## The arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 1000 BCE, Austronesian-speaking peoples began to migrate to South Sulawesi from Taiwan and the Philippines. These early Austronesians were skilled sailors and brought with them new technologies such as the outrigger canoe and the iron axe. They quickly established themselves as the dominant group in the region and began to develop a complex society based on agriculture and trade.\n\n## Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe Bugis people are believed to have originated from the region around Lake Tempe in South Sulawesi. According to legend, the Bugis people were created by the god Batara Guru, who formed them from the earth and gave them the task of settling the region. The name \"Bugis\" is derived from the word \"Ugi\", which means \"to honor\" or \"to respect\". The Bugis people have a deep connection to the land and have developed a rich cultural heritage based on their history and traditions.\n\n# History\n\n## Early society\n\nThe early Bugis society was based on a complex system of kinship and social hierarchy. The Bugis people were organized into small kingdoms and chiefdoms, each with its own ruler and system of governance. The Bugis were skilled farmers and traders, and their economy was based on the production of rice, salt, and other commodities.\n\n## The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n\nOver time, the Bugis kingdoms began to grow and expand, and by the 13th century, the Bugis had established themselves as a major power in the region. The Bugis kingdoms were known for their military prowess and their skilled sailors, who traded extensively throughout the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n## Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis began to face challenges from other ethnic groups in the region, including the Makassar and the Mandar. The Makassar, in particular, were a major power in the region and had established themselves as a major trading center. The Bugis and Makassar had a complex relationship, with periods of cooperation and conflict.\n\n## Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Bugis and Makassar societies were closely intertwined. The two groups shared a common language and culture, and there was extensive intermarriage and trade between them.

The spread of Islam in the region was facilitated by the arrival of Muslim traders and scholars from the Middle East and India. The Bugis and Makassar were attracted to Islam because of its emphasis on trade and commerce, and they saw it as a way to strengthen their economic and cultural ties with other Muslim communities in the region.\n\n## The twilight of dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis had begun to decline as a major power in the region. The arrival of European colonizers, particularly the Dutch, had disrupted the traditional trade and commerce of the region, and many Bugis had been forced to adapt to new economic and cultural realities.\n\n## A new golden age\n\nIn recent years, the Bugis have experienced a resurgence of interest in their culture and traditions.

Shia Islam has a long history in Lebanon, dating back to the early days of Islam. Today, Lebanese Shia Muslims play an important role in the country's politics, culture, and society.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nShia Islam was introduced to Lebanon during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, is revered by Shia Muslims as the rightful successor to the Prophet. Ali's son, Hussein ibn Ali, who was martyred in Karbala, is also an important figure in Shia Islam. Many Shia Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula settled in Lebanon, particularly in the Jabal Amel region, during the 7th century.\n\n## Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, Shia Muslims played a significant role in the region. The Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled from Baghdad, had a significant Shia population in Lebanon. The Shia Muslims of Lebanon were known for their scholarship and piety, and many notable Shia scholars emerged from the region during this period.\n\n## Mamluk period\n\nThe Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, saw a significant decline in Shia Muslim fortunes in Lebanon. The Mamluks, who were Sunni Muslims, persecuted Shia Muslims and destroyed many Shia shrines and mosques. However, Shia Muslims continued to thrive in the Jabal Amel region, where they maintained a degree of autonomy.\n\n## Under Ottoman rule\n\nLebanon was under Ottoman rule from the 16th century to the 20th century. During this period, Shia Muslims faced significant challenges. The Ottomans, who were Sunni Muslims, imposed their own brand of Islam on the region, which led to tensions with the Shia Muslim population. However, Shia Muslims also benefited from the Ottoman rule, as it brought a degree of stability and security to the region.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the 16th century, the Safavid dynasty, which was Shia Muslim, ruled Iran. The Safavids had close relations with the Shia Muslims of Lebanon, and many Lebanese Shia scholars traveled to Iran to study and seek patronage. The Safavids also provided financial and military support to the Shia Muslims of Lebanon, which helped to strengthen their position in the region.\n\n## French mandate period\n\nLebanon was under French mandate from 1920 to 1946. During this period, Shia Muslims faced significant challenges. The French, who were Catholic, favored the Christian population of Lebanon, and Shia Muslims felt marginalized and excluded from power. However, Shia Muslims also benefited from the French mandate, as it brought modern education and infrastructure to the region.\n\n### Education\n\nThe French mandate period saw a significant expansion of education in Lebanon. Shia Muslims, who had previously been excluded from education, were able to access modern schools and universities. Many Shia Muslim scholars emerged during this period, and they played a significant role in shaping Lebanese culture and society.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nIn 1926, the French established Ja'fari shar'ia courts in Lebanon, which gave Shia Muslims control over their own personal status law. The Ja'fari shar'ia courts were responsible for matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance, and they played a significant role in maintaining Shia Muslim identity and culture.\n\n# Sub-groups\n\n## Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as the Metouali, are the largest Shia sub-group in Lebanon. They believe in the twelve imams, who are the rightful successors to the Prophet Muhammad. The Metouali are known for their piety and scholarship, and they have produced many notable Shia scholars and leaders.\n\n## Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a Shia sub-group that is found primarily in Syria and Lebanon. They believe in the divinity of Ali ibn Abi Talib and the twelve imams. The Alawites have a distinct culture and identity, and they have played a significant role in Lebanese politics and society.\n\n## Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a Shia sub-group that is found primarily in Syria and Lebanon. They believe in the seven imams, who are the rightful successors to the Prophet Muhammad. The Isma'ilis have a distinct culture and identity, and they have played a significant role in Lebanese trade and commerce.\n\n# Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n\nShia Muslims are found throughout Lebanon, but they are concentrated primarily in the Jabal Amel region, which includes the cities of Tyre and Sidon.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Afghan history, playing a crucial role in the country's struggle for independence and sovereignty. During his reign, he faced numerous challenges, including European influence, conflicts with neighboring countries, and internal power struggles.\n\nBackground and rise to power\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in Kandahar, Afghanistan. He was a member of the Barakzai tribe, a powerful and influential tribe in Afghanistan. His father, Payinda Khan, was a prominent leader of the tribe, and Dost Mohammad Khan's early life was marked by his involvement in tribal politics. In 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan seized power in Kabul, becoming the Emir of Afghanistan. His rise to power was facilitated by his marriage to a woman from the powerful Qizilbash tribe, which helped to secure his position.\n\nEuropean influence in Afghanistan\n\nDuring Dost Mohammad Khan's reign, European influence in Afghanistan began to increase. The British East India Company, in particular, was expanding its influence in the region, and Afghanistan became a crucial location in the Great Game, the rivalry between the British and Russian empires for control of Central Asia. In 1838, the British launched the First Anglo-Afghan War, which was sparked by Dost Mohammad Khan's refusal to accept British influence in his country. The war ended in disaster for the British, with the infamous Retreat from Kabul in 1842, in which thousands of British soldiers were killed.\n\nWar with the Sikhs\n\nIn addition to the challenges posed by European influence, Dost Mohammad Khan also faced conflicts with neighboring countries, including the Sikh Empire. In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan's forces clashed with the Sikhs in the Battle of Jamrud, which resulted in a decisive victory for the Afghans. However, the conflict with the Sikhs continued, and in 1837, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign against the Sikh Empire, which ultimately ended in defeat.\n\nSecond reign\n\nAfter his defeat in the First Anglo-Afghan War, Dost Mohammad Khan was forced into exile in India. However, he remained a powerful figure, and in 1843, he returned to Afghanistan and regained power. His second reign was marked by a series of military campaigns, including the conquest of the Balkh Wilayat and the capture of Herat.\n\n## Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nIn 1845, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign against the Balkh Wilayat, a region in northern Afghanistan that had been under the control of the Uzbek khanates. The campaign was successful, and Dost Mohammad Khan's forces captured the city of Balkh, which became an important center of trade and commerce.\n\n## Alliance with the British\n\nIn 1855, Dost Mohammad Khan formed an alliance with the British, which marked a significant shift in his foreign policy. The alliance was formalized in the Treaty of Peshawar, which provided for British support for Dost Mohammad Khan's government in exchange for Afghan cooperation on issues related to trade and security. The alliance with the British helped to secure Dost Mohammad Khan's position and provided a significant boost to the Afghan economy.\n\n## Conquest of Herat and Death\n\nIn 1862, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign against the city of Herat, which had been under the control of the Persians. The campaign was successful, and Dost Mohammad Khan's forces captured the city, which became an important center of trade and commerce. However, Dost Mohammad Khan's victory was short-lived, as he died in 1863, at the age of 70.\n\nGallery\n\n* Portrait of Dost Mohammad Khan\n* Map of Afghanistan during Dost Mohammad Khan's reign\n* Illustration of the Battle of Jamrud\n* Photograph of the city of Balkh\n* Painting of the city of Herat\n\nSee also\n\n* History of Afghanistan\n* Barakzai dynasty\n* First Anglo-Afghan War\n* Great Game\n\nReferences\n\n* Sources\n\nExternal links\n\n* Biography of Dost Mohammad Khan on the Afghan Government website\n* Article on Dost Mohammad Khan on the Encyclopedia Britannica website\n* Photographs of Dost Mohammad Khan on the Getty Images website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dost_Mohammad_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and rise to power\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n#War with the Sikhs\n#Second reign\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n##Alliance with the British\n##Conquest of Herat and Death\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fourteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed as a subtropical storm in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean on November 7. Over the next few days, the storm underwent a complex evolution, eventually strengthening into a hurricane before making landfall in Florida.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nNicole originated from a low-pressure system that developed over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean on November 5. The system gradually organized, and by November 7, it had become a subtropical storm, earning the name Nicole. Initially, the storm's movement was slow and erratic, with a mix of tropical and subtropical characteristics. However, as Nicole interacted with a mid-latitude trough, it began to acquire more tropical features, including a symmetric circulation and a warm core.\n\nOn November 9, Nicole transitioned into a tropical storm, and by the next day, it had strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. The storm's intensification was fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable outflow pattern. As Nicole continued to move westward, it began to interact with a stationary front, causing the storm's track to become more uncertain.\n\nDespite the complexity of the situation, Nicole maintained its strength, making landfall in Florida on November 10 as a Category 1 hurricane. After crossing the state, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic, where it began to weaken, eventually becoming a post-tropical cyclone on November 12.\n\n# Preparations\n\nAs Nicole approached the Caribbean and southeastern United States, governments and emergency management officials took steps to prepare for the storm's impact.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) activated its emergency operations center, and the country's Prime Minister, Philip Davis, urged residents to take necessary precautions. A hurricane warning was issued for the northwestern Bahamas, and tourists were advised to leave the islands.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency, mobilizing the Florida National Guard and activating the state's emergency operations center. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for several coastal counties, including Palm Beach, Martin, and St. Lucie. Schools and government offices were closed, and residents were advised to stock up on supplies and prepare for power outages.\n\n### Neighboring states\n\nOther southeastern states, including Georgia and South Carolina, also took precautions, with governors declaring states of emergency and activating their emergency operations centers. Residents were advised to monitor the storm's progress and prepare for potential power outages and flooding.\n\n# Impact\n\nNicole's impact was felt across the Caribbean and southeastern United States, with the storm causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n## Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the Lesser Antilles, particularly the islands of Barbados and St. Lucia. The storm caused power outages and flooding, with several roads and bridges rendered impassable.\n\n## Greater Antilles\n\nThe Greater Antilles, including Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, experienced tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 100,000 households affected in Puerto Rico alone.\n\n## Bahamas\n\nNicole made landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 1 hurricane, causing widespread damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and storm surge flooded coastal areas, with several homes and businesses destroyed.\n\n## United States\n\n### Florida\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, causing significant damage and power outages. The storm's strong winds and storm surge flooded coastal areas, with several homes and businesses destroyed. Over 300,000 households lost power, with several counties declaring states of emergency.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nOther southeastern states, including Georgia and South Carolina, experienced tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall. The storm caused power outages and flooding, with several roads and bridges rendered impassable.\n\n## Canada\n\nNicole's post-tropical remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to eastern Canada, particularly the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The storm caused power outages and flooding, with several roads and bridges rendered impassable.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of Nicole saw widespread recovery efforts, with governments and emergency management officials working to restore power and infrastructure.\n\nGovernments and aid organizations provided assistance to affected residents, including food, shelter, and medical care. The storm's impact on agriculture and tourism was significant, with several industries experiencing losses.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n* List of Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: This article is a simulated Wikipedia-style article and does not include actual citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were the key leaders of the American Revolution, the drafters of the United States Constitution, and the architects of the country's government. Their contributions have had a lasting impact on the nation, and their legacy continues to influence American politics, culture, and society.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" refers to a group of individuals who were instrumental in the creation of the United States. While there is no definitive list of Founding Fathers, the term generally includes the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the framers of the United States Constitution, and other key leaders of the American Revolution.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in 1916 by Warren G. Harding, who would later become the 29th President of the United States. Harding used the phrase in a speech to describe the individuals who had played a significant role in the creation of the United States. Since then, the term has become widely accepted and is now commonly used to refer to the group of individuals who were instrumental in shaping the nation.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe following individuals were signers of the Declaration of Independence and/or framers of the United States Constitution:\n\n* John Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Samuel Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Josiah Bartlett (New Hampshire)\n* Carter Braxton (Virginia)\n* Charles Carroll (Maryland)\n* George Clymer (Pennsylvania)\n* William Ellery (Rhode Island)\n* William Floyd (New York)\n* Benjamin Franklin (Pennsylvania)\n* Elbridge Gerry (Massachusetts)\n* Button Gwinnett (Georgia)\n* Lyman Hall (Georgia)\n* John Hancock (Massachusetts)\n* Benjamin Harrison (Virginia)\n* John Hart (New Jersey)\n* Joseph Hewes (North Carolina)\n* Thomas Heyward Jr. (South Carolina)\n* William Hooper (North Carolina)\n* Stephen Hopkins (Rhode Island)\n* Francis Hopkinson (New Jersey)\n* Samual Huntington (Connecticut)\n* Thomas Jefferson (Virginia)\n* Richard Henry Lee (Virginia)\n* John Morton (Pennsylvania)\n* Thomas Nelson Jr. (Virginia)\n* William Paca (Maryland)\n* Robert Treat Paine (Massachusetts)\n* John Penn (North Carolina)\n* George Read (Delaware)\n* Caesar Rodney (Delaware)\n* George Ross (Pennsylvania)\n* Edward Rutledge (South Carolina)\n* Roger Sherman (Connecticut)\n* James Smith (Pennsylvania)\n* Richard Stockton (New Jersey)\n* Thomas Stone (Maryland)\n* George Taylor (Pennsylvania)\n* Matthew Thornton (New Hampshire)\n* George Walton (Georgia)\n* William Whipple (New Hampshire)\n* John Witherspoon (New Jersey)\n* Oliver Wolcott (Connecticut)\n* George Wythe (Virginia)\n\n### Other delegates\n\nOther individuals who played a significant role in the creation of the United States, but were not signers of the Declaration of Independence or framers of the Constitution, include:\n\n* George Mason (Virginia)\n* James Madison (Virginia)\n* Alexander Hamilton (New York)\n* John Jay (New York)\n* Patrick Henry (Virginia)\n* Samuel Chase (Maryland)\n* Thomas Mifflin (Pennsylvania)\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nOther individuals who made significant contributions to the creation of the United States, but are not typically considered to be among the core group of Founding Fathers, include:\n\n* Paul Revere (Massachusetts)\n* Crispus Attucks (Massachusetts)\n* Deborah Sampson (Massachusetts)\n* Haym Salomon (Pennsylvania)\n* John Paul Jones (Virginia)\n\n## Women founders\n\nWhile women did not play a direct role in the creation of the United States, several women made significant contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the nation. These include:\n\n* Abigail Adams (Massachusetts)\n* Deborah Read Franklin (Pennsylvania)\n* Martha Washington (Virginia)\n* Dolley Madison (Virginia)\n* Phyllis Wheatley (Massachusetts)\n\n## Other patriots\n\nOther individuals who played a significant role in the American Revolution and the early years of the nation, but are not typically considered to be among the core group of Founding Fathers, include:\n\n* Ethan Allen (Vermont)\n* Benedict Arnold (Connecticut)\n* Daniel Boone (Kentucky)\n* John André (New York)\n* Nathan Hale (Connecticut)\n\n# The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n\nThe American Revolution began in the mid-1760s, as the British government imposed a series of taxes on the American colonies without their consent. This led to widespread protests and boycotts, as the colonists argued that they had no representation in Parliament and therefore could not be taxed. The situation escalated in 1770, when British soldiers killed five colonists in the Boston Massacre. The colonists responded by forming the Sons of Liberty, a group of patriots who used violence and intimidation to resist British rule.\n\n# Continental Congress (1774–1775)\n\nIn 1774, the colonies sent representatives to the First Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia to coordinate a unified response to British rule. The Congress issued a statement of grievances and called for a boycott of British goods. The following year, the Second Continental Congress met, and it was this Congress that declared independence from Britain and established the United States of America.\n\n## First Continental Congress (1774)\n\nThe First Continental Congress met on September 5, 1774, and was attended by representatives from 12 colonies. The Congress issued a statement of grievances, known as the Declaration and Resolves, which listed the colonies' complaints against the British government. The Congress also called for a boycott of British goods and established a committee to coordinate the colonies' resistance to British rule.\n\n## Second Continental Congress (1775)\n\nThe Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775, and was attended by representatives from all 13 colonies. The Congress declared independence from Britain and established the United States of America. The Congress also established the Continental Army, with George Washington as its commander-in-chief.\n\n# Declaration of Independence (1776)\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, which was written by Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration stated that all men are created equal and have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It also declared that the colonies were free and independent states, no longer subject to British rule.\n\n# Fighting for independence\n\nThe American Revolutionary War lasted from 1775 to 1783, as the colonies fought for independence from Britain. The war was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Saratoga, and the Battle of Yorktown. The British surrendered at Yorktown in 1781, effectively ending the war.\n\n## Treaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, and officially ended the American Revolutionary War. The treaty recognized American independence and established the boundaries of the United States.\n\n# Constitutional Convention\n\nIn 1787, the Constitutional Convention was held in Philadelphia to draft a new constitution for the United States. The Convention was attended by many of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin. The Convention produced the United States Constitution, which was ratified in 1788.\n\n## Virginia and New Jersey plans\n\nThe Constitutional Convention considered two main plans for the new government: the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan. The Virginia Plan called for a strong central government with three branches, while the New Jersey Plan called for a weaker central government with more power given to the states.\n\n## Connecticut Compromise\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, also known as the Great Compromise, was a plan that combined elements of the Virginia and New Jersey plans. The compromise established a bicameral legislature, with the House of Representatives based on population and the Senate based on equal representation for each state.\n\n## State ratification conventions\n\nThe United States Constitution was ratified by the states through a series of conventions. The conventions were held in each state, and they debated and voted on the Constitution. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, when the ninth state, New Hampshire, approved it.\n\n## New form of government\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government, with a strong central government and a system of checks and balances. The Constitution also established the principle of federalism, with power divided between the federal government and the states.\n\n## Bill of Rights\n\nThe Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution in 1791, and it guarantees certain individual rights and freedoms. The Bill of Rights includes the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and the press, and the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n# Ascending to the presidency\n\nGeorge Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in 1789. He served two terms and established many of the customs and traditions of the presidency. Other Founding Fathers, including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, also served as President.\n\n# Demographics and other characteristics\n\nThe Founding Fathers were a diverse group of individuals, with different backgrounds and characteristics.\n\n## Political experience\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers had experience in politics, having served in colonial governments or in the Continental Congress.\n\n## Education\n\nThe Founding Fathers were well-educated, with many having attended college or having studied law.

Some of the Founding Fathers, such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, were Deists, who believed in a higher power but did not subscribe to traditional Christian doctrine.\n\n# Founders on currency and postage\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been featured on various forms of currency and postage, including:\n\n* Coins: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Lincoln\n* Bills: Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Franklin\n* Stamps: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Madison\n\n# Political and cultural impact\n\nThe Founding Fathers have had a significant impact on American politics and culture.\n\n## Political rhetoric\n\nThe Founding Fathers' ideas and ideals have been invoked by politicians and activists throughout American history. The concept of \"originalism,\" which holds that the Constitution should be interpreted as the Founding Fathers intended, has been a central theme in American politics.\n\n## Holidays\n\nSeveral holidays are celebrated in honor of the Founding Fathers, including:\n\n* Independence Day (July 4)\n* Presidents' Day (February 17)\n* Washington's Birthday (February 22)\n\n## Media and theater\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been featured in numerous films, plays, and television shows, including:\n\n* \"1776\" (1969)\n* \"The Adams Chronicles\" (1976)\n* \"John Adams\" (2008)\n* \"Hamilton\" (2015)\n\n## Sports\n\nSeveral sports teams and stadiums have been named after the Founding Fathers, including:\n\n* Washington Redskins (National Football League)\n* Washington Nationals (Major League Baseball)\n* Liberty Bell (Philadelphia)\n\n# Religious freedom\n\nThe Founding Fathers were committed to the principle of religious freedom, and the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.\n\n# Slavery\n\nThe Founding Fathers were divided on the issue of slavery, with some owning slaves and others opposing the practice. The Constitution's Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for purposes of representation, has been widely criticized.\n\n## Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"\n\nThe Reconstruction era, which followed the Civil War, has been referred to as a \"Second Founding\" of the United States. During this period, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution were ratified, guaranteeing freedom, citizenship, and voting rights for African Americans.\n\n# Scholarly analysis\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been the subject of extensive scholarly analysis and debate.\n\n## Early historians\n\nEarly historians, such as George Bancroft and Henry Adams, viewed the Founding Fathers as heroic figures who created a new nation based on democratic principles.\n\n## Modern historians\n\nModern historians, such as Bernard Bailyn and Gordon Wood, have taken a more nuanced view of the Founding Fathers, emphasizing their complexities and contradictions.\n\n## Noted collections\n\nSeveral notable collections of Founding Fathers' papers and documents have been published, including:\n\n* \"The Papers of George Washington\"\n* \"The Papers of Thomas Jefferson\"\n* \"The Papers of James Madison\"\n* \"The Founders' Constitution\"\n\n# See also\n\n* American Revolution\n* United States Constitution\n* Bill of Rights\n* Presidents of the United States\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

The election was called following the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland on 15 February 2023.\n\nBackground\n\nNicola Sturgeon had been the leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland since 2014. During her tenure, she had led the party to several election victories, including the 2015 UK general election, the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, and the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. However, her leadership was also marked by controversy, particularly over her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and her push for Scottish independence.\n\nOn 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her resignation as leader of the SNP and First Minister of Scotland, citing the toll that the job had taken on her mental and physical health. Her resignation triggered a leadership election, which was contested by three candidates: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf.\n\nIssues\n\nThe 2023 SNP leadership election was dominated by several key issues, including economics, independence, and gender recognition reform.\n\n## Economics\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the election, with all three candidates promising to tackle poverty and inequality. Kate Forbes, who served as Finance Secretary under Sturgeon, promised to increase funding for public services and reduce taxes for low-income families. Ash Regan, who served as Minister for Community Safety, promised to increase support for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Humza Yousaf, who served as Health Secretary, promised to increase funding for the National Health Service (NHS) and reduce waiting times.\n\n## Independence\n\nScottish independence was also a major issue in the election, with all three candidates promising to pursue a second independence referendum. Kate Forbes promised to hold a referendum within the next two years, while Ash Regan promised to hold one within the next five years. Humza Yousaf promised to hold a referendum as soon as possible, but did not specify a timeline.\n\n## Gender recognition reform\n\nGender recognition reform was also an issue in the election, with all three candidates promising to reform the current system. Kate Forbes promised to introduce a new system that would allow individuals to self-identify as male or female, while Ash Regan promised to introduce a system that would require individuals to provide evidence of their gender identity. Humza Yousaf promised to introduce a system that would allow individuals to self-identify as male, female, or non-binary.\n\nCampaign\n\nThe campaign for the 2023 SNP leadership election began on 15 February 2023, when Nicola Sturgeon announced her resignation. The nomination period for candidates ran from 22 February to 24 February, during which time three candidates put themselves forward: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf.\n\n## Nomination period\n\nThe nomination period for the 2023 SNP leadership election ran from 22 February to 24 February. During this time, three candidates put themselves forward: Kate Forbes, Ash Regan, and Humza Yousaf. All three candidates were required to secure the support of at least 100 SNP members in order to be nominated.\n\n## Kate Forbes\n\nKate Forbes was the first candidate to be nominated for the leadership election. She announced her candidacy on 22 February and was quickly endorsed by several high-profile SNP politicians, including former First Minister Alex Salmond. Forbes ran on a platform of economic growth and social justice, promising to increase funding for public services and reduce taxes for low-income families.\n\n## Ash Regan\n\nAsh Regan was the second candidate to be nominated for the leadership election. She announced her candidacy on 23 February and was endorsed by several SNP politicians, including former Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill. Regan ran on a platform of independence and community empowerment, promising to increase support for small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n## Humza Yousaf\n\nHumza Yousaf was the third candidate to be nominated for the leadership election. He announced his candidacy on 24 February and was endorsed by several high-profile SNP politicians, including former Health Secretary Shona Robison. Yousaf ran on a platform of social justice and equality, promising to increase funding for the NHS and reduce waiting times.\n\n## Hustings\n\nThe hustings for the 2023 SNP leadership election were held on 27 February and 1 March. The hustings were attended by all three candidates and were moderated by SNP politicians. During the hustings, the candidates were questioned on a range of issues, including economics, independence, and gender recognition reform.\n\n## Row about membership numbers\n\nDuring the campaign, there was a row about the number of SNP members. The party claimed to have around 100,000 members, but some commentators questioned this figure. The row was sparked by a report in The Herald newspaper, which suggested that the party's membership numbers had been inflated. The party denied the allegations, but the row continued to dominate the campaign.\n\nElection process\n\nThe election process for the 2023 SNP leadership election was a one-member, one-vote (OMOV) system. All SNP members were eligible to vote in the election, which was held online and by post.

According to local legend, the name was coined by early settlers who found the mountain's unique shape and terrain to be \"silly\" or peculiar. Another theory suggests that the name may have been derived from the mountain's propensity for landslides, which were often triggered by heavy rainfall or earthquakes. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the name's origin, it has become an integral part of the mountain's identity and charm.\n\n# Flora\n\nSilly Mountain is home to a diverse range of flora, including coniferous and deciduous trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. The mountain's lower slopes are dominated by dense forests of pine, spruce, and fir, while the upper slopes are characterized by alpine meadows and scrubland.

The mountain's core is composed of granite, which is surrounded by a ring of volcanic rocks. The mountain's slopes are characterized by a series of faults and fractures, which have created a range of landforms, including cliffs, talus slopes, and alluvial fans.\n\n## Mining\n\nThe mountain has a long history of mining, with evidence of ancient mining activity dating back thousands of years. The mountain's rich mineral deposits, including copper, gold, and silver, have attracted miners for centuries. In recent years, the mountain has been the site of several large-scale mining operations, which have raised concerns about environmental impact and sustainability.\n\n# Recreation\n\nSilly Mountain offers a range of recreational activities, including mountain biking, hiking, and botanical walks.\n\n## Mountain biking\n\nThe mountain's trails offer some of the most challenging and scenic mountain biking in the region.

The new association was formed to provide a stronger and more competitive competition for the region's football clubs. Over the years, the association has undergone several changes, including the introduction of new clubs and the departure of others.\n\n## Early Years\n\nIn the early years of the association, the competition was dominated by the Faithful Creek and Swan Hill clubs, who between them won 12 of the first 15 premierships. However, as the competition grew and more clubs joined, the dominance of these two clubs began to wane, and other clubs, such as Nyah West and Ultima, began to make their mark on the competition.\n\n## Modern Era\n\nIn recent years, the Faithful and District Football Association has continued to grow and evolve. The association has introduced new initiatives, such as the O'Loan Cup, which is a pre-season competition featuring all the clubs in the association.

{"title": "Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters", "content": "#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Lists of feature films with LGBT characters\n\nThis article lists feature films that include LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) characters in the narrative, whether as main characters, supporting characters, or as part of the ensemble cast. The representation of LGBT individuals in film has evolved significantly over the years, reflecting changing societal attitudes and increasing acceptance.\n\n# Early years (1910s-1960s)\n\n## Silent era and early sound films\n\nDuring the silent film era, LGBT characters were rarely depicted, and when they were, it was often in a stereotypical or negative light. One notable exception is the 1919 German film \"Different from the Others,\" which tells the story of a gay man's struggle for acceptance. The film was groundbreaking for its time but was later banned in many countries due to its frank portrayal of same-sex relationships.\n\n## Coded characters and subtext\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, films began to incorporate coded LGBT characters, often using subtext to convey same-sex relationships or desires. These characters were frequently depicted as outsiders or misfits, reinforcing negative stereotypes. Examples of films from this era include \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1945) and \"Rebecca\" (1940), both of which feature characters with ambiguous or repressed same-sex desires.\n\n## Post-war films and the rise of the \"problem picture\"\n\nFollowing World War II, films began to address more serious social issues, including LGBT themes. \"The Well of Loneliness\" (1946) and \"Olivia\" (1951) are examples of films that tackled same-sex relationships, albeit in a melodramatic and often negative way. These \"problem pictures\" aimed to raise awareness about social issues but often relied on stereotypes and sensationalism.\n\n# New Wave and counterculture (1960s-1970s)\n\n## European art cinema\n\nThe 1960s saw a significant shift in the representation of LGBT characters in film, particularly in European art cinema. Directors like Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, and Pier Paolo Pasolini explored themes of same-sex desire and identity in films like \"Persona\" (1966), \"Contempt\" (1963), and \"Teorema\" (1968). These films often featured complex, nuanced characters and challenged traditional notions of sexuality and identity.\n\n## American underground films\n\nIn the United States, underground filmmakers like Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey began to create films that celebrated queer culture and identity. Films like \"Chelsea Girls\" (1966) and \"Trash\" (1970) featured openly gay and trans characters, often in a playful and irreverent way. These films helped to pave the way for more mainstream representations of LGBT characters in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n## Mainstream films and the emergence of the \"gay character\"\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in mainstream films featuring LGBT characters, often as supporting or minor characters. Films like \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971), and \"A Very Natural Thing\" (1974) featured gay characters in more prominent roles, although often still relying on stereotypes and tropes.\n\n# AIDS and activism (1980s-1990s)\n\n## AIDS and the \"gay plague\"\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant shift in the representation of LGBT characters in film, particularly in response to the AIDS crisis. Films like \"Longtime Companion\" (1989) and \"Philadelphia\" (1993) tackled the issue of AIDS and its impact on the LGBT community. These films often featured gay characters as main characters, although sometimes still relying on stereotypes and melodrama.\n\n## Queer cinema and the rise of independent film\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of queer cinema, a movement that celebrated LGBT identity and culture. Filmmakers like Todd Haynes, Gregg Araki, and Rose Troche created films that explored themes of same-sex desire, identity, and community. Films like \"Poison\" (1991), \"The Living End\" (1992), and \"Go Fish\" (1994) featured complex, nuanced characters and challenged traditional notions of sexuality and identity.\n\n## Mainstream films and the emergence of the \"gay hero\"\n\nThe 1990s saw a significant increase in mainstream films featuring LGBT characters, often as main or heroic characters. Films like \"Philadelphia\" (1993), \"As Good as It Gets\" (1997), and \"The Birdcage\" (1996) featured gay characters in more prominent roles, although sometimes still relying on stereotypes and tropes.\n\n# Contemporary films (2000s-present)\n\n## Increased representation and diversity\n\nThe 2000s saw a significant increase in the representation of LGBT characters in film, particularly in mainstream cinema. Films like \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005), \"Milk\" (2008), and \"The Kids Are All Right\" (2010) featured complex, nuanced characters and explored themes of same-sex desire, identity, and community.\n\n## Global perspectives and intersectionality\n\nContemporary films have also explored global perspectives on LGBT identity and culture. Films like \"Pariah\" (2011), \"Rafiki\" (2018), and \"Call Me By Your Name\" (2017) feature characters from diverse backgrounds and explore themes of intersectionality and identity.\n\n## Queer cinema and the rise of streaming platforms\n\nThe rise of streaming platforms has also led to a surge in queer cinema, with platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime producing and distributing films and series that celebrate LGBT identity and culture. Films like \"Carol\" (2015), \"Moonlight\" (2016), and \"Ammonite\" (2020) have received critical acclaim and have helped to further increase representation and diversity in film.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of LGBT-related films\n* List of films with LGBT characters\n* Queer cinema\n* LGBT representation in film and television\n* LGBT themes in literature\n* LGBT culture", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters\" following this outline:\n\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He began his musical studies at the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca, where he studied composition with Sigismund Toduță. In 1957, Țăranu moved to Bucharest to continue his studies at the Ciprian Porumbescu Conservatory, where he was taught by renowned composers such as Mihail Jora and Alfred Mendelssohn. During this period, Țăranu developed a strong interest in neoclassicism, which would become a hallmark of his early compositional style.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Țăranu gained recognition as a rising talent in Romanian music, with several of his works being performed by prominent ensembles, including the Romanian Radio Orchestra. His neoclassical compositions from this period, such as the String Quartet No. 1 (1962) and the Piano Concerto (1964), demonstrate a mastery of classical forms and a keen sense of musical structure.\n\n## Paris studies and Ars Nova\n\nIn 1967, Țăranu received a scholarship to study at the Paris Conservatory, where he was taught by Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez. This period marked a significant turning point in Țăranu's compositional style, as he became increasingly interested in avant-garde and experimental music. He was particularly drawn to the works of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen, which would later influence his own compositions.\n\nDuring his time in Paris, Țăranu became acquainted with the Ars Nova movement, which emphasized the use of new and innovative musical techniques. He was particularly drawn to the works of composers such as György Ligeti and Iannis Xenakis, who were pushing the boundaries of musical expression. Țăranu's own compositions from this period, such as the orchestral work \"Aurora\" (1969), demonstrate a growing interest in experimentalism and avant-garde techniques.\n\n## Postmodernism and historicism\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Țăranu's compositional style underwent a significant transformation, as he became increasingly interested in postmodernism and historicism. He began to draw on a wide range of musical sources, from medieval chant to jazz and rock music. This eclecticism is evident in works such as the \"Concerto for Orchestra\" (1975), which incorporates elements of folk music and jazz.\n\nȚăranu's interest in historicism is also evident in his compositions from this period, which often draw on historical musical styles and techniques. For example, his \"String Quartet No. 3\" (1980) is written in a style reminiscent of the classical string quartets of Haydn and Mozart. This blending of historical and contemporary styles is a hallmark of Țăranu's postmodern compositional approach.\n\n## Old age\n\nIn recent years, Țăranu has continued to compose music, despite his advanced age. His later works, such as the \"Piano Trio\" (2005), demonstrate a continued interest in experimentation and innovation. Țăranu has also remained active as a musicologist, publishing several books and articles on music theory and history.\n\nDespite his many accomplishments, Țăranu remains humble and dedicated to his craft. In a recent interview, he stated, \"I am still learning, still discovering new things about music. It is a lifelong journey, and one that I am grateful to be on.\"\n\n# Selected works\n\n* String Quartet No. 1 (1962)\n* Piano Concerto (1964)\n* \"Aurora\" (1969)\n* \"Concerto for Orchestra\" (1975)\n* String Quartet No. 3 (1980)\n* Piano Trio (2005)\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cornel_Țăranu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The law governing testate succession in South Africa is primarily codified in the Wills Act 7 of 1953 and the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965. This article provides an overview of the key principles and rules governing testate succession in South African law.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nFreedom of testation is the principle that a person has the right to dispose of their property as they wish after their death, subject to certain limitations. This principle is enshrined in the South African Constitution, which guarantees the right to property and the right to freedom of testation.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile the principle of freedom of testation is fundamental to South African law, there are certain limitations on a person's ability to dispose of their property as they wish. These limitations include:\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA person cannot dispose of their property in a way that is illegal or contrary to public policy. For example, a person cannot leave their property to someone who is not entitled to inherit it, such as an illegitimate child who is not recognized by the law.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act 70 of 1970 prohibits the subdivision of agricultural land into smaller portions, except in certain circumstances. This means that a person cannot leave their agricultural land to multiple beneficiaries in a way that would result in the land being subdivided.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 regulates the subdivision of mineral rights. A person cannot leave their mineral rights to multiple beneficiaries in a way that would result in the rights being subdivided, except in certain circumstances.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a type of trust where a person leaves their property to multiple beneficiaries, with each beneficiary having a successive interest in the property. South African law does not recognize fideicommissa multiplex, and any attempt to create such a trust will be invalid.\n\n### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nA person's surviving spouse has a right to maintenance from the estate, and this right takes priority over any other claims against the estate. A person cannot dispose of their property in a way that would deprive their surviving spouse of this right.\n\n### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nA person's minor children have a right to maintenance and education from the estate, and this right takes priority over any other claims against the estate. A person cannot dispose of their property in a way that would deprive their minor children of this right.\n\n### Pension Funds\n\nPension funds are regulated by the Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956, and a person cannot dispose of their pension benefits in a way that would contravene this Act.\n\n## Delegation\n\nA person can delegate their power to dispose of their property to another person, such as a trustee or executor. However, this delegation must be done in accordance with the law, and the delegate must act in accordance with the person's wishes as expressed in their will.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law plays an important role in South African law, particularly in relation to the rights of indigenous people. A person who is subject to customary law may have different rights and obligations in relation to the disposal of their property, and these rights and obligations must be taken into account when interpreting their will.\n\n# Testamentary Capacity\n\nTestamentary capacity refers to a person's mental ability to make a valid will. A person must have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the consequences of their decisions.\n\n## Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nA person must have the necessary mental ability to make a valid will, which includes the ability to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the consequences of their decisions. A person who is mentally incapacitated, such as someone who is suffering from dementia, may not have the necessary mental ability to make a valid will.\n\n## Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nA person's will can be invalid if it is made as a result of undue influence. Undue influence occurs when someone uses coercion or manipulation to influence a person's decisions, and this can include threats, intimidation, or manipulation.\n\n# Capacity to Witness a Will\n\nA person who witnesses a will must have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and extent of the will, as well as the consequences of their actions. A person who is mentally incapacitated, such as someone who is suffering from dementia, may not have the necessary mental capacity to witness a will.\n\n# Formalities for Execution of a Will\n\nA will must be executed in accordance with the formalities prescribed by law, which includes the requirement that the will be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two or more competent witnesses.\n\n## Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be made in accordance with the formalities prescribed by law, which includes the requirement that the disposition be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two or more competent witnesses.\n\n## Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nThere are several methods of executing a valid will, including:\n\n* Signing the will in the presence of two or more competent witnesses\n* Signing the will in the presence of a notary public\n* Signing the will in the presence of a commissioner of oaths\n\n## Signing and Signature\n\nThe testator must sign the will in the presence of two or more competent witnesses, and the witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator. The signature must be made by the testator themselves, and not by someone else on their behalf.\n\n## Certificate\n\nA certificate of execution must be attached to the will, which includes the signatures of the witnesses and a statement that the will was executed in accordance with the formalities prescribed by law.\n\n## Witnesses\n\nTwo or more competent witnesses are required to witness a will, and the witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator. The witnesses must be competent, which means that they must have the necessary mental capacity to understand the nature and extent of the will, as well as the consequences of their actions.\n\n# Condonation\n\nCondonation is the process by which a court can validate a will that does not comply with the formalities prescribed by law. Condonation can be granted if the court is satisfied that the will was made in accordance with the testator's wishes, and that the formalities were not complied with due to a genuine mistake or oversight.\n\n# Invalid Wills\n\nA will can be invalid if it does not comply with the formalities prescribed by law, or if it is made as a result of undue influence or mental incapacity.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by the testator at any time, either by making a new will or by destroying the existing will.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nThe testator has the right to revoke their will at any time, either by making a new will or by destroying the existing will.\n\n### Manner\n\nA will can be revoked in several ways, including:\n\n* Making a new will\n* Destroying the existing will\n* Ademption\n* Other means of revocation\n\n#### Later Will or Codicil\n\nA later will or codicil can revoke an earlier will, either in whole or in part.\n\n#### Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nA will can be revoked by physically or symbolically destroying it, such as by tearing it up or burning it.\n\n#### Ademption\n\nAdemption occurs when a specific gift in a will is revoked due to the testator's subsequent actions, such as selling the property or giving it away.\n\n#### Other Means of Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by other means, such as by a court order or by the testator's subsequent marriage or divorce.\n\n#### Divorce or Annulment of Marriage\n\nA will can be revoked by the divorce or annulment of the testator's marriage, either in whole or in part.\n\n### Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can Be Revoked\n\nThere are several exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked, including:\n\n* A will that is made in contemplation of marriage\n* A will that is made in anticipation of a specific event, such as a business deal\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived if the testator makes a new will that revives the earlier will, either in whole or in part.\n\n## Alteration or Variation\n\nA will can be altered or varied by the testator, either by making a new will or by adding a

This period saw significant growth and development in Massachusetts, particularly in the Boston area, where many of these historic houses can still be found. The architecture of these homes reflects the skills and traditions of English craftsmen, who brought their expertise to the New World.\n\n## Legend\n\nThe term \"First Period\" was coined by architectural historian Abbott Lowell Cummings to describe the earliest surviving homes in Massachusetts. Cummings, who wrote extensively on the subject, defined the First Period as spanning from 1626 to 1725. However, for the purposes of this article, we will focus on the specific sub-period between 1660 and 1679.\n\n## 1660–1670\n\nDuring this decade, Massachusetts experienced significant growth, driven by an influx of settlers from England. Many of these newcomers were skilled craftsmen, who brought with them the latest architectural styles and techniques. First Period houses from this era are characterized by their use of traditional English building methods, such as timber framing and wattle and daub construction.\n\nOne notable example from this period is the Parson Capen House, built in 1683 in Topsfield, Massachusetts. Although it was constructed slightly outside our specified timeframe, it is often cited as a prime example of First Period architecture. The house features a typical English-style timber frame, with a central chimney and a steeply pitched roof.\n\nOther notable houses from this era include the Fairbanks House in Dedham, Massachusetts, and the Browne House in Watertown, Massachusetts. Both of these homes showcase the characteristic features of First Period architecture, including their use of timber framing, wattle and daub infill, and steeply pitched roofs.\n\n## 1671–1679\n\nThe latter part of the 1670s saw continued growth and development in Massachusetts, particularly in the Boston area. During this period, many First Period houses were built in the city and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nOne notable example from this era is the Paul Revere House, built in 1680 in Boston's North End. Although it was constructed slightly outside our specified timeframe, it is often cited as a prime example of First Period architecture. The house features a typical English-style timber frame, with a central chimney and a steeply pitched roof.\n\nOther notable houses from this era include the Pierce House in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and the James Blake House in Boston, Massachusetts. Both of these homes showcase the characteristic features of First Period architecture, including their use of timber framing, wattle and daub infill, and steeply pitched roofs.\n\n## See also\n\n* List of historic houses in Massachusetts\n* First Period architecture\n* Massachusetts architecture\n* Historic preservation in Massachusetts\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article is based on general knowledge and does not include specific citations or references.\n\n## References\n\nNone.\n\n## External links\n\n* Historic New England: First Period Houses\n* Massachusetts Historical Society: First Period Architecture\n* Preservation Massachusetts: Historic Preservation in Massachusetts", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"First_period_houses_in_Massachusetts_(1660–1679)\" following this outline:\n\n#Legend\n#1660–1670\n#1671–1679\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The app allows users to share text posts, similar to Twitter, and is integrated with Instagram. Threads was launched in July 2023, amidst a crowded social media landscape, and has faced various challenges and controversies.\n\n# History\n\n## Predecessor\n\nThreads is not the first attempt by Instagram to create a text-based social media platform. In 2019, Instagram launched a feature called \"Threads\" which allowed users to share photos and videos with close friends. However, this feature was eventually shut down due to low usage.\n\n## Development and announcement\n\nIn 2022, Instagram began developing a new social media app, codenamed \"Project 92\". The app was designed to be a text-based platform, allowing users to share short posts, similar to Twitter. In June 2023, Instagram officially announced the app, now called Threads, and revealed that it would be integrated with Instagram.\n\n## Launch\n\nThreads was launched on July 5, 2023, for both iOS and Android devices. The app was available in over 100 countries, and users could sign up using their Instagram account. Upon launch, Threads faced technical issues, including slow loading times and errors.\n\n# Appearance and features\n\nThreads has a simple and minimalistic design, with a focus on text-based posts. The app allows users to share posts of up to 500 characters, and supports basic formatting options, such as bold and italics. Users can also share links, images, and videos.\n\n## Possibility of open interoperability\n\nThreads has sparked debate about the possibility of open interoperability between social media platforms. Some experts have argued that Threads could be a step towards a more open and decentralized social media ecosystem, where users can seamlessly interact with other platforms.\n\n## Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads is deeply integrated with Instagram, and users can sign up using their Instagram account. This integration allows users to share posts from Threads to Instagram, and also enables features like account verification and login.\n\n## Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, and can be accessed through the app or through the Instagram website.\n\n## Censorship attempts\n\nThreads has faced censorship attempts from various governments and organizations. In some countries, the app has been blocked or restricted, citing concerns over misinformation and hate speech.\n\n## Advertising\n\nThreads does not currently display ads, but Instagram has announced plans to introduce advertising on the platform in the future.\n\n# Userbase\n\n## Decline in the months after launch\n\nAfter a successful launch, Threads' userbase declined in the following months. According to reports, the app's daily active users decreased by over 50% in the first few months after launch.\n\n## Popularity in Taiwan\n\nDespite declining user numbers globally, Threads has gained popularity in Taiwan. The app has become a popular platform for Taiwanese users to discuss politics and social issues.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has been involved in an intellectual property dispute with a company called \"Threads, Inc.\", which claims that Instagram's app infringes on their trademark.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nThreads has faced concerns over data privacy, with some experts arguing that the app's integration with Instagram raises concerns about user data being shared between platforms.\n\n## State media\n\nState media outlets have responded to Threads with skepticism, with some outlets accusing the app of spreading misinformation and propaganda.\n\n## Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating other social media platforms, such as Twitter and Mastodon. Some experts have argued that the app's features and design are too similar to existing platforms.\n\n# See also\n\n* Instagram\n* Twitter\n* Mastodon\n* Social media\n* Online communities\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Rise of Threads: A New Social Media Platform\" by Wired\n* \"Threads: The New Social Media App from Instagram\" by The Verge\n* \"What is Threads, and How Does it Work?\" by CNET\n\n# External links\n\n* Threads website\n* Instagram website\n* Meta Platforms, Inc. website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The tournament was organized by the World Chess Championship and was contested by eight of the world's top chess players. The winner of the tournament earned the right to challenge the reigning World Chess Champion, Magnus Carlsen, in the 2023 World Chess Championship match.\n\n# Participants\n\nThe tournament featured a strong field of eight players, each of whom had qualified through various routes. The participants were:\n\n* Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia)\n* Ding Liren (China)\n* Fabiano Caruana (United States)\n* Anish Giri (Netherlands)\n* Richard Rapport (Hungary)\n* Hikaru Nakamura (United States)\n* Alireza Firouzja (France)\n* Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan)\n\n## Qualification of Radjabov\n\nTeimour Radjabov was the last player to qualify for the tournament, securing his spot after Sergey Karjakin was disqualified. Radjabov had initially been part of the tournament field but had withdrawn due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. However, following Karjakin's disqualification, Radjabov was reinstated as a participant.\n\n## Disqualification of Karjakin\n\nSergey Karjakin was originally part of the tournament field but was disqualified due to his support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The World Chess Championship took a strong stance against the invasion and subsequently banned all Russian and Belarusian players from participating in their events. As a result, Karjakin was disqualified, and Radjabov took his place.\n\n## Qualification of Ding Liren\n\nDing Liren qualified for the tournament through his performance in the FIDE World Cup 2021. He won the tournament, defeating Alexander Grischuk in the final, and earned his spot in the Candidates Tournament.\n\n# Organization\n\nThe tournament was organized by the World Chess Championship and was held at the Palacio Santoña in Madrid, Spain. The event was a double-round robin, with each player facing every other player twice – once with the white pieces and once with the black pieces.\n\n## Regulations\n\nThe tournament followed standard FIDE regulations, with a few exceptions.
