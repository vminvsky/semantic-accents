He was a prominent figure in American politics and a key leader in the Democratic Party. Jackson's presidency was marked by significant events, including the Indian Removal Act, the Nullification Crisis, and the Bank War. He is also known for his strong personality and his commitment to the principles of democracy and the common man.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in Waxhaws, a region on the border of North and South Carolina. His parents, Andrew and Elizabeth Jackson, were Scottish-Irish immigrants who had settled in the area. Jackson's father died before his birth, and his mother moved the family to a nearby farm. Jackson received a limited education, but he was an avid reader and developed a strong interest in the law.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Jackson's family was involved in the conflict. His brother, Hugh, died of heat stroke during a battle, and his mother died of cholera while nursing soldiers. Jackson himself joined the Continental Army at the age of 13 and served as a messenger and a soldier. He was captured by British soldiers and contracted smallpox while in captivity.\n\nEarly career\n\n### Legal career and marriage\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Jackson began to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1787. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and established a successful law practice. In 1797, he married Rachel Donelson Robards, a woman who was still married to her first husband. The couple had a tumultuous relationship, but they eventually married in 1797 after Robards' divorce was finalized.\n\n### Early public career\n\nJackson's entry into politics began in 1796, when he was elected to the Tennessee State Legislature. He later served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In 1804, he was appointed as a judge in the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n\n### Planting career and slavery\n\nJackson was also a successful planter and owned several plantations in Tennessee. He was a slaveowner and believed that slavery was a necessary institution in the South. He owned over 150 slaves during his lifetime and was known for his strict treatment of them.\n\n### Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr\n\nIn 1806, Jackson engaged in a duel with Charles Dickinson, a man who had insulted his wife. Jackson killed Dickinson in the duel. He also had a close relationship with Aaron Burr, the former Vice President of the United States, and accompanied him on a trip to the Southwest.\n\nMilitary career\n\n### War of 1812\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Jackson served as a colonel in the Tennessee militia. He led a successful campaign against the Creek Indians, who had allied themselves with the British. In 1813, he defeated the Creek at the Battle of Tallushatchee and the Battle of Talladega.\n\n#### Creek War\n\nThe Creek War was a conflict between the United States and the Creek Indians, who had allied themselves with the British. Jackson led a successful campaign against the Creek, defeating them at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.\n\n#### Battle of New Orleans\n\nJackson's most famous military victory was at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. He led a force of American troops against a large British army and defeated them decisively. The battle was fought after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed, ending the War of 1812.\n\n### First Seminole War\n\nIn 1817, Jackson led a military campaign against the Seminole Indians in Florida. He defeated the Seminole and captured several of their leaders. The campaign was a success, but it was also marked by controversy, as Jackson had exceeded his authority and invaded Spanish territory.\n\nPresidential aspirations\n\n### Election of 1824\n\nIn 1824, Jackson ran for President, but he lost to John Quincy Adams in a four-way election. Jackson received the most popular votes, but Adams was elected by the House of Representatives.\n\n### Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson\n\nIn 1828, Jackson ran for President again and won a decisive victory over incumbent President John Quincy Adams. However, the campaign was marred by personal tragedy, as Jackson's wife, Rachel, died just before the election.\n\nPresidency (1829–1837)\n\n### Inauguration\n\nJackson's inauguration was marked by controversy, as a large crowd of his supporters stormed the White House, causing damage and disrupting the proceedings.\n\n### Reforms and rotation in office\n\nJackson believed in the principles of democracy and the common man. He implemented several reforms, including the rotation of office, which allowed for the removal of long-serving government officials.\n\n### Petticoat affair\n\nThe Petticoat affair was a scandal that involved Jackson's Secretary of War, John Eaton, and his wife, Peggy. The affair was marked by controversy and ultimately led to the resignation of several members of Jackson's cabinet.\n\n### Indian Removal Act\n\nThe Indian Removal Act was a law that allowed for the forced removal of Native American tribes from their land to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The law was passed in 1830 and was a major priority of Jackson's presidency.\n\n### Nullification crisis\n\nThe Nullification crisis was a conflict between the federal government and the state of South Carolina, which had nullified a federal law. Jackson responded to the crisis by issuing a proclamation that asserted the authority of the federal government.\n\n### Bank War and Election of 1832\n\n#### Bank veto\n\nJackson vetoed the re-charter of the Second Bank of the United States, which was a major financial institution at the time. The veto was a major controversy and ultimately led to the collapse of the bank.\n\n#### Election of 1832\n\nIn 1832, Jackson ran for re-election and won a decisive victory over challenger Henry Clay.\n\n#### Removal of deposits and censure\n\nAfter his re-election, Jackson removed the government's deposits from the Second Bank of the United States and placed them in state banks. The move was a major controversy and ultimately led to the censure of Jackson by the Senate.\n\n#### Panic of 1837\n\nThe Panic of 1837 was a major economic downturn that occurred during Jackson's presidency. The panic was caused by a combination of factors, including the collapse of the Second Bank of the United States and a decline in agricultural prices.\n\n### Physical assault and assassination attempt\n\nIn 1835, Jackson was the target of an assassination attempt by Richard Lawrence, an unemployed housepainter. Lawrence fired two pistols at Jackson, but both misfired.\n\n### Slavery\n\nJackson was a slaveowner and believed that slavery was a necessary institution in the South. However, he also believed that the issue of slavery should be left to the states to decide.\n\n### Foreign affairs\n\nJackson's foreign policy was marked by several notable events, including the negotiation of several treaties with European countries and the annexation of Texas.\n\n### Judiciary\n\nJackson appointed several notable judges to the federal judiciary, including Roger Taney, who would later become Chief Justice of the United States.\n\n### States admitted to the Union\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, several new states were admitted to the Union, including Arkansas, Michigan, and Alabama.\n\nLater life and death (1837–1845)\n\nAfter leaving office, Jackson retired to his plantation, the Hermitage. He died on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78.\n\nPersonal life\n\n### Family\n\nJackson had several family members who were involved in politics, including his nephew, Andrew Jackson Jr., who served as a congressman.\n\n### Temperament\n\nJackson was known for his strong personality and his ability to inspire loyalty in his supporters. However, he was also known for his quick temper and his willingness to engage in duels.\n\n### Religious faith\n\nJackson was a Presbyterian and believed in the importance of religion in public life.\n\nLegacy\n\nJackson's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong leader who expanded democracy and the power of the presidency. However, he is also remembered for his role in the forced removal of Native American tribes and his support for slavery.\n\nWritings\n\nJackson wrote several books and articles during his lifetime, including a memoir and a collection of his speeches.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n### Biographies\n\n* Remini, Robert V.

He was a member of the Samajwadi Party and represented the Phulpur constituency in Uttar Pradesh. Ahmed's life was marked by a mix of politics and crime, with numerous cases pending against him, including murder, extortion, and kidnapping.\n\n#Early and personal life\n\nAtiq Ahmed was born on August 10, 1965, in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. He belonged to a Muslim family and was the youngest of five brothers. Ahmed's early life was marked by poverty and struggle, with his family dependent on his father's meager income as a laborer. Despite the financial constraints, Ahmed's parents encouraged his education, and he completed his high school from a local government school. However, he dropped out of college due to financial difficulties.\n\n#Political career\n\n##Entry into politics\n\nAhmed's entry into politics was facilitated by his elder brother, Ashraf Ahmed, who was an active member of the Samajwadi Party. Atiq Ahmed began his political career as a worker for the party, participating in local campaigns and rallies. His charisma and oratory skills soon made him a popular figure among the party cadres, and he rose through the ranks. In 1996, Ahmed contested his first election for the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Allahabad West constituency but lost.\n\n##As a member of Lok Sabha\n\nIn 2004, Ahmed was nominated by the Samajwadi Party to contest the Lok Sabha election from the Phulpur constituency. He won the election with a margin of over 40,000 votes, defeating his nearest rival, Keshav Prasad Maurya of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Ahmed's tenure as a member of the Lok Sabha was marked by controversy, with several cases pending against him, including murder, extortion, and kidnapping. Despite the allegations, Ahmed remained a popular figure in his constituency, known for his accessibility and willingness to help the poor and marginalized.\n\n##Participation from prison\n\nIn 2007, Ahmed was arrested and jailed in connection with the Umesh Pal abduction and murder case. Despite being in prison, Ahmed continued to participate in parliamentary proceedings through video conferencing. This was made possible by a special arrangement made by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee. Ahmed's participation from prison was seen as a unique experiment in Indian democracy, allowing a jailed MP to continue his legislative duties.\n\n#Electoral history\n\n* 1996: Lost Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election from Allahabad West constituency\n* 2004: Won Lok Sabha election from Phulpur constituency\n* 2009: Lost Lok Sabha election from Phulpur constituency\n\n#Criminal cases\n\n##Introduction to crime\n\nAhmed's involvement in crime began in the early 1990s, when he was involved in a series of extortion and kidnapping cases. His notoriety grew, and he became known as a \"dreaded don\" in Allahabad. Ahmed's rise in crime was facilitated by his connections with the Samajwadi Party, which provided him with a degree of protection and patronage.\n\n##Raju Pal murder\n\nIn 2005, Ahmed was accused of murdering Raju Pal, a Bahujan Samaj Party MLA from Allahabad. Pal was shot dead outside his residence, and Ahmed was named as the prime accused. The case was widely condemned, and Ahmed's involvement sparked a massive outcry. Ahmed denied any involvement in the murder, but the case remained pending against him.\n\n##SHUATS assault case\n\nIn 2006, Ahmed was accused of assaulting the Vice-Chancellor of Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences (SHUATS), Rajendra B. Lal. The incident occurred during a visit by the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, to the university. Ahmed allegedly assaulted Lal over a dispute regarding the university's land. The case was widely condemned, and Ahmed's involvement sparked a massive outcry.\n\n##Umesh Pal abduction and murder\n\nIn 2006, Ahmed was accused of abducting and murdering Umesh Pal, a lawyer who was representing Raju Pal's wife in a case against Ahmed. Pal was abducted from outside his residence and later found dead. Ahmed was named as the prime accused, and the case was widely condemned. Ahmed denied any involvement in the murder, but the case remained pending against him.\n\n#Death\n\nAtiq Ahmed died on April 15, 2023, while being transported from a prison in Uttar Pradesh to a court in Allahabad. The exact circumstances of his death are still unclear, but it is believed that he died due to a cardiac arrest. Ahmed's death sparked a massive outcry, with many of his supporters and family members alleging foul play.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Atiq_Ahmed\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and personal life\n#Political career\n##Entry into politics\n##As a member of Lok Sabha\n##Participation from prison\n#Electoral history\n#Criminal cases\n##Introduction to crime\n##Raju Pal murder\n##SHUATS assault case\n##Umesh Pal abduction and murder\n#Death\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was sparked by the attempt of James Meredith, an African American student, to enroll at the university, which was previously an all-white institution. The riot marked a significant moment in the American Civil Rights Movement and highlighted the resistance to racial integration in the Deep South.\n\n# Leadup\n\nThe lead-up to the Ole Miss Riot was a complex and tumultuous period, marked by escalating tensions and a series of failed attempts by James Meredith to enroll at the University of Mississippi.\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nIn 1961, James Meredith, a 28-year-old African American veteran, applied to the University of Mississippi, citing his desire to pursue a degree in business administration. Despite meeting the academic requirements, Meredith's application was rejected by the university's admissions committee, which cited a technicality in his application. Meredith appealed the decision, and the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the university to reconsider his application. However, the university continued to resist Meredith's admission, citing concerns about his safety and the potential disruption to campus life.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nAs the summer of 1962 approached, tensions surrounding Meredith's admission continued to escalate. President John F. Kennedy, who had been monitoring the situation, attempted to intervene, engaging in a series of phone calls with Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, a staunch segregationist. Despite Kennedy's efforts to persuade Barnett to cooperate, the governor remained resolute in his opposition to Meredith's admission, sparking a heated exchange between the two leaders. The standoff between Kennedy and Barnett set the stage for the violent confrontation that would unfold in the fall.\n\n# Events\n\nThe events of September 30, 1962, marked the culmination of the crisis surrounding Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi.\n\n## Meredith arrives\n\nOn the morning of September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived at the University of Mississippi, accompanied by U.S. Marshals and federal agents. The group was met with a large crowd of protesters, who had gathered to block Meredith's path to the campus. Despite the tense atmosphere, the U.S. Marshals managed to escort Meredith to the Lyceum building, the administrative center of the university, where he was to register for classes.\n\n## Violence on campus\n\nAs Meredith entered the Lyceum building, the crowd outside began to grow more agitated, with protesters throwing rocks and bottles at the U.S. Marshals. The situation quickly spiraled out of control, with rioters setting fires, overturning cars, and attacking federal agents. The U.S. Marshals, vastly outnumbered, attempted to hold off the crowd, but they were eventually forced to retreat, leaving Meredith and the federal agents vulnerable to attack.\n\n## Military response\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, President Kennedy deployed 31,000 U.S. troops to the University of Mississippi, including the 101st Airborne Division. The military arrived on campus in the early hours of October 1, 1962, and quickly restored order, dispersing the rioters and securing the campus. The military presence remained on campus for several weeks, ensuring Meredith's safety and maintaining order.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the riot, the University of Mississippi was forced to confront the reality of racial integration. James Meredith, despite the initial resistance, was able to register for classes and attend the university, paving the way for future generations of African American students. The Ole Miss Riot of 1962 marked a significant turning point in the American Civil Rights Movement, highlighting the need for federal intervention to enforce civil rights laws in the Deep South.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 has had a lasting impact on American history, serving as a powerful symbol of the struggle for civil rights in the Deep South. The event marked a significant moment in the presidency of John F. Kennedy, who was forced to confront the reality of racial violence and take decisive action to protect the rights of African American citizens. The riot also highlighted the bravery and determination of James Meredith, who risked his life to challenge the status quo and fight for his right to an education.\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 has been remembered as a pivotal moment in the American Civil Rights Movement, marking a turning point in the struggle for racial equality and justice. The event has been commemorated in various forms, including a documentary film and a memoir by James Meredith, and continues to serve as a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle for civil rights in the United States.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 was a complex and multifaceted event, involving a range of individuals and organizations.

Jordan, who also stars in the film alongside Jonathan Majors, Tessa Thompson, Wood Harris, and Phylicia Rashad. The film is the third installment in the Creed film series and serves as a sequel to Creed II (2018). The movie follows the story of Adonis Creed as he faces a new challenge in the form of Damian Anderson, a boxer from his past.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe film begins with Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) enjoying his life as the heavyweight champion of the world. He is married to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and they have a young daughter together. However, Adonis's life is disrupted by the arrival of Damian Anderson (Jonathan Majors), a boxer from his past who has just been released from prison. Damian was a friend and fellow boxer of Adonis's during their time at a juvenile detention center, but he was sent to prison for a crime he committed to protect Adonis.\n\nDamian is determined to make a name for himself in the boxing world and challenges Adonis to a fight. Adonis is initially hesitant but eventually agrees to the fight, which sets off a chain of events that puts his marriage, his career, and his reputation at risk. As Adonis trains for the fight, he also has to confront his past and the mistakes he made as a young man.\n\nMeanwhile, Bianca is struggling to balance her music career with her responsibilities as a mother and wife. She feels overwhelmed and neglected by Adonis, who is too focused on his training to pay attention to her needs. The tension between them grows as the fight approaches, and Adonis must find a way to reconcile his personal life with his professional obligations.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Michael B.

The film's editor worked closely with Jordan to ensure that the pacing and tone of the movie were consistent with the rest of the Creed franchise.

He is best known for his involvement in the Hundred Years' War and his later conviction for the murders of numerous children. De Rais' life and crimes have been the subject of much debate and speculation, with some viewing him as a heroic military leader and others as a monstrous killer.\n\n#House of Retz\n\n##Early life\n\nGilles de Rais was born in 1404 in the castle of Champtocé-sur-Loire, in the province of Anjou, France. He was the son of Guy de Laval, Lord of Retz, and Marie de Craon, daughter of the wealthy and influential Craon family. De Rais' family was part of the nobility and held significant power and influence in the region.\n\n##Matrimonial projects\n\nIn 1418, de Rais was betrothed to Béatrice de Rohan, but the marriage was never consummated. Instead, he married Catherine de Thouars, a member of the powerful Thouars family, in 1420.

He also participated in several battles, including the Battle of Laval, where he was wounded.\n\n##Companion in arms with Joan of Arc\n\nIn 1429, de Rais met Joan of Arc, who would become a significant figure in his life.

He became increasingly focused on his personal life and his estates, which he had neglected during his military campaigns.\n\n#Squandering of heritage\n\nDe Rais' military campaigns and lavish lifestyle had taken a significant toll on his finances. He began to squander his heritage, selling off his estates and titles to fund his extravagant lifestyle.\n\n#Criminal life\n\n##Occult involvement\n\nDe Rais became involved in the occult, which was a significant aspect of his later life. He was fascinated by the supernatural and the occult arts, and he spent significant amounts of money on occult rituals and practices.\n\n##Child murders\n\nDe Rais was accused of murdering numerous children, who were often lured to his castles with promises of food and shelter. The exact number of victims is unknown, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds.\n\n##Act of force in Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte\n\nIn 1440, de Rais was accused of using force to take control of the parish of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte. He was also accused of murdering several children in the parish.\n\n##Ecclesiastical and secular investigations\n\nDe Rais was investigated by both ecclesiastical and secular authorities, who were concerned about his alleged crimes. He was eventually arrested and put on trial.\n\n##Trial and execution\n\nDe Rais was put on trial in 1440, where he was accused of numerous crimes, including murder, heresy, and sodomy. He was found guilty and executed on October 26, 1440.\n\n#Question of guilt\n\n##Doubts about the verdict in the Age of Enlightenment tradition\n\nThere have been doubts about de Rais' guilt since the Age of Enlightenment. Some have questioned the fairness of his trial and the reliability of the evidence against him.\n\n##Occultist interpretations\n\nSome occultists have interpreted de Rais' life and crimes as part of a larger occult conspiracy. They believe that he was a member of a secret society that practiced human sacrifice and other forms of occult ritual.\n\n##Georges Bataille's interpretations\n\nGeorges Bataille, a French philosopher and writer, has interpreted de Rais' life and crimes as part of a larger exploration of the human condition. He sees de Rais as a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature.\n\n##1992 mock re-trial\n\nIn 1992, a mock re-trial of de Rais was held, which found him not guilty of the crimes for which he was accused. However, this verdict is not widely accepted by historians and scholars.\n\n##Contemporary academic views\n\nMost contemporary scholars and historians accept that de Rais was guilty of the crimes for which he was accused. However, there is ongoing debate about the nature and extent of his crimes.\n\n#Fictional portraits\n\nDe Rais has been the subject of numerous fictional portraits, including in literature, film, and art. He has been portrayed as a heroic figure, a monstrous killer, and everything in between.\n\n#Psychopathological interpretations\n\n##Fin de siècle portrayals\n\nDe Rais was often portrayed as a psychopath during the fin de siècle period. He was seen as a symbol of the darker aspects of human nature.\n\n##Classification as a serial killer\n\nDe Rais is often classified as a serial killer, although this term did not exist during his lifetime. He is seen as a precursor to modern serial killers.\n\n#Gilles de Rais and the Bluebeard myth\n\nDe Rais has been linked to the Bluebeard myth, which tells the story of a man who murders his wives. De Rais' crimes have been seen as a real-life inspiration for this myth.\n\n#Relationship with Joan of Arc\n\nDe Rais' relationship with Joan of Arc is still the subject of much debate and speculation. Some see him as a loyal companion, while others see him as a manipulative figure who used her for his own gain.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of French serial killers\n* List of people executed by hanging, drawing and quartering\n* List of people executed for witchcraft\n\n#References\n\n##Notes\n\n##Footnotes\n\n##Bibliography\n\n###Historical studies and literary scholarship\n\n* Bataille, Georges.

The case involves allegations of Trump's involvement in a scheme to pay hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. Trump's prosecution is a significant development in the history of U.S. politics, marking the first time a former president has been criminally charged.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2006, adult film actress Stormy Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) allegedly had an affair with Trump, who was then a reality TV star. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election, Daniels threatened to publicly disclose the alleged affair. Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, arranged for a payment of $130,000 to be made to Daniels in exchange for her silence. The payment was made through a shell company, Essential Consultants LLC, which was set up by Cohen.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney's (DA) office launched an investigation into the payment made to Daniels. The investigation was led by DA Cyrus Vance Jr. and focused on potential violations of New York State election law. In December 2020, a grand jury was empaneled to hear evidence in the case.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nTrump's prosecution has raised questions about his eligibility to run for president in the future. Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution sets out the qualifications for the presidency, including that the president must be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. However, the Constitution does not explicitly address the issue of whether a person who has been convicted of a felony can run for president.\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Indictment and charges\n\nOn March 30, 2023, Trump was indicted by a grand jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.

He is best known as the founder and former CEO of FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, and Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm. Bankman-Fried's career has been marked by significant successes and controversies, including the collapse of FTX and subsequent charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in Palo Alto, California. He developed an interest in physics and mathematics at an early age and attended the Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California.\n\nBankman-Fried studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated in 2014. During his time at MIT, he became interested in ethics and effective altruism, a philosophy that emphasizes the use of reason and evidence to maximize the positive impact of charitable donations.\n\n#Career\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried worked as a trader at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm, from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, he left Jane Street to found Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that specialized in cryptocurrency trading. Alameda Research quickly gained success and became one of the largest cryptocurrency trading firms in the world.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. FTX quickly gained popularity and became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Bankman-Fried served as the CEO of FTX until its collapse in 2022.\n\n##Views on charity and market regulation\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for effective altruism and has pledged to donate the majority of his wealth to charitable causes. He has also been a vocal critic of market regulation, arguing that it can stifle innovation and limit economic growth.\n\nHowever, Bankman-Fried's views on market regulation have been criticized by some as being overly simplistic and naive. Critics argue that his views ignore the importance of regulation in protecting consumers and preventing market failures.\n\n##Bankruptcy of FTX\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO. The collapse of FTX was attributed to a liquidity crisis and allegations of fraud and mismanagement. The collapse of FTX resulted in billions of dollars in losses for investors and customers.\n\n#Arrest and charges\n\nIn December 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple counts of fraud and money laundering. The charges were related to the collapse of FTX and allegations that Bankman-Fried had used customer funds to finance his own trading activities.\n\n#United States v. Bankman-Fried\n\nBankman-Fried was extradited to the United States and faced trial in federal court. The trial was highly publicized and drew significant attention from the media and the public.\n\n##Trial conclusion\n\nIn August 2023, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on multiple counts of fraud and money laundering. The jury delivered a verdict after several days of deliberation.\n\n##Second trial dismissed\n\nIn September 2023, a second trial against Bankman-Fried was dismissed due to lack of evidence. The trial had been scheduled to begin in October 2023.\n\n##Appeal\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have announced plans to appeal the guilty verdict. The appeal is expected to be heard in the coming months.\n\n#Incarceration history\n\nBankman-Fried is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution in Brooklyn, New York. He is expected to be sentenced in the coming months and could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\n#Donations\n\nBankman-Fried has been a significant donor to various charitable causes, including pandemic prevention and effective altruism. However, his donations have been criticized by some as being motivated by self-interest and a desire for publicity.\n\n##Politics\n\nBankman-Fried has been a significant donor to political campaigns, including the 2020 presidential campaign of Joe Biden.\n\n###2020 and earlier\n\nBankman-Fried donated $5 million to the 2020 presidential campaign of Joe Biden. He also donated $2 million to the Democratic National Committee.\n\n###2021–2022\n\nIn 2021, Bankman-Fried donated $1 million to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He also donated $500,000 to the Senate Majority Fund.\n\n###2022 U.S. midterm elections\n\nBankman-Fried donated $10 million to the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, including $5 million to the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.\n\n##Pandemic prevention contributions and related controversy\n\nBankman-Fried has been a significant donor to pandemic prevention efforts, including a $5 million donation to the University of Oxford to support research on COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHowever, his donations have been criticized by some as being motivated by self-interest and a desire for publicity. Critics argue that Bankman-Fried's donations are not transparent and that he has not provided sufficient information about his charitable activities.\n\n##Attempts to recoup donations\n\nIn 2022, Bankman-Fried attempted to recoup donations he had made to various charitable causes. The attempts were widely criticized and sparked controversy.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBankman-Fried is known for his casual and laid-back demeanor. He has been open about his struggles with anxiety and depression and has used his platform to raise awareness about mental health issues.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic summary of Sam Bankman-Fried's life and career.

Prior to his presidency, Reagan served as the 33rd Governor of California from 1967 to 1975. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.\n\n#Early life\n\nRonald Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, to John Edward Reagan and Nelle Clyde Wilson Reagan. He was the second of two sons, with an older brother, Neil. His father was of Irish Catholic descent, while his mother was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Reagan's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Dixon, Illinois, where he spent most of his youth.\n\nReagan attended Eureka College in Illinois, where he studied economics and sociology. He was an active member of the school's drama club and developed a passion for acting. After graduating in 1932, Reagan worked as a sports announcer for a local radio station in Davenport, Iowa.\n\n#Entertainment career\n\n##Radio and film\n\nReagan's early career in radio led him to Hollywood, where he began working as an actor in the 1930s. He appeared in over 50 films, including Knute Rockne, All American (1940) and Bedtime for Bonzo (1951). Reagan's film career was interrupted by his military service during World War II.\n\n##Military service\n\nReagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve in 1937 and was called to active duty in 1942. He served in the Army Air Forces, producing training films and serving as a liaison officer. Reagan was honorably discharged in 1945 with the rank of captain.\n\n##Screen Actors Guild presidency\n\nReagan became involved in the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in the 1940s and served as its president from 1947 to 1952 and again from 1959 to 1960. He played a key role in shaping the guild's policies and advocating for actors' rights.\n\n##Marriages and children\n\nReagan married actress Jane Wyman in 1940, and they had two children, Maureen and Michael. The couple divorced in 1948. Reagan married actress Nancy Davis in 1952, and they had two children, Patricia and Ronald.\n\n##Television\n\nReagan's television career began in the 1950s, with appearances on shows such as Death Valley Days and General Electric Theater. He hosted both shows and became a familiar face on American television.\n\n#Early political activities\n\nReagan's interest in politics began in the 1940s, when he became involved in the Democratic Party. He supported Harry Truman's presidential campaign in 1948 and later became a registered Republican in 1962.\n\n##1966 California gubernatorial election\n\nReagan ran for Governor of California in 1966, defeating incumbent Pat Brown in a landslide victory. He served as governor from 1967 to 1975, advocating for conservative policies and reducing state spending.\n\n#California governorship (1967–1975)\n\nAs governor, Reagan implemented several key policies, including reducing the state's budget and increasing funding for law enforcement. He also played a key role in shaping the state's response to the 1960s counterculture movement.\n\n#Seeking the presidency (1975–1981)\n\nReagan announced his candidacy for President of the United States in 1975, but lost the Republican nomination to Gerald Ford. He ran again in 1980 and won the nomination, going on to defeat incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the general election.\n\n##1976 Republican primaries\n\nReagan's 1976 presidential campaign was marked by a series of debates with Ford, which helped to establish him as a national figure. Although he lost the nomination, Reagan's campaign laid the groundwork for his future presidential bids.\n\n##1980 election\n\nReagan's 1980 presidential campaign focused on themes of economic growth and national security. He won the election in a landslide, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes.\n\n#Presidency (1981–1989)\n\n##First inauguration\n\nReagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981, marked a new era in American politics. He outlined his vision for the country in a speech that emphasized individual freedom and limited government.\n\n##\"Reaganomics\" and the economy\n\nReagan's economic policies, known as \"Reaganomics,\" focused on reducing government spending, cutting taxes, and promoting free trade. The policies led to a period of economic growth, but also increased the national debt.\n\n###Taxation\n\nReagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) in 1981, which reduced marginal tax rates and increased deductions. He also signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which further reduced tax rates and eliminated many tax deductions.\n\n###Inflation and unemployment\n\nReagan's policies led to a decline in inflation, which had risen to 14.8% in 1980. Unemployment rates also fell, from 7.5% in 1980 to 5.3% in 1988.\n\n###Government spending\n\nReagan's policies led to an increase in government spending, particularly on defense. He also increased spending on social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\n###Deregulation\n\nReagan's administration implemented a series of deregulatory measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed parts of the Glass-Steagall Act.\n\n###Deficits\n\nReagan's policies led to an increase in the national debt, from $994 billion in 1980 to $2.1 trillion in 1988. The deficits were largely due to the combination of tax cuts and increased government spending.\n\n##Assassination attempt\n\nOn March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Reagan survived the attack, but his press secretary, James Brady, was seriously injured.\n\n##Supreme Court appointments\n\nReagan appointed two Supreme Court justices, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia. He also nominated Robert Bork, but Bork's nomination was rejected by the Senate.\n\n##Public sector labor union fights\n\nReagan's administration clashed with public sector labor unions, particularly the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO).

It is one of the oldest human technologies, with evidence of pottery dating back to around 9000 BC. Pottery has been used for a wide range of purposes, including cooking, storing, and serving food and drinks, as well as creating decorative and ceremonial objects.\n\n# Main types\n\n## Earthenware\n\nEarthenware is a type of pottery that is fired at a relatively low temperature, typically between 1000°C and 1150°C. It is often made from clay that is rich in iron oxide, which gives it a reddish-brown color. Earthenware is porous and prone to cracking, but it is also relatively inexpensive and easy to produce. It is often used for creating functional items such as plates, bowls, and cups, as well as decorative items like vases and figurines.\n\n## Stoneware\n\nStoneware is a type of pottery that is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware, typically between 1150°C and 1300°C. It is made from clay that is more dense and less porous than earthenware, which makes it stronger and more durable. Stoneware is often glazed to create a waterproof surface, and it is commonly used for creating functional items like cups, bowls, and plates, as well as decorative items like vases and sculptures.\n\n## Porcelain\n\nPorcelain is a type of pottery that is fired at an even higher temperature than stoneware, typically between 1250°C and 1400°C. It is made from a specific type of clay called kaolin, which is rich in silica and alumina. Porcelain is translucent, strong, and durable, and it is often used for creating delicate and intricate decorative items like figurines, vases, and tea sets.\n\n# Archaeology\n\n## Fabric analysis\n\nFabric analysis is a technique used by archaeologists to study the composition and structure of pottery. It involves examining the clay body and any inclusions, such as sand or stones, to determine the type of clay used and the firing conditions. This information can be used to date the pottery and determine its origin.\n\n# Clay bodies and raw materials\n\nClay is the primary material used in pottery, and it is often mixed with other materials to create a workable clay body. The type of clay used can affect the color, texture, and strength of the final product. Other raw materials used in pottery include silica, alumina, and feldspar, which are often used to create glazes and other surface decorations.\n\n# Production\n\n## Shaping\n\nShaping is the process of creating the desired form and shape of the pottery. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including hand-building, throwing on a potter's wheel, and slip-casting. The type of shaping technique used will depend on the type of pottery being created and the desired level of detail and precision.\n\n## Drying\n\nDrying is an important step in the pottery-making process, as it allows the clay to shrink and harden before firing. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including air-drying, using a drying rack, or covering the pottery with a damp cloth. The drying process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days, depending on the thickness of the clay and the ambient temperature and humidity.\n\n## Firing\n\n### Temperature\n\nThe firing temperature will depend on the type of pottery being created and the desired level of hardness and durability. Earthenware is typically fired at a relatively low temperature, while stoneware and porcelain are fired at higher temperatures.\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nThe firing atmosphere can also affect the final product, with different atmospheres producing different colors and textures. For example, a reducing atmosphere can produce a range of colors from pink to purple, while an oxidizing atmosphere can produce a range of colors from yellow to green.\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several different firing methods used in pottery, including electric kilns, gas kilns, and raku kilns. Each type of kiln has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of kiln will depend on the type of pottery being created and the desired level of control and precision.\n\n### Stages\n\nThe firing process typically involves several stages, including bisque firing, glaze firing, and reduction firing. Bisque firing is the initial firing stage, which involves firing the pottery at a low temperature to remove excess moisture and create a hard, brittle surface. Glaze firing involves applying a glaze to the pottery and firing it at a higher temperature to melt and set the glaze. Reduction firing involves firing the pottery in a reducing atmosphere to produce a range of colors and textures.\n\n## Decorating\n\n### Methods\n\nThere are several different decorating methods used in pottery, including hand-painting, slip-trailing, and stenciling. The type of decorating method used will depend on the type of pottery being created and the desired level of detail and precision.\n\n## Glazing\n\nGlazing is the process of applying a layer of glaze to the pottery to create a waterproof surface. Glazes can be clear or colored, and they can be applied using a variety of techniques, including brushing, pouring, and spraying.\n\n## Health and environmental issues\n\nPottery can pose several health and environmental risks, including exposure to toxic materials like lead and cadmium. It is also important to ensure that the pottery is fired at a high enough temperature to kill off any bacteria or other microorganisms that may be present.\n\n# History\n\n## Early pottery\n\nThe earliest evidence of pottery dates back to around 9000 BC, with the discovery of pottery fragments in the ancient settlement of Xianrendong in China. Pottery was initially used for creating functional items like bowls and cups, but it soon became a popular form of decorative art.\n\n## History by region\n\n### Beginnings of pottery\n\nThe beginnings of pottery varied by region, with different cultures developing their own unique styles and techniques. In Africa, pottery was first developed around 7000 BC, while in Europe it was first developed around 5000 BC.\n\n### East Asia\n\nIn East Asia, pottery was first developed in China around 9000 BC.

It is estimated that between 20% to 30% of the Roman Empire's population were slaves, with the number of slaves increasing significantly during the late Republic and early Empire periods. Slaves were obtained through various means, including war, piracy, debt, and self-sale. They were used for a variety of purposes, including household chores, agriculture, mining, and entertainment.\n\n# Origins\n\nSlavery in ancient Rome had its roots in the early Roman Republic. The first slaves were likely prisoners of war, who were captured during the Roman conquest of Italy. As the Roman Empire expanded, the number of slaves increased, and they became an essential part of the Roman economy.\n\n## Enslavement of Roman Citizens\n\nAlthough rare, Roman citizens could be enslaved under certain circumstances. This could happen if a citizen was captured by enemies and sold into slavery, or if they were convicted of certain crimes, such as treason or desertion. Additionally, a Roman citizen could be enslaved if they were unable to pay their debts.\n\n# The Slave in Roman Law and Society\n\nRoman law recognized slaves as property, rather than as human beings with rights. Slaves were considered to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy, below even the lowest classes of free citizens.\n\n## Marriage and Family\n\nSlaves were not allowed to form legitimate marriages, and any children they had were considered to be the property of their owner. However, slaves were often allowed to form de facto relationships, and some owners even recognized these relationships by providing slaves with their own living quarters or allowing them to have children.\n\n## Peculium\n\nSlaves were allowed to own a limited amount of property, known as peculium, which was usually earned through their own labor or given to them by their owner. This property could include money, clothing, or other personal items.\n\n## Manumission\n\nSlaves could be freed by their owners through a process known as manumission. This could be done for a variety of reasons, including as a reward for good service or as a way to gain favor with the gods. Freed slaves, known as freedmen, were considered to be part of the Roman citizenry and were entitled to many of the same rights and privileges as other citizens.\n\n## Freedmen\n\nFreedmen were often stigmatized by society and were considered to be inferior to freeborn citizens. However, they were still considered to be part of the Roman citizenry and were entitled to many of the same rights and privileges as other citizens.\n\n## Dediticii\n\nDediticii were slaves who had been freed by their owners but were still required to provide labor or services to their former owners. This was often the case for slaves who had been freed through manumission but were still required to provide labor or services to their former owners.\n\n# Causes of Enslavement\n\nSlaves were obtained through a variety of means, including war, piracy, debt, and self-sale.\n\n## War Captives\n\nWar captives were one of the primary sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Prisoners of war were often sold into slavery, and this was a major source of income for many Roman soldiers.\n\n### Captivi in Roman Culture\n\nWar captives were often paraded through the streets of Rome as a symbol of Roman military power. They were also often used as sacrifices to the gods or as entertainment in the arena.\n\n## Piracy and Kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also major sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Pirates would often raid coastal towns and villages, capturing people and selling them into slavery.\n\n## Vernae\n\nVernae were slaves who were born into slavery, often to slave parents. They were considered to be part of the slave household and were often treated as such.\n\n### Alumni\n\nAlumni were slave", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term encompasses a wide range of film genres, styles, and periods, and is characterized by a focus on women's experiences, perspectives, and stories.\n\nFamous women in film history\n-----------------------------\n\n### Silent films\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a significant role in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera. Actresses like Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, and Clara Bow were among the most popular stars of the time, while women like Alice Guy-Blaché and Lois Weber worked as directors, producers, and screenwriters.\n\n### Classical Hollywood\n\nIn the classical Hollywood period, women's roles in the film industry were largely limited to acting. However, a few women, like Dorothy Arzner and Ida Lupino, managed to break into directing and producing. Arzner, in particular, is notable for being the first woman to direct a sound film, with her 1927 film \"The Wild Party\".\n\n### Experimental and avant-garde cinema\n\nThe experimental and avant-garde film movements of the 1960s and 1970s provided a platform for women to experiment with new forms and styles of filmmaking. Women like Maya Deren, Shirley Clarke, and Carolee Schneemann created innovative and influential films that challenged traditional narrative structures and explored new ways of representing the female experience.\n\nImpact on society\n------------------\n\n### Impact of second-wave feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a significant impact on women's cinema, as women began to demand greater representation and equality in the film industry. Films like \"A Woman Under the Influence\" (1974) and \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\" (1975) reflected the changing roles and expectations of women in society.\n\n### Representing sexuality\n\nWomen's cinema has often been at the forefront of representing female sexuality and desire on screen. Films like \"Daughters of Darkness\" (1971) and \"In the Realm of the Senses\" (1976) explored themes of female eroticism and desire, challenging traditional notions of female sexuality.\n\n### Fear of entering cinematography\n\nDespite the progress made by women in the film industry, many women still face barriers and biases when trying to enter the field. A lack of representation and opportunities, combined with a fear of being marginalized or stereotyped, can discourage women from pursuing careers in cinematography.\n\n### Statistics\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, women made up only 12% of directors working on the 100 top-grossing films of 2019. This lack of representation is reflected in the types of stories and characters that are represented on screen.\n\n### Documentaries\n\nDocumentary films have provided a platform for women to tell their own stories and share their experiences. Films like \"The Act of Killing\" (2012) and \"The Look of Silence\" (2014) have explored themes of female empowerment and resistance.\n\n### Female filmmakers as feminists\n\nMany female filmmakers identify as feminists, and see their work as a way to challenge patriarchal structures and promote social change. Filmmakers like Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler have used their platforms to highlight issues of racial and social justice.\n\n### Celluloid ceiling\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the barriers and biases that women face in the film industry, particularly when it comes to advancing to positions of power and influence. Despite the progress made by women in recent years, the celluloid ceiling remains a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nNorth America\n-------------\n\n### Canada\n\nCanada has a thriving film industry, with a number of women playing key roles in front of and behind the camera. Filmmakers like Deepa Mehta and Sarah Polley have gained international recognition for their work.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Hollywood\n\nHollywood has long been dominated by men, but women have made significant inroads in recent years. Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and Sofia Coppola have won major awards for their work, and women like Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler have become household names.\n\n#### Silent era\n\nDuring the silent era, women played a significant role in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera.

Bigelow's 1991 film \"Point Break\" was a major success, and Coppola's 1999 film \"The Virgin Suicides\" earned her critical acclaim.\n\n#### 2000s-present\n\nIn recent years, women like Ava DuVernay and Ryan Coogler have become household names, thanks to their work on films like \"Selma\" (2014) and \"Black Panther\" (2018).

The conflict has its roots in the country's complex history, with Ukraine declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The war has resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and economic hardship for Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence on August 24, 1991. The country's early years were marked by economic struggles and political instability. In 2004, the Orange Revolution took place, with widespread protests against the government's corruption and electoral fraud. The revolution led to the election of Viktor Yushchenko as president, who sought to align Ukraine with Western Europe.\n\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, mass protests broke out in Kiev's Independence Square, known as Euromaidan, against the government's decision to abandon an association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. The protests, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity, led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. However, the revolution was met with resistance from pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine, who felt that the new government was illegitimate.\n\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nIn 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed a treaty allowing Russia to maintain a naval base in Crimea, which was part of Ukraine. The treaty was set to expire in 2017, but in 2010, Ukraine extended the lease until 2042. However, the presence of Russian military bases in Crimea was a source of tension between the two countries.\n\n##Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe legality of the conflict is disputed. Ukraine has consistently maintained that Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine constitute an act of aggression and a violation of its sovereignty. Russia, on the other hand, claims that its actions are aimed at protecting the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine. The conflict has not been formally declared a war, but it has resulted in significant military action and loss of life.\n\n#History\n\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn February 2014, following the ousting of President Yanukovych, Russian troops began to move into Crimea. The troops, who were initially without insignia, took control of key infrastructure and government buildings. On March 16, 2014, a referendum was held in which the majority of Crimeans voted to join Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine has never recognized it.\n\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn the spring of 2014, pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donbas region, began to organize protests and take control of government buildings. The protests were met with resistance from Ukrainian security forces, leading to violent clashes.\n\n###Armed conflict\n\nIn April 2014, the conflict escalated into an armed conflict, with the formation of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The conflict resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of people.\n\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops entered eastern Ukraine, leading to a significant escalation of the conflict. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine has consistently maintained that it was an act of aggression.\n\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian forces launched an offensive against the DPR and LPR, leading to the capture of the city of Mariupol. However, the offensive was met with resistance, and a ceasefire was agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus.\n\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe conflict continued throughout 2014, with both sides suffering significant losses. In February 2015, a new ceasefire agreement was signed in Minsk, which included the withdrawal of heavy artillery and the establishment of a buffer zone.\n\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a confrontation took place in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. Ukrainian naval vessels were attempting to pass through the strait, but were intercepted by Russian ships. The incident resulted in the capture of Ukrainian sailors and the imposition of martial law in Ukraine.\n\n###2019–2020\n\nThe conflict continued throughout 2019 and 2020, with both sides suffering losses. In 2020, Ukraine and Russia agreed to a new ceasefire, which included the exchange of prisoners and the establishment of a new buffer zone.\n\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russo-Ukrainian_War\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n##Legality and declaration of war\n#History\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n###Armed conflict\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n###2019–2020\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n###Prelude\n###Escalation\n###Full-scale invasion\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n#Human rights violations\n#Related issues\n##Spillover\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n##Hybrid warfare\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n##Russia–NATO relations\n#Reactions\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n###Ukrainian response\n###NATO and United States military response\n###Financial markets\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n###United States\n###Russian military suppliers\n###United Nations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his science fiction novels and short stories, which explored themes of advanced technology, space exploration, and social commentary. Griffith's writing career spanned over two decades, during which he produced numerous works that captivated readers with their imaginative and often prophetic visions of the future.\n\nBiography\n==========\n\n### Early life\n\nGeorge Griffith was born on June 4, 1857, in Plymouth, Devon, England. His early life is not well-documented, but it is known that he came from a modest background and was educated at a local school. Griffith's interest in literature and writing developed at an early age, and he began writing stories and poetry as a teenager.\n\n### Teaching career\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Griffith worked as a teacher. He taught at several schools in the Plymouth area, where he developed his skills as a communicator and storyteller. Griffith's experience as a teacher likely influenced his writing style, which often featured clear and concise prose.\n\n### Writing career\n\n#### Early career\n\nGriffith's writing career began in the late 1880s, when he started contributing articles and stories to various magazines and journals. His early work was largely focused on literary criticism and reviews, but he soon began to experiment with science fiction and fantasy. Griffith's first published science fiction story, \"The Angel of the Revolution,\" appeared in 1893 and caught the attention of readers with its imaginative and futuristic themes.\n\n#### Breakthrough\n\nGriffith's breakthrough novel, \"The Outlaws of the Air,\" was published in 1895 and became a major success. The book told the story of a group of rebels who use advanced technology to challenge the authority of a corrupt government. \"The Outlaws of the Air\" was praised for its originality and vision, and it established Griffith as a leading figure in the science fiction genre.\n\n#### Mid-1890s\n\nDuring the mid-1890s, Griffith continued to produce innovative and thought-provoking science fiction novels and short stories. His works from this period, such as \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895) and \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1897), explored themes of advanced technology, space exploration, and social commentary. Griffith's writing was characterized by its imaginative and often prophetic visions of the future, and he became known for his ability to predict technological advancements and social trends.\n\n#### Decline\n\nBy the late 1890s, Griffith's popularity began to decline. He continued to write, but his work was no longer as widely read or influential as it had been during the mid-1890s. Griffith's decline was likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in literary fashion and the rise of new science fiction writers.\n\n#### Final years\n\nGriffith's final years were marked by personal and financial struggles. He continued to write, but his work was largely ignored by the literary establishment. Griffith died on June 9, 1906, at the age of 49, and was largely forgotten by the literary world.\n\n### Death\n\nGriffith died on June 9, 1906, at his home in London. The cause of his death was not reported, but it is believed to have been due to a combination of illness and personal struggles.\n\nLegacy\n=======\n\n### Place in science fiction history\n\nGeorge Griffith is widely regarded as one of the most important science fiction writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His innovative and imaginative works explored themes of advanced technology, space exploration, and social commentary, and he is credited with helping to establish science fiction as a major literary genre.\n\n### Literary proficiency\n\nGriffith's writing style was characterized by its clarity, concision, and imagination. He was a master of the science fiction genre, and his works continue to be read and studied by scholars and enthusiasts today.\n\n### In relation to H. G. Wells\n\nGriffith is often compared to H. G. Wells, another prominent science fiction writer of the period. While both authors explored similar themes and ideas, Griffith's work was often more imaginative and prophetic. Griffith's writing style was also more concise and accessible than Wells', and he is credited with helping to popularize science fiction among a wider audience.\n\nPersonal views\n==============\n\n### Religion\n\nGriffith's religious views are not well-documented, but it is believed that he was an agnostic or atheist. His writing often explored themes of social commentary and critique, and he was critical of organized religion.\n\n### Politics\n\nGriffith's politics were largely liberal and progressive. He was a strong advocate for social justice and equality, and his writing often explored themes of social commentary and critique.\n\n### Social matters\n\nGriffith was a strong advocate for social reform and justice. He was critical of poverty, inequality, and social injustice, and his writing often explored themes of social commentary and critique.\n\nPublications\n============\n\n### Poetry collections\n\n* \"The Poems of George Griffith\" (1891)\n\n### Novels\n\n* \"The Angel of the Revolution\" (1893)\n* \"The Outlaws of the Air\" (1895)\n* \"Valdar the Oft-Born\" (1895)\n* \"The World Peril of 1910\" (1897)\n* \"A Criminal Croesus\" (1899)\n* \"The Lake of Gold\" (1900)\n\n### Short stories\n\n* \"The Great Pirate Syndicate\" (1891)\n* \"The Raid of Le Vengeur\" (1892)\n* \"The Pirate's Lair\" (1893)\n\n### Short story collections\n\n* \"The Chronicles of a Pirate\" (1893)\n* \"The Stories of George Griffith\" (1901)\n\n### Non-fiction books\n\n* \"The World of Tomorrow\" (1896)\n* \"The Science of the Future\" (1898)\n\nExplanatory notes\n================\n\nThis article is based on available sources and research.

The film is a sequel to the 2018 film Black Panther and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The movie follows the nation of Wakanda as they navigate the loss of their king, T'Challa, and face new threats to their nation's security and future.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place after the events of Avengers: Endgame, in which T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, has died. The nation is in mourning, and his sister, Shuri, is struggling to come to terms with the loss. Meanwhile, the world is also dealing with the aftermath of the Snap, and the consequences of the Blip are still being felt. As Wakanda tries to move forward, a new threat emerges in the form of Namor, the king of the underwater nation of Talokan.\n\nNamor is determined to protect his people and his nation from the surface world, which he believes is a threat to their existence. He is also driven by a desire for revenge against the surface world for the harm it has inflicted on his people.

The film is a fictionalized account of the life of Marilyn Monroe, played by Ana de Armas, and explores her struggles with fame, identity, and mental health.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film is presented in a non-linear fashion, jumping back and forth in time to explore different periods of Monroe's life. The story begins with Monroe's childhood, where she is shown to be a vulnerable and sensitive girl, often struggling to cope with the emotional abuse she suffers at the hands of her mother. As she grows older, Monroe becomes increasingly obsessed with the idea of becoming a movie star, and she eventually lands a contract with a major film studio.\n\nAs Monroe's career takes off, she finds herself struggling to cope with the pressures of fame and the constant scrutiny she faces from the public and the media. She becomes increasingly dependent on prescription medication and begins to experience mental health issues, including anxiety and depression.\n\nThroughout the film, Monroe's relationships with various men are explored, including her marriages to Joe DiMaggio and Arthur Miller. The film also delves into her rumored affair with President John F. Kennedy, which is portrayed as a complex and emotionally fraught relationship.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe\n* Adrien Brody as Arthur Miller\n* Bobby Cannavale as Joe DiMaggio\n* Xavier Samuel as Cass Chaplin\n* Julianne Nicholson as Gladys Pearl Baker\n* Evan Williams as Edward G.

However, after reading Joyce Carol Oates' novel \"Blonde\", Dominik became fascinated with the idea of adapting it for the screen. He spent several years working on the script, pouring over research and conducting interviews with people who knew Monroe.\n\nDominik has stated that he was drawn to Oates' novel because of its unique and nuanced portrayal of Monroe, which he felt was more accurate than other biographies and films about the actress. He also appreciated the novel's non-linear structure, which allowed him to experiment with unconventional storytelling techniques.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production on \"Blonde\" began in 2019, with Dominik assembling a team of collaborators, including cinematographer Chayse Irvin and production designer Anthony Gasparro. The film's budget was reportedly around $22 million, which is relatively modest compared to other biopics.\n\n## Casting\n\nAna de Armas was cast as Marilyn Monroe in 2019, after a lengthy auditioning process. Dominik has stated that he was impressed by de Armas' range and vulnerability, and felt that she had the perfect combination of talent and charisma to bring Monroe to life.\n\nThe rest of the cast was assembled over the next several months, with Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale signing on to play Arthur Miller and Joe DiMaggio, respectively.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on \"Blonde\" began in August 2019 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, New York City, and other locations, with a mix of practical and studio sets.\n\nDominik has stated that he used a combination of digital and film cameras to capture the film's distinctive look, which is characterized by a dreamlike, nostalgic quality.\n\n## Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, who have collaborated with Dominik on several previous projects. The score features a mix of original music and period-specific songs, including several of Monroe's famous recordings.\n\n# Release\n\n\"Blonde\" premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. The film was later released in the United States on September 28, 2022, where it received a limited release in several major cities.\n\n## Critical response\n\n\"Blonde\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Ana de Armas' performance as Marilyn Monroe. The film holds a 74% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 122 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nHowever, not all reviews were positive, with some critics finding the film's pacing and tone to be uneven. The film also received criticism for its depiction of Monroe's mental health struggles, with some viewers feeling that it was sensationalized or exploitative.\n\n## Industry reception\n\n\"Blonde\" received several awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe nomination for Ana de Armas' performance. The film was also named one of the best films of 2022 by several publications, including The New York Times and Rolling Stone.\n\n## Cast\n\nAna de Armas' performance as Marilyn Monroe was widely praised, with many critics noting that she brought a new level of depth and nuance to the role. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale also received praise for their supporting performances.\n\n## NC-17 rating\n\n\"Blonde\" received an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), due to its explicit content, including nudity and graphic sex scenes. The rating was seen as a major coup for the film, which was released unrated in several countries.\n\n## Criticism about depiction of abortion\n\n\"Blonde\" received criticism from some viewers who felt that its depiction of Marilyn Monroe's abortion was gratuitous or exploitative. The film's director, Andrew Dominik, responded to the criticism, stating that he had intended to portray the experience in a realistic and non-judgmental way.\n\n## Accolades\n\n* Golden Globe nomination for Ana de Armas' performance\n* National Board of Review Award for Best Actress (Ana de Armas)\n* Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Cinematography (Chayse Irvin)\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award nomination for Best Actress (Ana de Armas)\n\n# See also\n\n* Marilyn Monroe\n* Joyce Carol Oates\n* Andrew Dominik\n* Ana de Armas\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Blonde at IMDb\n* Blonde at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Blonde at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Blonde_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Industry reception\n##Cast\n##NC-17 rating\n##Criticism about depiction of abortion\n##Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
