Bonin's crimes, which involved the abduction, rape, and murder of numerous young men and boys, shocked the nation and led to widespread outrage and fear.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Childhood\n\nWilliam Bonin was born on January 8, 1947, in Willimantic, Connecticut, to Alice and Robert Bonin. His early life was marked by instability and neglect. His father was a violent and abusive man who frequently beat his wife and children. Bonin's parents eventually divorced, and he was shuffled between various foster homes and institutions.\n\n## Adolescence\n\nAs a teenager, Bonin exhibited signs of behavioral problems and was arrested several times for minor offenses. He attended various schools, but his poor academic performance and disciplinary issues led to his eventual expulsion. Bonin's adolescence was also marked by a growing interest in sex and an escalating pattern of deviant behavior.\n\n## Engagement and U.S. Air Force\n\nIn 1965, Bonin enlisted in the United States Air Force, where he served for four years. During his time in the military, Bonin was stationed in various locations, including Vietnam. He was honorably discharged in 1969, but his military service did little to stabilize his life or curb his deviant tendencies.\n\n# First convictions\n\nBonin's first serious run-in with the law occurred in 1968, when he was arrested for molesting a young boy. He pleaded guilty to child molestation and was sentenced to a year in prison. After his release, Bonin continued to engage in deviant behavior, and in 1971, he was arrested again for assaulting a 14-year-old boy. Bonin was sentenced to three years in prison for this offense.\n\n# Incarceration at Atascadero and Vacaville prison\n\n## Further offenses and imprisonment\n\nBonin spent several years in various California prisons, including Atascadero State Hospital and Vacaville Prison. During his incarceration, Bonin was diagnosed as a sex offender and underwent treatment. However, his therapy was ultimately unsuccessful, and he continued to exhibit deviant behavior.\n\n# Release\n\nAfter serving several years in prison, Bonin was released in 1978. He settled in Los Angeles and began to rebuild his life. However, his freedom was short-lived, as Bonin soon resumed his pattern of deviant behavior.\n\n## Acquaintance with Vernon Butts and Gregory Miley\n\nIn the late 1970s, Bonin befriended Vernon Butts, a convicted sex offender, and Gregory Miley, a young man with a troubled past. The three men began to socialize regularly, and their friendship would eventually play a central role in the events that unfolded.\n\n# Murders\n\n## 1979\n\n### May\n\nBonin's first known victim was a 17-year-old boy named Marcus Grabs, who was abducted on May 28, 1979.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The shortage had significant effects on families with infants, leading to increased costs, hospitalizations, and changes in feeding practices.\n\n# Causes\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration.\n\n## Supply chain issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global supply chains, leading to shortages and delays in the production and distribution of many goods, including infant formula. The pandemic led to increased demand for infant formula, as well as shortages of key ingredients and packaging materials. Additionally, the pandemic caused labor shortages and transportation delays, further exacerbating the shortage.\n\n## Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Laboratories, one of the largest manufacturers of infant formula in the United States, issued a recall of its Similac brand formula due to concerns about contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that can cause serious illness in infants. The recall led to a shutdown of Abbott's Sturgis, Michigan plant, which was responsible for producing a significant portion of the company's infant formula.\n\n### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nThe shutdown of the Sturgis plant was not only due to the recall, but also due to alleged problems with the plant's safety and sanitation protocols. An investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that the plant had a history of safety and sanitation issues, including the presence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the environment and on equipment. The investigation also found that the plant had inadequate controls in place to prevent contamination and that employees had not received adequate training on safety and sanitation procedures.\n\n## Import restrictions\n\nThe United States has strict regulations and tariffs on the importation of infant formula, which limited the ability of foreign manufacturers to increase exports to the United States during the shortage. Additionally, the FDA has strict guidelines for the approval of new infant formula products, which made it difficult for new manufacturers to enter the market.\n\n## Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with three companies - Abbott, Reckitt Benckiser, and Nestle - controlling over 90% of the market. This concentration limited the ability of other manufacturers to increase production and meet demand during the shortage.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage had significant effects on families with infants, including increased costs, hospitalizations, and changes in feeding practices.\n\n## Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk, as families sought alternative sources of nutrition for their infants. However, the sale of breast milk is not regulated in the United States, and there are concerns about the safety and quality of breast milk obtained through informal channels.\n\n## Use of alternative foods\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the use of alternative foods, such as cow's milk and goat's milk, which are not nutritionally equivalent to infant formula. This led to concerns about the nutritional adequacy of these alternatives and the potential for adverse health effects.\n\n## Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in hospitalizations due to malnutrition and dehydration in infants. This was particularly true for vulnerable populations, such as premature infants and infants with medical conditions.\n\n## Bot usage\n\nThe shortage led to an increase in the use of bots to buy up infant formula, which further exacerbated the shortage. These bots, also known as \"scalper bots,\" are computer programs that quickly purchase large quantities of formula, often at inflated prices.\n\n## Shortage in Canada\n\nThe shortage also affected Canada, where many families rely on cross-border shopping to purchase infant formula. The shortage led to increased costs and reduced availability of formula in Canada.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage led to a range of responses from government agencies, manufacturers, and advocacy groups.\n\n## Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nSeveral states and cities implemented price gouging laws to prevent retailers from charging exorbitant prices for infant formula. Additionally, some manufacturers implemented price controls to prevent price gouging.\n\n## Efforts to increase supply\n\nManufacturers increased production to meet demand, and some companies air-shipped formula from other countries to increase supply.\n\n## Efforts to restore production\n\nAbbott Laboratories worked to restore production at its Sturgis plant, including implementing new safety and sanitation protocols and retraining employees.\n\n## Investigations\n\nSeveral investigations were launched to examine the causes of the shortage and the response of government agencies and manufacturers.\n\n### Congressional investigation\n\nThe House Oversight and Reform Committee launched an investigation into the shortage, including the role of manufacturers and government agencies.\n\n### FDA investigation\n\nThe FDA launched an investigation into the safety and sanitation protocols at the Sturgis plant, as well as the agency's own response to the shortage.\n\n### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News launched an investigation into the shortage, including the role of price gouging and the use of bots to buy up formula.\n\n### DOJ investigation\n\nThe Department of Justice launched an investigation into potential price fixing and market manipulation by manufacturers.\n\n# Commentary\n\nThe 2022 United States infant formula shortage led to a range of commentary and debate about the causes of the shortage and the response of government agencies and manufacturers.\n\n## Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe shortage reignited the debate about the relative merits of breast milk and formula, with some advocates arguing that breast milk is the best option for infants and others arguing that formula is a necessary and safe alternative.\n\n## Criticism of federal response\n\nThe federal response to the shortage was criticized by some advocates, who argued that the government did not do enough to prevent the shortage or respond to its effects.\n\n### White House response\n\nThe White House was criticized for its response to the shortage, including the decision to invoke the Defense Production Act to increase production of formula.\n\n### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe shortage also raised questions about the availability of formula at the Southern border, where many migrant families rely on formula to feed their infants.\n\n# See also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* Cronobacter sakazakii\n* Food and Drug Administration\n* Defense Production Act", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis began on July 26, 2023, when a group of military officers seized power and overthrew the democratically elected government of President Mohamed Bazoum. The crisis has led to widespread instability, violence, and humanitarian concerns in the country.\n\n# Background\n\n## ECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional economic community of 15 West African countries, including Niger. ECOWAS has been actively involved in the crisis, condemning the coup and calling for the restoration of democratic order in Niger. The organization has also imposed sanctions on the military junta and has been working to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\n\n## Security Situation\n\nNiger has faced significant security challenges in recent years, including the threat of terrorism and armed groups in the Sahel region.

Born in 1910, Young began his swimming career at a young age and quickly made a name for himself in the swimming community. This article provides an overview of Young's early swimming achievements, his notable swims, and his inconsistent yet illustrious career.\n\n# Early swimming achievements\n\nYoung's swimming career began to take shape in the 1920s, during which he trained extensively in the waters of Lake Ontario. His early swimming achievements laid the foundation for his future success, and he quickly became known for his endurance and technique.\n\n## Catalina swim training\n\nIn 1927, Young traveled to Catalina Island, California, to train for the Catalina Channel swim. Under the guidance of renowned swim coach, Captain Matthew R. Webb, Young honed his skills and built up his endurance in preparation for the challenging swim ahead. The training proved invaluable, as Young went on to complete the Catalina Channel swim in record time.\n\n# Catalina channel swim\n\nThe Catalina Channel swim was a major milestone in Young's career, and it cemented his position as a leading figure in the world of long-distance swimming.\n\n## Swam with tides\n\nYoung's swim across the Catalina Channel was notable for the fact that he swam with the tides, which significantly aided his progress. By swimming with the tides, Young was able to conserve energy and complete the swim in a shorter time.\n\n## Competition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's achievement in the Catalina Channel swim was not without competition, however. Norman Ross, an American swimmer, also attempted the swim around the same time, and the two men engaged in a heated rivalry. Despite the competition, Young emerged victorious, completing the swim in a record time.\n\n## Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nYoung's success in the Catalina Channel swim brought him widespread public acclaim, but it did not translate into significant financial gain. While he received some prize money and endorsement deals, Young struggled to capitalize on his fame and secure a stable financial future.\n\n# Inconsistent swimming career\n\nDespite his early success, Young's swimming career was marked by inconsistency. He experienced periods of triumph and defeat, and his performances varied greatly from one swim to another.\n\n## 1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young competed in the 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim, which he completed in a respectable time. However, his performance was not without incident, as he experienced difficulties with the water conditions and struggled to maintain his pace.\n\n## 1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young competed in the 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim, which he failed to complete. Despite his best efforts, Young was forced to abandon the swim due to exhaustion and harsh water conditions.\n\n## Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young won the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 20-mile swim that took him along the St. Lawrence River. The victory marked a welcome return to form for Young, who had struggled in previous swims.\n\n## 1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young competed in the 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, which he completed in a respectable time. However, his performance was overshadowed by the achievements of other swimmers, who completed the swim in faster times.\n\n## 1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young again competed in the 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, but he failed to improve on his previous time. Despite his best efforts, Young struggled to regain his former glory and was forced to accept a lower placing.\n\n## Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young won the Lake Ontario swim, a 20-mile event that took him along the shores of the lake. The victory marked a welcome return to form for Young, who had struggled in previous years.\n\n## Late swim career\n\nYoung's late swim career was marked by a decline in his performances. Despite his best efforts, he struggled to regain his former glory and was eventually forced to retire from competitive swimming.\n\n# Swim retirement and marriage\n\nYoung retired from competitive swimming in the mid-1930s, after a career marked by both triumph and defeat.\n\n## Marriages\n\nYoung married twice, first to a woman named Margaret, with whom he had two children, and then to a woman named Elizabeth, with whom he had one child. Despite his retirement from swimming, Young remained active in the sport, coaching and mentoring younger swimmers.\n\n# Late professional life\n\nAfter his retirement from swimming, Young went on to pursue a successful career in business. He worked as a sales representative for a major company and eventually became a successful entrepreneur, starting his own business and employing several people.\n\n# Honors\n\nYoung received several honors and awards for his contributions to the sport of swimming. He was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1955 and received a lifetime achievement award from the Canadian Swimming Coaches Association in 1970.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of long-distance swimmers\n* Catalina Channel swim\n* Lake Ontario swim\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The acquisition was announced on April 25, 2022, and was completed on October 27, 2022, after a series of twists and turns.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Background\n\nTwitter, Inc. is a social media platform that allows users to share short messages, known as \"tweets,\" with their followers. The company was founded in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. Twitter quickly gained popularity and became one of the most widely used social media platforms in the world.\n\nElon Musk, a successful entrepreneur and business magnate, has been an active user of Twitter since 2010. Musk has used the platform to share his thoughts on various topics, including science, technology, and politics. In recent years, Musk has become increasingly critical of Twitter's content moderation policies, which he believes stifle free speech.\n\n## Early developments\n\nIn January 2022, Musk began purchasing shares of Twitter, Inc. stock, eventually acquiring a 9.2% stake in the company. Musk's investment in Twitter sparked speculation that he might be considering a takeover bid. On April 4, 2022, Musk announced that he would not be joining Twitter's board of directors, despite being invited to do so by Twitter's CEO, Parag Agrawal.\n\n# Buyout offer\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk submitted a non-binding proposal to Twitter's board of directors, offering to acquire the company for $54.20 per share, valuing Twitter at approximately $43 billion. Musk's offer was contingent on him securing financing for the deal.\n\nTwitter's board of directors rejected Musk's offer, citing concerns about the company's future prospects and the potential risks associated with a takeover. However, Musk remained committed to acquiring Twitter and began exploring alternative financing options.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter's board of directors announced that it had accepted Musk's revised offer of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share. The acquisition was subject to shareholder approval and regulatory clearance.\n\n# Attempted termination\n\n## Alleged hold\n\nIn May 2022, Musk began to express concerns about the number of fake accounts on Twitter, which he believed were undermining the platform's integrity. Musk claimed that Twitter's executives had misled him about the extent of the problem and that he was considering terminating the acquisition.\n\n## Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was withdrawing from the acquisition, citing Twitter's alleged failure to provide him with accurate information about the number of fake accounts on the platform. Twitter's board of directors responded by filing a lawsuit against Musk, seeking to compel him to complete the acquisition.\n\n# Revival and closing\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nIn October 2022, Musk revived his bid to acquire Twitter, offering to complete the acquisition at the original price of $54.20 per share. Twitter's board of directors accepted Musk's revised offer, and the acquisition was completed on October 27, 2022.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition, Musk announced that he would be taking Twitter private, delisting the company's shares from the New York Stock Exchange. Musk also announced that he would be assuming the role of CEO, replacing Parag Agrawal.\n\n## Post-acquisition\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquisition, Musk began to implement a series of changes to Twitter's content moderation policies, including the reinstatement of several high-profile accounts that had been suspended for violating the platform's rules. Musk also announced plans to expand Twitter's product offerings, including the introduction of a new paid subscription service.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nMusk's initial takeover bid was met with a mixed response from Twitter users and investors. Some praised Musk's commitment to free speech and his vision for Twitter's future, while others expressed concerns about the potential risks associated with a takeover.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nThe acquisition announcement was met with a more positive response, with many Twitter users and investors expressing optimism about the potential benefits of a Musk-led Twitter.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempted termination of the acquisition was met with widespread criticism, with many accusing him of trying to back out of the deal. Twitter's lawsuit against Musk was seen as a bold move to hold him accountable for his actions.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the acquisition was met with a mix of reactions, with some praising Musk's commitment to seeing the deal through and others expressing concerns about the potential implications for Twitter's users and employees.\n\n# Critical analysis\n\n## Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nMusk's takeover bid and acquisition announcement were widely seen as a bold move to acquire a major social media platform. However, some critics argued that Musk's vision for Twitter was unclear and that his commitment to free speech was misguided.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempted termination of the acquisition was widely criticized as a cynical move to back out of the deal. Twitter's lawsuit against Musk was seen as a necessary step to hold him accountable for his actions.\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nMusk's decision to revive his bid to acquire Twitter was seen as a surprise move, given the controversy surrounding his attempted termination of the deal. However, some analysts argued that Musk's revised offer was a more realistic assessment of Twitter's value.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the acquisition was seen as a major milestone for Musk and Twitter. However, some critics argued that the deal was a mistake, given the potential risks associated with a Musk-led Twitter.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk will likely be remembered as a major turning point in the history of social media. Musk's vision for Twitter is still unclear, but his commitment to free speech and his willingness to take risks are likely to have a lasting impact on the platform and its users.\n\n# References\n\n*Note: References are not included in this article, as per the requirements.*\n\n# Further reading\n\n*Note: Further reading is not included in this article, as per the requirements.*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: External links are not included in this article, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n##Background\n##Early developments\n#Buyout offer\n##Takeover bid\n##Acquisition announcement\n#Attempted termination\n##Alleged hold\n##Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n#Revival and closing\n##Revitalization of bid\n##Completion of purchase\n##Post-acquisition\n#Reactions\n##Takeover bid\n##Acquisition announcement\n##Attempted termination\n##Completion of purchase\n#Critical analysis\n##Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n##Attempted termination\n##Revitalization of bid\n##Completion of purchase\n#Legacy\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is the sequel to the 2009 film Avatar and the second installment in the Avatar franchise. The story takes place 13 years after the events of the first film and follows Jake Sully, Neytiri, and their family as they navigate the dangers of Pandora and the threat of human invasion.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film begins with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) living in the forest of Pandora with their children, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Tuktirey (Trinity Bliss), and adopted son, Spider (Jack Champion). However, their peaceful life is disrupted by the return of human colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who seeks revenge against Jake for his past betrayal.\n\nQuaritch and his team, including a genetically engineered avatar, begin to hunt down Jake and his family, forcing them to flee their home and seek refuge with the Metkayina clan, a group of Na'vi who live in the oceans of Pandora. The Sully family must navigate their new surroundings and learn the ways of the Metkayina, all while facing the threat of Quaritch and his team.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Jake and Neytiri's son, Lo'ak, forms a bond with a captured tulkun, a massive sea creature, which becomes a key part of the story. Meanwhile, Jake and Quaritch engage in a series of intense battles, leading to a climactic showdown that will determine the fate of Pandora and its inhabitants.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at\n* Edie Falco as General Ardmore\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby\n* Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam Sully\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak Sully\n* Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey Sully\n* Jack Champion as Miles Socorro \"Spider\" Sully\n\n#Themes and analysis\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water explores several themes, including the clash between technology and nature, the importance of family and community, and the struggle for identity and belonging. The film also delves into the consequences of colonialism and the exploitation of indigenous cultures.\n\nThe film's use of 3D technology and immersive visuals creates a sense of presence and wonder, drawing the audience into the world of Pandora. The film's themes and messages are conveyed through the characters and their relationships, rather than through explicit exposition or dialogue.\n\nThe character of Lo'ak, in particular, serves as a symbol of the film's themes. His bond with the tulkun represents the connection between humans and nature, and his struggles to find his place within the Metkayina clan reflect the challenges of identity and belonging.\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nJames Cameron began working on the sequel to Avatar in 2010, shortly after the release of the first film. Cameron wrote the script for the film, which was initially intended to be a single sequel. However, as the story evolved, Cameron decided to split the narrative into four separate films, with The Way of Water being the first installment.\n\nCameron spent several years developing the story and characters, working with a team of writers and artists to create the film's visual and narrative elements. The film's budget was estimated to be around $460 million, making it one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n##Writing\n\nCameron wrote the script for the film, which was influenced by his own experiences as a father and his interests in science and nature. The script was developed in collaboration with a team of writers, including Laeta Kalogridis, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver.\n\nThe script was designed to be a self-contained story, while also setting up the events of the next three films. The story was structured around the theme of family and the challenges of raising children in a world filled with danger and uncertainty.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe cast of the film includes several returning actors from the original, including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver. New cast members include Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, and CCH Pounder.\n\nThe film's casting process was extensive, with Cameron and his team searching for actors who could bring depth and nuance to the characters. The cast underwent a rigorous training program to prepare for the film's physical and emotional demands.\n\n##Filming\n\n###Performance capture\n\nThe film's performance capture process was carried out at Weta Digital in Wellington, New Zealand. The cast wore motion capture suits and performed in a large, empty space, which was later filled with digital environments and characters.\n\nThe performance capture process allowed the actors to immerse themselves in the world of Pandora, creating a sense of presence and authenticity. The process was also used to capture the actors' facial expressions and body language, which were later translated into digital characters.\n\n###Live-action\n\nThe film's live-action elements were shot on location in Hawaii and New Zealand. The live-action sequences were used to capture the film's external environments, including the oceans and forests of Pandora.\n\nThe live-action process involved the use of specialized camera equipment and techniques, including 3D photography and underwater filming. The live-action sequences were later combined with the performance capture elements to create the film's final visuals.\n\n##Visual effects\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by Weta Digital, which used a combination of software and hardware to generate the film's digital environments and characters.\n\nThe visual effects process involved the creation of detailed digital models of the film's characters and environments, which were later animated and lit to create the final images. The process was highly complex, requiring the use of massive amounts of data and computational power.\n\n##Runtime\n\nThe film's runtime is approximately 192 minutes, making it one of the longest films ever released. The film's length was necessary to accommodate the complexity and scope of the story, which involves multiple plot threads and character arcs.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Simon Franglen, who worked closely with James Cameron to create the film's musical elements. The score was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and features a combination of orchestral and choral elements.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also includes several songs, including \"Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)\" by The Weeknd. The song was written specifically for the film and features a haunting, atmospheric quality that reflects the film's themes and mood.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was extensive, involving the use of social media, print advertising, and promotional partnerships. The campaign was designed to generate buzz and excitement around the film, which was released in multiple formats, including 3D and IMAX.\n\nThe film's trailer was released in May 2022 and quickly generated millions of views on YouTube and other social media platforms. The trailer featured a combination of action, drama, and spectacle, showcasing the film's visual and narrative elements.\n\n#Release\n\nThe film was released in the United States and Canada on December 16, 2022, and in other territories shortly thereafter. The film was released in multiple formats, including 3D and IMAX, and was shown in over 3,000 theaters worldwide.\n\n##Home media\n\nThe film was released on home media in March 2023, including DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming. The home media release featured a combination of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and commentary from James Cameron and the cast.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\n###United States and Canada\n\nThe film grossed over $684 million in the United States and Canada, making it one of the highest-grossing films of all time.

The acts were designed to prevent mutiny and desertion, and to establish a system of military justice. The first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, and subsequent acts were renewed and updated regularly until the 20th century.\n\nBackground\n-----------\n\nThe need for a Mutiny Act arose from the difficulties faced by the English army during the English Civil War and the subsequent Restoration period. The army was plagued by desertion, mutiny, and indiscipline, which threatened the stability of the government. In response, Parliament passed the first Mutiny Act in 1689, which established a system of military justice and provided for the punishment of soldiers who deserted or mutinied.\n\nPassage of the first Mutiny Act\n------------------------------\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed on April 18, 1689, during the reign of King William III. The act was designed to address the problems of desertion and mutiny in the army, which had become a major concern during the English Civil War. The act established a system of military justice, which provided for the trial and punishment of soldiers who deserted or mutinied. The act also provided for the appointment of courts-martial to try soldiers accused of military offenses.\n\nRenewal of the Mutiny Acts\n-------------------------\n\nThe Mutiny Acts were renewed and updated regularly until the 20th century. The acts were typically passed for a period of one year, and then renewed or updated as necessary. The renewal of the Mutiny Acts was often a contentious issue, with some members of Parliament arguing that the acts were too severe or restrictive.\n\nThe Quartering Acts\n------------------\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed by Parliament to regulate the quartering of soldiers in the homes of civilians. The acts were designed to alleviate the burden on local communities of housing large numbers of soldiers, and to prevent the abuse of civilians by soldiers. The Quartering Acts were often passed in conjunction with the Mutiny Acts, and were an important part of the system of military justice.\n\nList\n-----\n\nThe following is a list of the Mutiny Acts passed by Parliament:\n\n### England\n\n* 1689: The first Mutiny Act, passed on April 18, 1689\n* 1690: The Mutiny Act, passed on December 20, 1690\n* 1691: The Mutiny Act, passed on February 25, 1691\n* 1692: The Mutiny Act, passed on January 16, 1692\n* 1693: The Mutiny Act, passed on February 21, 1693\n\n### Great Britain\n\n* 1700: The Mutiny Act, passed on March 14, 1700\n* 1701: The Mutiny Act, passed on January 26, 1701\n* 1702: The Mutiny Act, passed on March 11, 1702\n* 1703: The Mutiny Act, passed on February 13, 1703\n* 1704: The Mutiny Act, passed on January 14, 1704\n\n### United Kingdom\n\n#### 1800s\n\n* 1801: The Mutiny Act, passed on June 14, 1801\n* 1802: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 26, 1802\n* 1803: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 12, 1803\n* 1804: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 27, 1804\n* 1805: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 14, 1805\n\n#### 1810s\n\n* 1810: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 21, 1810\n* 1811: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 24, 1811\n* 1812: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 11, 1812\n* 1813: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 25, 1813\n* 1814: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 13, 1814\n\n#### 1820s\n\n* 1820: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 14, 1820\n* 1821: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 27, 1821\n* 1822: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 10, 1822\n* 1823: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 25, 1823\n* 1824: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 12, 1824\n\n#### 1830s\n\n* 1830: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 14, 1830\n* 1831: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 26, 1831\n* 1832: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 10, 1832\n* 1833: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 27, 1833\n* 1834: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 12, 1834\n\n#### 1840s\n\n* 1840: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 21, 1840\n* 1841: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 24, 1841\n* 1842: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 11, 1842\n* 1843: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 25, 1843\n* 1844: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 13, 1844\n\n#### 1850s\n\n* 1850: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 14, 1850\n* 1851: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 27, 1851\n* 1852: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 10, 1852\n* 1853: The Mutiny Act, passed on July 25, 1853\n* 1854: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 12, 1854\n\n#### 1860s\n\n* 1860: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 14, 1860\n* 1861: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 26, 1861\n* 1862: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 10, 1862\n* 1863: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 27, 1863\n* 1864: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 12, 1864\n\n#### 1870s\n\n* 1870: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 21, 1870\n* 1871: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 24, 1871\n* 1872: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 11, 1872\n* 1873: The Mutiny Act, passed on August 25, 1873\n* 1874: The Mutiny Act, passed on September 13, 1874\n\nMarine Mutiny Acts\n------------------\n\nThe Marine Mutiny Acts were a series of laws passed by Parliament to regulate the behavior of sailors in the Royal Navy.

The outbreak was a result of a powerful low-pressure system that developed over the Great Plains and moved eastward, interacting with a cold front and a strong jet stream. The resulting tornadoes caused significant damage and loss of life, with the hardest-hit areas being Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nThe outbreak was fueled by a strong low-pressure system that developed over the Great Plains on November 3, 2022. As the system moved eastward, it interacted with a cold front and a strong jet stream, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms to develop. The storms that formed were supercells, which are characterized by strong updrafts and downdrafts, and are capable of producing large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in Norman, Oklahoma, issued a moderate risk (4/5) of severe weather for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas on November 4, indicating a high potential for significant severe weather events. The SPC also issued a tornado watch for parts of Texas and Oklahoma, which was later upgraded to a tornado warning as the storms developed.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 68 tornadoes were confirmed across five states during the outbreak.\n\n##November 4 event\n\nA total of 31 tornadoes were reported on November 4, with the majority occurring in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n##November 5 event\n\nA total of 37 tornadoes were reported on November 5, with the majority occurring in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\n##Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nA long-lived EF2 tornado touched down in Fannin County, Texas, and traveled for 34 miles before entering Oklahoma. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Brookston, Caviness, and Midcity. The tornado then crossed into Oklahoma and affected the town of Arthur City, causing additional damage.\n\n##Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n\nA significant EF3 tornado touched down in Red River County, Texas, and traveled for 43 miles before entering Oklahoma. The tornado caused widespread damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Bogota, Clarksville, and Acworth. The tornado then crossed into Oklahoma and affected the towns of Idabel, Broken Bow, and Eagletown, causing additional damage.\n\n##Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nA short-lived EF1 tornado touched down in Morris County, Texas, and traveled for 5 miles before dissipating. The tornado caused minor damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Cason and Naples.\n\n##Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nA short-lived EF1 tornado touched down in Bowie County, Texas, and traveled for 3 miles before dissipating. The tornado caused minor damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Simms and New Boston.\n\n#Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic effects, including large hail and damaging winds. Many areas reported hail up to 1 inch in diameter, and wind gusts up to 70 mph.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe tornado outbreak caused significant damage and loss of life. A total of 15 fatalities were reported, with many more injured.

The accident resulted in the deaths of all 72 people on board, making it one of the deadliest aviation accidents in Nepalese history.\n\n# Accident\n\nThe accident occurred at around 10:50 local time, when the ATR 72-500 aircraft, registered as 9N-ANC, was on approach to Pokhara International Airport's runway 12. The aircraft was flying from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, a distance of approximately 125 miles (201 km). According to eyewitnesses, the plane was seen banking sharply to the left before crashing into the Seti River gorge, near the airport. The impact and subsequent fire destroyed the aircraft, leaving no survivors.\n\nThe crash site was located in a steep and inaccessible area, making rescue efforts challenging. Emergency responders were quickly dispatched to the scene, but due to the remote location and difficult terrain, it took several hours to reach the wreckage. The rescue operation was conducted by a team of Nepalese army personnel, police, and local volunteers, who worked tirelessly to recover the bodies and debris.\n\n# Aircraft\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was an ATR 72-500, a twin-engine turboprop regional airliner manufactured by ATR, a joint venture between Airbus and Leonardo. The plane was 14 years old at the time of the accident and had been in service with Yeti Airlines since 2008. The aircraft had undergone regular maintenance and had been certified airworthy by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal.\n\nThe ATR 72-500 is a widely used regional airliner, known for its reliability and safety record. However, like all aircraft, it is not immune to accidents. The investigation into the crash of Flight 691 will examine all aspects of the aircraft's maintenance, performance, and operation to determine the cause of the accident.\n\n# Passengers and crew\n\nThere were 72 people on board Flight 691, including 68 passengers and 4 crew members. The passengers included Nepalese nationals, as well as tourists from various countries, including India, China, and the United States. The crew consisted of two pilots and two flight attendants, all of whom were experienced and trained professionals.\n\nThe passengers were from diverse backgrounds and included families, couples, and solo travelers. Many were on their way to Pokhara for tourism, business, or to visit family and friends. The accident has left a profound impact on the families and loved ones of those on board, who are still coming to terms with the loss of their loved ones.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe accident has had a significant impact on the aviation industry in Nepal, with many airlines and airports suspending operations temporarily. The government has established a committee to investigate the accident and determine its cause. The committee will examine all aspects of the accident, including the aircraft's maintenance, the pilots' training and experience, and the airport's infrastructure and procedures.\n\nThe accident has also raised concerns about aviation safety in Nepal, which has experienced several accidents in recent years. The government has promised to take steps to improve safety standards and prevent such accidents in the future.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the crash of Flight 691 is being led by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, with assistance from international experts and organizations, including the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).\n\n## Preliminary report\n\nA preliminary report into the accident was released by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal on January 20, 2023. The report stated that the aircraft had been flying normally until it began its descent into Pokhara International Airport. The pilots had been in contact with air traffic control and had been cleared for landing.\n\nHowever, the report noted that the aircraft had deviated from its intended flight path and had been flying at a lower altitude than expected. The investigation is ongoing, and the cause of the accident has not yet been determined.\n\n## Final report\n\nThe final report into the accident is expected to be released in several months. The report will provide a detailed analysis of the accident and its causes, as well as recommendations for preventing similar accidents in the future. The report will be based on a thorough examination of all available evidence, including flight data recorders, cockpit voice recorders, and witness statements.\n\n# See also\n\n* Aviation accidents and incidents in Nepal\n* List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\n* Yeti Airlines\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article will be updated as more information becomes available.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yeti_Airlines_Flight_691\" following this outline:\n\n#Accident\n#Aircraft\n#Passengers and crew\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n##Preliminary report\n##Final report\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

As a prominent figure in the printing industry, Davis was instrumental in disseminating news, ideas, and literature throughout the colony, earning him a reputation as one of the most influential printers of his time.\n\n# Early and family life\n\nJames Davis was born in 1721 in England, where he likely received his early education and training in the printing trade. Little is known about his family or his life before his arrival in North Carolina, but it is believed that he immigrated to the colonies in the early 1740s. Davis settled in New Bern, a bustling port city in the Province of North Carolina, where he quickly established himself as a skilled printer.\n\n# Printing career\n\n## North Carolina Gazette\n\nIn 1751, Davis began publishing the North Carolina Gazette, the first newspaper in the colony. The Gazette was a weekly publication that covered local and international news, as well as advertising and notices. Under Davis's guidance, the Gazette became a vital source of information for the colonists, providing news from Europe, the other colonies, and local events. The newspaper also served as a platform for Davis to express his views on politics, literature, and culture.\n\n## The North Carolina Magazine\n\nIn addition to the Gazette, Davis also published The North Carolina Magazine, a literary and cultural journal that featured essays, poems, and articles on a wide range of topics. The Magazine was an ambitious project that showcased the intellectual and artistic talents of the colonists, and it played a significant role in promoting the development of a distinct North Carolina identity.\n\n## Counterfeiting allegations\n\nIn 1759, Davis was accused of counterfeiting, a serious crime that carried severe penalties. The allegations were likely politically motivated, as Davis had become a vocal critic of the colonial government and its policies. Despite the charges, Davis maintained his innocence and continued to publish the Gazette, using the newspaper as a platform to defend himself and attack his accusers.\n\n# Political career\n\nDavis's printing career was closely tied to his involvement in politics. As a vocal advocate for colonial rights and liberties, he used his newspapers to promote the interests of the colonists and challenge the authority of the British government. In the 1760s and 1770s, Davis became increasingly involved in local politics, serving as a delegate to the North Carolina Provincial Congress and participating in the colonial government.\n\n# Final days and legacy\n\nJames Davis died in 1785, at the age of 64. His legacy as a printer, publisher, and politician is still celebrated in North Carolina today. Through his newspapers and journals, Davis played a significant role in shaping the cultural and intellectual landscape of the colony, and his contributions to the American Revolution helped to pave the way for independence.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of early American publishers and printers\n* North Carolina Gazette\n* The North Carolina Magazine\n* American Revolution\n* Colonial history of North Carolina\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a general overview of James Davis's life and career, and it is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to his contributions to American history.\n\n# Citations\n\nNone\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Davis_(printer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and family life\n#Printing career\n##North Carolina Gazette\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n#Political career\n#Final days and legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film follows Maverick, a test pilot and flight instructor, as he returns to the Top Gun program to train a new generation of pilots.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place 34 years after the events of the first film. Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot and flight instructor who is still pushing the limits of what is possible in the air. He is ordered to return to the Top Gun program as an instructor, where he will train a new generation of pilots, including Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer, Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.\n\nMaverick is tasked with training the pilots for a mission to destroy a uranium facility in an unnamed enemy country. The facility is heavily guarded and protected by advanced air defense systems, making it a nearly impossible target to hit. Maverick and his team must use all their skills and experience to come up with a plan to complete the mission.\n\nAs Maverick trains the new pilots, he also rekindles his romance with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), a former love interest from his past. Meanwhile, Maverick's rival, Iceman (Val Kilmer), is now a high-ranking officer in the Navy and is skeptical of Maverick's abilities as an instructor.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Tom Cruise as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell\n* Miles Teller as Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw\n* Jennifer Connelly as Penny Benjamin\n* Jon Hamm as Vice Admiral Cyclone\n* Glen Powell as Lieutenant Junior Grade \"Hangman\" Seresin\n* Lewis Pullman as Lieutenant Robert \"Bob\" Floyd\n* Ed Harris as Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain\n* Val Kilmer as Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe development of Top Gun: Maverick began in 2010, when Paramount Pictures and Skydance Media announced plans to produce a sequel to the 1986 film.

The incident drew widespread attention and sparked a heated debate about violence, accountability, and the limits of free speech.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards ceremony was held to honor the best films of 2021. Chris Rock, a comedian and actor, was hosting the ceremony for the second time, while Will Smith was a nominee for Best Actor for his role in King Richard. The two actors had a long-standing friendly relationship, and Rock had often made jokes about Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, in his stand-up routines.\n\n# Incident\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chris Rock took the stage to present the award for Best Documentary Feature. Before announcing the winner, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, saying, \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.\" The joke was met with laughter from the audience, but Will Smith initially appeared to laugh along with the joke. However, he soon became visibly upset and walked onto the stage, slapping Rock in the face.\n\n## Photograph\n\nA photograph of the incident, captured by a Getty Images photographer, was widely shared on social media and became a defining image of the incident. The photograph shows Smith's hand making contact with Rock's face, with a shocked expression on Rock's face.\n\n## Uncensored viewership\n\nThe incident was broadcast live on television, but the audio was temporarily muted to avoid exposing viewers to explicit language. However, viewers in some countries, including Australia and Japan, saw the incident uncensored, as the broadcast was not subject to the same content restrictions.\n\n## Additional videos\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, additional videos emerged showing the altercation from different angles. One video, captured by a spectator, showed Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, looking visibly upset and trying to calm her husband down. Another video, captured by a security camera, showed Smith and Rock in the backstage area, with Smith appearing to apologize to Rock.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe incident sparked a heated debate about violence, accountability, and the limits of free speech. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) faced criticism for its handling of the incident, with some calling for Smith to be stripped of his Best Actor award.\n\n## Initial response\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, the Academy released a statement condemning the violence, but did not take any immediate action against Smith. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) also released a statement, saying that they were aware of the incident and were investigating.\n\n## Public apologies\n\nWill Smith publicly apologized to Chris Rock on Instagram, saying that his behavior was \"unacceptable and inexcusable.\" Smith also apologized to the Academy and the viewers at home. Chris Rock did not publicly comment on the incident, but his representatives released a statement saying that he was \"shaken\" by the incident.\n\n## Formal Academy review\n\nThe Academy launched a formal review into the incident, with the goal of determining whether Smith should face disciplinary action. The review was led by the Academy's president, David Rubin, and included input from the Academy's board of governors.\n\n## Resignation and ban\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Will Smith announced that he was resigning from the Academy, effective immediately. The Academy accepted his resignation and also announced that Smith would be banned from attending the Oscars for a period of 10 years.\n\n## Smith film delayed\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, it was announced that Smith's upcoming film, Emancipation, would be delayed indefinitely. The film, which was set to be released in 2022, was a historical drama that starred Smith as a slave who escapes from a plantation.\n\n## Later responses\n\nIn the months following the incident, both Smith and Rock continued to face scrutiny and criticism. Smith was criticized for his handling of the incident, with some accusing him of using his platform to downplay his behavior. Rock, on the other hand, was praised for his handling of the incident, with many commending him for not escalating the situation.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe incident sparked a wide range of reactions, from outrage and condemnation to praise and support.\n\n## Crew of Summer of Soul\n\nThe crew of the documentary film Summer of Soul, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, released a statement condemning the violence and expressing support for Chris Rock.\n\n## Individuals\n\nMany individuals, including celebrities and politicians, weighed in on the incident. Some, such as actor Denzel Washington, expressed support for Smith, while others, such as actress Lupita Nyong'o, condemned his behavior.\n\n## Comedians\n\nMany comedians, including Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart, expressed support for Chris Rock and condemned the violence.\n\n## Politicians\n\nSome politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, weighed in on the incident, with Cruz calling for Smith to be stripped of his Oscar.\n\n## Accusations of staging\n\nSome conspiracy theorists accused Smith and Rock of staging the incident for publicity. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\n## Alopecia awareness\n\nThe incident raised awareness about alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss. Jada Pinkett Smith has been open about her struggles with alopecia, and the incident sparked a wider conversation about the condition.\n\n## Views on criminality\n\nThe incident sparked a debate about whether Smith's behavior constituted a crime. Some argued that the slap was a form of assault, while others argued that it was a minor incident that did not warrant criminal charges.\n\n## Memes\n\nThe incident sparked a wave of memes and jokes on social media, with many people poking fun at the incident and Smith's behavior.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe incident has been subject to extensive analysis and commentary, with many trying to make sense of the incident and its aftermath.\n\n## Potential causes\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Smith's behavior was caused by a combination of factors, including his ego, his desire to protect his wife, and the pressure of the live broadcast.\n\n## Comparisons with historic Academy incidents\n\nThe incident has been compared to other historic incidents at the Academy Awards, including the acceptance speech by Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African American to win an Oscar in 1939.\n\n## Financial impact\n\nThe incident is likely to have a significant financial impact on Will Smith's career, with some estimating that he could lose millions of dollars in endorsement deals and film projects.\n\n# See also\n\n* 94th Academy Awards\n* Will Smith\n* Chris Rock\n* Jada Pinkett Smith\n* King Richard (film)\n* Alopecia\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Rock–Will_Smith_slapping_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Incident\n##Photograph\n##Uncensored viewership\n##Additional videos\n#Aftermath\n##Initial response\n##Public apologies\n##Formal Academy review\n##Resignation and ban\n##Smith film delayed\n##Later responses\n#Reactions\n##Crew of Summer of Soul\n##Individuals\n##Comedians\n##Politicians\n##Accusations of staging\n##Alopecia awareness\n##Views on criminality\n##Memes\n#Analysis\n##Potential causes\n##Comparisons with historic Academy incidents\n##Financial impact\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The prosecution, led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, has resulted in the indictment of several high-profile defendants, including former President Donald Trump.\n\n# Background\n\n## Prior to and during election day\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, President Trump and his allies made numerous public statements questioning the integrity of the electoral process in Georgia. These statements continued on election day, November 3, 2020, as Trump tweeted about alleged voting irregularities in the state.\n\n## Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nFollowing the election, Trump and his allies made repeated attempts to pressure Georgia state officials to overturn the results of the election. This included phone calls from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Governor Brian Kemp, as well as visits from Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to the state capitol.\n\n## Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nIn December 2020, a group of Georgia Republicans, including State Senator Burt Jones and State Representative Vernon Jones, signed a document purporting to be the official electoral vote count for the state. This document, which was sent to the National Archives, falsely claimed that Trump had won the state's electoral votes.\n\n## Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nIn January 2021, a group of individuals, including Cathy Latham and Misty Hampton, breached the election equipment room in Coffee County, Georgia. The individuals, who were later identified as having ties to Trump's campaign, made copies of the Dominion Voting Systems software used in the county.\n\n## Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nIn the months following the election, several Fulton County election workers, including Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, were subjected to harassment and intimidation by Trump supporters. This included death threats, racist slurs, and in-person confrontations.\n\n# Indictment\n\n## Charges\n\nOn August 14, 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County, Georgia, returned a 98-count indictment against several individuals, including former President Donald Trump. The charges include:\n\n* Racketeering\n* Solicitation of violation of oath by public officer\n* Tampering with witnesses\n* Influencing witnesses\n* False statements and writings\n* Filing false documents\n\n## Defendants\n\nThe defendants in the case include:\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Rudy Giuliani\n* Mark Meadows\n* John Eastman\n* Jenna Ellis\n* Burt Jones\n* Vernon Jones\n* Cathy Latham\n* Misty Hampton\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Surrender and booking\n\nFollowing the indictment, several of the defendants, including Trump, Giuliani, and Meadows, surrendered to authorities and were booked into the Fulton County Jail.\n\n## Arraignments\n\nThe defendants were arraigned before Judge Robert McBurney of the Fulton County Superior Court. During the arraignment, the defendants entered not guilty pleas to all charges.\n\n# Pretrial motions\n\n## Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nSeveral of the defendants have filed motions to dismiss the charges against them. These motions argue that the prosecution is based on flawed evidence and that the charges are not supported by law.\n\n## Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nSome of the defendants have also filed motions to remove the case to federal court. These motions argue that the case involves federal issues and that the federal court has jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n## Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nSeveral of the defendants have requested a speedy trial, arguing that the prosecution is taking too long to bring the case to trial. Some of the defendants have also requested severance from the other defendants, arguing that their defenses are mutually exclusive.\n\n## Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nIn September 2023, Judge McBurney dismissed the solicitation and false documents charges against several of the defendants. This decision was based on the prosecution's failure to provide sufficient evidence to support these charges.\n\n# Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n\n## Background\n\nIn September 2023, several of the defendants filed motions alleging prosecutorial impropriety. These motions argued that District Attorney Fani Willis had engaged in improper conduct, including leaking confidential information to the press and making public statements about the case.\n\n## Hearing\n\nA hearing was held on the motions, during which several witnesses, including Willis, testified. The prosecution argued that Willis had done nothing wrong and that the motions were without merit.\n\n## Ruling and aftermath\n\nJudge McBurney ruled that Willis had engaged in improper conduct, but that this conduct did not require her removal from the case. The defendants have appealed this ruling.\n\n## Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nThe defendants have appealed Judge McBurney's ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. This appeal argues that Willis's conduct requires her removal from the case and that a new prosecutor should be appointed.\n\n# Guilty pleas\n\n## Proffer video leak\n\nIn October 2023, a video was leaked showing one of the defendants, Jenna Ellis, making statements to prosecutors about the case. This video was part of a proffer agreement, which is a statement made by a defendant in exchange for immunity from prosecution.\n\n# Trials\n\n## Date and duration\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin in early 2024 and is expected to last several months.\n\n## Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution is expected to call several witnesses, including election officials, Trump allies, and experts on election law. The defense is also expected to call witnesses, including Trump himself.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe prosecution has been met with widespread media attention and public interest. Several civil rights groups have filed amicus briefs in support of the prosecution, arguing that the charges are necessary to protect the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date developments in the case.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include citations or references.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor more information on the case, see the following articles:\n\n* \"Trump Indicted in Georgia Election Probe\" (The New York Times)\n* \"Fani Willis: The DA Taking on Trump\" (The Atlantic)\n* \"The Georgia Election Racketeering Case: A Primer\" (Lawfare)\n\n# External links\n\n## Federal removal dockets\n\n* United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia: Trump v.

It officially began on June 1, 2023, and will end on November 30, 2023. The season has seen a mix of intense and weak systems, with several storms affecting the Caribbean and the United States.\n\n# Seasonal Forecasts\n\n## Pre-season forecasts\n\nBefore the start of the season, several organizations issued forecasts predicting the number of tropical cyclones that would form in the Atlantic. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted a near-normal season, with 12 to 17 named storms, 5 to 9 hurricanes, and 1 to 3 major hurricanes. The Colorado State University (CSU) predicted a slightly above-normal season, with 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes.\n\n## Mid-season forecasts\n\nIn early August, NOAA updated its forecast, predicting a slightly above-normal season, with 14 to 21 named storms, 6 to 10 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes.

The earthquake resulted in significant damage and loss of life, prompting a massive response from emergency services and international aid organizations.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the High Atlas mountain range, a seismically active region that is part of the larger African-Eurasian plate boundary. The region is characterized by a complex tectonic setting, with multiple faults and fractures that have been active over millions of years. The earthquake occurred in an area of high seismic hazard, where the African and Eurasian plates are in contact, resulting in a zone of deformation and faulting.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was a shallow, thrust-fault earthquake with a focal depth of approximately 10 km. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw) and was characterized by a significant release of energy, resulting in widespread damage and shaking. The earthquake's epicenter was located in a remote mountainous area, approximately 30 km southwest of the city of Marrakech.\n\n## Ground Effects\n\nThe earthquake resulted in significant ground effects, including landslides, rockfalls, and soil liquefaction. The shaking was intense, with reports of buildings collapsing and widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The earthquake also triggered a number of landslides, which blocked roads and rivers, causing further damage and disruption.\n\n# Damage and Casualties\n\nThe earthquake resulted in significant damage and loss of life, with reports of over 2,000 fatalities and more than 5,000 injured. The damage was widespread, with entire villages and towns affected, and many buildings reduced to rubble. The earthquake also caused significant economic losses, with estimates suggesting that the damage exceeded $1 billion.\n\n# Search and Rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were led by the Moroccan authorities, with assistance from international teams. The efforts were challenging due to the remote location of the affected areas and the difficult terrain. Despite these challenges, the rescue teams were able to locate and rescue many survivors, including those trapped under rubble and debris.\n\n# International Response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with many countries offering aid and assistance. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinated the international response, with teams from the UN, NGOs, and governments providing support. The international response included the provision of emergency shelter, food, and medical aid, as well as support for search and rescue efforts.\n\n# Recovery and Assistance\n\nThe recovery efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with support from international organizations and NGOs. The efforts focused on providing emergency assistance, including shelter, food, and medical aid, as well as supporting longer-term recovery and reconstruction efforts. The international community provided significant support, including financial assistance, technical expertise, and humanitarian aid.\n\n# Aid and Crisis Management\n\n## International Aid\n\nThe international community provided significant aid to support the recovery efforts, including financial assistance, technical expertise, and humanitarian aid. The aid was coordinated by the UN OCHA, with teams from the UN, NGOs, and governments providing support. The aid included the provision of emergency shelter, food, and medical aid, as well as support for longer-term recovery and reconstruction efforts.\n\n## Crisis Management\n\nThe crisis management efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with support from international organizations and NGOs. The efforts focused on responding to the immediate needs of the affected population, including providing emergency assistance, supporting search and rescue efforts, and coordinating the international response.\n\n## Protests\n\nThere were reports of protests in the aftermath of the earthquake, with some communities expressing frustration with the government's response to the disaster. The protests were largely peaceful, but highlighted the need for the government to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of the affected population.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nThe reconstruction efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with support from international organizations and NGOs. The efforts focused on rebuilding damaged infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings, as well as supporting longer-term recovery and development efforts. The international community provided significant support, including financial assistance, technical expertise, and humanitarian aid.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2023\n* List of earthquakes in Morocco\n* Earthquake engineering\n* Seismic hazard assessment\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External Links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Al_Haouz_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Mechanism\n##Ground effects\n#Damage and casualties\n#Search and rescue\n#International response\n#Recovery and assistance\n#Aid and crisis management\n##International aid\n##Crisis management\n##Protests\n##Reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

At its peak, it was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in Southeast Asia, with a rich culture, architecture, and trade networks that stretched across the region and beyond.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\n### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, the region was home to several smaller cities and kingdoms, including the Khmer Empire's outpost of Lopburi and the Mon kingdom of U Thong. These cities played an important role in the development of the region's culture, politics, and economy.\n\n### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, Ayutthaya was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I, who is said to have established the city on a small island in the Chao Phraya River. The city was named after the Indian city of Ayodhya, which was said to be the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama. The founding of Ayutthaya marked the beginning of a new era in the region's history, as the city would go on to become a major center of power, culture, and trade.\n\n## Early maritime dominance\n\nIn the early years of its existence, Ayutthaya focused on building its maritime trade networks, establishing relationships with neighboring kingdoms and city-states in Southeast Asia, as well as with China and India. The city's strategic location at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River made it an ideal hub for trade, and its merchants played a major role in the region's maritime commerce.\n\n## Age of warfare\n\n### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nIn the 15th century, Ayutthaya began to shift its focus from maritime trade to the development of its hinterland. The city expanded its territories through a series of military campaigns, conquering neighboring kingdoms and city-states. This marked a significant turning point in the history of Ayutthaya, as the city began to focus more on the development of its internal territories rather than its maritime trade networks.\n\n### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nDuring this period, the power of the Northern lords, who controlled the kingdom's northern territories, grew significantly. These lords played a major role in the kingdom's military campaigns and were instrumental in the expansion of Ayutthaya's territories.\n\n### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the 16th century, Ayutthaya fought a series of wars with the Burmese kingdom of Pegu. These wars had a significant impact on the kingdom, as they led to the destruction of several major cities and the loss of significant territories.\n\n## Peace and commerce\n\n### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nIn the 17th century, Ayutthaya experienced a period of relative peace and stability, during which the kingdom's economy and culture flourished. The kingdom's trade networks expanded, and its merchants established relationships with European traders.\n\n### Persian and French influences\n\nDuring this period, Ayutthaya was influenced by Persian and French culture. The kingdom's rulers adopted elements of Persian architecture and art, and the French established a significant presence in the kingdom, with several French traders and missionaries living in Ayutthaya.\n\n## Late Ayutthaya period\n\n### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nIn the 18th century, Ayutthaya continued to experience significant economic growth and cultural development. The kingdom's trade networks expanded, with increased connections to China and other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nHowever, the kingdom was also plagued by succession conflicts and corruption, which weakened the power of the monarchy and created instability in the kingdom.\n\n### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nDuring this period, Ayutthaya saw the introduction of capitalist economic systems, which led to the rise of a new class of commoners who were involved in trade and commerce. This led to the development of proto-nationalist sentiment, as people began to identify themselves as part of a distinct Siamese nation.\n\n### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nThe nobility continued to play a significant role in the kingdom, and Buddhism remained a central part of Siamese culture and identity. The kingdom's rulers were patrons of Buddhism, and the religion played a major role in the kingdom's art, literature, and architecture.\n\n### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nBy the mid-18th century, Ayutthaya was facing significant military and political challenges. The kingdom was weakened by internal conflicts and external threats, and its military was in disarray.\n\n## Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1767, Ayutthaya was conquered by the Burmese kingdom of Konbaung, marking the end of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The city was destroyed, and many of its inhabitants were taken captive or forced to flee.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Ayutthaya marked a significant turning point in the history of Thailand. The kingdom was eventually replaced by the Thonburi Kingdom, which was founded by King Taksin. The legacy of Ayutthaya continued to shape Thai culture and identity, and the kingdom's history remains an important part of Thailand's national heritage.\n\n# Government\n\n## Kings\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was ruled by a series of kings, who were believed to have divine authority.

The war has its roots in the complex history and politics of the region, with multiple factors contributing to its escalation. This article provides an overview of the background, history, and current situation of the conflict, as well as its impact on human rights, related issues, and international reactions.\n\n# Background\n\n## Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, following the dissolution of the USSR. In the early 2000s, Ukraine experienced a period of significant economic growth, driven by its strategic location and natural resources. However, the country's politics were marked by corruption and authoritarianism, which led to widespread discontent among the population. The Orange Revolution in 2004 brought about a change in government, with pro-Western politicians coming to power. This shift in politics was seen as a threat by Russia, which had long considered Ukraine to be within its sphere of influence.\n\n## Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking widespread protests in Kiev's Independence Square, known as Euromaidan. The protests, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity, called for greater integration with Europe and an end to corruption. However, the protests also led to a backlash from pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine, who saw the EU as a threat to their economic and cultural ties with Russia.\n\n## Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia had maintained a significant military presence in Crimea since the Soviet era, with the port city of Sevastopol serving as the home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The 1997 Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet allowed Russia to maintain a maximum of 25,000 troops in Crimea, with Ukraine receiving a significant portion of the rent paid by Russia. However, the treaty also limited Russia's ability to unilaterally increase its military presence in the region.\n\n## Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised questions about the legality of Russia's actions, particularly with regards to the annexation of Crimea. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine has also accused Russia of violating the Budapest Memorandum, a 1994 agreement in which Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom pledged to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal.\n\n# History\n\n## Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn February 2014, following the ousting of President Yanukovych, Russian troops began to take control of key infrastructure in Crimea, including military bases, airports, and government buildings. On March 16, 2014, a referendum was held in Crimea, in which the majority of voters supported joining Russia. The annexation was formalized on March 21, 2014, when Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty making Crimea a part of Russia.\n\n## War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian groups in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, began to stage protests and take control of government buildings. The protests were largely driven by economic grievances and a sense of disconnection from the central government in Kiev.\n\n### Armed conflict\n\nIn May 2014, the conflict escalated into an armed conflict, with Ukrainian government forces clashing with pro-Russian separatists. The conflict was marked by significant human rights abuses, including the use of cluster munitions and indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas.\n\n### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, with the aim of supporting the separatists and gaining control of the strategic city of Mariupol. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian government forces launched an offensive to retake Mariupol, which was largely successful. The offensive was followed by a ceasefire agreement, known as the Minsk Protocol, which was brokered by Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe conflict continued to escalate throughout the end of 2014, with significant fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In February 2015, a new ceasefire agreement, known as Minsk II, was brokered, which called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy artillery, and the establishment of a buffer zone.\n\n## Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, Russian naval forces seized three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\n### 2019–2020\n\nThe conflict continued to simmer throughout 2019 and 2020, with periodic outbreaks of fighting and significant human rights abuses. In 2020, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky launched a series of reforms aimed at addressing the root causes of the conflict, including corruption and economic inequality.\n\n## Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia significantly increased its military presence along the border with Ukraine, with estimates suggesting that up to 150,000 troops were deployed.\n\n### Escalation\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, which marked the beginning of a full-scale invasion. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### Full-scale invasion\n\nThe invasion was marked by significant fighting, particularly in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. Ukrainian government forces launched a series of counteroffensives, which were largely successful in repelling the Russian advance.\n\n## Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n\nThe conflict continued to escalate throughout 2022 and 2023, with periodic outbreaks of fighting and significant human rights abuses. In 2023, Ukrainian government forces launched a series of counteroffensives, which were largely successful in retaking significant territory from Russian-backed separatists.\n\n## Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n\nThe conflict continues to escalate, with Russian forces launching a series of campaigns aimed at gaining control of key infrastructure and territory. In response, Ukrainian government forces launched a counteroffensive, known as the Kursk offensive, which aims to retake significant territory from Russian-backed separatists.\n\n# Human rights violations\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been marked by significant human rights abuses, including the use of cluster munitions, indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas, and forced displacement. According to estimates, up to 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict, with many more injured or displaced.\n\n# Related issues\n\n## Spillover\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has had significant spillover effects, including the displacement of people to neighboring countries and the disruption of trade and economic activity.\n\n## Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n\nThe conflict has also had significant implications for energy security, with Russia using its gas supplies as a tool of leverage.

The earthquake was a shallow, high-magnitude event that caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the affected areas. This article provides an overview of the tectonic setting, the earthquake itself, and its impact on the region.\n\n# Tectonic Setting\n\nIndonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to high seismic activity due to the movement of several tectonic plates. The country is situated at the boundary between the Eurasian, Australian, and Philippine Sea plates, which interact to create a complex tectonic environment. West Java, where the earthquake occurred, is located near the subduction zone of the Eurasian and Australian plates. This subduction zone is characterized by deep earthquakes, but shallow earthquakes can also occur due to the deformation of the overriding plate.\n\n# Earthquake\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake occurred on November 21, 2022, at 13:21 local time (06:21 UTC). The earthquake had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale and a depth of 10 kilometers. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Cianjur Regency, approximately 70 kilometers southeast of the provincial capital, Bandung. The earthquake was a shallow, thrust-fault event, which is consistent with the tectonic setting of the region.\n\nThe earthquake was followed by several aftershocks, with the largest one having a magnitude of 4.3. The aftershocks were concentrated in the same area as the mainshock and were likely caused by the continued movement of the tectonic plates.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The earthquake was felt in several provinces, including West Java, Jakarta, and Central Java. However, the most affected areas were in the Cianjur Regency, where the earthquake was centered.\n\nThe earthquake caused significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Many buildings collapsed, including homes, schools, and hospitals. The earthquake also triggered landslides and soil liquefaction, which further exacerbated the damage.\n\n# Casualties\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake resulted in a significant number of casualties. According to official reports, at least 600 people were killed, and over 2,000 were injured. Many of the victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and rescue efforts were hindered by the lack of access to the affected areas.\n\n## Search and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were launched immediately after the earthquake, with teams from the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) and other organizations deploying to the affected areas. The search and rescue efforts were challenging due to the remote location of the affected areas and the lack of access to some of the villages.\n\nThe search and rescue teams worked tirelessly to locate and rescue trapped victims, using specialized equipment such as excavators and sniffer dogs. However, the efforts were often hindered by the lack of resources and the difficult terrain.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a significant impact on the affected communities, causing widespread destruction and displacement. Many people were left homeless, and the local economy was severely affected.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nThe Indonesian government launched a reconstruction effort to rebuild the affected areas. The effort was led by the BNPB, which worked with other government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and local communities to rebuild homes, schools, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe reconstruction effort was focused on building back better, with a emphasis on disaster-resilient construction and community-based initiatives. However, the effort was often hindered by the lack of resources and the complexity of the reconstruction process.\n\n# Response\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was led by the Indonesian government, which deployed emergency responders and aid to the affected areas. The response effort was supported by international organizations and non-governmental organizations, which provided aid and assistance to the affected communities.\n\n## International Aid\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with many countries and organizations providing aid and assistance to the affected communities. The aid included food, shelter, and medical supplies, as well as financial assistance to support the reconstruction effort.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) played a key role in coordinating the international response, working with the Indonesian government and other organizations to assess the needs of the affected communities and provide support.\n\n# Controversy\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was not without controversy. There were reports of corruption and mismanagement of aid, with some organizations and individuals accused of taking advantage of the disaster for personal gain.\n\nThere were also concerns about the lack of preparedness and disaster risk reduction measures in place, which may have contributed to the severity of the impact. The Indonesian government was criticized for its slow response to the disaster, with some arguing that more could have been done to prevent the loss of life and property.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake\n* 2009 Sumatran earthquake\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the 2022 West Java earthquake, based on available information.

The storm caused widespread damage and loss of life, particularly in the eastern part of the country. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations made by authorities, its impact on affected areas, aftermath of the disaster, retirement of the name Megi, and related topics.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\n## Formation and intensification\nTropical Storm Megi formed on April 1, 2010, as a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines. The system slowly intensified into a tropical depression on April 3, and further strengthened into a tropical storm on April 4. The storm's name, Megi, was assigned by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The storm then began to rapidly intensify, with maximum sustained winds increasing by 50 knots in just 12 hours.\n\n## Peak intensity and landfall\nOn April 6, Megi reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100 knots (185 km/h) and a central pressure of 960 hPa. The storm made landfall on the eastern coast of Luzon, Philippines, at around 10:00 UTC on April 7. The storm's powerful winds and heavy rainfall caused widespread damage and disruption to communities in the affected areas.\n\n## Dissipation\nAfter making landfall, Megi began to weaken due to interaction with the Philippine terrain. The storm's circulation became disorganized, and it was downgraded to a tropical depression on April 8. The storm then dissipated over the South China Sea on April 10.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Philippines\nIn anticipation of the storm's landfall, the Philippine government issued storm warnings and evacuation orders for residents in low-lying areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency response plan, with emergency responders and aid teams on standby.\n\n## Other countries\nOther countries in the region, including Taiwan and Hong Kong, also issued storm warnings and prepared for the potential impact of Megi.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Philippines\nThe storm's impact was most severe in the eastern part of the Philippines, particularly in the provinces of Isabela and Cagayan. Widespread damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agriculture was reported, with estimated losses of over PHP 12 billion (USD 270 million). The storm also caused significant disruptions to transportation and communication services.\n\n## Other countries\nIn Taiwan, strong winds and heavy rainfall caused power outages and disruptions to transportation services. In Hong Kong, the storm's outer rain bands caused flash flooding in some areas.\n\n## Casualties\nAccording to official reports, a total of 22 people lost their lives due to the storm, with many more injured or displaced.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Relief efforts\nThe Philippine government launched a massive relief effort in the aftermath of the storm, with aid teams and emergency responders providing assistance to affected communities. International aid organizations, including the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, also provided support to the relief efforts.\n\n## Rebuilding and recovery\nRebuilding and recovery efforts began soon after the storm, with the Philippine government allocating funds for the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and buildings.\n\n# Retirement\n\n## Naming conventions\nThe name Megi was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names in the Western Pacific by the JMA in 2011. The name was replaced by Malakas.\n\n## Reason for retirement\nThe name Megi was retired due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the storm, particularly in the Philippines.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific\n* List of retired Pacific typhoon names\n* Tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n\n# External links\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency\n* National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (Philippines)\n* United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a hypothetical, grainy, and indistinct object that is thought to be the fundamental nature of black holes. The theory proposes that black holes are not points of infinite density, as traditionally described, but rather extended, three-dimensional objects with a definite surface. This concept challenges the conventional understanding of space-time and the behavior of matter in extreme environments.\n\n#Physical properties\n\n##String theory and composition\n\nIn string theory, fuzzballs are composed of vibrating strings, which are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. The vibrations of the strings within a fuzzball determine its properties, such as its mass, charge, and angular momentum. The surface of a fuzzball is thought to be made up of a dense network of strings, which are constantly vibrating and interacting with each other.\n\nThe string theory framework provides a unique perspective on the nature of space-time, suggesting that it is not a fixed, background entity but rather an emergent property of the collective behavior of strings. In this context, fuzzballs can be seen as a manifestation of the intricate web of string interactions that underlie the fabric of space-time.\n\n##Densities\n\nFuzzballs are characterized by their extremely high densities, which are thought to be many orders of magnitude greater than those of conventional objects. This is due to the immense compression of the strings within the fuzzball, which creates a region of space-time where the laws of physics as we know them break down. The density of a fuzzball is not uniform, with the highest densities typically found near the surface, where the strings are most densely packed.\n\nThe extreme densities within fuzzballs give rise to a number of interesting phenomena, including the potential for exotic matter and energy. These phenomena could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe, particularly in the context of black hole physics and the behavior of matter in extreme environments.\n\n##Neutron star collapse\n\nOne of the most interesting applications of fuzzball theory is in the context of neutron star collapse. According to traditional theories, a neutron star will eventually collapse into a singularity, a point of infinite density, as it reaches the end of its life cycle. However, fuzzball theory suggests that this collapse may be halted by the formation of a fuzzball, which would provide a more stable, long-lived configuration.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star into a fuzzball would have significant implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter in extreme environments. It would also provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of fuzzballs, which could help to shed light on the fundamental nature of space-time and the behavior of strings.\n\n#Information paradox\n\nThe information paradox is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics, which arises from the apparent loss of information that occurs when a black hole forms and then evaporates. According to traditional theories, the information about the matter that falls into a black hole is lost forever, which is difficult to reconcile with the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\nFuzzball theory provides a potential solution to the information paradox, suggesting that the information about the matter that falls into a black hole is not lost but rather encoded on the surface of the fuzzball. This information is thought to be preserved in the form of vibrations of the strings, which make up the surface of the fuzzball.\n\nThe fuzzball solution to the information paradox is still highly speculative and requires further development. However, it provides a promising avenue for research, which could help to shed light on the fundamental nature of space-time and the behavior of matter in extreme environments.\n\n#Testability of the theory\n\nOne of the main challenges facing fuzzball theory is the development of experimental tests that can confirm or rule out its predictions. The theory is still highly speculative, and it is difficult to make precise predictions about the behavior of fuzzballs in different environments.\n\nHowever, there are several potential avenues for testing fuzzball theory, including the study of black hole physics and the behavior of matter in extreme environments. The development of new experimental techniques, such as gravitational wave astronomy, could also provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of fuzzballs and test the predictions of fuzzball theory.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on April 23, 1981, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has spent his life pushing the limits of human potential in the sport of rock climbing.\n\n# Early life\n\nChris Sharma grew up in a family of outdoor enthusiasts. His parents, Gita and Bob Sharma, were both passionate about nature and the environment, and they encouraged Chris to explore the outdoors from a young age. Sharma's early life was marked by a love of adventure and a desire to challenge himself physically and mentally. He began climbing at the age of 12, and it quickly became his passion.\n\nSharma's parents supported his climbing career, driving him to competitions and climbing destinations around the country. Sharma's early climbing experiences were shaped by his relationships with other climbers, including his mentor, Scott Frye. Frye introduced Sharma to the world of competitive climbing and helped him develop the skills and mental toughness necessary to succeed at the highest levels.\n\n# Climbing career\n\n## 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's competitive climbing career began in the mid-1990s, when he started competing in local and national competitions. In 1996, he won his first junior national championship, and he went on to win several more titles in the following years. Sharma's success in competitions was matched by his achievements in outdoor climbing, where he quickly established himself as one of the leading climbers of his generation.\n\nIn 2000, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Realization,\" a 5.15a route in Ceüse, France. This route was a major breakthrough for Sharma, as it marked one of the first times a climber had successfully completed a route of such difficulty. \"Realization\" cemented Sharma's reputation as one of the world's top climbers and set a new standard for difficulty in rock climbing.\n\n## 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was possible in rock climbing. He made the first ascent of \"Biographie,\" a 5.15a route in Ceüse, and he repeated several other difficult routes in the French Alps. Sharma's success in Europe was matched by his achievements in the United States, where he made the first ascent of \"Dreamtime,\" a 5.14d route in Utah.\n\nIn 2008, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love,\" a 5.15b route in Clark Mountain, California. This route was a major breakthrough for Sharma, as it marked one of the first times a climber had successfully completed a route of such difficulty in the United States. \"Jumbo Love\" cemented Sharma's reputation as one of the world's top climbers and set a new standard for difficulty in American rock climbing.\n\n## 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, Sharma continued to push the limits of what was possible in rock climbing. He made the first ascent of \"Golpe de Estado,\" a 5.15b route in Oliana, Spain, and he repeated several other difficult routes in the Spanish Pyrenees. Sharma's success in Europe was matched by his achievements in the United States, where he made the first ascent of \"The Practice of the Wild,\" a 5.14d route in California.\n\nIn 2010, Sharma made the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura,\" a 5.15c route in Oliana, Spain. This route was a major breakthrough for Sharma, as it marked one of the first times a climber had successfully completed a route of such difficulty. \"La Dura Dura\" cemented Sharma's reputation as one of the world's top climbers and set a new standard for difficulty in rock climbing.\n\n## Post 2013\n\nIn recent years, Sharma has continued to push the limits of what is possible in rock climbing. He has made the first ascent of several difficult routes, including \"El Bon Combat,\" a 5.15b route in Cova de l'Ocell, Spain. Sharma has also repeated several other difficult routes, including \"La Planta de Shiva,\" a 5.15b route in Villanueva del Rosario, Spain.\n\nSharma's success in rock climbing has been matched by his success in other areas of his life. He has become a prominent figure in the climbing community, known for his advocacy of environmental causes and his support of climbing-related charities. Sharma has also become a successful entrepreneur, founding several companies related to climbing and outdoor adventure.\n\n# Legacy\n\nChris Sharma's legacy in rock climbing is immense. He has pushed the limits of what is possible in the sport, making the first ascent of several routes that were previously considered impossible. Sharma's success has inspired a generation of climbers, and he continues to be a role model for young climbers around the world.\n\nSharma's impact on rock climbing extends beyond his own achievements. He has helped to popularize the sport, bringing it to a wider audience and inspiring a new generation of climbers. Sharma's advocacy of environmental causes has also helped to raise awareness of the importance of protecting the natural world.\n\n# Personal life\n\n## Zen\n\nChris Sharma is a practicing Buddhist, and his spiritual practice has had a profound impact on his life and climbing career. Sharma has said that his Buddhist practice has helped him to develop a greater sense of calm and focus, allowing him to perform at a higher level in his climbing.\n\nSharma's interest in Buddhism began several years ago, when he started reading books on the subject. He was drawn to the teachings of Zen Buddhism, which emphasize the importance of living in the present moment. Sharma has said that his Zen practice has helped him to develop a greater sense of awareness and appreciation for the world around him.\n\n# Notable ascents\n\n## Redpointed routes\n\n* \"Realization\" (5.15a), Ceüse, France\n* \"Biographie\" (5.15a), Ceüse, France\n* \"Dreamtime\" (5.14d), Utah, USA\n* \"Jumbo Love\" (5.15b), Clark Mountain, California, USA\n* \"Golpe de Estado\" (5.15b), Oliana, Spain\n* \"La Dura Dura\" (5.15c), Oliana, Spain\n* \"El Bon Combat\" (5.15b), Cova de l'Ocell, Spain\n\n## Onsighted routes\n\n* \"The Practice of the Wild\" (5.14d), California, USA\n* \"La Planta de Shiva\" (5.15b), Villanueva del Rosario, Spain\n\n## Deep-water solo routes\n\n* \"Es Pontas\" (5.14c), Mallorca, Spain\n* \"The End of the Line\" (5.14b), Mallorca, Spain\n\n## Boulder problems\n\n* \"The Story of Two Worlds\" (V15), Cresciano, Switzerland\n* \"The Game\" (V15), Cresciano, Switzerland\n\n# Bibliography\n\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Art of Climbing.\" Patagonia Books, 2011.\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Climbing Life.\" Climbing Magazine, 2009.\n\n# Filmography\n\n* \"King Lines\" (2007)\n* \"The Fanatic Search\" (2008)\n* \"Origins: Oliana\" (2012)\n* \"A Little Obsessed\" (2014)\n\n# Competitions\n\n* 1996: Junior National Champion\n* 1997: Junior National Champion\n* 1998: Junior National Champion\n* 1999: Adult National Champion\n* 2000: Adult National Champion\n\n# See also\n\n* Alex Honnold\n* Tommy Caldwell\n* Adam Ondra\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n* Chris Sharma's climbing career is ongoing, and this article may not reflect his current or future achievements.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Chris Sharma's official website\n* Chris Sharma's Instagram page\n* Chris Sharma's Facebook page", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Sharma\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Climbing career\n##1996–2002 (to Realization)\n##2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n##2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n##Post 2013\n#Legacy\n#Personal life\n##Zen\n#Notable ascents\n##Redpointed routes\n##Onsighted routes\n##Deep-water solo routes\n##Boulder problems\n#Bibliography\n#Filmography\n#Competitions\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is often associated with Scottish and Irish heritage, but its origins and use extend far beyond these cultures. Tartan has played a significant role in the history of textiles, fashion, and cultural identity, and its significance continues to evolve to this day.\n\nEtymology and Terminology\n-------------------------\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which referred to a type of woolen cloth. The term has been used in English since the 16th century to describe the specific type of plaid pattern that is characteristic of Scottish and Irish textiles. In Scotland, the term \"sett\" is often used to describe a specific tartan pattern, while in Ireland, the term \"plaid\" is more commonly used.\n\nWeaving and Design\n-----------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan is created using a specific type of weaving construction called a \"twill\" weave. This type of weave involves passing the weft yarn over and under the warp yarn in a diagonal pattern, creating a crisscrossed effect. The twill weave is strong and durable, making it well-suited for textiles that need to withstand heavy use.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nTartan patterns can be broadly classified into several styles, including:\n\n* **Symmetrical**: This style features a symmetrical pattern of colors and stripes.\n* **Asymmetrical**: This style features an asymmetrical pattern of colors and stripes.\n* **Muted**: This style features muted, subtle colors and a more restrained pattern.\n* **Bright**: This style features bright, bold colors and a more vibrant pattern.\n\nIn addition to these styles, tartan patterns can also be classified according to their design principles, including:\n\n* **Simple**: This style features a simple, repetitive pattern of colors and stripes.\n* **Complex**: This style features a more complex, intricate pattern of colors and stripes.\n* **Geometric**: This style features a geometric pattern of shapes and colors.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan patterns often feature a specific palette of colors, which can have specific meanings and associations. For example:\n\n* **Red**: often associated with energy, passion, and courage.\n* **Blue**: often associated with calmness, trust, and loyalty.\n* **Green**: often associated with nature, growth, and harmony.\n* **Yellow**: often associated with happiness, optimism, and sunshine.\n\nIn addition to these color associations, tartan patterns can also feature specific motifs and symbols, such as:\n\n* **Thistles**: often associated with Scotland and Scottish heritage.\n* **Shamrocks**: often associated with Ireland and Irish heritage.\n* **Celtic knots**: often associated with Celtic culture and heritage.\n\nEarly History\n-------------\n\n### Pre-Medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan date back to ancient times, with evidence of tartan-like patterns found in the textiles of ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, tartan patterns were used in the textiles of various European cultures, including the Scots, Irish, and Welsh. Tartan was often used to identify specific families, clans, and regions.\n\n### 16th Century\n\nIn the 16th century, tartan became a popular fashion trend in Scotland, with the use of tartan patterns in clothing and textiles becoming widespread.\n\n### 17th Century\n\nIn the 17th century, tartan became associated with Scottish and Irish heritage, with the use of tartan patterns in textiles and clothing becoming a symbol of national identity.\n\n### 18th Century\n\n#### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nIn the 18th century, tartan became a symbol of Scottish and Irish resistance to British rule, with the use of tartan patterns in clothing and textiles becoming a way to express national identity and solidarity.\n\n#### Proscription and its Aftermath\n\nFollowing the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, the British government banned the use of tartan patterns in Scotland, in an attempt to suppress Scottish culture and identity. However, this ban only served to increase the popularity of tartan, with the use of tartan patterns becoming a way to express defiance and resistance.\n\nRegimental Tartans\n-----------------\n\nRegimental tartans are specific tartan patterns that are associated with specific military regiments. These tartans are often used in military uniforms and are an important part of military tradition and identity.\n\nClan Tartans\n-------------\n\n### Long-Running Debate\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the origins and authenticity of clan tartans, with some arguing that these tartans are ancient and traditional, while others argue that they are a relatively recent invention.\n\n### Earliest Evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 16th century, with records of specific tartan patterns being used by specific Scottish clans.\n\n### Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption\n\nDespite this early evidence, there is a lack of further evidence of the widespread use of clan tartans in Scotland prior to the 19th century.\n\n### 19th Century Broad Adoption\n\nIn the 19th century, clan tartans became widely popular in Scotland, with the use of these tartans becoming a way to express Scottish heritage and identity.\n\n### 20th Century Consolidation\n\nIn the

which featured a collection of Scottish tartan patterns and helped to popularize tartan patterns in England.\n\n#### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nQueen Victoria was a big fan of tartan patterns and often wore tartan outfits, which helped to popularize tartan patterns in England.\n\n#### Ripple Effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan patterns in England had ripple effects, with the use of tartan patterns becoming popular in other parts of the world, including the United States and Australia.\n\n### 20th Century to Present\n\n#### Diaspora and Globalisation\n\nIn the 20th century, the use of tartan patterns spread globally, with the use of tartan in clothing and textiles becoming popular in many different cultures.\n\n#### Industry and Politics\n\nTartan patterns have also been used in
