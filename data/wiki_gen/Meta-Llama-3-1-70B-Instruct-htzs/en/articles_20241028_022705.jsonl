Bagley is a former CIA officer who spent most of his career in the Clandestine Service, dealing with Soviet and Eastern European operations. He is best known for his involvement in several high-profile espionage cases, including the Popov, Golienewski, and Nosenko cases, which are still widely discussed and debated among intelligence historians and experts today.\n\n# Early life and education\n\nTennent Bagley was born on July 17, 1925, in New York City. He grew up in a family of modest means and developed an early interest in languages and international relations. Bagley attended the University of Michigan, where he studied Russian and Eastern European studies. After graduating in 1947, he joined the CIA, which was then still a relatively new organization.\n\n# Career\n\nBagley's CIA career spanned over three decades, during which he worked primarily in the Clandestine Service, dealing with Soviet and Eastern European operations. He served in various postings, including Berlin, Vienna, and Moscow, and rose through the ranks to become a senior officer. Bagley's expertise in Soviet affairs and his fluency in Russian made him a valuable asset to the CIA, and he was involved in many sensitive operations during his career.\n\n## Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n\nBagley's experience in the CIA gave him a unique perspective on the KGB-CIA war, which he later wrote about in his book \"Spy Wars.\" According to Bagley, the CIA's efforts to penetrate the KGB were consistently thwarted by the Soviet agency's skillful counterintelligence operations. Bagley argued that the CIA's failure to understand the KGB's methods and motivations led to a series of costly mistakes and setbacks, including the exposure of several high-ranking CIA officers.\n\n# The Popov Case\n\nOne of the most significant cases Bagley was involved in was the Popov case. Pyotr Popov was a Soviet GRU officer who defected to the CIA in the 1950s. Bagley was part of the CIA team that handled Popov's defection and debriefed him. However, the CIA's handling of the Popov case was later criticized for being sloppy and naive. Popov was eventually caught and executed by the KGB, and the CIA's failure to protect him was seen as a major embarrassment.\n\n# The Golienewski Case\n\nAnother significant case Bagley was involved in was the Golienewski case. Michal Goleniewski was a Polish intelligence officer who defected to the CIA in the 1950s. Bagley was part of the CIA team that handled Goleniewski's defection and debriefed him. Goleniewski provided the CIA with valuable information about Soviet intelligence operations, but his defection was later compromised by a KGB mole within the CIA.\n\n# The Nosenko Case\n\nOne of the most infamous cases Bagley was involved in was the Nosenko case. Yuri Nosenko was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in the 1960s. Bagley was part of the CIA team that handled Nosenko's defection and debriefed him. However, the CIA's handling of the Nosenko case was later criticized for being overly cautious and suspicious. Nosenko was subjected to prolonged interrogation and polygraph testing, which many felt was unnecessary and counterproductive.\n\n## Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n\nOne of the most bizarre incidents involving Nosenko was the \"Zepp\" incident. According to Bagley, Nosenko claimed that he had been involved in a KGB operation to assassinate a CIA officer using a poison umbrella. However, the CIA's investigation into the incident found no evidence to support Nosenko's claims, leading some to question his credibility.\n\n## More Nosenko\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Nosenko case, Bagley remained convinced that Nosenko was a genuine defector who had provided the CIA with valuable information. Bagley argued that the CIA's failure to trust Nosenko was a major mistake that had cost the agency dearly.\n\n# The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n\nAnother significant case Bagley was involved in was the KITTY HAWK / Shadrin case. Nicholas Shadrin was a KGB officer who defected to the CIA in the 1960s. Bagley was part of the CIA team that handled Shadrin's defection and debriefed him. However, the CIA's handling of the Shadrin case was later criticized for being sloppy and naive. Shadrin was eventually caught and executed by the KGB, and the CIA's failure to protect him was seen as a major embarrassment.\n\n# Rebuttal to John L. Hart's HSCA testimony\n\nIn the 1970s, Bagley was called to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) about the CIA's handling of the Nosenko case. Bagley's testimony was later rebutted by John L. Hart, a former CIA officer who claimed that Bagley had been mistaken about several key details. However, Bagley remained convinced that his version of events was accurate.\n\n# Reactions to his Spy Wars book\n\nBagley's book \"Spy Wars\" was published in 2007 to mixed reviews. Some reviewers praised the book for its detailed and nuanced account of the KGB-CIA war, while others criticized it for being overly simplistic and naive. Bagley's critics argued that his book failed to provide a balanced account of the CIA's operations and that it relied too heavily on anecdotal evidence.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nBagley's life and career have been the subject of several books and films. The most notable of these is the book \"The Spy Who Saved the World\" by Bryan Burrough, which tells the story of the Popov case and Bagley's role in it.\n\n# Personal life\n\nBagley is married with two children and currently lives in retirement in the United States. Despite his advanced age, Bagley remains active and continues to write and speak about his experiences in the CIA.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tennent_H._Bagley\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Bagley's Analysis of the KGB-CIA War\n#The Popov Case\n#The Golienewski Case\n#The Nosenko Case\n#Nosenko and the \"Zepp\" Incident\n#More Nosenko\n#The KITTY HAWK / Shadrin Case\n#Rebuttal to John L.

The film stars Mammootty, Bindu Panicker, and Kottayam Nazeer in lead roles. The movie follows the story of a brooding and introverted police officer who is tasked with solving a series of mysterious crimes.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film revolves around Luke Anthony, a troubled and introverted police officer who is struggling to come to terms with his past. He is tasked with solving a series of mysterious crimes that have shaken the small town of Perumbavoor. As Luke delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the crimes are linked to a mysterious figure from his past. The investigation takes a toll on Luke's mental health, and he begins to question his own sanity.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Luke's obsession with the case grows, and he becomes increasingly isolated from his colleagues and family. The film's title, Rorschach, refers to the psychological test used to assess a person's thought process and emotional functioning. Throughout the movie, Luke's perceptions and interpretations of reality are constantly challenged, leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is just a product of his imagination.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Mammootty as Luke Anthony, a brooding and introverted police officer\n* Bindu Panicker as Mariam, Luke's mother\n* Kottayam Nazeer as CI Siva, Luke's colleague and friend\n* Grace Antony as Sofiya, a young woman who becomes embroiled in Luke's investigation\n* Jagadish as DYSP Cheriyan, Luke's superior officer\n* Sanju Sivram as Siju, a local journalist who helps Luke with his investigation\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe idea for Rorschach was conceived by Nissam Basheer, who wrote the screenplay over a period of several months. Basheer was inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock and the Malayalam thriller films of the 1980s. He wanted to create a film that would keep the audience guessing until the very end. Mammootty was the first choice to play the lead role, and he agreed to do the film after reading the screenplay.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in February 2022 and lasted for several months. The film was shot on location in Perumbavoor and surrounding areas. The cinematography was handled by Nikhil S. Praveen, who used a combination of static and handheld shots to create a sense of tension and unease.\n\nThe film's editing was done by Saiju Sreedharan, who worked closely with Basheer to ensure that the pacing and tone of the film were just right. The sound design and mixing were handled by Tony Babu, who used a combination of diegetic and non-diegetic sound to create a sense of realism.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Midhun Mukundan, who created a haunting and atmospheric score that perfectly complemented the mood of the film. The soundtrack features several themes, including a haunting melody that plays during the opening credits.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was handled by the production company, Mammootty Kampany. The trailer was released in August 2022 and generated a lot of buzz on social media. The film's posters and teasers were also released, which helped to build anticipation among fans.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nRorschach was released in theaters on October 7, 2022.

The college has a rich history dating back to the 15th century, with various incarnations and transformations over the centuries. From its humble beginnings as a chantry to its eventual closure as a constituent college of Imperial College London, Wye College has played a significant role in the development of agricultural education and research in the United Kingdom.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Chantry\n\nWye College's origins date back to 1447 when a chantry was established by Cardinal John Kempe, Archbishop of York. The chantry was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and consisted of a chapel, a school, and a hospital. The chantry was endowed with land and revenue to support the education and welfare of the local population.\n\n### After abolition\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the monasteries during the English Reformation, the chantry was abolished, and its assets were seized by the Crown. The chapel and school continued to operate, but the hospital was closed.\n\n### Lady Joanna Thornhill School\n\nIn 1585, Lady Joanna Thornhill, a local benefactress, established a grammar school in Wye, which was later known as the Lady Joanna Thornhill School.

The college was funded by the Kent County Council and the Board of Agriculture.\n\n### Wye College\n\nIn 1902, the South Eastern Agricultural College was renamed Wye College, and its curriculum was expanded to include courses in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. The college became a center for agricultural research and innovation, with a strong focus on practical training and experimentation.\n\n### Imperial College at Wye\n\nIn 2000, Wye College merged with Imperial College London to become Imperial College at Wye.

The movie follows a family who is held hostage by a group of strangers in a remote cabin, and they must make a choice to save humanity from an impending apocalypse.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in a remote cabin in the woods, where a couple, Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Andrew (Ben Aldridge), are vacationing with their adopted daughter, Wen (Kristen Cui). One day, a group of four strangers, led by Leonard (Dave Bautista), appears at the cabin, claiming that the world is about to end and that they have been chosen to inform the family of their role in saving humanity.\n\nThe strangers, who include a nurse, a teacher, a cook, and a young woman, claim that a catastrophic event will occur unless the family makes a sacrifice. They demand that the family choose one of their own to be killed, in order to prevent the apocalypse. The family is initially skeptical and resistant to the strangers' demands, but as the situation escalates and the strangers become increasingly aggressive, they begin to question their own reality and the true nature of the threat.\n\nAs the family tries to find a way to escape and save themselves, they are forced to confront their own relationships and the secrets they have kept from each other. The film builds up to a tense and suspenseful climax, as the family must make a choice that will determine the fate of humanity.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jonathan Groff as Eric\n* Ben Aldridge as Andrew\n* Kristen Cui as Wen\n* Dave Bautista as Leonard\n* Abby Quinn as Adriane\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Sabrina\n* Rupert Grint as Redmond\n* William Ragsdale as Sherman\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was first announced in December 2021, with M.

The monument consists of four large granite stones inscribed with ten commandments or guidelines for human behavior. The Guidestones have become a source of interest and controversy, attracting both admirers and detractors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Georgia Guidestones, their history, description, and interpretations.\n\n# History\n\n## Construction\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were constructed in 1980 by a mysterious individual or group using the pseudonym R.C. Christian. The identity of Christian remains unknown to this day, but the story goes that he approached Joe Fendley, the president of the Elberton Granite Finishing Company, with a proposal to build a monument featuring a set of guiding principles for humanity. Christian provided a detailed description of the monument, including the language and design. Fendley was impressed by the plan and agreed to take on the project.\n\nThe construction of the Guidestones took several months to complete and required the expertise of local granite workers. The four stones were quarried from a nearby site and transported to a field in Elbert County, where they were erected in a circular pattern. The monument was completed in March 1980.\n\n## Reaction\n\nThe unveiling of the Georgia Guidestones on March 22, 1980, was a low-key event, with only a handful of local residents and journalists in attendance. However, as news of the monument spread, it began to attract attention from both national and international media outlets. Many people were intrigued by the mysterious nature of the Guidestones and the identity of R.C. Christian.\n\nWhile some people saw the Guidestones as a positive and thought-provoking addition to the landscape, others were more skeptical. Some criticized the monument as a symbol of elitism or a attempt to impose a set of authoritarian principles on humanity. Others saw it as a harmless curiosity, but one that lacked any real significance or meaning.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOn July 6, 2022, the Georgia Guidestones were damaged by an explosion. The blast destroyed one of the four stones, and the remaining stones were later demolished by authorities due to safety concerns.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe destruction of the Georgia Guidestones sparked a wave of reactions, ranging from sadness and outrage to jubilation and celebration. Many people expressed disappointment and frustration that the monument had been destroyed, while others saw it as a positive development.\n\nAn investigation into the explosion was launched by local authorities, but the identity of the perpetrators remains unknown. The destruction of the Guidestones has raised questions about the role of monuments and public art in society, as well as the importance of preserving cultural and historical artifacts.\n\n# Description\n\n## Inscriptions\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature ten inscriptions, each one providing a guiding principle for human behavior. The inscriptions are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The principles are as follows:\n\n1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\n2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity.\n3. Unite humanity with a living new language.\n4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason.\n5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.\n6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.\n7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.\n8. Balance personal rights with social duties.\n9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite.\n10. Be not a cancer on the Earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature.\n\n## Explanatory tablet\n\nIn addition to the inscriptions, the Georgia Guidestones feature an explanatory tablet that provides some background information on the monument and its purpose. The tablet reads:\n\n\"Astronomical Data: The center cluster of stones marks the true north. The center shaft points to the true north. The celestial pole is marked by a hole drilled in the stone at the top of the shaft. The remainder of the shaft is a sundial. The shadow of the end of the noon sun indicates the day of the year at noon on the equinoxes and solstices. The base of the shaft is marked with the coordinates of the center cluster – 34 13 30.00 N 82 53 19.00 W. A circle of four stones marks the cardinal compass points. The stones are also marked with the names of the eight languages used on the tablets. The stone in the SW corner of the circle bears a message in the eight languages. The four stones in the outer circle are aligned with the rising of the sun on the solstices and equinoxes.\"\n\n## Physical data\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones are constructed from four large granite stones, each one weighing approximately 20 tons. The stones are arranged in a circular pattern, with the center cluster of stones marking the true north. The center shaft is 20 feet tall and is topped with a small stone that marks the celestial pole.\n\n## Guidestone languages\n\nThe inscriptions on the Georgia Guidestones are written in eight different languages: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian. The languages were chosen to represent the major languages of the world, and the inscriptions are arranged in a way that allows the reader to compare and contrast the different languages.\n\n## Astronomical features\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones feature several astronomical alignments, including the alignment of the stones with the rising of the sun on the solstices and equinoxes. The center shaft is also designed to function as a sundial, with the shadow of the end of the noon sun indicating the day of the year at noon on the equinoxes and solstices.\n\n# Interpretations\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones have been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories over the years, ranging from claims that the monument is a symbol of a New World Order to allegations that it is a tool of mind control. Some people believe that the Guidestones are part of a larger conspiracy to control the population and impose a set of authoritarian principles on humanity.\n\nWhile these theories are unfounded and lack any credible evidence, they do reflect the widespread fascination with the Guidestones and the enduring mystery surrounding their origins and purpose.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mysterious monuments\n* New World Order\n* Population control\n* Sustainable development\n\n# References\n\n*none*\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Georgia Guidestones\" by Elberton Granite Finishing Company\n* \"The Message of the Georgia Guidestones\" by R.C.

The attack resulted in the deaths of ten people and injured three others. The perpetrator, identified as Payton S. Gendron, was arrested at the scene and later charged with multiple counts of murder and hate crimes.\n\n# Shooting\n\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 2:30 pm local time, when Gendron entered the Tops Friendly Markets supermarket located at 1275 Jefferson Avenue in Buffalo. He was dressed in tactical gear and armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun. Gendron began shooting indiscriminately at customers and employees, killing ten people and injuring three others. The victims were predominantly African American, and the attack was later characterized as a hate crime.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe victims of the shooting were identified as:\n\n* Roberta Drury, 32\n* Margus Morrison, 52\n* Andre Mackneil, 53\n* Aaron Salter, 55\n* Geraldine Talley, 62\n* Celestine Chaney, 65\n* Heyward Patterson, 67\n* Katherine Massey, 72\n* Pearl Young, 77\n* Ruth Whitfield, 86\n\n# Immediate Aftermath\n\nFollowing the shooting, the Buffalo Police Department and other emergency services responded to the scene. Gendron was arrested at the scene, and the supermarket was evacuated. The surrounding area was closed off, and a SWAT team was deployed to search for any additional suspects. The victims were transported to local hospitals, where they were pronounced dead or treated for their injuries.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the shooting was led by the Buffalo Police Department, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies. The investigation focused on Gendron's motives, his planning and preparation for the attack, and any potential connections to extremist groups or ideologies.\n\n## Investigation of previous threat\n\nIn June 2021, Gendron had made a threatening comment during a high school class, prompting a police investigation and a referral to a mental health professional. However, he was not charged with any crime, and the investigation was closed.\n\n## Weapons\n\nGendron used a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun during the attack. The rifle was purchased legally at a gun store in New York, while the handgun was obtained from an unknown source.\n\n## Manifesto\n\nGendron had written a manifesto outlining his motivations and ideology. The manifesto, which was shared online, expressed white supremacist and anti-Semitic views, and described his plan to attack a predominantly African American community.\n\n## Activity on chat logs & online diary\n\nGendron had been active on online chat logs and had maintained an online diary, in which he discussed his plans and ideology. The chat logs and diary were obtained by investigators, providing insight into Gendron's motivations and planning.\n\n# Legal Proceedings\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nGendron was charged with multiple counts of murder, attempted murder, and hate crimes. He was held without bail, pending trial.\n\n## State\n\nGendron was charged with ten counts of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted murder, and one count of domestic terrorism. He faced life in prison without parole if convicted.\n\n## Federal\n\nGendron was also charged with federal hate crimes, including 10 counts of hate crime resulting in death and 3 counts of hate crime involving an attempt to kill. He faced the death penalty if convicted.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## National\n\nThe shooting was widely condemned by national leaders, including President Joe Biden and New York Governor Kathy Hochul. The attack was characterized as a hate crime, and calls were made for increased gun control and measures to address white supremacy.\n\n## Twitch response\n\nGendron had livestreamed the attack on Twitch, a social media platform. Twitch responded by removing the video and banning Gendron from the platform.\n\n## Usage of Gendron's rhetoric by others\n\nFollowing the attack, Gendron's rhetoric and manifesto were shared online by some individuals and groups, sparking concerns about the spread of hate ideology.\n\n## Legislative\n\nThe shooting led to renewed calls for gun control and measures to address hate crimes. The New York State Legislature passed a number of bills aimed at addressing these issues.\n\n## Local\n\nThe shooting had a profound impact on the local community, with many residents expressing shock and grief. A memorial was established outside the supermarket, and community events were held to honor the victims.\n\n## International\n\nThe shooting was condemned by international leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe 2022 Buffalo shooting was one of the deadliest hate crimes in recent US history, highlighting the ongoing threat of white supremacy and gun violence. The attack led to renewed calls for action to address these issues, and sparked a national conversation about the need for greater gun control and measures to address hate ideology.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of mass shootings in the United States\n* List of terrorist incidents in the United States\n* White supremacy in the United States\n* Gun control in the United States", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Buffalo_shooting\" following this outline:\n\n#Shooting\n#Victims\n#Immediate aftermath\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n##Investigation of previous threat\n##Weapons\n##Manifesto\n##Activity on chat logs & online diary\n#Legal proceedings\n##Criminal charges\n##State\n##Federal\n#Reactions\n##National\n##Twitch response\n##Usage of Gendron's rhetoric by others\n##Legislative\n##Local\n##International\n#Legacy\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Anantarika-karma", "content": "#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Anantarika-karma\n================\n\nAnantarika-karma is a Buddhist concept that refers to a specific type of karma that is considered to be so severe that it leads to immediate rebirth in one of the lower realms of existence, such as the hell realms or the animal realm. The concept of anantarika-karma is central to the Buddhist understanding of the workings of karma and the nature of rebirth.\n\n## Definition\n\nAnantarika-karma is often translated as \"fixed\" or \"invariable\" karma, because it is considered to be a type of karma that is inevitable and cannot be changed or mitigated. It is said to be the result of actions that are so severe and negative that they override all other karma and lead to immediate rebirth in a lower realm.\n\n## Types of Anantarika-karma\n\nAccording to Buddhist teachings, there are five types of anantarika-karma, which are considered to be the most severe and negative actions that a person can commit. These five actions are:\n\n1. **Matricide**: Killing one's mother is considered to be one of the most severe actions a person can commit, because it is a betrayal of the person who gave birth to and nurtured them.\n2. **Patricide**: Killing one's father is also considered to be a severe action, because it is a betrayal of the person who provided for and protected them.\n3. **Killing an Arhat**: An Arhat is a person who has achieved enlightenment and is considered to be a saint. Killing an Arhat is considered to be a severe action because it is a destruction of a being who has achieved great spiritual realization.\n4. **Causing a schism in the Sangha**: The Sangha is the community of Buddhist monks and nuns. Causing a schism in the Sangha is considered to be a severe action because it leads to division and conflict among those who are dedicated to spiritual practice.\n5. **Shedding the blood of a Buddha**: Shedding the blood of a Buddha is considered to be the most severe action of all, because it is a physical attack on the embodiment of enlightenment and compassion.\n\n## Consequences of Anantarika-karma\n\nAccording to Buddhist teachings, committing one of the five types of anantarika-karma leads to immediate rebirth in one of the lower realms of existence. The specific realm that a person is reborn in depends on the severity of the action and the individual's karma. For example, killing a Buddha is considered to be the most severe action and leads to rebirth in the Avici hell, which is the lowest and most severe of the hell realms.\n\n## Mitigating Anantarika-karma\n\nWhile committing anantarika-karma is considered to be a severe and negative action, Buddhist teachings also offer the possibility of mitigating the consequences of such actions through spiritual practice and repentance. For example, a person who has committed anantarika-karma can engage in intense spiritual practice, such as meditation and prostrations, in order to purify their karma and mitigate the consequences of their actions.\n\n## Significance of Anantarika-karma\n\nThe concept of anantarika-karma is significant in Buddhist teachings because it highlights the importance of ethics and moral behavior. By understanding the severe consequences of negative actions, individuals can cultivate a sense of mindfulness and compassion, and strive to live a life of virtue and integrity.\n\n## Relationship to Other Buddhist Concepts\n\nAnantarika-karma is related to other Buddhist concepts, such as karma and rebirth. Karma refers to the idea that actions have consequences, and that the effects of our actions will be experienced in the future. Rebirth refers to the idea that the consciousness continues to exist after death and is reborn into a new body. Anantarika-karma is a specific type of karma that leads to immediate rebirth in a lower realm.\n\n## Cultural Significance\n\nThe concept of anantarika-karma has significant cultural and historical importance in Buddhist societies. For example, in Tibetan Buddhism, the concept of anantarika-karma is used to explain the importance of ethics and moral behavior, and to encourage individuals to cultivate a sense of compassion and mindfulness.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Karma\n* Rebirth\n* Buddhist ethics\n* Tibetan Buddhism\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (None)\n\nFurther Reading\n---------------\n\n* Buddhaghosa.

It is a vital resource that supports life, provides habitats for diverse species, and shapes the environment in which humans live, work, and interact. This article explores the concept of land, its physical characteristics, features, and layers, as well as its significance in the life sciences, human culture, and the environment.\n\nDefinition\n----------\n\nLand is defined as the solid surface of the Earth, excluding bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers. It encompasses a vast array of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras, each with unique characteristics and features. Land is a dynamic entity, constantly changing due to geological processes, human activities, and environmental factors.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe word \"land\" has its roots in Old English and Germanic languages, where it was used to describe a plot of ground or a territory. The term has evolved over time, incorporating various meanings and connotations. In modern usage, land refers to a broader concept, encompassing not only physical terrain but also the social, cultural, and economic aspects associated with it.\n\nPhysical science\n----------------\n\nFormation\n----------\n\nThe Earth's surface is composed of several layers, with the crust being the outermost solid layer. The process of land formation involves the movement of tectonic plates, which can result in the creation of mountains, volcanoes, and oceanic trenches. Weathering and erosion also play a significant role in shaping the landscape, breaking down rocks and sediments into smaller particles.\n\nLandmasses\n----------\n\nA landmass is a large area of land that is separated from other landmasses by oceans or seas. There are seven continents on Earth, each with its unique geological features and characteristics. The continents are: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.\n\nTerrain\n----------\n\nThe terrain of an area refers to its physical features, including mountains, hills, valleys, and plains. Terrain is shaped by geological processes, such as erosion, weathering, and tectonic activity. It plays a crucial role in determining the climate, vegetation, and human settlement patterns of an area.\n\nGeomorphology\n-------------\n\nGeomorphology is the study of the Earth's physical features and landforms. It examines the processes that shape the landscape, including erosion, sedimentation, and tectonic activity. Geomorphologists use various techniques, such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), to analyze and understand the complex interactions between the Earth's surface and the environment.\n\nClimate\n----------\n\nClimate refers to the long-term atmospheric conditions of an area, including temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns. Climate is influenced by various factors, such as latitude, altitude, and proximity to the ocean. It plays a significant role in shaping the landscape, determining the types of vegetation and wildlife that can thrive in an area.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nCoasts and islands\n------------------\n\nCoasts are the areas where the land meets the sea. They can be rocky, sandy, or muddy, and are shaped by the constant interaction between the ocean and the land. Islands are landmasses that are surrounded by water on all sides. They can be small or large, and are often formed by volcanic activity or erosion.\n\nMountains and plateaus\n----------------------\n\nMountains are natural elevations of the Earth's surface, often formed by tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions. They can be rugged and rocky, or gentle and rolling. Plateaus are elevated areas of land that are relatively flat on top. They can be formed by erosion or volcanic activity.\n\nPlains and valleys\n------------------\n\nPlains are flat or gently sloping areas of land, often formed by erosion or sedimentation. Valleys are low-lying areas of land between hills or mountains, often formed by rivers or glaciers.\n\nCaves and craters\n-----------------\n\nCaves are natural openings in the Earth's surface, often formed by erosion or volcanic activity. Craters are depressions in the Earth's surface, often formed by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts.\n\nLayers\n-------\n\nLand cover\n----------\n\nLand cover refers to the physical characteristics of the Earth's surface, including vegetation, soil, and rocks. It plays a crucial role in determining the climate, hydrology, and ecosystems of an area.\n\nSoil\n-----\n\nSoil is a complex mixture of minerals, organic matter, and living organisms. It provides habitat for plants, filters water, and stores carbon. Soil is formed through the weathering of rocks and the decomposition of organic matter.\n\nContinental crust\n-----------------\n\nThe continental crust is the outermost solid layer of the Earth's surface, making up the continents and the oceanic crust. It is composed of rocks and minerals, and is shaped by geological processes such as tectonic activity and erosion.\n\nLife science\n-------------\n\nLand biomes\n------------\n\nA biome is a large area of land that is characterized by a specific type of vegetation and climate. There are several types of biomes, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and tundras.\n\nFauna and flora\n----------------\n\nFauna refers to the animals that inhabit an area, while flora refers to the plants. Land is home to a vast array of species, each with unique characteristics and adaptations.\n\nHumans and land\n----------------\n\nCulture\n--------\n\nLand has played a significant role in shaping human culture, from the development of agriculture to the creation of art and literature. It has also influenced the way humans live, work, and interact with one another.\n\nTravel\n-------\n\nTravel refers to the movement of people from one place to another. Land has played a crucial role in the development of transportation systems, including roads, railways, and airports.\n\nTrade\n------\n\nTrade refers to the exchange of goods and services between different regions or countries. Land has played a significant role in the development of trade, from the ancient Silk Road to modern-day transportation networks.\n\nLand use\n---------\n\nLand use refers to the way humans use land, including agriculture, urbanization, and conservation. It has a significant impact on the environment, economy, and human well-being.\n\nLaw\n----\n\nLand law refers to the rules and regulations that govern the use of land. It includes property rights, zoning laws, and environmental regulations.\n\nGeopolitics\n------------\n\nGeopolitics refers to the study of the relationship between politics and geography. It examines the impact of land on international relations, including border disputes, resource management, and environmental issues.\n\nEnvironmental issues\n--------------------\n\nSoil degradation\n----------------\n\nSoil degradation refers to the decline in soil quality, often due to erosion, pollution, or overuse. It has a significant impact on agriculture, ecosystems, and human well-being.\n\nPollution\n----------\n\nPollution refers to the release of harmful substances into the environment. It can have a significant impact on land, including soil contamination, air pollution, and water pollution.\n\nBiodiversity loss\n-----------------\n\nBiodiversity loss refers to the decline in the variety of species that inhabit an area. It can have a significant impact on ecosystems, including the loss of ecosystem services and the decline of species populations.\n\nResource depletion\n------------------\n\nResource depletion refers to the decline in the availability of natural resources, including water, minerals, and fossil fuels.

From its humble beginnings as a novelty device to its current status as an indispensable tool for communication, the telephone has undergone significant transformations over the years. This article explores the major milestones and developments in the history of the telephone in the United States.\n\n# AT&T and the Bell System\n\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) played a pivotal role in the development and proliferation of the telephone in the United States. The company's history can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant events and transformations.\n\n## American Bell Telephone Company (1881–1899)\n\nThe American Bell Telephone Company was formed in 1881 by Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The company's primary objective was to commercialize the telephone and make it available to the masses. During this period, the company focused on expanding its network, improving the quality of service, and reducing costs. In 1885, the company established the first long-distance line between New York and Boston, marking a significant milestone in the development of the telephone network.\n\n## AT&T (1899–1982)\n\nIn 1899, the American Bell Telephone Company was renamed the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). The company continued to expand its network, and by the 1920s, it had established itself as the dominant player in the US telephone industry. During this period, AT&T invested heavily in research and development, leading to significant improvements in telephone technology. The company also introduced the first transcontinental telephone line in 1915, connecting the east and west coasts of the United States.\n\n## Research priority\n\nAT&T's research and development efforts were driven by a desire to improve the quality and efficiency of its services. The company's researchers made significant contributions to the development of new technologies, including the first practical transistor, the first commercial touch-tone phone, and the first electronic switching system. These innovations enabled AT&T to maintain its position as a leader in the US telephone industry.\n\n## Targeting an audience\n\nAT&T's marketing efforts were focused on targeting specific audiences, including urban and rural communities.\n\n### Urban public telephones\n\nIn the early 20th century, AT&T introduced public telephone booths in urban areas, providing easy access to telephone services for city dwellers. These booths became a common feature of urban landscapes, and their design evolved over time to include features such as phone books and coin-operated machines.\n\n### Rural telephone service\n\nAT&T also made significant efforts to expand telephone services to rural areas, where access to communication was limited. The company introduced the first rural telephone lines in the 1920s, connecting rural communities to the wider telephone network. This expansion was driven by the need to improve communication between rural areas and urban centers.\n\n## Breakup of AT&T in 1982\n\nIn 1982, the US government filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging that the company had engaged in monopolistic practices. The lawsuit led to the breakup of AT&T into seven regional Bell operating companies, each responsible for providing local telephone services. This breakup marked a significant shift in the US telephone industry, leading to increased competition and innovation.\n\n# Cellphones and smartphones\n\nThe introduction of cellphones and smartphones in the latter half of the 20th century revolutionized the US telephone industry. These devices enabled users to make and receive calls on the go, and their popularity grew rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 marked a significant turning point in the development of smartphones, with its touchscreen interface and app ecosystem setting a new standard for mobile devices.\n\n# Personnel\n\nThe personnel who worked for AT&T and other telephone companies played a crucial role in the development and operation of the US telephone network.\n\n## Switchboard and operators\n\nIn the early days of the telephone, switchboard operators played a vital role in connecting calls. These operators worked in large switchboards, connecting calls between different lines and providing assistance to users. As automation increased, the role of switchboard operators declined, but they remained an essential part of the telephone network.\n\n## Labor force: bias for and against women\n\nThe US telephone industry has a complex history of labor relations, with biases both for and against women. In the early 20th century, women were often employed as switchboard operators and telephone operators, as these roles were seen as suitable for women. However, women were also excluded from many technical and managerial positions, and they faced significant barriers to advancement.\n\n### Strikes\n\nTelephone workers, including switchboard operators and linemen, went on strike several times in the 20th century, demanding better wages and working conditions. These strikes often involved confrontations between workers and management, and they highlighted the tensions between labor and capital in the US telephone industry.\n\n## Hawthorne studies\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, AT&T conducted a series of studies at its Hawthorne Works factory, examining the impact of working conditions on productivity. These studies, known as the Hawthorne studies, found that improvements in working conditions, including better lighting and breaks, led to increased productivity. The studies also highlighted the importance of social factors, such as worker morale and job satisfaction, in determining productivity.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nAT&T and other telephone companies offered a range of employee benefits, including health insurance, pensions, and paid vacation time. These benefits were often seen as a way to attract and retain skilled workers, and they contributed to the development of a stable and loyal workforce.\n\n# Users\n\nThe users of the US telephone network were diverse and widespread, including businesses, households, and individuals.\n\n## Business\n\nBusinesses were among the earliest adopters of the telephone, using it to communicate with customers, suppliers, and partners. The telephone enabled businesses to expand their operations and reach new markets, and it played a critical role in the development of modern commerce.\n\n## Housewives\n\nHousewives were another key group of telephone users, using the device to manage household affairs and connect with family and friends. The telephone enabled housewives to access a wider range of goods and services, and it helped to reduce the isolation of domestic life.\n\n## Gender and culture roles\n\nThe telephone played a significant role in shaping gender and culture roles in the US. For example, the device enabled women to participate more fully in public life, while also reinforcing traditional gender roles. The telephone also played a role in shaping cultural attitudes towards communication and social interaction.\n\n## Telemarketing\n\nTelemarketing emerged as a significant industry in the latter half of the 20th century, with companies using the telephone to sell goods and services directly to consumers. Telemarketing was often seen as a way to reach new customers and increase sales, but it also raised concerns about privacy and consumer protection.\n\n## 9-1-1\n\nThe introduction of the 9-1-1 emergency number in the 1960s revolutionized emergency services in the US. The number enabled citizens to quickly and easily access emergency services, including police, fire, and ambulance.\n\n## Harassing calls\n\nThe telephone also enabled harassing calls, including prank calls, obscene calls, and threatening calls. These calls often caused significant distress and disruption, and they raised concerns about telephone etiquette and social responsibility.\n\n## Literary fears\n\nThe telephone has been the subject of numerous literary works, including horror stories and science fiction novels. These works often explored the darker side of the telephone, including its potential for surveillance, control, and manipulation.\n\n# See also\n\n* History of the telephone\n* Alexander Graham Bell\n* AT&T\n* Bell System\n* Cellular network\n* Public switched telephone network\n* Switchboard\n* Telephone exchange\n* Telephone operator\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Social and cultural studies\n\n* Claude S.

He has been a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly since 2004 and has held various ministerial positions in the state government. Shinde gained national attention in 2022 for his role in the Maharashtra political crisis, which led to the downfall of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and his eventual appointment as the Chief Minister.\n\n#Early life\n\nEknath Shinde was born on February 9, 1964, in the town of Dare, located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra. His family belongs to the Maratha community, a dominant caste in the state. Shinde's father, Sambhaji Shinde, was a farmer, and his mother, Yashoda Shinde, was a homemaker. He is the youngest of three siblings.\n\nShinde completed his primary education at a local school in Dare and later attended the Yashwantrao Chavan Vidyalaya in Mumbai. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Yashwantrao Chavan Open University in 1988.\n\n#Early political career\n\n##Entry into politics\n\nShinde's entry into politics began in the late 1980s, when he joined the Shiv Sena, a right-wing regional party founded by Bal Thackeray. At the time, the Shiv Sena was a relatively new party, but it had already gained popularity in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra.\n\nShinde started his career as a grassroots worker, participating in local campaigns and events organized by the Shiv Sena. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a member of the party's youth wing, the Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena.\n\n##Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n\nIn 2004, Shinde was elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency in Thane district. He has since been re-elected four times from the same constituency.\n\nDuring his tenure as a member of the legislative assembly, Shinde has held various ministerial positions in the state government. He was appointed Minister of Public Works (Public Undertakings) in 2005 and later became the Minister of Public Health and Family Welfare in 2009.\n\nIn 2014, Shinde was appointed Minister of Public Works (Excluding Public Undertakings) in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. He continued to hold this position until 2019, when the Shiv Sena formed an alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) to form the MVA government.\n\n#Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n\nIn June 2022, Shinde rebelled against the MVA government, leading a group of Shiv Sena MLAs who were dissatisfied with the party's alliance with the NCP and INC. The rebellion was sparked by a dispute over the distribution of ministerial positions and the party's overall direction.\n\nShinde and his supporters claimed that the Shiv Sena had compromised its ideology and values by forming an alliance with the NCP and INC, which they saw as ideologically opposed to the party's core principles.\n\nThe rebellion led to a constitutional crisis in Maharashtra, with the MVA government facing a vote of no confidence in the legislative assembly. The government ultimately collapsed, and Shinde was appointed Chief Minister with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\n#Chief Minister\n\nShinde was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra on June 30, 2022. His appointment was seen as a major upset, given that he was not a prominent leader in the Shiv Sena and had rebelled against the party's leadership.\n\nAs Chief Minister, Shinde has faced several challenges, including the task of rebuilding the Shiv Sena and restoring the party's credibility. He has also had to navigate the complexities of coalition politics, given that his government relies on the support of the BJP.\n\n##Electoral performance\n\nShinde has contested five assembly elections from the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency and has won each time. His electoral performance has been consistent, with him winning by a margin of over 10,000 votes in each election.\n\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n\nShinde's rebellion against the MVA government was also seen as a challenge to the leadership of the Shiv Sena, which has been dominated by the Thackeray family since its inception.\n\nThe Shiv Sena's leadership has been a subject of dispute, with some party members arguing that Shinde's rebellion was a legitimate response to the party's drift from its core ideology.\n\n##Political legitimacy\n\nShinde's appointment as Chief Minister has raised questions about his political legitimacy, given that he rebelled against the Shiv Sena's leadership and formed an alliance with the BJP.\n\nHowever, Shinde has argued that his government has the support of the majority of Shiv Sena MLAs and that his appointment as Chief Minister is therefore legitimate.\n\n#Personal life\n\nShinde is married to Lata Shinde, and the couple has three children. His son, Shrikant Shinde, is also a politician and has been elected to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.\n\nShinde is known to be a devout Hindu and has been involved in various social and cultural activities in his constituency. He has also been a strong advocate for the development of infrastructure in Maharashtra, particularly in the Mumbai metropolitan region.\n\n#Popular culture\n\nShinde has been the subject of several news articles and opinion pieces, particularly during the 2022 Maharashtra political crisis.\n\nHe has also been featured in various television news programs and has given interviews to several media outlets.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eknath_Shinde\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Early political career\n##Entry into politics\n###Maharashtra Legislative Assembly & ministries\n##Role in 2022 Maharashtra political crisis\n#Chief Minister\n##Electoral performance\n#Leader of Shiv Sena\n##Shiv Sena leadership dispute\n##Political legitimacy\n#Personal life\n#Popular culture\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is located in the Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 2,042.2 meters (6,700 ft) above sea level. The city is situated in the Darjeeling district and is the headquarters of the district. Darjeeling is known for its natural beauty, tea plantations, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n#Toponymy\n\nThe origin of the name \"Darjeeling\" is unclear. However, it is believed to be derived from the Tibetan words \"dorje\" meaning \"thunderbolt\" and \"ling\" meaning \"place\" or \"land\". Another theory suggests that the name is derived from the Lepcha word \"dor\" meaning \"thunder\" and \"je\" meaning \"land\". The name may also be derived from the Nepali word \"dor\" meaning \"thunder\" and \"ge\" meaning \"land\" or \"place\".\n\n#History\n\n##1780 to 1835\n\nThe area around Darjeeling was originally inhabited by the Lepcha people, who were later displaced by the Bhutia and Gorkha peoples. In 1780, the Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah annexed the area and incorporated it into the Kingdom of Nepal.

The father, Gertrude's husband, is having an affair with a younger woman, and their daughter is a social media influencer who is obsessed with her online presence. Meanwhile, Gertrude is struggling to keep the family together and maintain a sense of normalcy.\n\nAs the battle between Santa and the mercenaries intensifies, the family is forced to confront their own issues and work together to survive the night.

Known for her powerful, emotive voice and introspective songwriting, O'Connor was a critically acclaimed and influential artist who released several successful albums throughout her career.\n\nEarly life and education\n------------------------\n\nO'Connor was born in Glenageary, County Dublin, Ireland, to Sean O'Connor, a structural engineer, and Marie O'Connor, a dressmaker. She was the third of four children, and her parents divorced when she was eight years old. O'Connor's mother raised her and her siblings in a Catholic household, and she attended the Catholic girls' school, Laurel Hill in Limerick.\n\nMusic career\n-------------\n\n### 1980s\n\nO'Connor began her music career in the late 1980s, performing in Dublin folk clubs and pubs. She was discovered by Nigel Grainge, the head of Ensign Records, who signed her to a record deal in 1987.\n\n### 1987–1989: The Lion and the Cobra\n\nO'Connor's debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, was released in 1987.

He is best known for founding and leading FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, until its bankruptcy in 2022. Bankman-Fried's career has been marked by significant successes and controversies, including his views on charity and market regulation, the bankruptcy of FTX, and his subsequent arrest and trial.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSam Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California. His parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, are both professors at Stanford Law School. Bankman-Fried grew up in a Jewish family and was raised in Palo Alto, California. He developed an interest in mathematics and physics at a young age and attended Crystal Springs Uplands School in Hillsborough, California.\n\nBankman-Fried went on to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he graduated in 2014. During his time at MIT, he became interested in ethics and effective altruism, a philosophy that emphasizes using reason and evidence to maximize the positive impact of charitable donations.\n\n#Career\n\nAfter graduating from MIT, Bankman-Fried worked as a trader at Jane Street Capital, a quantitative trading firm, from 2013 to 2017. He then founded Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm that focused on trading cryptocurrencies, in 2017. Alameda Research became a significant player in the cryptocurrency market, and Bankman-Fried used his profits to fund his philanthropic efforts.\n\nIn 2019, Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, which quickly gained popularity among traders. FTX became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with billions of dollars in daily trading volume. Bankman-Fried's success with FTX made him one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of over $20 billion.\n\n##Views on charity and market regulation\n\nBankman-Fried has been a vocal advocate for effective altruism and has pledged to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime. He has donated to various causes, including pandemic prevention, animal welfare, and climate change mitigation.\n\nBankman-Fried has also been a vocal advocate for market regulation, particularly in the cryptocurrency space. He has argued that regulation is necessary to protect consumers and prevent market manipulation. However, his views on regulation have been criticized by some in the cryptocurrency community, who see him as being too cozy with regulators.\n\n##Bankruptcy of FTX\n\nIn November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, citing a liquidity crisis caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in the value of cryptocurrencies and a run on deposits. The bankruptcy was widely seen as a shock to the cryptocurrency market, and it led to a significant decline in the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe bankruptcy of FTX also led to a number of lawsuits and regulatory investigations, including a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a regulatory investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\n#Arrest and charges\n\nIn December 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with multiple counts of fraud and money laundering related to the bankruptcy of FTX. He was also charged with violating campaign finance laws by making millions of dollars in donations to politicians and PACs.\n\nBankman-Fried was extradited to the United States, where he was released on bail pending trial. His arrest and charges were widely seen as a significant blow to the cryptocurrency industry, and they raised questions about the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.\n\n#United States v. Bankman-Fried\n\nBankman-Fried's trial was widely followed in the media, with many observers seeing it as a test of the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.\n\n##Trial conclusion\n\nIn March 2023, Bankman-Fried's trial concluded with a guilty verdict on all counts. He was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud and money laundering, as well as violating campaign finance laws.\n\n##Second trial dismissed\n\nIn April 2023, a second trial against Bankman-Fried was dismissed due to lack of evidence. The trial had been related to allegations of tax evasion and had been seen as a significant threat to Bankman-Fried's freedom.\n\n##Appeal\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have announced that they will appeal the guilty verdict, arguing that the trial was unfair and that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove guilt.\n\n#Incarceration history\n\nBankman-Fried has been incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Brooklyn, New York, pending his appeal. His incarceration has been seen as a significant blow to the cryptocurrency industry, and it has raised questions about the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.\n\n#Donations\n\nBankman-Fried has been a significant donor to various causes, including pandemic prevention, animal welfare, and climate change mitigation. His donations have been seen as a significant contribution to the effective altruism movement.\n\n##Politics\n\nBankman-Fried has also been a significant donor to politicians and PACs, with many of his donations going to Democrats and progressive causes.\n\n###2020 and earlier\n\nBankman-Fried's early donations were focused on progressive causes, including the Democratic Party and various PACs. He donated millions of dollars to politicians and PACs, including a significant donation to the Democratic Party's presidential campaign in 2020.\n\n###2021–2022\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Bankman-Fried's donations shifted towards pandemic prevention and other causes. He donated millions of dollars to various organizations, including the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n###2022 U.S. midterm elections\n\nIn the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, Bankman-Fried donated millions of dollars to Democrats and progressive causes. His donations were seen as a significant contribution to the Democratic Party's efforts to maintain control of Congress.\n\n##Pandemic prevention contributions and related controversy\n\nBankman-Fried's donations to pandemic prevention efforts have been seen as a significant contribution to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, his donations have also been the subject of controversy, with some critics arguing that he has been too focused on pandemic prevention and has neglected other causes.\n\n##Attempts to recoup donations\n\nIn the wake of Bankman-Fried's arrest and charges, some of his donors have attempted to recoup their donations. However, it is unclear whether these efforts will be successful, and the issue remains a subject of controversy.\n\n#Personal life\n\nBankman-Fried has been known for his unconventional personal life, including his vegan diet and his interest in effective altruism. He has also been known for his relationships with various celebrities and business leaders, including Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic account of Sam Bankman-Fried's life and career.

It is a member of the genus Torreya, which is classified under the family Taxaceae. The species has been of great interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique characteristics and the threats it faces.\n\nSpecies discovery\n----------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia was first described by Arnold in 1838. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the species gained significant attention from botanists. In the 1920s, a thorough survey of the species' range was conducted, revealing a restricted distribution in the southeastern United States.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\n-------------------\n\nThe genus Torreya was named in honor of John Torrey, an American botanist who made significant contributions to the field of botany. The species name taxifolia refers to the resemblance of the tree's leaves to those of the yew (Taxus spp.).\n\nType species of genus Torreya\n-----------------------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia is considered the type species of the genus Torreya. This designation indicates that the species is the most representative of the genus and serves as a reference point for further classification.\n\nCommon names\n-------------\n\nTorreya taxifolia is commonly known as the Florida nutmeg or stinking cedar. The name \"Florida nutmeg\" refers to the tree's native range in Florida, while \"stinking cedar\" refers to the unpleasant odor of the tree's foliage.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\n### Technical description\n\nTorreya taxifolia is a coniferous tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The tree's trunk is typically straight and columnar, with a diameter of up to 1 meter. The bark is grayish-brown and scaly. The leaves are dark green, elliptical, and measure up to 5 centimeters in length. The cones are small, green, and measure up to 2 centimeters in length.\n\n### Subcanopy growth adaptations\n\nTorreya taxifolia has adaptations that enable it to grow in the subcanopy layer of forests. The tree's leaves are able to photosynthesize in low light conditions, allowing it to survive in areas with limited sunlight. Additionally, the tree's small size allows it to thrive in areas with limited space.\n\nDistribution\n------------\n\n### Wild population\n\nTorreya taxifolia is native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the states of Florida and Georgia. The species is found in the wild in a limited range, primarily in the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida.\n\n### Prehistoric distribution\n\nFossil records indicate that Torreya taxifolia had a wider distribution in the past, extending as far north as Virginia and as far west as Louisiana.\n\nEcology\n---------\n\n### Habitat\n\nTorreya taxifolia is typically found in well-drained, acidic soils in areas with high humidity. The species thrives in areas with limited sunlight, such as the subcanopy layer of forests.\n\n### Seed dispersal\n\nThe seeds of Torreya taxifolia are dispersed by animals, primarily birds and small mammals. The seeds are attractive to these animals due to their fleshy, edible coats.\n\nExtinction threats\n------------------\n\n### Vulnerabilities of restricted range size\n\nTorreya taxifolia's limited range makes it vulnerable to extinction. The species is susceptible to environmental changes, such as habitat destruction and climate change, which can have a significant impact on its population.\n\n### The die-off begins\n\nIn the 1950s, a decline in Torreya taxifolia's population was observed. The decline was attributed to a combination of factors, including habitat destruction, climate change, and disease.\n\n### The role of pathogens in the die-off\n\nPathogens, such as fungi and bacteria, have been identified as contributing factors to the decline of Torreya taxifolia. These pathogens can cause disease in the tree, leading to its death.\n\n### The role of habitat deterioration in the die-off\n\nHabitat deterioration, primarily due to human activities such as logging and development, has also contributed to the decline of Torreya taxifolia. The destruction of the tree's habitat has reduced its population and made it more vulnerable to extinction.\n\n### Focus on a stem canker fungus\n\nA stem canker fungus, Diplodia pinea, has been identified as a primary cause of mortality in Torreya taxifolia. The fungus causes lesions on the tree's stem, leading to its death.\n\n### Ultimate cause of die-off still unsolved\n\nDespite research, the ultimate cause of Torreya taxifolia's decline remains unsolved. It is likely that a combination of factors has contributed to the species' decline.\n\nConservation actions\n-------------------\n\n### Protect areas in species range\n\nEfforts have been made to protect areas within Torreya taxifolia's range, including the establishment of national forests and wildlife refuges.\n\n### List the species as endangered\n\nTorreya taxifolia has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and is protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n### In situ habitat improvement\n\nEfforts have been made to improve the habitat of Torreya taxifolia in situ, including the removal of invasive species and the restoration of degraded habitats.\n\n### Ex situ genetic safeguarding\n\nEx situ conservation efforts, such as the collection and storage of seeds, have been undertaken to safeguard the genetic material of Torreya taxifolia.\n\n### Document early horticultural plantings\n\nEarly horticultural plantings of Torreya taxifolia have been documented, providing valuable information on the species' cultivation and care.\n\nConservation controversies\n-------------------------\n\n### Assisted migration (the policy debate)\n\nThere is ongoing debate about whether to assist the migration of Torreya taxifolia to areas outside of its current range. Proponents argue that this could help the species adapt to climate change, while opponents argue that it could lead to the introduction of invasive species.\n\n### Management of seeds produced ex situ\n\nThere is controversy over the management of seeds produced ex situ, particularly with regards to their use in reintroduction programs.\n\n#### Seeds produced from official plantings\n\nSeeds produced from official plantings are typically managed by conservation organizations and are used in reintroduction programs.\n\n#### Seeds accessed by citizens\n\nSeeds accessed by citizens, such as those collected from private gardens, are often not managed in the same way as those produced from official plantings.

It is a unique and fascinating plant, known for its adaptations to growth in winter and early spring, its ability to fix nitrogen, and its toxic properties. In this article, we will explore the scientific name, common names, distribution, habitat, adaptations, seed dispersal, value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant, medicinal use, toxicity, and cultural references of Anagyris foetida.\n\n#Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of the plant is Anagyris foetida. The genus name Anagyris is derived from the Greek words \"ana\" meaning \"again\" and \"gyris\" meaning \"circle\", possibly referring to the plant's ability to regrow from its roots. The specific epithet foetida is Latin for \"foul-smelling\", which refers to the plant's strong, unpleasant odor.\n\n#Common names\nAnagyris foetida has several common names, including stinking bean trefoil, stinking bean tree, and Mediterranean stinking bean. It is also known as \"fève puante\" in French, \"faba fetida\" in Spanish, and \"fava fetida\" in Italian.\n\n#Distribution\nAnagyris foetida is native to the Mediterranean region, including Spain, France, Italy, Greece, and North Africa. It has been naturalized in other parts of the world, including California, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\n#Habitat\nAnagyris foetida grows in a variety of habitats, including dry scrublands, rocky outcrops, and open woodlands. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun.\n\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n\n##Summer leaf-fall\nOne of the unique adaptations of Anagyris foetida is its ability to shed its leaves in the summer months. This allows the plant to conserve water and energy during the hot, dry summer period. The plant then regrows its leaves in the winter and early spring, when water is more abundant.\n\n##Pollination by birds\nAnagyris foetida is pollinated by birds, which are attracted to its sweet, nectar-rich flowers. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are rich in nectar and pollen.\n\n#Seed dispersal\nAnagyris foetida has several strategies for seed dispersal, including soil seed banks, olive mimicry, and role of sheep.\n\n##Soil seed banks\nThe plant produces seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for many years. These seeds can germinate when conditions are favorable, allowing the plant to colonize new areas.\n\n##Olive mimicry\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida are similar in shape and size to those of the olive tree (Olea europaea). This may allow the seeds to be dispersed by animals that eat olives, such as birds and small mammals.\n\n##Role of sheep\nSheep are known to eat the seeds of Anagyris foetida, and can play a role in dispersing them to new areas.\n\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\nOther animals, such as goats, deer, and birds, may also play a role in dispersing the seeds of Anagyris foetida.\n\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\nDespite its importance, the exact mechanism of seed dispersal in Anagyris foetida is not fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the relative importance of different seed dispersal vectors.\n\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\nThe seeds of Anagyris foetida have tough, waterproof coats that allow them to survive for many years in the soil. This adaptation allows the plant to colonize new areas and to survive in areas with low rainfall.\n\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\nAnagyris foetida is a nitrogen-fixing plant, which means that it has the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by other plants. This makes it a valuable pioneer plant, able to colonize new areas and improve soil fertility. It is also a useful companion plant, able to improve the growth and productivity of other plants.\n\n#Medicinal use\nAnagyris foetida has been used in traditional medicine for many years. The plant contains a number of bioactive compounds, including alkaloids and flavonoids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.\n\n#Toxicity\n\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\nThe plant contains a toxic alkaloid called anagyrine, which can cause birth defects in animals. This has led to concerns about the safety of consuming products made from the plant.\n\n##Danger to children\nThe plant is particularly dangerous to children, who may be attracted to its sweet-tasting seeds.\n\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\nThe plant's toxic compounds can be transmitted to milk products, making them hazardous to consume.\n\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\nThere have been reports of accidental poisoning from Anagyris foetida in Algeria, where the plant is used as a food ingredient.\n\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n\n##Lysistrata\nThe plant is mentioned in the ancient Greek play Lysistrata, where it is used as a metaphor for the female genitalia.\n\n##Persistence of name\nThe name Anagyris has persisted in the botanical literature for many centuries, despite changes in the classification of the plant.\n\n#Gallery\n\n##Anagyris foetida\nA photograph of the plant in flower.\n\n##Avian pollinators\nA photograph of a bird visiting the flowers of Anagyris foetida.\n\n##Avian nectar thief\nA photograph of a bird stealing nectar from the flowers of Anagyris foetida.\n\n##Insect pollinators\nA photograph of an insect visiting the flowers of Anagyris foetida.\n\n#See also\nOther plants in the Fabaceae family, such as the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the pea (Pisum sativum).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anagyris_foetida\" following this outline:\n\n#Scientific Name\n#Common names\n#Distribution\n#Habitat\n#Adaptations to growth in Winter and early Spring\n##Summer leaf-fall\n##Pollination by birds\n#Seed dispersal\n##Soil seed banks\n##Olive mimicry\n##Role of sheep\n##Other possible mammalian and avian vectors\n##Unknown seed dispersal vector\n##Tough, waterproof seed coats\n#Value as a nitrogen-fixing pioneer and companion plant\n#Medicinal use\n#Toxicity\n##Alkaloid anagyrine a cause of birth defects\n##Danger to children\n##Hazardous tainting of milk products\n##Case of accidental poisoning in Algeria\n#Cultural references: Anagyris and Anagyrous\n##Lysistrata\n##Persistence of name\n#Gallery\n##Anagyris foetida\n##Avian pollinators\n##Avian nectar thief\n##Insect pollinators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The show was broadcast on Rede Globo and was produced by Endemol Shine Brasil.\n\nThe Game\n\nThe game of Big Brother Brasil 23 followed the same format as previous seasons, with a group of contestants living together in a house with cameras and microphones recording their every move. The contestants, known as \"housemates,\" competed in various challenges and games to win prizes and avoid eviction.\n\nFinal Prize Change Throughout the Season\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the first time in the show's history, the final prize was changed throughout the season. Initially, the winner was set to receive R$1.5 million, but this was later increased to R$2 million. However, on March 20, 2023, it was announced that the final prize would be reduced to R$1.8 million due to a new sponsorship deal.\n\nSuper HoH\n-----------\n\nThe Super HoH (Head of Household) was a new twist introduced this season. Each week, the HoH would have the power to save one housemate from eviction, in addition to the usual power to nominate two housemates for eviction.\n\nWithdrawal Button\n----------------\n\nThe Withdrawal Button was another new twist introduced this season. Located in the house's garden, the button allowed housemates to voluntarily leave the game. If a housemate pressed the button, they would be immediately removed from the game and their prize money would be forfeited.\n\nFeedBBB\n-------\n\nFeedBBB was a social media platform where viewers could interact with the housemates and influence the game. Viewers could vote for their favorite housemates and participate in games and challenges to win prizes.\n\nSelective Collection\n-------------------\n\nSelective Collection was a game where housemates had to collect specific items from around the house.

The invasion is the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II and has resulted in significant humanitarian, economic, and environmental impacts.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\n### Post-Soviet Relations\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and Russia maintained close economic and cultural ties. However, tensions began to rise in the mid-2000s over issues such as energy supplies, NATO expansion, and Ukrainian aspirations for closer ties with the European Union. In 2010, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, signed a deal with Russia that extended the lease on the Russian naval base in Crimea until 2042.\n\n### Ukrainian Revolution, Russian Intervention in Crimea and Donbas\n\nIn 2014, a popular uprising in Ukraine led to the ousting of President Yanukovych. Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, known as the Donbas War, resulted in the deaths of over 14,000 people and the displacement of millions.\n\nPrelude\n-------\n\n### Putin's Invasion Announcement\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a televised address in which he recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and announced the launch of a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.

The film is a semi-autobiographical account of Spielberg's own childhood and adolescence, exploring his early passion for filmmaking and the complexities of his family life.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe Fabelmans tells the story of Sammy Fabelman, a young boy who discovers his love for filmmaking after being taken to see a Cecil B. DeMille film by his parents. As Sammy grows older, he begins to use his camera to capture the world around him, often incorporating his family members into his amateur films. However, his family's dynamics become increasingly complicated when his parents, Burt and Mitzi, face marital problems, and Sammy struggles to reconcile his love for his family with his desire to pursue a career in filmmaking.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Sammy navigates the challenges of adolescence, including bullying, first love, and self-discovery. Through his experiences, he learns valuable lessons about the power of storytelling, the importance of family, and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe Fabelmans features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy Fabelman\n* Michelle Williams as Mitzi Fabelman\n* Paul Dano as Burt Fabelman\n* Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy\n* Keeley Karsten as Natalie Fabelman\n* Julia Butters as Reggie Fabelman\n* Jeannie Berlin as Haddie Fabelman\n* Judd Hirsch as Uncle Boris\n* Robin Bartlett as Tina Schildkraut\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe Fabelmans was first conceived in the early 1990s, when Spielberg began working on a semi-autobiographical script about his childhood. However, the project was put on hold due to various other commitments, including the production of Jurassic Park and Schindler's List.\n\nIn 2019, Spielberg revisited the script, drawing inspiration from his own experiences growing up in Arizona and California. He collaborated with screenwriter Tony Kushner to develop the story and characters, incorporating elements of his own family's history and dynamics.\n\n##Writing\n\nThe screenplay for The Fabelmans was written by Spielberg and Kushner, with input from various other writers and consultants. The script underwent several drafts, with the filmmakers working to balance the narrative's tone and pacing.\n\nSpielberg has stated that he drew heavily from his own childhood memories and experiences, incorporating elements of his family's history and dynamics into the story. He also drew inspiration from classic coming-of-age films, such as The 400 Blows and American Graffiti.\n\n##Pre-production\n\nPre-production on The Fabelmans began in 2020, with Spielberg and his team assembling a crew and scouting locations. The filmmakers chose to shoot on location in various parts of the United States, including Arizona, California, and New Jersey.\n\nThe production team also worked to recreate the look and feel of the 1950s and 1960s, incorporating period-specific costumes, props, and set dressing.\n\n##Casting\n\nCasting for The Fabelmans began in 2020, with Spielberg and his team searching for actors to play the Fabelman family and their friends.\n\nGabriel LaBelle was cast as Sammy Fabelman, with Michelle Williams and Paul Dano playing his parents, Mitzi and Burt.

His innovative ideas and designs paved the way for the development of modern technology, and he is considered one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n-------------------------\n\nLeonardo Torres Quevedo was born on December 28, 1852, in Santa Cruz de Iguna, a small town in the province of Cantabria, Spain. His family was of modest means, but his parents encouraged his interest in mathematics and science from an early age. Quevedo's father was a mathematics teacher, and his mother was a homemaker who managed the family's textile business.\n\nQuevedo received his primary education in his hometown and later attended the Instituto de Santander, where he excelled in mathematics and physics. In 1870, he enrolled in the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales y Puertos in Madrid, where he studied civil engineering. After completing his degree in 1876, Quevedo worked as an engineer on various projects, including the construction of roads, bridges, and canals.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\n### Cableways\n\nIn 1880, Quevedo designed and built a cableway system for the transportation of goods and people in the city of Bilbao. The system used a network of cables and pulleys to move cars along a suspended track, and it was a precursor to modern aerial tramways. Quevedo's design improved the efficiency and safety of transportation in the city and was later adopted in other parts of Spain.\n\n### Analogue Calculating Machines\n\nQuevedo was fascinated by the possibility of creating machines that could perform mathematical calculations automatically. In the 1890s, he designed and built several analogue calculating machines, including the \" Torres Quevedo's Direct Multiplication Machine,\" which could perform multiplication and division operations using a system of gears and levers.\n\n### Aerostatics\n\nQuevedo's interest in aeronautics led him to design and build several dirigibles, including the \"Quevedo's Dirigible,\" which was launched in 1902. The dirigible was powered by a steam engine and used a system of propellers to control its movement. Although the project was not successful, it demonstrated Quevedo's innovative approach to aerostatic design.\n\n### Radio Control: the Telekino\n\nIn 1903, Quevedo developed the \"Telekino,\" a system of radio control that allowed him to operate a boat remotely using a radio transmitter. The Telekino was a pioneering achievement in the field of robotics and paved the way for the development of modern radio-controlled systems.\n\n### Formal Language\n\nQuevedo was interested in the development of formal languages and proposed a system of logical notation that was later adopted by other mathematicians. His work on formal language laid the foundation for modern computer programming languages.\n\n### Laboratory of Automation\n\nIn 1911, Quevedo established the Laboratory of Automation in Madrid, which became a hub for research and development in the field of automation. The laboratory was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, and Quevedo worked with a team of engineers and technicians to develop new machines and systems.\n\n### Chess Automaton: El Ajedrecista\n\nIn 1912, Quevedo built the \"El Ajedrecista,\" a chess-playing automaton that could play chess against human opponents. The machine used a system of electromagnets to move the pieces on the board, and it was programmed to play according to a set of predefined rules.\n\n### Essays on Automatics\n\nQuevedo wrote several essays on automatics, including \" Essays on Automatics,\" which was published in 1914. The essays discussed the principles of automation and proposed new ideas for the development of automatic machines.\n\n#### Analytical Machines\n\nQuevedo's work on analytical machines led him to propose the development of machines that could perform complex mathematical calculations automatically. His ideas on analytical machines were later adopted by other mathematicians and engineers, including Alan Turing.\n\n### Naval Projects\n\nQuevedo worked on several naval projects, including the design of submarines and torpedo boats. His work on naval engineering led to the development of new technologies and systems that improved the efficiency and safety of naval vessels.\n\n### Other Inventions and Miscellaneous Activities\n\nQuevedo held over 100 patents in various fields, including aeronautics, automata, and computer science. He was also an accomplished linguist and translated several books on mathematics and science into Spanish.\n\n#### Esperantist\n\nQuevedo was an Esperantist and advocated for the use of Esperanto as a universal language. He believed that Esperanto could facilitate communication between people from different countries and cultures.\n\n#### Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n\nQuevedo compiled a dictionary of technological terms that was used by engineers and technicians in Spain and America. The dictionary provided a comprehensive list of technical terms and their definitions, and it was widely used in the industry.\n\nDistinctions\n--------------\n\nQuevedo received several awards and honors for his contributions to science and technology, including the Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso XII and the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic.\n\nPersonal Life, Religious Beliefs, and Death\n-------------------------------------------\n\nQuevedo was a devout Catholic and believed in the importance of faith and morality in science and technology. He was married to Maria Josefa González Alegre, and they had five children together. Quevedo died on December 18, 1936, at the age of 83, in Madrid, Spain.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nQuevedo's legacy is immense, and his contributions to science and technology have had a lasting impact on modern society. He is remembered as a pioneer of automation, artificial intelligence, and computer science, and his ideas continue to inspire new generations of scientists and engineers.\n\nIn Fiction\n------------\n\nQuevedo's life and work have been the subject of several books, films, and plays. His innovative ideas and designs have also been featured in science fiction stories and films.\n\nSelected Works\n----------------\n\n* \"Essays on Automatics\" (1914)\n* \"The Telekino\" (1903)\n* \"Torres Quevedo's Direct Multiplication Machine\" (1890s)\n* \"El Ajedrecista\" (1912)\n\nSee Also\n-------------\n\n* Automation\n* Artificial intelligence\n* Computer science\n* Aeronautics\n* Esperanto\n\nReferences\n------------\n\n### Notes\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\n### Bibliography\n\n* Quevedo, Leonardo Torres. \"Essays on Automatics.\" Madrid, 1914.\n* Quevedo, Leonardo Torres. \"The Telekino.\" Madrid, 1903.\n* Rodriguez, Juan. \"Leonardo Torres Quevedo: A Pioneer of Automation.\" Madrid, 2003.\n\nExternal Links\n------------------\n\n* [www.torresquevedo.org](http://www.torresquevedo.org)\n* [www.ieee.org](http://www.ieee.org)\n* [www.acm.org](http://www.acm.org)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Leonardo_Torres_Quevedo\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n##Cableways\n##Analogue calculating machines\n##Aerostatics\n##Radio control: the Telekino\n##Formal language\n##Laboratory of Automation\n##Chess automaton: El Ajedrecista\n##Essays on Automatics\n###Analytical machines\n##Naval projects\n##Other inventions and miscellaneous activities\n###Esperantist\n###Spanish-American Technological Dictionary\n#Distinctions\n#Personal life, religious beliefs and death\n#Legacy\n#In fiction\n#Selected works\n#See also\n#References\n##Notes\n##Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is situated near the Indo-Pakistani border and is known for its unique cultural and geographical characteristics. The valley is home to a small community of Brokpas, a tribe believed to be of Aryan descent, who have maintained their distinct culture and traditions despite being surrounded by the predominantly Buddhist population of Ladakh.\n\nGeography and Economy\n---------------------\n\nThe Aryan Valley is a small, narrow valley surrounded by the Karakoram range to the north and the Himalayas to the south. It is situated at an altitude of approximately 3,500 meters (11,483 feet) above sea level and is accessible only by a single road that connects it to the rest of Ladakh. The valley is watered by the Sindh River, which flows through it and provides irrigation to the local crops.\n\nThe economy of the Aryan Valley is primarily based on subsistence agriculture, with the local population growing crops such as barley, wheat, and potatoes. The valley is also known for its rich mineral deposits, including copper, zinc, and lead, which have been mined in the past. However, the mining industry has been largely inactive in recent years due to environmental concerns and lack of investment.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Brokpas\n\nThe Brokpas are a small tribe that inhabits the Aryan Valley and surrounding areas. They are believed to be of Aryan descent and have maintained their distinct culture and traditions despite being surrounded by the predominantly Buddhist population of Ladakh. The Brokpas have a unique language, customs, and rituals that are different from those of the rest of Ladakh.\n\nThe origins of the Brokpas are shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that they migrated to the Aryan Valley from Central Asia over 1,000 years ago. They have a rich cultural heritage, with a strong emphasis on music, dance, and storytelling. The Brokpas are also known for their expertise in metalwork, particularly copper and bronze, which they use to create intricate ornaments and utensils.\n\n### Aryan association and neologism\n\nThe term \"Aryan Valley\" is a relatively recent neologism that was coined to describe the valley and its inhabitants. The term \"Aryan\" refers to the Indo-European-speaking peoples who migrated to the Indian subcontinent over 3,000 years ago. However, the term has also been associated with racist and nationalist ideologies, particularly in the context of Nazi Germany.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend to associate the Brokpas with the Aryans, despite the fact that the two terms are not synonymous. While the Brokpas may be of Aryan descent, they are a distinct ethnic group with their own language, culture, and traditions. The use of the term \"Aryan Valley\" to describe the valley and its inhabitants has been criticized by some as being inaccurate and misleading.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Ladakh\n* Jammu and Kashmir\n* Brokpas\n* Aryan\n* Indo-European-speaking peoples\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of the Aryan Valley and its inhabitants.

The monastery was originally founded in the 12th century and has a rich history spanning over nine centuries. It has been an important center of Orthodox Christianity and Ukrainian culture, and its stunning architecture and beautiful artworks have made it a popular tourist destination.\n\nHistory\n---------\n\n### Early years\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1108-1113 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, the Grand Prince of Kiev, on the site of a previous church dedicated to St. Demetrius. The monastery was originally dedicated to the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of Kiev. In the 12th century, the monastery became a major center of learning and spirituality, attracting many monks and scholars from across the region.\n\n### 16th–17th centuries\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the monastery underwent significant changes. In 1508, the monastery was rebuilt and renovated after a devastating fire. The new buildings were constructed in the Ukrainian Baroque style, which was popular at the time. In 1620, the monastery was elevated to the status of a lavra, a high-ranking monastery in the Orthodox Church.\n\n### 18th century\n\nIn the 18th century, the monastery continued to thrive.

This phenomenon has occurred throughout history, often as a result of war, revolution, or regime change. In such situations, the embassy may continue to function, albeit with limited authority and legitimacy, in an attempt to maintain diplomatic relations with the host country and protect the interests of its nationals.\n\n# History\n\n## Russia (1917–1925)\n\nThe concept of an embassy without a government first emerged in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917. The fall of the Romanov dynasty and the subsequent rise of the Bolsheviks led to a period of turmoil and instability, during which the Russian diplomatic corps found itself without a clear government to represent.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1917\n\nDespite the collapse of the imperial government, Russian diplomats continued to staff embassies and consulates around the world. However, their authority and legitimacy were increasingly called into question. Many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, refused to recognize the Bolshevik government, and instead maintained relations with the Russian Diplomatic Corps, which claimed to represent the Russian people rather than the Soviet regime.\n\nThis situation led to a series of awkward diplomatic incidents, as Russian diplomats attempted to navigate the complex web of international relations without a clear government to back them. In some cases, Russian embassies and consulates continued to function, albeit with limited authority, while in others, they were forced to close or significantly reduce their operations.\n\n### Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThe situation was finally resolved in 1925, when the Soviet Union was formally recognized by the international community, and the Russian Diplomatic Corps was absorbed into the Soviet foreign ministry. However, the legacy of the embassy without a government continued to shape international relations, as countries grappled with the implications of diplomatic recognition and the role of embassies in representing governments.\n\n## Spain (1939–1977)\n\nAnother notable example of an embassy without a government occurred in Spain following the Spanish Civil War. The fall of the Republican government in 1939 led to the establishment of a dictatorship under General Francisco Franco, which was not recognized by many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nDespite the lack of recognition, Spanish diplomats continued to staff embassies and consulates around the world, albeit with limited authority and legitimacy. The Spanish Republican government-in-exile, which was recognized by some countries, maintained its own diplomatic corps, which operated in parallel with the Franco regime's diplomats.\n\nThis situation led to a series of diplomatic tensions, as countries navigated the complex web of relations with Spain. In some cases, countries maintained relations with both the Franco regime and the Republican government-in-exile, while in others, they refused to recognize either government.\n\n## Poland (1939–1990)\n\nThe concept of an embassy without a government also emerged in Poland following the outbreak of World War II. The fall of the Polish government in 1939 led to the establishment of a government-in-exile, which was recognized by many countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 1939\n\nDespite the lack of control over Polish territory, the government-in-exile maintained a diplomatic corps, which operated in parallel with the diplomatic missions of the Soviet-backed Polish People's Republic. This situation led to a series of diplomatic tensions, as countries navigated the complex web of relations with Poland.\n\nThe situation was finally resolved in 1990, when Poland transitioned to democracy, and the government-in-exile was dissolved. However, the legacy of the embassy without a government continued to shape international relations, as countries grappled with the implications of diplomatic recognition and the role of embassies in representing governments.\n\n## Afghanistan (2021–present)\n\nThe most recent example of an embassy without a government occurred in Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover in 2021. The fall of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan led to a period of uncertainty, during which the Afghan diplomatic corps found itself without a clear government to represent.\n\n### Diplomatic missions after 2021\n\nDespite the collapse of the government, Afghan diplomats continued to staff embassies and consulates around the world, albeit with limited authority and legitimacy. The Taliban, which has not been recognized by the international community, has established its own diplomatic corps, which operates in parallel with the Afghan diplomatic missions.\n\nThis situation has led to a series of diplomatic tensions, as countries navigate the complex web of relations with Afghanistan. In some cases, countries have maintained relations with the Afghan diplomatic missions, while in others, they have refused to recognize the Taliban regime.\n\n# See also\n\n* Diplomatic recognition\n* Government-in-exile\n* Embassy\n* Diplomatic relations\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Embassy_without_a_government\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Russia (1917–1925)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1917\n###Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n##Spain (1939–1977)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Poland (1939–1990)\n###Diplomatic missions after 1939\n##Afghanistan (2021–present)\n###Diplomatic missions after 2021\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
