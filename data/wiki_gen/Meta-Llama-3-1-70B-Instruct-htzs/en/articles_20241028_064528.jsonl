The acts were first introduced in the 17th century and continued to be passed until the 19th century. This article provides an overview of the background, passage, and renewal of the Mutiny Acts, as well as their impact on the armed forces.\n\n#Background\nThe Mutiny Acts were a response to the growing need for a professional and disciplined army in England. Prior to the 17th century, the English army was largely made up of part-time soldiers who were not subject to a centralized authority. However, with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the need for a more disciplined and organized army became apparent.\n\nThe New Model Army, established by Parliament in 1645, was the first professional army in England. However, the army's discipline and loyalty were tested during the Second English Civil War, when some soldiers refused to fight against the Scottish Presbyterians. To maintain order and discipline, Parliament passed the first Mutiny Act in 1649.\n\n#Passage of the first Mutiny Act\nThe first Mutiny Act, passed in 1649, was a temporary measure that gave the army's commanders the authority to punish mutinous soldiers. The act established a system of military justice, with courts-martial to try soldiers accused of mutiny and other offenses. The act also gave the army's commanders the power to impose harsh punishments, including execution, for serious offenses.\n\nThe Mutiny Act of 1649 was a significant innovation in English military law. Prior to its passage, soldiers were subject to the same laws as civilians, and military commanders had limited authority to discipline their troops. The act marked the beginning of a separate system of military law, which would be developed and refined over the next century.\n\n#Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\nThe Mutiny Act of 1649 was a temporary measure, and it expired at the end of the year. However, the need for a system of military law remained, and subsequent acts were passed to continue the provisions of the first act. The Mutiny Acts were typically passed for a period of one to three years, and they were often renewed or amended before they expired.\n\nThe renewal of the Mutiny Acts became a regular feature of English military law. The acts were passed to regulate the army's discipline, pay, and conditions of service, as well as to provide for the punishment of mutinous soldiers. Over time, the acts were expanded to cover a wider range of topics, including the organization and administration of the army.\n\n#The Quartering Acts\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in the 18th century to provide for the quartering of soldiers in England. The acts required local authorities to provide accommodations for soldiers, and they gave the army's commanders the power to quarter soldiers in private homes.\n\nThe Quartering Acts were closely related to the Mutiny Acts, as they helped to maintain order and discipline in the army. By providing for the quartering of soldiers, the acts helped to reduce the risk of mutiny and other disorders. However, the acts were also unpopular with local communities, who resented the burden of quartering soldiers.\n\n#List\n##England\nThe following is a list of Mutiny Acts passed in England:\n\n* 1649: Mutiny Act (1649)\n* 1650: Mutiny Act (1650)\n* 1652: Mutiny Act (1652)\n* 1653: Mutiny Act (1653)\n* 1654: Mutiny Act (1654)\n* 1655: Mutiny Act (1655)\n* 1656: Mutiny Act (1656)\n* 1657: Mutiny Act (1657)\n* 1658: Mutiny Act (1658)\n* 1659: Mutiny Act (1659)\n\n##Great Britain\nThe following is a list of Mutiny Acts passed in Great Britain:\n\n* 1702: Mutiny Act (1702)\n* 1703: Mutiny Act (1703)\n* 1704: Mutiny Act (1704)\n* 1705: Mutiny Act (1705)\n* 1706: Mutiny Act (1706)\n* 1707: Mutiny Act (1707)\n* 1708: Mutiny Act (1708)\n* 1709: Mutiny Act (1709)\n* 1710: Mutiny Act (1710)\n* 1711: Mutiny Act (1711)\n\n##United Kingdom\nThe following is a list of Mutiny Acts passed in the United Kingdom:\n\n###1800s\n* 1801: Mutiny Act (1801)\n* 1802: Mutiny Act (1802)\n* 1803: Mutiny Act (1803)\n* 1804: Mutiny Act (1804)\n* 1805: Mutiny Act (1805)\n* 1806: Mutiny Act (1806)\n* 1807: Mutiny Act (1807)\n* 1808: Mutiny Act (1808)\n* 1809: Mutiny Act (1809)\n\n###1810s\n* 1810: Mutiny Act (1810)\n* 1811: Mutiny Act (1811)\n* 1812: Mutiny Act (1812)\n* 1813: Mutiny Act (1813)\n* 1814: Mutiny Act (1814)\n* 1815: Mutiny Act (1815)\n* 1816: Mutiny Act (1816)\n* 1817: Mutiny Act (1817)\n* 1818: Mutiny Act (1818)\n* 1819: Mutiny Act (1819)\n\n###1820s\n* 1820: Mutiny Act (1820)\n* 1821: Mutiny Act (1821)\n* 1822: Mutiny Act (1822)\n* 1823: Mutiny Act (1823)\n* 1824: Mutiny Act (1824)\n* 1825: Mutiny Act (1825)\n* 1826: Mutiny Act (1826)\n* 1827: Mutiny Act (1827)\n* 1828: Mutiny Act (1828)\n* 1829: Mutiny Act (1829)\n\n###1830s\n* 1830: Mutiny Act (1830)\n* 1831: Mutiny Act (1831)\n* 1832: Mutiny Act (1832)\n* 1833: Mutiny Act (1833)\n* 1834: Mutiny Act (1834)\n* 1835: Mutiny Act (1835)\n* 1836: Mutiny Act (1836)\n* 1837: Mutiny Act (1837)\n* 1838: Mutiny Act (1838)\n* 1839: Mutiny Act (1839)\n\n###1840s\n* 1840: Mutiny Act (1840)\n* 1841: Mutiny Act (1841)\n* 1842: Mutiny Act (1842)\n* 1843: Mutiny Act (1843)\n* 1844: Mutiny Act (1844)\n* 1845: Mutiny Act (1845)\n* 1846: Mutiny Act (1846)\n* 1847: Mutiny Act (1847)\n* 1848: Mutiny Act (1848)\n* 1849: Mutiny Act (1849)\n\n###1850s\n* 1850: Mutiny Act (1850)\n* 1851: Mutiny Act (1851)\n* 1852: Mutiny Act (1852)\n* 1853: Mutiny Act (1853)\n* 1854: Mutiny Act (1854)\n* 1855: Mutiny Act (1855)\n* 1856: Mutiny Act (1856)\n* 1857: Mutiny Act (1857)\n* 1858: Mutiny Act (1858)\n* 1859: Mutiny Act (1859)\n\n###1860s\n* 1860: Mutiny Act (1860)\n* 1861: Mutiny Act (1861)\n* 1862: Mutiny Act (1862)\n* 1863: Mutiny Act (1863)\n* 1864: Mutiny Act (1864)\n* 1865: Mutiny Act (1865)\n* 1866: Mutiny Act (1866)\n* 1867: Mutiny Act (1867)\n* 1868: Mutiny Act (1868)\n* 1869: Mutiny Act (1869)\n\n###1870s\n* 1870: Mutiny Act (1870)\n* 1871: Mutiny Act (1871)\n* 1872: Mutiny Act (1872)\n* 1873: Mutiny Act (1873)\n* 1874: Mutiny Act (1874)\n* 1875: Mutiny Act (1875)\n* 1876: Mutiny Act (1876)\n* 1877: Mutiny Act (1877)\n* 1878: Mutiny Act (1878)\n* 1879: Mutiny Act (1879)\n\n#Marine Mutiny Acts\nThe Marine Mutiny Acts were a series of laws passed to regulate the Royal Marines.

The outbreak produced multiple tornadoes, resulting in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n#Meteorological synopsis\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the southern Great Plains on November 3, 2022, and began to move eastward. As the system strengthened, a dry line formed over western Texas, creating a focal point for thunderstorm development. A strong cold front trailed behind the low-pressure system, providing the necessary lift for thunderstorms to develop and intensify.\n\nAs the system moved eastward, it encountered a warm and moist air mass over eastern Texas and Oklahoma, leading to the development of a strong squall line. The combination of strong wind shear, instability, and moisture created an environment conducive to tornado formation.\n\n#Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 23 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on November 4.\n\n##November 4 event\n\nThe first tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on November 4, with multiple tornadoes reported in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n##November 5 event\n\nAdditional tornadoes occurred on November 5, as the system continued to move eastward.\n\n##Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak occurred on November 4, as a long-lived EF3 tornado touched down near Brookston, Texas, and moved northeastward into Oklahoma. The tornado caused significant damage and loss of life, with multiple fatalities reported.\n\n##Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n\nAnother significant tornado occurred on November 4, as an EF2 tornado touched down near Bogota, Texas, and moved northeastward into Oklahoma. The tornado caused significant damage and injuries, with multiple structures destroyed.\n\n##Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nAn EF1 tornado touched down near Cason, Texas, on November 4, causing moderate damage and minor injuries.\n\n##Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nA weak EF0 tornado touched down near Simms, Texas, on November 4, causing minor damage and no injuries.\n\n#Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak produced significant non-tornadic effects, including strong winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall. Multiple reports of wind gusts over 70 mph were received, with isolated areas experiencing gusts over 90 mph.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe tornado outbreak had a significant impact on the affected areas, with multiple fatalities and injuries reported. The economic impact of the outbreak was substantial, with multiple structures destroyed and significant damage reported.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tornado outbreaks\n* Tornado Alley\n* Severe weather\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive summary of the Tornado Outbreak of November 4–5, 2022.

Born in the early 18th century, Davis played a significant role in the development of the colony's print media, publishing several influential newspapers and magazines. He was also an active participant in local politics, serving in various capacities throughout his life. This article provides an overview of Davis's life, printing career, and political endeavors, as well as his lasting legacy in the history of North Carolina.\n\n#Early and family life\n\nLittle is known about James Davis's early life, including his exact date and place of birth. However, it is believed that he was born in the early 1700s, possibly in England or Ireland. Davis's family background is also shrouded in mystery, with no definitive records of his parents or siblings.\n\nDespite the lack of information about his early life, it is clear that Davis received a solid education, which would serve him well in his future printing career. He likely apprenticed with a printer or publisher, learning the skills necessary to operate a printing press and produce high-quality publications.\n\n#Printing career\n\nJames Davis's printing career spanned several decades, during which he published numerous newspapers, magazines, and other materials. His most notable publications include the North Carolina Gazette and The North Carolina Magazine.\n\n##North Carolina Gazette\n\nIn 1751, Davis began publishing the North Carolina Gazette, a weekly newspaper that would become a staple of colonial life in the colony. The Gazette covered a wide range of topics, including local news, politics, and commerce. Davis's newspaper quickly gained a reputation for its accuracy and reliability, earning the trust of readers throughout the colony.\n\nUnder Davis's editorship, the Gazette became a platform for discussing important issues of the day, including taxation, representation, and the role of government. The newspaper also featured articles on literature, science, and culture, reflecting Davis's own interests and tastes.\n\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n\nIn addition to the Gazette, Davis also published The North Carolina Magazine, a monthly publication that focused on literature, history, and culture. The Magazine featured articles, essays, and reviews written by some of the colony's most prominent intellectuals, including politicians, ministers, and scholars.\n\nThe North Carolina Magazine was an important outlet for the colony's literary and intellectual community, providing a platform for writers and thinkers to share their ideas and showcase their talents. Davis's Magazine also helped to promote a sense of colonial identity, highlighting the unique history, culture, and traditions of North Carolina.\n\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n\nIn the late 1750s, James Davis became embroiled in a controversy surrounding allegations of counterfeiting. Davis was accused of printing and distributing counterfeit currency, which led to a series of investigations and trials.\n\nAlthough Davis maintained his innocence, the allegations had a lasting impact on his reputation and business. The controversy surrounding his alleged involvement in counterfeiting led to a decline in subscriptions to the Gazette and a loss of public trust.\n\n#Political career\n\nJames Davis was an active participant in local politics, serving in various capacities throughout his life. He was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, representing the town of New Bern in the colonial legislature.\n\nDavis was also a vocal advocate for colonial rights and liberties, speaking out against British taxation policies and advocating for greater representation in government. His political views were reflected in his writings, particularly in the Gazette, where he used his platform to critique British policies and promote colonial interests.\n\n#Final days and legacy\n\nJames Davis's later years are not well documented, and little is known about his final days. However, it is clear that he continued to play an active role in colonial life until his death, which likely occurred in the late 1770s or early 1780s.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his alleged involvement in counterfeiting, James Davis's legacy as a printer, journalist, and politician remains significant. He played a crucial role in the development of North Carolina's print media, publishing influential newspapers and magazines that helped shape the colony's literary and intellectual culture.\n\nDavis's contributions to colonial politics are also noteworthy, particularly his advocacy for colonial rights and liberties. His writings and speeches helped to promote a sense of colonial identity and resistance to British rule, laying the groundwork for the American Revolution.\n\n#See also\n\n* Colonial American journalism\n* North Carolina in the American Revolution\n* List of colonial American newspapers\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is based on available sources and is intended to provide a general overview of James Davis's life and career.\n\n#Citations\n\nNone.\n\n#Bibliography\n\nNone.\n\n#External links\n\nNone.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Davis_(printer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and family life\n#Printing career\n##North Carolina Gazette\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n#Political career\n#Final days and legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a sequel to the 1986 film Top Gun and stars Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, and Val Kilmer.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place 34 years after the events of the first film. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot and captain in the United States Navy, who is assigned to return to the Top Gun program as an instructor. Maverick is tasked with training a new generation of fighter pilots, including Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick's late friend and Radar Intercept Officer, Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.\n\nMaverick is ordered to prepare the pilots for a mission to destroy a uranium enrichment facility in an unnamed enemy country, which requires flying into a heavily defended valley. Maverick is hesitant to follow orders, feeling that the mission is too reckless and will put the pilots in harm's way. He clashes with his superior, Vice Admiral Cyclone (Jon Hamm), who insists that the mission must be carried out.\n\nAs Maverick trains the pilots, he also rekindles his romance with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), a former love interest.

The incident sparked widespread controversy, debate, and media attention, and had significant repercussions for both individuals involved, as well as the film industry as a whole.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards ceremony was held on March 27, 2022, to honor the best in film for 2021. Chris Rock, an American comedian and actor, was chosen to host the ceremony for the second time. Will Smith, an American actor and rapper, was nominated for Best Actor for his role in King Richard. The ceremony was attended by numerous celebrities and industry professionals, and was broadcast live on television worldwide.\n\nIncident\n--------\n\nDuring the ceremony, Chris Rock took the stage to present the award for Best Documentary Feature. Before announcing the winner, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's wife, saying \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.\" The joke was a reference to Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had due to her struggles with alopecia. Will Smith initially laughed at the joke, but then walked on stage and slapped Rock in the face.\n\nPhotograph\n----------\n\nA photograph of the slap, taken by Chris Pizzello of the Associated Press, was widely circulated on social media and became one of the most iconic images of the incident. The photograph shows Smith's hand making contact with Rock's face, with Rock's eyes wide in shock and Smith's face contorted in anger.\n\nUncensored viewership\n--------------------\n\nThe incident was broadcast live on television, but many viewers did not see the slap in real-time due to censorship. In the United States, the ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which cut away to a commercial break immediately after the slap. However, viewers in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, saw the incident uncensored.\n\nAdditional videos\n-----------------\n\nIn the days following the incident, additional videos and footage emerged showing the slap from different angles and perspectives. One video, taken by a member of the audience, showed Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith laughing and applauding after the slap, while another video showed Smith's son Jaden Smith reacting with shock and horror.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nInitial response\n----------------\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, there was widespread shock and confusion among the audience and viewers at home. Many people took to social media to express their reactions, with some defending Smith's actions and others condemning them. Chris Rock's team released a statement saying that Rock was \"shaken\" by the incident, but was \"doing fine.\"\n\nPublic apologies\n----------------\n\nOn March 28, 2022, Will Smith released a public apology for his actions, saying \"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.\" Chris Rock did not publicly respond to the apology, but his team released a statement saying that Rock was \"still processing\" the incident.\n\nFormal Academy review\n---------------------\n\nOn March 28, 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) announced that it would be conducting a formal review of the incident. The review would examine the circumstances surrounding the slap and determine whether any disciplinary action should be taken against Smith.\n\nResignation and ban\n------------------\n\nOn April 1, 2022, Will Smith announced that he was resigning from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, effective immediately. The Academy accepted his resignation and subsequently banned him from attending the Oscars for the next 10 years.\n\nSmith film delayed\n-----------------\n\nIn the wake of the incident, Smith's upcoming film Emancipation was delayed indefinitely. The film, which was set to be released in 2022, was a major project for Smith and was expected to be a major awards contender.\n\nLater responses\n----------------\n\nIn the months following the incident, both Chris Rock and Will Smith continued to address the slap in various ways. Rock incorporated the incident into his stand-up comedy routine, making jokes about the slap and Smith's behavior. Smith, on the other hand, continued to apologize for his actions and expressed remorse for the harm he had caused.\n\nReactions\n---------\n\nCrew of Summer of Soul\n----------------------\n\nThe crew of the documentary film Summer of Soul, which won the award for Best Documentary Feature at the 94th Academy Awards, released a statement condemning Smith's behavior and expressing support for Chris Rock.\n\nIndividuals\n------------\n\nMany celebrities and industry professionals weighed in on the incident, with some defending Smith's actions and others condemning them. Actress Tiffany Haddish, for example, defended Smith's behavior, saying \"I love Will Smith. I don't know what happened, but I know that he's a good person.\"\n\nComedians\n----------\n\nMany comedians, including Kevin Hart and Trevor Noah, addressed the incident in their stand-up routines, making jokes about the slap and Smith's behavior.\n\nPoliticians\n------------\n\nSome politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, weighed in on the incident, with Cruz calling for Smith to be stripped of his Oscar.\n\nAccusations of staging\n----------------------\n\nSome people accused Chris Rock and Will Smith of staging the incident as a publicity stunt, but there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nAlopecia awareness\n------------------\n\nThe incident raised awareness about alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss. Jada Pinkett Smith has been open about her struggles with alopecia, and the incident sparked a wider conversation about the condition.\n\nViews on criminality\n----------------------\n\nSome people argued that Smith's behavior was a form of assault and that he should be held criminally liable. Others argued that the incident was a minor scuffle and that Smith should not face serious consequences.\n\nMemes\n------\n\nThe incident spawned a wave of memes and jokes on social media, with many people making light of the situation.\n\nAnalysis\n----------\n\nPotential causes\n----------------\n\nThere are many potential causes for Will Smith's behavior, including stress, anxiety, and a sense of protectiveness towards his wife. Some people also speculated that Smith may have been reacting to a perceived slight or insult from Chris Rock.\n\nComparisons with historic Academy incidents\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe incident was compared to other historic incidents at the Academy Awards, including the infamous Marlon Brando-Oscar controversy in 1973.\n\nFinancial impact\n----------------\n\nThe incident had a significant financial impact on the film industry, with many people speculating about the potential consequences for Smith's career and the box office performance of his upcoming films.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* 94th Academy Awards\n* Chris Rock\n* Will Smith\n* Jada Pinkett Smith\n* Alopecia\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Rock–Will_Smith_slapping_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Incident\n##Photograph\n##Uncensored viewership\n##Additional videos\n#Aftermath\n##Initial response\n##Public apologies\n##Formal Academy review\n##Resignation and ban\n##Smith film delayed\n##Later responses\n#Reactions\n##Crew of Summer of Soul\n##Individuals\n##Comedians\n##Politicians\n##Accusations of staging\n##Alopecia awareness\n##Views on criminality\n##Memes\n#Analysis\n##Potential causes\n##Comparisons with historic Academy incidents\n##Financial impact\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case is being prosecuted by the Office of the Fulton County District Attorney, led by District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\n# Background\n\n## Prior to and during election day\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his campaign team made numerous public statements questioning the integrity of the election process in Georgia, which was seen as a key battleground state. On election day, Trump's team sent observers to polling stations across the state, where they were accused of intimidating voters and interfering with the voting process.\n\n## Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nAfter the election, Trump and his allies made repeated attempts to pressure Georgia state officials to overturn the results, which had been certified in favor of President-elect Joe Biden. Trump personally called the Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, and asked him to \"find\" enough votes to reverse the outcome. The call was widely reported and sparked outrage among Democrats and some Republicans.\n\n## Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nIn December 2020, a group of Trump supporters, including a former state legislator, created a set of fake electoral vote documents, which they submitted to the National Archives. The documents falsely claimed that Trump had won the election in Georgia and were intended to be used to challenge the legitimate electoral votes cast for Biden.\n\n## Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nIn January 2021, a group of Trump supporters, including a local election official, breached the security of election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia. The equipment was accessed and manipulated, potentially allowing the perpetrators to alter the outcome of future elections.\n\n## Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nThroughout the post-election period, Trump and his allies subjected Fulton County election workers to harassment and intimidation, including death threats and racist abuse. The harassment was widely condemned by Democrats and some Republicans, who accused Trump of inciting violence against public servants.\n\n# Indictment\n\n## Charges\n\nIn August 2023, a grand jury in Fulton County indicted Trump, along with 17 other defendants, on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, and other crimes. The indictment alleged that Trump and his co-defendants had engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n\n## Defendants\n\nThe defendants in the case include:\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale\n* Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon\n* Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\n* Georgia State Senator Burt Jones\n* Former Georgia State Representative Vernon Jones\n* A group of Trump supporters who created the fake electoral vote documents\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Surrender and booking\n\nOn August 24, 2023, Trump surrendered to authorities in Fulton County and was booked into the county jail. He was released on bond shortly thereafter.\n\n## Arraignments\n\nThe defendants were arraigned on the charges in late August 2023, with most entering not guilty pleas.\n\n# Pretrial motions\n\n## Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nIn September 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the charges, arguing that the prosecution was politically motivated and that the grand jury had been improperly empaneled.\n\n## Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nTrump's lawyers also filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the charges involved federal crimes and that the case should be heard in a federal court.\n\n## Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nIn October 2023, several defendants filed motions requesting a speedy trial and severance from the rest of the case.\n\n## Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nIn November 2023, the prosecution dismissed two counts of solicitation and one count of creating false documents, citing insufficient evidence.\n\n# Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n\n## Background\n\nIn October 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion alleging prosecutorial impropriety, arguing that District Attorney Fani Willis had improperly obtained evidence and had made public statements that prejudiced the case against Trump.\n\n## Hearing\n\nA hearing was held on the motion in November 2023, during which Trump's lawyers presented evidence and witnesses.\n\n## Ruling and aftermath\n\nThe court ruled that while Willis had made some improper statements, the evidence did not support the claim of prosecutorial impropriety.\n\n## Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nTrump's lawyers appealed the ruling, arguing that Willis should be dismissed from the case due to her alleged bias.\n\n# Guilty pleas\n\n## Proffer video leak\n\nIn December 2023, a video of a proffer session with one of the defendants was leaked to the media, revealing potentially damaging evidence against Trump and his co-defendants.\n\n# Trials\n\n## Date and duration\n\nThe trial is expected to begin in early 2024 and is expected to last several months.\n\n## Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nThe trial will be heard by a jury and will feature testimony from numerous witnesses, including election officials, Trump advisors, and former Trump campaign staff.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe case has sparked intense reaction from both Democrats and Republicans, with many seeing it as a test of the rule of law and the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and is subject to change as the case develops.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include citations or references.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor more information on the case, see the following articles:\n\n* \"Georgia Election Racketeering Prosecution: A Guide to the Case\" by The New York Times\n* \"Trump Indicted in Georgia Election Racketeering Case\" by The Washington Post\n\n# External links\n\n## Federal removal dockets\n\n* United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia: Trump v.

The earthquake had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread damage and loss of life. This article provides an overview of the tectonic setting, the earthquake itself, and the subsequent response and recovery efforts.\n\n#Tectonic Setting\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the Atlas Mountains, a region of significant tectonic activity. The Atlas Mountains are part of the larger African-Eurasian plate boundary, where the African plate is being pushed beneath the Eurasian plate. This process, known as subduction, has resulted in the formation of the Atlas Mountains and the creation of a zone of seismic activity.\n\nThe region is characterized by a combination of compressional and extensional tectonic forces, which have created a complex network of faults and folds. The most significant fault in the region is the Atlas Fault, which runs for over 500 kilometers and is responsible for much of the seismic activity in the area.\n\n#Earthquake\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake occurred at 3:45 pm local time on September 8, 2023. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale and a depth of approximately 10 kilometers. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Al Haouz Province, approximately 30 kilometers southeast of the city of Marrakech.\n\n##Mechanism\n\nThe earthquake was caused by a combination of compressional and extensional forces along the Atlas Fault. The faulting mechanism was characterized by a mix of reverse and normal faulting, indicating a complex tectonic setting.\n\n##Ground Effects\n\nThe earthquake caused significant ground effects, including shaking, liquefaction, and landslides. The shaking was reported to be intense, with many buildings and structures collapsing or suffering significant damage. Liquefaction, a process where water-saturated soil loses its strength and becomes liquid, was reported in several areas, causing buildings and roads to sink or collapse. Landslides were also reported in several areas, blocking roads and causing additional damage.\n\n#Damage and Casualties\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread damage and loss of life. According to official reports, over 2,000 people were killed and over 5,000 injured. The damage was estimated to be in excess of $1 billion, with many buildings, roads, and bridges destroyed or severely damaged.\n\nThe damage was particularly severe in the city of Marrakech, where many historic buildings and landmarks were destroyed or severely damaged. The city's famous Jemaa el-Fnaa square was severely damaged, with several buildings collapsing and many more suffering significant damage.\n\n#Search and Rescue\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were launched immediately after the earthquake, with teams from across Morocco and around the world responding to the disaster. The efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with assistance from international organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross.\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were challenging, with many areas inaccessible due to damage and debris. However, despite the challenges, many people were rescued, and the efforts were widely praised for their speed and effectiveness.\n\n#International Response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with many countries offering aid and assistance. The United Nations launched a flash appeal for $100 million to support the relief efforts, and many countries pledged significant amounts of aid.\n\nThe international response was led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which coordinated the relief efforts and provided support to the Moroccan government.\n\n#Recovery and Assistance\n\nThe recovery efforts were ongoing for many months after the earthquake, with many people still in need of assistance. The Moroccan government established a number of relief camps to provide shelter and support to those affected, and many international organizations provided aid and assistance.\n\nThe recovery efforts were focused on rebuilding damaged infrastructure, restoring basic services, and supporting affected communities.

As the full moon approaches, Bhaskar begins to experience strange and terrifying transformations, and he must navigate his new condition with the help of his friends and a local scientist.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Bhaskar's transformations become more frequent and intense, causing chaos and destruction in the small town where he lives.

The film's cinematography was handled by Jishnu Bhattacharjee, while the editing was done by Sreekar Prasad.\n\nThe film's visual effects were created by the company, Nirmal Singh, and were designed to bring the wolf transformations to life in a convincing and terrifying way.\n\n# Themes\n\nBhediya explores a number of themes, including the struggle between humanity and nature, the dangers of unchecked technological progress, and the importance of preserving traditional knowledge and ways of life.\n\nThe film also touches on the idea of identity and how it is shaped by our relationships with others and with the natural world. Through Bhaskar's transformations, the film raises questions about what it means to be human, and whether our sense of self is tied to our physical bodies or something more abstract.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's music was composed by Sachin-Jigar, with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The soundtrack features a mix of folk and contemporary styles, and includes the hit singles \"Thumkeshwari\" and \"Apna Bana Le\".\n\nThe music plays an important role in the film, helping to create a sense of atmosphere and tension, and underscoring the emotional moments of the story.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nBhediya was released in theaters on November 25, 2022, in Hindi, and was later dubbed into several other languages, including Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam.\n\nThe film received a wide release, playing on over 2,000 screens across India, and was also released in several international markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film was later released on home media platforms, including DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming services.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Critical response\n\nBhediya received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's unique blend of horror and comedy, as well as the performances of the lead actors.\n\nThe film's visual effects and cinematography were also widely praised, with many noting that the wolf transformations were convincingly brought to life on screen.\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film's pacing was uneven, and that the story could have been tightened up in places.\n\n## Box office\n\nBhediya was a commercial success, grossing over ₹150 crore at the box office worldwide.\n\nThe film performed particularly well in India, where it grossed over ₹90 crore, making it one of the highest-grossing films of the year.\n\n# Notes\n\nBhediya is the third installment in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy universe, following the films Stree and Roohi.\n\nThe film marked a return to the horror-comedy genre for Varun Dhawan, who had previously starred in the film Bhool Bhulaiyaa.\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bhediya\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n##Special appearances\n#Production\n#Themes\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Critical response\n##Box office\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The war has caused significant human suffering, displacement, and economic losses, and has become a major flashpoint in international relations.\n\n#Background\n\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, the country's early years of independence were marked by economic crisis, corruption, and authoritarianism. In 2004, the Orange Revolution brought about a peaceful transfer of power, with the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko becoming president. However, the revolution's promise of reform and closer ties with Europe was not fully realized, and Ukraine's politics remained marked by corruption and instability.\n\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's then-president Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking widespread protests in Kiev's Independence Square, known as the Euromaidan. The protests, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity, demanded greater integration with Europe and an end to corruption. However, the protests also triggered pro-Russian unrest in eastern Ukraine, where many residents have strong cultural and economic ties to Russia.\n\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nIn 1997, Russia and Ukraine signed a treaty allowing Russia to maintain a naval base in Crimea, which has been a strategic location for Russia's Black Sea Fleet since the 18th century. However, the treaty also recognized Crimea as part of Ukraine, and Russia's military presence in the region was subject to Ukrainian law.\n\n##Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised complex questions about the legality of war and the use of force. In 2014, Russia's annexation of Crimea was widely condemned by the international community as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has also been marked by allegations of war crimes and human rights abuses.\n\n#History\n\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn February 2014, following the ouster of President Yanukovych, Russian troops began to move into Crimea, citing the need to protect ethnic Russians and Russian military installations. On March 16, 2014, a disputed referendum was held in Crimea, in which the majority of voters supported joining Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian unrest broke out in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The unrest was marked by the seizure of government buildings and the declaration of independence by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.\n\n###Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict escalated into an armed conflict in May 2014, with the Ukrainian military launching an operation to retake control of the regions. The conflict has been marked by allegations of human rights abuses, including the use of civilians as human shields and the targeting of civilian infrastructure.\n\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops crossed into Ukraine, marking a significant escalation of the conflict. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed further sanctions on Russia.\n\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian forces launched an offensive to retake the strategic port city of Mariupol, which had been under siege by Russian-backed separatists. The offensive was successful, but was followed by a ceasefire agreement in Minsk, Belarus, which was brokered by Russia, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe ceasefire agreement was repeatedly violated, and the conflict continued to escalate. In February 2015, a second ceasefire agreement was reached in Minsk, which included provisions for a withdrawal of heavy weapons and the establishment of a buffer zone.\n\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, Russian ships fired on and seized three Ukrainian naval vessels that were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait, which connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The incident was widely condemned by the", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russo-Ukrainian_War\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n##Legality and declaration of war\n#History\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n###Armed conflict\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n###2019–2020\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n###Prelude\n###Escalation\n###Full-scale invasion\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n#Human rights violations\n#Related issues\n##Spillover\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n##Hybrid warfare\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n##Russia–NATO relations\n#Reactions\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n###Ukrainian response\n###NATO and United States military response\n###Financial markets\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n###United States\n###Russian military suppliers\n###United Nations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The storm caused significant damage and loss of life, particularly in the Philippines, where it made landfall as a tropical storm.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\n## Formation and intensification\n\nTropical Storm Megi formed on April 8, 2022, as a tropical depression over the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 kilometers east of the Philippines. The system slowly intensified as it moved westward, fueled by warm ocean waters and low wind shear. On April 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Megi.\n\n## Landfall and weakening\n\nMegi made landfall on the eastern coast of the Philippines on April 10, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to several provinces. The storm's center passed over the islands of Samar and Leyte, causing widespread damage and disrupting communication and transportation services. After landfall, Megi slowly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines.\n\n## Dissipation\n\nOn April 11, Megi's circulation began to dissipate as it moved over the Sulu Sea. The JTWC downgraded the system to a tropical depression, and later, to a remnant low-pressure area. The storm's remnants continued to bring scattered thunderstorms and gusty winds to several areas in the Philippines and Malaysia.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Philippines\n\nIn anticipation of Megi's landfall, the Philippine government declared a state of calamity in several provinces, including Eastern Samar, Samar, and Leyte. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency response protocols, deploying rescue teams, relief supplies, and equipment to affected areas.\n\n## Malaysia and other countries\n\nMalaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia also took precautions against Megi. The Malaysian Meteorological Department issued warnings for strong winds and heavy rainfall in several states, while the Thai government advised fishermen to return to port due to rough seas.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Philippines\n\nMegi caused significant damage and loss of life in the Philippines. According to official reports, at least 200 people died, while over 1,000 were injured. The storm destroyed thousands of homes, displacing tens of thousands of people. The agricultural sector also suffered heavily, with estimated losses of over PHP 1 billion (USD 20 million).\n\n## Malaysia and other countries\n\nIn Malaysia, Megi brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to several states, causing flash floods and landslides. At least 10 people died, while several hundred were evacuated to safety. In Thailand, the storm caused rough seas, disrupting fishing and tourism activities.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Relief efforts\n\nThe Philippine government launched a massive relief effort, deploying military personnel, rescue teams, and equipment to affected areas. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the Red Cross, also provided assistance.\n\n## Economic impact\n\nThe economic impact of Megi was significant, particularly in the Philippines. The storm disrupted several industries, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. The Philippine government estimated the total damage at over PHP 10 billion (USD 200 million).\n\n# Retirement\n\nIn May 2022, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) announced the retirement of the name Megi from its list of tropical cyclone names. The name was replaced by a new one, which will be used for future storms.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 Pacific typhoon season\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n\n# External links\n\n* Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) archives\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) best track data\n* Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) storm reports", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is set in 1920s Hollywood and follows the lives of several individuals during the transition from silent films to \"talkies.\" The film features an ensemble cast, including Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Jovan Adepo, and Tobey Maguire.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film is set in 1926, during the height of the Roaring Twenties in Hollywood. The story follows Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), a silent film star struggling to adapt to the new world of sound in cinema. He becomes embroiled in a romantic affair with Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), a young and ambitious actress who rises to fame during this period.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a young Mexican-American man, starts working as a film assistant and becomes infatuated with Nellie. As Nellie's star rises, Manny finds himself caught up in her chaotic world, which includes her tumultuous relationships and substance abuse.\n\nThe film also explores the lives of other characters, including Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li), a Chinese-American actress who becomes a rival to Nellie; Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo), a jazz trumpeter who performs on film sets; and James McKay (Tobey Maguire), a wealthy and enigmatic figure who becomes involved in the film industry.\n\nThroughout the film, the characters navigate the challenges and excesses of 1920s Hollywood, including the rise of sound in cinema, the exploitation of actors and actresses, and the corrupting influence of wealth and power.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer\n* Li Jun Li as Lady Fay Zhu\n* Tobey Maguire as James McKay\n* Olivia Wilde as Ina Conrad\n* Max Minghella as Irving Thalberg\n* Flea as Bob Levine\n* Lukas Haas as George Munn\n* Samara Weaving as Constance Moore\n* Rory Scovel as The Count\n* Katherine Waterston as Estelle LaRoy\n* Phoebe Tonkin as Jane Thornton\n* Jeff Garlin as Don Wallach\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nDamien Chazelle began working on the script for Babylon in 2019, shortly after the release of his previous film, First Man. Chazelle was inspired by the excesses and decadence of 1920s Hollywood, as well as the challenges faced by actors and actresses during the transition from silent films to sound.\n\nChazelle spent several years researching the period and developing the characters and storylines. He drew inspiration from a range of sources, including the lives of real-life Hollywood stars such as Clara Bow and John Gilbert, as well as the films of directors such as Cecil B. DeMille and Ernst Lubitsch.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for Babylon began in April 2021, with a budget of over $78 million. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, including the historic Greystone Mansion, which served as the exterior of Jack Conrad's mansion.\n\nThe film's cinematographer, Linus Sandgren, used a range of techniques to capture the look and feel of 1920s Hollywood. These included the use of practical lighting, as well as the creation of elaborate sets and costumes.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who had previously collaborated with Chazelle on La La Land and First Man. The score incorporates a range of jazz and blues influences, reflecting the musical styles of the 1920s.\n\nIn addition to the original score, the film features a range of period-specific songs, including jazz standards by Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong.\n\n#Themes\n\nBabylon explores a range of themes, including the corrupting influence of wealth and power, the exploitation of actors and actresses, and the challenges faced by individuals during times of change.\n\nThe film also explores the tension between art and commerce, as the characters navigate the shift from silent films to sound. This tension is reflected in the character of Jack Conrad, who struggles to adapt to the new world of sound in cinema.\n\nThe film also touches on issues of racism and sexism, reflecting the prejudices and biases of the time period.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in theaters on December 23, 2022. The film received a limited release, opening on 600 screens in the United States and Canada.\n\n##Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms on January 31, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on February 21, 2023.\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign included a range of trailers and promotional materials, as well as a series of promotional events and premieres.\n\nThe film's trailer was released in October 2022, and received widespread attention for its depiction of the excesses and decadence of 1920s Hollywood.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nBabylon grossed over $63 million at the box office, against a budget of over $78 million.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with an approval rating of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nMany critics praised the film's visuals, performances, and music, as well as its ambition and scope. However, some critics found the film's pacing and editing to be uneven, and its characters and storylines to be somewhat underdeveloped.\n\n#Accolades\n\nBabylon received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\n\nThe film also received several Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography.\n\n#See also\n\n* The Artist (2011)\n* The Aviator (2004)\n* Singin' in the Rain (1952)\n* Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references.\n\n#External links\n\n* Babylon at IMDb\n* Babylon at AllMovie\n* Babylon at Box Office Mojo\n* Babylon at Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Babylon_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Themes\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n=====================\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a theoretical object that has been proposed as a candidate for the fundamental building block of the universe. The concept of fuzzballs was first introduced by Leonard Susskind in the early 1990s as a way to resolve the black hole information paradox. Since then, the idea has been developed and expanded upon by numerous researchers in the field. This article will provide an overview of the physical properties of fuzzballs, their composition in the context of string theory, and their potential role in resolving the information paradox.\n\nPhysical properties\n-----------------\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nIn string theory, the fundamental building blocks of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles we observe in the universe. Fuzzballs are thought to be a type of stringy object that is made up of a network of vibrating strings. They are called \"fuzzballs\" because they are thought to be highly irregular and fuzzy, rather than being smooth and spherical like a traditional black hole.\n\nThe exact composition of fuzzballs is still a topic of active research and debate. However, most theories suggest that they are made up of a type of stringy material known as \"stringy hair.\" This stringy hair is thought to be composed of a network of vibrating strings that are tangled together in a highly complex and irregular way.\n\n### Densities\n\nOne of the key physical properties of fuzzballs is their density. In traditional theories of black holes, the density of the object is thought to increase as you approach the event horizon. However, in the case of fuzzballs, the density is thought to be constant throughout the object. This is because the stringy material that makes up the fuzzball is thought to be evenly distributed throughout the object, rather than being concentrated at the center.\n\nThis constant density is thought to be one of the key features that distinguishes fuzzballs from traditional black holes. It is also thought to be the key to resolving the information paradox, which is discussed in more detail below.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nAnother area of research that is relevant to the study of fuzzballs is the collapse of neutron stars. In traditional theories of gravity, a neutron star is thought to collapse into a black hole when it reaches a certain critical mass. However, in the context of fuzzball theory, the collapse of a neutron star is thought to result in the formation of a fuzzball rather than a traditional black hole.\n\nThis is because the stringy material that makes up the fuzzball is thought to be able to resist the collapse of the neutron star, resulting in the formation of a highly irregular and fuzzy object. This fuzzball is thought to be stable and long-lived, and is potentially observable using future telescopes.\n\nInformation paradox\n-----------------\n\nOne of the key challenges facing theories of black holes is the information paradox. This paradox arises because the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that information cannot be destroyed, but the laws of general relativity suggest that anything that falls into a black hole is lost forever.\n\nIn the context of fuzzball theory, the information paradox is thought to be resolved because the information that falls into the fuzzball is not lost, but rather is encoded on the surface of the object. This is because the stringy material that makes up the fuzzball is thought to be able to store and process information in a highly efficient and compact way.\n\nAs a result, the information paradox is thought to be resolved in the context of fuzzball theory, and the laws of quantum mechanics and general relativity are thought to be reconciled.\n\nTestability of the theory\n-------------------------\n\nOne of the key challenges facing any new theory is the question of testability. In the case of fuzzball theory, there are several ways in which the theory could be tested in the future.\n\nOne potential way to test the theory is through the observation of the collapse of neutron stars. As mentioned above, the collapse of a neutron star is thought to result in the formation of a fuzzball rather than a traditional black hole. If this is the case, then the observation of neutron star collapse could provide evidence for the existence of fuzzballs.\n\nAnother potential way to test the theory is through the observation of the properties of fuzzballs themselves. For example, the density of fuzzballs is thought to be constant throughout the object, which could be tested through observations of the object's gravitational field.\n\nIn conclusion, fuzzball theory is a promising new approach to understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. While the theory is still in its early stages, it has the potential to resolve several long-standing paradoxes and puzzles in the field of physics.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\nNote: This article is a fictional representation of a Wikipedia article and does not contain actual references or external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The People Power Party also faced internal conflicts, with several lawmakers criticizing Yoon's leadership style and policy decisions.\n\n## Sim Sang-jung Suspends Campaign Activities\n\nSim Sang-jung suspended her campaign activities due to health reasons, sparking concerns about her ability to continue in the race.

The voting process was generally smooth, with few reports of irregularities or technical issues.\n\n# Exit Polls\n\nExit polls showed a tight race between Lee Jae-myung and Yoon Suk-yeol, with Yoon leading by a narrow margin. The polls also showed a significant number of undecided voters, which could have swung the election in either direction.\n\n# Results\n\n## By Region\n\nThe results showed a clear regional divide, with Lee Jae-myung winning in the liberal-leaning Seoul metropolitan area and Yoon Suk-yeol winning in the conservative-leaning provinces. Ahn Cheol-soo and Sim Sang-jung performed relatively well in their home regions, but failed to gain traction elsewhere.\n\n### Major Candidates\n\n* Lee Jae-myung (Democratic Party): 47.83%\n* Yoon Suk-yeol (People Power Party): 48.56%\n* Ahn Cheol-soo (People Party): 6.44%\n* Sim Sang-jung (Justice Party): 2.37%\n\n### Minor Candidates\n\n* Kim Jae-yeon (Minsaeng Party): 0.83%\n* Huh Kyung-young (Our Republican Party): 0.55%\n* Lee Kwang-jae (National Revolutionary Dividist Party): 0.45%\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe election result was widely seen as a surprise, with many analysts and pundits predicting a Lee Jae-myung victory. Yoon Suk-yeol's narrow win was attributed to Ahn Cheol-soo's endorsement and the recruitment of left-wing feminists to the conservative camp.\n\nThe election also marked a significant shift in South Korean politics, with the conservative People Power Party regaining power after five years of liberal rule. The election also highlighted the growing divide between urban and rural areas, as well as the challenges faced by the country's liberal and conservative camps.\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw a series of protests and demonstrations, with supporters of Lee Jae-myung and other losing candidates alleging irregularities and demanding a recount. However, the election result was ultimately confirmed by the National Election Commission, and Yoon Suk-yeol was inaugurated as the new President of South Korea on May 10, 2022.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_South_Korean_presidential_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Electoral system\n#Nominations\n##Democratic Party\n###Primary campaign\n###Primary schedule and process\n####Primary results\n###Candidate\n###Other primary candidates\n###Eliminated candidates\n###Withdrawn candidates\n##People Power Party\n###Primary campaign\n####Primary results\n###Candidate\n###Other candidates\n###Withdrawn candidates\n###Did not run\n##Justice Party\n###Candidate\n###Other primary candidates\n##People Party\n###Candidate\n##Minor party candidates\n#Registered candidates\n#Opinion polling\n#Campaign developments\n##Campaign issues\n##Negative campaigning and candidate unpopularity\n##Recruitment of left-wing feminists to the conservative camps\n##Infighting in Yoon's campaign team and PPP\n##Sim Sang-jung suspends campaign activities\n##Bus accident deaths involving Ahn Cheol-soo's campaigners\n##Ahn's withdrawal from the campaign, endorsing Yoon Suk-yeol\n##Attack against Song Young-gil\n#Voting\n#Exit polls\n#Results\n##By region\n###Major candidates\n###Minor candidates\n#Aftermath\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was the third since the 2006 military coup, which saw Frank Bainimarama come to power. Bainimarama's FijiFirst party was seeking re-election for a third consecutive term, but faced strong challenges from the opposition parties, particularly the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) and the People's Alliance.\n\n# Background\n\nFiji has a history of unstable governance, with four military coups since 1987. The 2013 Constitution, which was introduced by the Bainimarama government, established a parliamentary system with a proportional representation electoral system. The 2018 general election, which was won by FijiFirst, was widely seen as free and fair, but the opposition parties raised concerns about the government's use of state resources and media bias.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2022 election, the opposition parties campaigned on issues such as the economy, healthcare, and education, while also highlighting concerns about the government's human rights record and its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Electoral System\n\n## Voters\n\nAll Fijian citizens aged 18 and over were eligible to vote, provided they were registered on the electoral roll.

Born on April 23, 1981, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma has spent his life pushing the limits of human climbing potential, and his contributions to the sport have left an indelible mark.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nSharma's introduction to climbing came at a young age, when his parents, Bob and Gita Sharma, enrolled him in a gymnastics program at the local climbing gym, the Pacific Edge Climbing Gym, in Santa Cruz. Sharma quickly fell in love with the physical and mental challenges of climbing, and by the age of 12, he had already begun to make a name for himself in the climbing community.\n\nClimbing Career\n----------------\n\n### 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's early climbing career was marked by rapid progress and impressive ascents. In 1996, at the age of 15, he sent his first 5.14a route, \"Narcissus,\" in the Owens River Gorge, California. This achievement earned him recognition within the climbing community and set the stage for his future accomplishments. Throughout the late 1990s, Sharma continued to push the boundaries of climbing, establishing new routes and repeating existing ones at an unprecedented level of difficulty.\n\nIn 2000, Sharma made headlines with the first ascent of \"Realization,\" a 5.15a route in the Ceüse region of France. This achievement marked a new benchmark in sport climbing and solidified Sharma's position as one of the world's top climbers.\n\n### 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nThe early 2000s saw Sharma continue to dominate the climbing scene, with a string of impressive ascents and firsts. In 2002, he established the route \"Biographie\" in the Ceüse region, which, at 5.15a, was one of the most difficult routes in the world at the time.\n\nIn 2008, Sharma made history with the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love,\" a 5.15b route in the Clark Mountain area of California. This achievement marked a new level of difficulty in sport climbing and further cemented Sharma's reputation as one of the world's greatest climbers.\n\n### 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nThe late 2000s and early 2010s saw Sharma continue to push the limits of climbing, with a focus on exploratory climbing and the establishment of new routes. In 2010, he made the first ascent of \"Golpe de Estado,\" a 5.15b route in the Oliana region of Spain.\n\nIn 2013, Sharma teamed up with Adam Ondra to make the first ascent of \"La Dura Dura,\" a 5.15c route in the Oliana region. This achievement marked a new benchmark in sport climbing and highlighted the ongoing progression of the sport.\n\n### Post 2013\n\nSince 2013, Sharma has continued to climb at an elite level, with a focus on exploratory climbing and the establishment of new routes. He has also become increasingly involved in environmental activism, using his platform to raise awareness about the impact of human activity on the natural world.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nChris Sharma's contributions to the sport of climbing are immeasurable. He has inspired generations of climbers with his dedication, passion, and unwavering commitment to the pursuit of excellence. His achievements have pushed the boundaries of human potential, and his influence extends far beyond the climbing community.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\n### Zen\n\nSharma has spoken publicly about the importance of Zen Buddhism in his life. He has practiced meditation and studied Zen philosophy, finding that it helps him to cultivate a sense of calm and focus in his climbing and in his daily life.\n\nNotable Ascents\n----------------\n\n### Redpointed Routes\n\n* \"Narcissus\" (5.14a), Owens River Gorge, California (1996)\n* \"Realization\" (5.15a), Ceüse, France (2000)\n* \"Biographie\" (5.15a), Ceüse, France (2002)\n* \"Jumbo Love\" (5.15b), Clark Mountain, California (2008)\n* \"Golpe de Estado\" (5.15b), Oliana, Spain (2010)\n* \"La Dura Dura\" (5.15c), Oliana, Spain (2013)\n\n### Onsighted Routes\n\n* \"The Nose\" (5.14a), El Capitan, Yosemite National Park, California (2001)\n* \"Astroman\" (5.11c), Washington Column, Yosemite National Park, California (2001)\n\n### Deep-water Solo Routes\n\n* \"Es Pontas\" (5.15a), Mallorca, Spain (2006)\n* \"Psico\" (5.14d), Mallorca, Spain (2006)\n\n### Boulder Problems\n\n* \"The Game\" (V16), Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (2010)\n* \"Practice of the Wild\" (V15), Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (2013)\n\nBibliography\n--------------\n\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Skills: Essential Skills for Climbing\" (2015)\n* Sharma, Chris. \"The Way of the Climber: A Guide to Climbing and Life\" (2018)\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n* \"King Lines\" (2007)\n* \"Origins: Oliana\" (2012)\n* \"La Dura Dura\" (2014)\n* \"Above the Sea\" (2018)\n\nCompetitions\n------------\n\n* 1996: Winner, Junior Bouldering National Championships\n* 2000: Winner, Arco Rock Master\n* 2002: Winner, Climbing World Cup\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* Climbing\n* Sport climbing\n* Rock climbing\n* Bouldering\n* Deep-water soloing\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Chris Sharma's life and climbing career.

The term \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" meaning \"woolen cloth.\" Tartan has a rich history, dating back to the 16th century, and has become an integral part of Scottish culture and identity.\n\nEtymology and Terminology\n-------------------------\n\nThe word \"tartan\" was first used in the 16th century to describe a specific type of woolen cloth. Over time, the term has evolved to encompass not only the textile itself but also the specific patterns and designs used to create it. In modern times, the term \"tartan\" is often used interchangeably with \"plaid,\" although technically, plaid refers to a specific type of tartan pattern.\n\nWeaving and Design\n------------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan is woven using a specific technique called \"twill,\" which involves crossing the warp and weft threads at a 90-degree angle. This creates a diagonal ribbing effect that gives tartan its distinctive texture. The twill weave is a key factor in creating the unique appearance of tartan.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nTartan designs are created using a combination of stripes and colors. The most common style of tartan is the \"set tartan,\" which features a repeating pattern of stripes. The \"symmetrical tartan\" features a mirrored pattern, while the \"asymmetrical tartan\" features a non-mirrored pattern. Tartan designs can also be classified into different categories, such as \"dress tartans,\" \"hunting tartans,\" and \"military tartans.\"\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartan colors are an integral part of the design and are often used to convey meaning and symbolism. The most common colors used in tartan are red, blue, green, yellow, and black. Different colors are often associated with different Scottish clans and families. For example, the MacLeod clan is associated with the colors blue, green, and yellow.\n\nEarly History\n-------------\n\n### Pre-Medieval Origins\n\nThe origins of tartan are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in Scotland during the pre-medieval period. The earliest known examples of tartan date back to the 6th century.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan became a staple of Scottish textiles. The first written records of tartan date back to the 12th century.\n\n### 16th Century\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of tartan as a fashion trend in Scotland. The first tartan patterns were created during this period, including the now-famous \"Black Watch\" tartan.\n\n### 17th Century\n\nThe 17th century saw the development of new tartan patterns, including the \"Royal Stewart\" tartan. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity.\n\n### 18th Century\n\n#### Union Protest and Jacobite Rebellion\n\nThe 18th century saw the rise of the Jacobite rebellion, which sought to restore the Stuart dynasty to the British throne. Tartan became a symbol of the rebellion, and many Jacobite leaders wore tartan as a sign of solidarity.\n\n#### Proscription and Its Aftermath\n\nThe Jacobite rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and the British government responded by proscribing the wearing of tartan. This ban was in place from 1746 to 1782.\n\nRegimental Tartans\n-----------------\n\nRegimental tartans were first introduced in the 18th century as a way to identify Scottish regiments. The first regimental tartan was the \"Black Watch\" tartan, which was worn by the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment.\n\nClan Tartans\n-------------\n\n### Long-Running Debate\n\nThere is ongoing debate about the origins of clan tartans. Some argue that clan tartans date back to the 16th century, while others argue that they are a more recent invention.\n\n### Earliest Evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 18th century.\n\n### Lack of Further Evidence of Early Adoption\n\nDespite extensive research, there is little evidence to suggest that clan tartans were widely adopted before the 19th century.\n\n### 19th Century Broad Adoption\n\nThe 19th century saw the widespread adoption of clan tartans, particularly among Scottish Highlanders.\n\n### 20th Century Consolidation\n\nThe 20th century saw the consolidation of clan tartans, with many clans adopting specific tartans as their own.\n\n### Recognition by Clan Chiefs\n\nIn recent years, many clan chiefs have recognized the importance of clan tartans and have worked to promote their use among clan members.\n\nModern General Use\n------------------\n\n### Late Georgian\n\n#### The King's Jaunt in Tartan\n\nIn 1822, King George IV visited Scotland and wore tartan as a sign of solidarity with the Scottish people. This event helped to popularize tartan among the general population.\n\n#### Civilian Spread\n\nTartan became increasingly popular among civilians during the late Georgian period.\n\n### Victorian\n\n#### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nThe Vestiarium Scoticum, a book published in 1842, helped to popularize tartan among the Victorian era.\n\n#### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nQueen Victoria's love of tartan helped to popularize it among the general population. The Queen's country estate, Balmoral, became a symbol of Scottish culture and tartan.\n\n#### Ripple Effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan during the Victorian era had a ripple effect, with tartan becoming increasingly popular among the general population.\n\n### 20th Century to Present\n\n#### Diaspora and Globalisation\n\nThe 20th century saw the spread of tartan around the world, particularly among Scottish diaspora communities.\n\n#### Industry and Politics\n\nTartan has become an important part of Scottish industry and politics, with many companies and politicians using tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity.\n\n#### In Popular Culture\n\nTartan has appeared in popular culture, including in films, television shows, and music.\n\nPopular Designs\n----------------\n\nThere are many popular tartan designs, including the \"Black Watch\" tartan, the \"Royal Stewart\" tartan, and the \"Dress Stewart\" tartan.\n\nTartans for Specific Purposes\n-----------------------------\n\n### Regional\n\nRegional tartans are specific to particular regions of Scotland.\n\n### Hunting, Mourning, Dress, and Dance\n\nTartans are used for specific purposes, including hunting, mourning, dress, and dance.\n\n### Family and Individual\n\nTartans can be used to identify specific families or individuals.\n\n### Corporate and Commercial\n\n#### Fashion\n\nTartan has become a popular fashion trend, with many designers incorporating tartan into their designs.\n\nRegulation\n----------\n\n### Registration\n\nTartan designs can be registered with the Scottish Registry of Tartans.\n\n### Legal Protection\n\nRegistered tartan designs are protected by law.\n\n### Etiquette\n\nThere are rules of etiquette surrounding the wearing of tartan, particularly among Scottish Highlanders.\n\nIn Other Cultures\n-----------------\n\n### Africa\n\n#### Maasai Shúkà\n\nThe Maasai people of East Africa have a similar textile tradition to tartan.\n\n### East and South Asia\n\n#### Bhutanese Mathra\n\nBhutanese textiles feature a similar pattern to tartan.\n\n#### Indian Madras\n\nIndian madras textiles feature a similar pattern to tartan.\n\n#### Japanese Kōshi\n\nJapanese kōshi textiles feature a similar pattern to tartan.\n\n### Eastern Europe to Western Asia\n\n#### Russian Shotlandka\n\nRussian textiles feature a similar pattern to tartan.\n\n### Oceania\n\n#### Adoption by the Māori\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand have adopted tartan as part of their cultural heritage.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n### Patterns\n\nOther textile patterns, including plaid and stripes.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of tartan, including its history, design, and cultural significance.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include references, but there are many resources available for further reading.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Scottish Registry of Tartans\n* The Tartan Society\n* The Scottish Tartans Authority", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tartan\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology and terminology\n#Weaving and design\n##Weaving construction\n##Styles and design principles\n##Colour, palettes, and meaning\n#Early history\n##Pre-medieval origins\n##Medieval\n##16th century\n##17th century\n##18th century\n###Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n###Proscription and its aftermath\n#Regimental tartans\n#Clan tartans\n##Long-running debate\n##Earliest evidence\n##Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n##19th century broad adoption\n##20th century consolidation\n##Recognition by clan chiefs\n#Modern general use\n##Late Georgian\n###The King's jaunt in tartan\n###Civilian spread\n##Victorian\n###Vestiarium Scoticum\n###The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n###Ripple effects\n##20th century to present\n###Diaspora and globalisation\n###Industry and politics\n###In popular culture\n#Popular designs\n#Tartans for specific purposes\n##Regional\n##Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance\n##Family and individual\n##Corporate and commercial\n###Fashion\n#Regulation\n##Registration\n##Legal protection\n##Etiquette\n#In other cultures\n##Africa\n###Maasai shúkà\n##East and South Asia\n###Bhutanese mathra\n###Indian madras\n###Japanese kōshi\n##Eastern Europe to Western Asia\n###Russian shotlandka\n##Oceania\n###Adoption by the Māori\n#See also\n##Patterns\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century, and is known for his innovative and provocative style, which has had a significant impact on the development of cinema.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nJean-Luc Godard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, to a Swiss father and a French mother. His family moved to Switzerland when he was four years old, and he spent most of his childhood in the town of Nyon, near Lake Geneva. Godard's early life was marked by a passion for literature and philosophy, and he was particularly influenced by the works of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nEarly Career (1950-1959)\n-------------------------\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard began his career as a film critic, writing for various French film magazines, including Cahiers du Cinéma. He was part of a group of young critics who would later become known as the French New Wave, a movement that sought to revolutionize French cinema. Godard's criticism was characterized by its passion and intellectual rigor, and he quickly established himself as one of the leading voices of the French New Wave.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nIn the late 1950s, Godard began to make his own films, starting with a series of short films and documentaries. His first feature film, \"Breathless,\" was released in 1960 and marked the beginning of the French New Wave.\n\nNew Wave Period (1960-1967)\n---------------------------\n\n### Breathless\n\n\"Breathless\" was a groundbreaking film that told the story of a car thief and his American girlfriend on the run in Paris. The film's innovative cinematography, editing, and narrative structure made it a critical and commercial success, and it established Godard as a major talent in world cinema.\n\n### Early Work with Anna Karina\n\nIn the early 1960s, Godard began a romantic and professional relationship with the Danish actress Anna Karina. Karina became a muse and collaborator for Godard, starring in many of his films, including \"Vivre sa vie\" and \"Contempt.\"\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\n\"Vivre sa vie\" was released in 1962 and told the story of a young woman who becomes a prostitute to support herself. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it cemented Godard's reputation as a leading figure in the French New Wave.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\n\"Le petit soldat\" and \"Les Carabiniers\" were two films that Godard made in the early 1960s. \"Le petit soldat\" was a romantic drama that told the story of a young couple in love, while \"Les Carabiniers\" was a satire of war and militarism.\n\n### Contempt\n\n\"Contempt\" was released in 1963 and told the story of a screenwriter who becomes embroiled in a love triangle with his wife and a film producer. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it marked a turning point in Godard's career.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Godard founded his own production company, Anouchka Films. The company produced many of Godard's films, including \"Pierrot le Fou\" and \"Week End.\"\n\n### Week End\n\n\"Week End\" was released in 1967 and told the story of a married couple who go on a road trip to the countryside. The film was a critical and commercial success, and it marked the end of Godard's work with Anna Karina.\n\nPolitical Period (1968-1979)\n---------------------------\n\n### Vietnam War\n\nIn the late 1960s, Godard became increasingly politicized, particularly in response to the Vietnam War. He began to make films that were more overtly political, including \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and \"One Plus One.\"\n\n### Bertolt Brecht\n\nGodard was heavily influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who was a key figure in the development of epic theatre. Godard's films from this period, including \"La Chinoise\" and \"Le Gai Savoir,\" reflect Brecht's influence.\n\n### Marxism\n\nGodard became increasingly interested in Marxism in the late 1960s, and he began to incorporate Marxist ideas into his films. \"The Wind from the East\" and \"Tout Va Bien\" are two films that reflect Godard's engagement with Marxism.\n\n### Revolutionary Period (1968-1979)\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were a time of great social and cultural upheaval, and Godard's films from this period reflect his engagement with the revolutionary movements of the time. \"The Wind from the East\" and \"Tout Va Bien\" are two films that capture the spirit of revolution.\n\n### Films\n\nGodard made many films during this period, including \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"One Plus One,\" \"La Chinoise,\" \"Le Gai Savoir,\" \"The Wind from the East,\" and \"Tout Va Bien.\"\n\n### Sonimage\n\nIn the early 1970s, Godard founded his own television production company, Sonimage. The company produced many of Godard's films and television programs, including \"Six fois deux\" and \"France/tour/détour/deux/enfants.\"\n\n### Jean-Pierre Gorin\n\nGodard collaborated with the filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin on several films, including \"Tout Va Bien\" and \"Ici et ailleurs.\"\n\n### Dziga Vertov Group\n\nGodard was a member of the Dziga Vertov Group, a collective of filmmakers who sought to create a new kind of cinema that was more experimental and more engaged with the world.\n\nReturn to Commercial Films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980-2000)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 1980s, Godard returned to making commercial films, including \"Passion\" and \"First Name: Carmen.\" He also began work on his epic project, \"Histoire(s) du cinéma,\" a series of films that tell the history of cinema.\n\nLate Period Films (2001-2022)\n---------------------------\n\nGodard continued to make films in the 21st century, including \"In Praise of Love\" and \"Goodbye to Language.\" His films from this period are characterized by their complexity and their engagement with the world.\n\nPersonal Life and Death\n----------------------\n\nGodard died on September 13, 2022, at the age of 91. He is survived by his wife, Anne-Marie Miéville, and his daughter, Eugène Green.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nGodard's legacy is immense, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 20th century.

Born on September 13, 1969, in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia, Warne played for the Australian national team from 1992 to 2007 and is considered one of the most successful and dominant bowlers in cricket history.\n\n#Early life\n\nWarne was born to Keith and Brigitte Warne, and grew up in a sporting family.

This collaboration took many forms, including military cooperation, economic support, and ideological alignment. The extent and nature of collaboration varied across Europe and beyond, influenced by factors such as occupation, ideology, and self-interest.\n\n# Terminology\n\nCollaboration with the Axis powers is often understood as the act of working together or cooperating with an enemy, in this case, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. However, the term \"collaboration\" can be complex and nuanced, as it may involve varying degrees of willingness, coercion, or self-interest. Some individuals and groups may have seen collaboration as a means to achieve specific goals or protect their interests, while others may have been coerced or forced into cooperation.\n\n# Collaboration in Western Europe\n\n## Belgium\n\nBelgium was invaded by Nazi Germany in May 1940, and the country remained under occupation until the end of the war.

However, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the PCF became a key player in the French Resistance.\n\n### French workers for Germany\n\nIn 1942, the Nazis introduced the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO), which required French workers to work in Germany. Many French workers were forcibly sent to Germany, while others volunteered or were coerced into participating.\n\n### Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust\n\nThe Vichy government played a significant role in the persecution and deportation of Jews from France. Between 1942 and 1944, over 76,000 Jews were deported from France to Auschwitz and other concentration camps.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nAfter the war, many collaborators were tried and punished for their actions. The Vichy government and its leaders were widely condemned, and the country struggled to come to terms with its complex and often painful history.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg was invaded by Nazi Germany in May 1940 and remained under occupation until the end of the war.

The event was a massive success, selling out the Sears Centre Arena in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and paving the way for the formation of All Elite Wrestling.\n\n### Storylines\n\nThe event featured a number of high-profile matches, including a bout between CM Punk and Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship.

The first match of the night saw The Butcher and The Blade defeat The Varsity Blondes in a tag team match.\n\n### Preliminary matches\n\nThe main card began with a match between Darby Allin and Nick Wayne, which saw Allin emerge victorious after delivering a devastating coffin drop to Wayne. The next match saw the AEW Women's World Championship qualifier tournament continue, with Toni Storm defeating Ruby Soho to advance to the semifinals.\n\n### Main event\n\nThe main event of the night saw CM Punk face off against Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship. The match was a hard-hitting and intense affair, with both men giving it their all in an effort to emerge victorious. In the end, it was Moxley who retained his title, defeating Punk with a Paradigm Shift.\n\nBox office\n----------\n\nAll In was a major commercial success, with the event selling out Wembley Stadium and generating a significant amount of revenue for AEW. The event also helped to establish AEW as a major player in the world of professional wrestling, with the promotion's popularity and influence continuing to grow in the months and years that followed.\n\nPre-show backstage altercation\n-----------------------------\n\nDuring the Zero Hour pre-show, a backstage altercation broke out between a number of AEW talent, including Andrade El Idolo, Matt Hardy, and The Lucha Brothers. The altercation was reportedly sparked by a disagreement between Andrade and Hardy, with The Lucha Brothers becoming involved in an effort to defend their friend.\n\nResults\n-------\n\n### AEW Women's World Championship qualifier tournament bracket\n\n|  | Quarterfinals |  | Semifinals |  | Final |\n|  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | Ruby Soho |  |  |\n|  |  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  | Britt Baker |  |  |\n|  | Britt Baker | Pin |  |\n|  |\n|  | Hikaru Shida |  |  |\n|  |  | Toni Storm | Pin |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  | Kris Statlander |  |  |\n|  | Kris Statlander | Pin |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | Nyla Rose |  |  |\n|  |  | Kris Statlander | Pin |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  | Jamie Hayter |  |  |\n|  | Jamie Hayter | Pin |  |\n|  |\n|  | Emi Sakura |  |  |\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The event was attended by a sold-out crowd of 80,000 fans.\n* The event was broadcast on pay-per-view and streamed live on All Elite Wrestling's website.\n* The event featured a number of celebrity appearances, including musician Snoop Dogg and actor Danny Trejo.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*None*\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"All_In_(2023)\" following this outline:\n\n#Production\n##Background\n##Storylines\n#Event\n##Zero Hour\n##Preliminary matches\n##Main event\n#Box office\n#Pre-show backstage altercation\n#Results\n##AEW Women's World Championship qualifier tournament bracket\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The phenomenon began with a series of reports from private citizens, military personnel, and media outlets, and quickly gained national attention. The events of that summer would go on to shape the public's perception of UFOs and spark a wave of interest in the subject that continues to this day.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze was a complex phenomenon that involved a combination of genuine sightings, misidentifications, hoaxes, and media hype. While the exact nature and origins of the sightings remain unclear, they can be broadly characterized as a series of reports of unusual aerial objects or lights, often described as disc-shaped or saucer-like. The sightings were not limited to any particular region or demographic, and were reported by people from all walks of life, including military personnel, pilots, and ordinary citizens.\n\n# Events of Summer 1947\n\n## Initial reports\n\nThe first reported sighting of a flying disc occurred on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was widely publicized and is often credited with sparking the flying disc craze. Over the next few days, similar sightings were reported in Washington, Oregon, and California, including a report from a United Airlines crew who claimed to have seen a disc-shaped object flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet.\n\n### Additional reports\n\nAs the days passed, more and more reports of flying discs came in from across the country. On June 25, a family in Pendleton, Oregon reported seeing a disc-shaped object flying overhead, and on June 26, a pilot in Idaho reported seeing a similar object. The sightings continued to mount, with reports coming in from Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming.\n\n### Pacific Northwest reports amid jet speculation\n\nMany of the early reports of flying discs came from the Pacific Northwest, where the U.S. military was conducting secret jet aircraft tests. Some speculated that the sightings were actually misidentifications of the new jet planes, but the descriptions of the objects did not match any known aircraft.\n\n### Reports throughout the West\n\nBy the end of June, reports of flying discs had been made in nearly every state in the western United States. The sightings were not limited to rural areas, but were also reported in major cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\n### Potential explanations offered\n\nAs the sightings continued to mount, various explanations were offered to explain the phenomenon. Some suggested that the objects were meteors or other natural phenomena, while others speculated that they were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n## Increasing prominence\n\n### Lt. Governor sighting followed by official investigation\n\nOn June 30, the Lt. Governor of Washington state reported seeing a disc-shaped object flying over the state capitol building. The sighting was widely publicized and led to an official investigation by the U.S. military.\n\n### San Francisco fireworks and stories of landings\n\nOn July 4, a series of fireworks displays were held in San Francisco, and several people reported seeing disc-shaped objects flying overhead. Some even claimed to have seen the objects land in the nearby hills.\n\n### July 4 press reports\n\nThe July 4 press reports of flying discs were some of the most sensational of the summer. Headlines such as \"FLYING SAUCERS SWOOP OVER SF\" and \"DISCS SPOTTED OVER LA\" captivated the public's attention and helped to fuel the flying disc craze.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 4, a United Airlines flight crew reported seeing a disc-shaped object flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The sighting was significant because it was made by experienced pilots who were familiar with the skies.\n\n### Group sightings\n\nAs the summer wore on, group sightings became more common. On July 5, a group of people in a park in Seattle reported seeing a disc-shaped object flying overhead, and on July 6, a group of soldiers in Oregon reported seeing a similar object.\n\n### Atomic link claimed\n\nSome speculated that the flying discs were connected to atomic testing, which was being conducted in the western United States at the time. However, there was no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\n### Reports peak\n\nBy mid-July, reports of flying discs had reached a peak. The sightings were being reported by people from all walks of life, and the media was having a field day.\n\n## Weather balloons, pranks, and hoaxes\n\n### Roswell debris\n\nOn July 8, a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but later claimed that it was actually a weather balloon.\n\n### Reports diminish\n\nAs the summer wore on, reports of flying discs began to diminish. The media attention had sparked a wave of interest in the subject, but it had also led to a number of hoaxes and misidentifications.\n\n### Hoaxed discs recovered in Hollywood and Detroit\n\nIn July and August, several hoaxed discs were recovered in Hollywood and Detroit. The hoaxes were often elaborate and involved fake discs made of paper and wood.\n\n### Balloons\n\nMany of the reported sightings were later explained as misidentifications of weather balloons. The balloons were often seen in the distance and were mistaken for disc-shaped objects.\n\n### Twin Falls recovered disc hoax\n\nIn August, a recovered disc was discovered in Twin Falls, Idaho. However, it was later revealed that the disc was a hoax.\n\n## Reports subside\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn August 1, a strange object crashed in a field near Kelso, Washington. The incident was reported by several witnesses, but the object was never recovered.\n\n## Public awareness\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze had a profound impact on public awareness of UFOs. It sparked a wave of interest in the subject that continues to this day, and it helped to shape the public's perception of UFOs.\n\n## Maps and table of reports\n\nA number of maps and tables were compiled to track the reports of flying discs. These maps and tables helped to illustrate the scope of the phenomenon and provided a visual record of the sightings.\n\n# Contemporary interpretations\n\n## Technological\n\nSome interpreted the flying discs as advanced technological devices, possibly of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n## Conventional\n\nOthers interpreted the sightings as misidentifications of conventional objects, such as weather balloons or aircraft.\n\n## Behavioral\n\nSome saw the flying disc craze as a behavioral phenomenon, driven by social and psychological factors.\n\n## Interplanetary\n\nMany people believed that the flying discs were of interplanetary origin, visiting Earth from other planets.\n\n## Biological\n\nA few people even suggested that the flying discs were biological entities, such as advanced forms of life.\n\n## Eschatological\n\nSome saw the flying discs as a sign of the end times, a harbinger of apocalypse.\n\n## Occult\n\nOthers interpreted the sightings as evidence of occult or supernatural forces at work.\n\n## Esoteric\n\nSome saw the flying discs as a manifestation of esoteric or mystical forces, connected to the spiritual realm.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Flying saucer conspiracy theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze spawned a number of conspiracy theories, including the idea that the U.S. government was covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\n## Roswell conspiracy theory\n\nThe Roswell incident became a central part of the flying saucer conspiracy theories, with many believing that the government had recovered an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n## Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nIn the 1990s, the U.S. government released documents related to Project Mogul and Skyhook, two secret projects that involved the use of high-altitude balloons. Some saw these projects as evidence of a government cover-up, while others saw them as a rational explanation for the sightings.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of reported UFO sightings\n* Flying saucer\n* Unidentified flying object\n\n# Further reading\n\n* Berlitz, Charles.

It is a Dravidian party and was founded by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR) in 1972 as a breakaway faction from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The party has had a significant impact on the politics of Tamil Nadu and has been in power for several terms.\n\nIdeology and Policies\n--------------------\n\nThe AIADMK's ideology is based on the principles of Dravidianism, which emphasizes the rights and dignity of the Dravidian people of southern India. The party's policies are centered around the welfare of the poor, marginalized, and oppressed sections of society.\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the preservation and promotion of Tamil culture and language. The party has implemented several policies to promote the use of Tamil in education, administration, and other fields. The AIADMK has also been instrumental in promoting the development of Tamil Nadu's rich cultural heritage, including its music, dance, and art.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe AIADMK's economic policies are centered around the development of Tamil Nadu's agriculture, industry, and services sectors. The party has implemented several initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, job creation, and economic growth. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the rights of farmers and workers.\n\n### Social Justice\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for social justice and has implemented several policies to promote the welfare of marginalized communities, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The party has also been instrumental in promoting women's empowerment and has implemented several initiatives to promote women's education, health, and economic development.\n\n### State Water Policy\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the rights of Tamil Nadu in the sharing of water resources with neighboring states. The party has implemented several initiatives to promote water conservation and management in the state.\n\n### Environment and Nature\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for environmental protection and conservation. The party has implemented several initiatives to promote sustainable development, reduce pollution, and protect Tamil Nadu's rich biodiversity.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe AIADMK was founded by M. G. Ramachandran in 1972 as a breakaway faction from the DMK. MGR, who was a popular film star and politician, was instrumental in building the party into a major force in Tamil Nadu politics.\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran Era (1972-87)\n\nMGR became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1977 and remained in office until his death in 1987. During his tenure, he implemented several initiatives to promote the welfare of the poor, marginalized, and oppressed sections of society. MGR's government also implemented several policies to promote the development of Tamil Nadu's agriculture, industry, and services sectors.\n\n#### Succession Conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa Factions\n\nAfter MGR's death, a succession conflict emerged between his wife, Janaki Ramachandran, and his protégée, J. Jayalalithaa. The conflict ultimately led to the split of the AIADMK into two factions, with Janaki Ramachandran leading one faction and Jayalalithaa leading the other.\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa Era (1989-2016)\n\nJayalalithaa became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991 and remained in office until her death in 2016. During her tenure, she implemented several initiatives to promote the welfare of the poor, marginalized, and oppressed sections of society.

The party contested elections in several other states, including Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n### V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran Era (2016-17)\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death, V. K. Sasikala, who was Jayalalithaa's closest aide, became the General Secretary of the AIADMK. Sasikala's nephew, T. T. V. Dhinakaran, became the Deputy General Secretary of the party. However, the duo's tenure was short-lived, and they were eventually expelled from the party.\n\n#### Expulsion of V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran\n\nSasikala and Dhinakaran were expelled from the AIADMK in 2017 after a rebellion by a group of party leaders led by O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami.\n\n### O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K.

Dhinakaran\n\nSasikala and Dhinakaran launched a legal fight to reclaim the AIADMK, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n#### Tensions with BJP\n\nThe AIADMK's relationship with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been strained in recent years. The two parties have been at odds over several issues, including the sharing of power in Tamil Nadu.\n\n#### Leadership Tussle between O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami\n\nA leadership tussle emerged between Panneerselvam and Palaniswami in 2020, with the two leaders vying for control of the party.\n\n### Edappadi K.

Zionism, a nationalist movement that emerged in the late 19th century, aimed to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The question of how to define Jewish identity and its relationship to other groups, particularly non-Jews, has been a central concern for Zionists. This article will explore the development of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism from its early days to the present.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nThe study of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism is a multidisciplinary field that draws on history, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. Scholars have approached this topic from various perspectives, including the history of Zionism, the sociology of Jewish identity, and the anthropology of nationalism. Some have focused on the ideological and intellectual debates within the Zionist movement, while others have examined the everyday experiences of Jews and non-Jews in Palestine/Israel.\n\nA key concept in the study of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism is the idea of \"Jewishness\" itself. Scholars have noted that Jewishness is a complex and multifaceted identity that encompasses not only religious but also ethnic, cultural, and national dimensions. Zionists have often sought to define Jewishness in terms of its relationship to other groups, particularly non-Jews, and to articulate a sense of Jewish distinctiveness and exceptionalism.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe modern concept of race emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in Europe and North America. During this period, racial theories and ideologies gained widespread acceptance, and the idea of racial hierarchy and segregation became increasingly popular. The rise of nationalism and imperialism further reinforced the idea of racial difference and the notion that certain groups were inherently superior to others.\n\nIn this context, the early Zionists, who were largely secular and influenced by European nationalism, began to articulate their own racial conceptions of Jewish identity. They saw Jewishness as a distinct racial and national identity that was separate from other groups, particularly non-Jews.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nEarly Zionism, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was characterized by a strong emphasis on Jewish racial and national identity. Zionists such as Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau drew on European nationalist and racial ideologies to articulate a sense of Jewish distinctiveness and exceptionalism.\n\nHerzl, in particular, was influenced by the racial theories of his time and saw Jewishness as a distinct racial identity that was separate from other groups. He argued that Jews were a \"nation\" in the classical sense, with their own distinct language, culture, and history.\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nFollowing the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the question of Jewish identity and its relationship to other groups became increasingly complex. The mass immigration of Jews from around the world, particularly from North Africa and the Middle East, raised questions about the nature of Jewish identity and the relationship between Ashkenazi (European) and Mizrahi (Middle Eastern) Jews.\n\nDuring this period, the Israeli government and many Zionists emphasized the idea of a unified Jewish identity that transcended ethnic and national differences. However, this emphasis on unity often masked underlying tensions and conflicts between different Jewish groups.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant shift in the racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism. The rise of Mizrahi and Sephardi (Spanish) Jewish identity, particularly in Israel, challenged the dominant Ashkenazi narrative and forced a re-evaluation of the relationship between Jewishness and other groups.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of post-Zionism, a movement that challenged the dominant Zionist narrative and emphasized the need for a more inclusive and multicultural understanding of Jewish identity.\n\n## The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe discovery of the human genome and the development of genetic research have had a significant impact on the racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism. Many Zionists have seen genetic research as a way to \"prove\" Jewish identity and to establish a scientific basis for Jewish distinctiveness.\n\nHowever, others have argued that genetic research has the potential to undermine traditional notions of Jewish identity and to highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of Jewishness.\n\n## Race and Non-Jews\n\nThroughout the history of Zionism, the relationship between Jewishness and other groups, particularly non-Jews, has been a central concern. Zionists have often sought to define Jewishness in terms of its relationship to other groups, and to articulate a sense of Jewish distinctiveness and exceptionalism.\n\nHowever, this emphasis on Jewish distinctiveness has often been accompanied by a neglect or erasure of non-Jewish experiences and perspectives. The Palestinian experience, in particular, has been marginalized or ignored in many Zionist narratives.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism have had a significant impact on the development of the State of Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The emphasis on Jewish distinctiveness and exceptionalism has often been used to justify the displacement and marginalization of non-Jewish groups, particularly Palestinians.\n\nHowever, the racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism have also been subject to challenge and critique, both from within the Zionist movement and from outside. Many have argued that a more inclusive and multicultural understanding of Jewish identity is necessary to address the complex and multifaceted nature of Jewishness.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Racial theory\n* Nationalism\n* Imperialism\n* Post-Zionism\n* Mizrahi Jews\n* Sephardi Jews\n* Ashkenazi Jews\n* Palestinian people\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election process began on 12 July 2022 and concluded on 5 September 2022, with Liz Truss being elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n#Background\n\n##Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election of 2019 was held after the resignation of Theresa May as party leader and prime minister. Boris Johnson won the election, defeating Jeremy Hunt in the final round. Johnson's leadership campaign focused on delivering Brexit, and he promised to take the UK out of the European Union by 31 October 2019. The 2019 general election was called soon after, in which the Conservative Party won a majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons.\n\n##2019 general election\n\nThe 2019 general election was held on 12 December 2019, in which the Conservative Party won 365 seats, a majority of 80. The Labour Party won 203 seats, and the Liberal Democrats won 11 seats. Boris Johnson's leadership and the Conservative Party's promise to deliver Brexit were seen as key factors in their election victory.\n\n##COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the UK, with the government introducing various restrictions and measures to control the spread of the virus. However, the partygate scandal, which involved gatherings at 10 Downing Street during lockdown periods, damaged the government's reputation and led to widespread criticism. Boris Johnson apologized for attending a gathering in May 2020, but denied that he had broken any rules.\n\n##June 2022 confidence vote\n\nOn 6 June 2022, a confidence vote was held among Conservative Party MPs, in which Boris Johnson won by 211 votes to 148. However, the vote was seen as a significant rebellion against Johnson's leadership, and it weakened his position as party leader and prime minister.\n\n##Government crisis\n\nIn the days following the confidence vote, several senior government ministers resigned, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The resignations created a government crisis, and Boris Johnson eventually resigned as party leader and prime minister on 7 July 2022.\n\n#Election details\n\nThe Conservative Party leadership election was overseen by the 1922 Committee, a group of backbench Conservative MPs. The election process involved two stages: an initial round of voting among MPs, followed by a final round of voting among party members.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election began on 12 July 2022, with several candidates announcing their intention to stand. The campaign focused on issues such as the economy, Brexit, and the party's future direction.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Nominated\n\nEight candidates were nominated for the leadership election:\n\n* Rishi Sunak\n* Liz Truss\n* Penny Mordaunt\n* Kemi Badenoch\n* Suella Braverman\n* Tom Tugendhat\n* Nadhim Zahawi\n* Jeremy Hunt\n\n##Withdrew\n\nTwo candidates withdrew from the election:\n\n* Sajid Javid\n* Grant Shapps\n\n##Publicly expressed interest\n\nSeveral MPs publicly expressed interest in standing for the leadership election, but did not ultimately nominate:\n\n* Ben Wallace\n* Priti Patel\n* Dominic Raab\n\n##Declined\n\nSeveral senior MPs declined to stand for the leadership election:\n\n* Michael Gove\n* Matt Hancock\n* Andrea Leadsom\n\n##Endorsements\n\nSeveral candidates received endorsements from senior MPs and former cabinet ministers:\n\n* Rishi Sunak: endorsed by Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid\n* Liz Truss: endorsed by Nadine Dorries and Lord Frost\n* Penny Mordaunt: endorsed by Andrea Leadsom and Damian Green\n\n#Timeline\n\n* 7 July 2022: Boris Johnson resigns as party leader and prime minister\n* 12 July 2022: Leadership election campaign begins\n* 13 July 2022: Nominations close\n* 18 July 2022: First round of voting among MPs\n* 20 July 2022: Second round of voting among MPs\n* 21 July 2022: Final round of voting among MPs\n* 5 September 2022: Final result announced\n\n#Debates\n\nSeveral debates were held during the leadership election campaign, featuring the candidates and moderated by journalists and broadcasters.\n\n##Public reaction\n\nThe debates were widely covered in the media, and the public reaction was significant.
