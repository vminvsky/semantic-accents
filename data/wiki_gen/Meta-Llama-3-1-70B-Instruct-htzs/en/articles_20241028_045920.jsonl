The incident drew widespread attention and sparked concerns about the safety of public figures and their families.\n\n# Break-in and attack\n\nOn October 28, 2022, at approximately 2:27 a.m., San Francisco police responded to a 911 call from Paul Pelosi, who reported that someone had broken into his home. When officers arrived, they found Pelosi, 82, and an assailant, later identified as David DePape, 42, struggling over a hammer. The officers intervened, and DePape was subdued and taken into custody. Pelosi was transported to a hospital for treatment of injuries, including a skull fracture, arm and hand injuries, and blunt force trauma. He underwent surgery and was expected to make a full recovery.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) launched an investigation into the attack, with assistance from the FBI and the U.S. Capitol Police. Authorities reviewed security footage from the Pelosi residence and nearby homes, as well as DePape's social media activity and online history. The investigation revealed that DePape had broken into the Pelosi home through a rear door, which was not equipped with security cameras. DePape allegedly attacked Pelosi with a hammer, and Pelosi was able to call 911 using a phone in the bedroom.\n\n# Perpetrator\n\n## Life prior to the attack\n\nDavid DePape was born on November 11, 1980, in British Columbia, Canada. He moved to the United States in 2000 and became a naturalized citizen in 2008. DePape lived in Berkeley, California, and worked as a hemp jewelry maker and a self-described \"exotic dancer.\" He was known to his acquaintances as a quiet and reserved person who was interested in spirituality and alternative lifestyles.\n\n## Social media activity\n\nDePape maintained a number of social media accounts, including a blog and a presence on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. His online activity revealed a fascination with far-right conspiracy theories, including QAnon and anti-Semitic ideologies. DePape also expressed admiration for Donald Trump and other high-profile conservatives. His online posts became increasingly erratic and threatening in the months leading up to the attack, with DePape posting about the need for violence and revolution.\n\n# State and federal prosecution\n\nDePape was charged with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and burglary. He was also charged with federal crimes, including assault on a member of a protected family and attempted kidnapping of a federal official.\n\n## Federal trial\n\nDePape's federal trial began on February 14, 2023. Prosecutors presented evidence of DePape's online activity and his alleged motives for the attack, which they characterized as a deliberate attempt to harm a member of a protected family. DePape's defense team argued that he was mentally ill and not fully responsible for his actions.\n\n## State trial\n\nDePape's state trial began on March 21, 2023. Prosecutors presented evidence of the attack and its aftermath, including testimony from Paul Pelosi and other witnesses. DePape's defense team again argued that he was mentally ill and not fully responsible for his actions.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi sparked widespread outrage and concern about the safety of public figures and their families. Many politicians and public figures condemned the attack and expressed support for the Pelosi family.\n\n## Misinformation and disinformation\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, a number of conspiracy theories and false narratives emerged on social media, including claims that the attack was staged or that DePape was a liberal operative. These claims were widely debunked by fact-checkers and law enforcement officials.\n\n# Notes\n\nThe attack on Paul Pelosi highlighted concerns about the safety of public figures and their families, as well as the spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media. The incident also raised questions about the role of online platforms in promoting or preventing violence and extremism.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references or citations.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor more information on the attack on Paul Pelosi and its aftermath, see the following articles and resources:\n\n* \"Paul Pelosi, Husband of Nancy Pelosi, Attacked in Home\" by The New York Times\n* \"David DePape, Suspect in Paul Pelosi Attack, Had Online Presence Filled with Hate and Conspiracy Theories\" by The Washington Post\n* \"The Attack on Paul Pelosi: What We Know\" by The San Francisco Chronicle", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Attack_on_Paul_Pelosi\" following this outline:\n\n#Break-in and attack\n#Investigation\n#Perpetrator\n##Life prior to the attack\n##Social media activity\n#State and federal prosecution\n##Federal trial\n##State trial\n#Reactions\n##Misinformation and disinformation\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 26 U.S. Representatives from the state of New York, one from each of the state's 26 congressional districts. The elections coincided with the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in other states, as well as with the 2022 United States Senate election in New York and various state and local elections.\n\n# 2020-22 redistricting controversy\n\nThe 2020 United States Census determined that New York would lose one congressional seat due to its slow population growth compared to other states. The New York State Legislature was tasked with drawing new congressional district boundaries, but the process was marred by controversy and partisan bickering. In February 2022, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the Legislature's redrawn maps were unconstitutional and appointed a special master to draw new maps. The special master's maps were used for the 2022 elections.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Votes by ballot line\n\nIn New York, candidates can run on multiple ballot lines, and voters can choose which ballot line to vote on. The following table shows the total number of votes cast for each party or ballot line in the 2022 House elections in New York.\n\n| Party/Ballot Line | Votes | Percentage |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Democratic | 2,831,230 | 43.8% |\n| Republican | 2,234,149 | 34.6% |\n| Conservative | 241,419 | 3.7% |\n| Working Families | 173,911 | 2.7% |\n| Libertarian | 36,549 | 0.6% |\n| Green | 25,619 | 0.4%

He has been the dominant figure in Russian politics for over two decades and has played a significant role in shaping the country's domestic and foreign policies.\n\n#Early life\n\nVladimir Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). His father, Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin, was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, and his mother, Maria Ivanovna Shelomova, was a factory worker. Putin's family lived in a communal apartment in Leningrad, where he grew up with his parents and two siblings.\n\nPutin's early life was marked by a strong interest in sports, particularly judo and sambo. He began training in judo at the age of 11 and eventually became a black belt. Putin's athletic background and competitive nature would later influence his approach to politics and leadership.\n\n#Education\n\nPutin graduated from Leningrad State University in 1975 with a degree in international law. During his time at university, he was recruited by the KGB, the Soviet Union's security agency, and began working as a foreign intelligence officer.\n\n#KGB career\n\nPutin's KGB career spanned 16 years, during which he worked in East Germany and Leningrad. He rose through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant colonel in 1990. Putin's experience in the KGB provided him with valuable skills and connections that would later serve him well in politics.\n\n#Political career\n\n##1990–1996: Saint Petersburg administration\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin entered politics in Saint Petersburg, where he worked as an advisor to the city's mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. Putin quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the city's deputy mayor in 1994.\n\n##1996–1999: Early Moscow career\n\nIn 1996, Putin moved to Moscow, where he worked in the presidential administration under President Boris Yeltsin. Putin's responsibilities included overseeing the work of the federal agencies and managing the country's relations with the regions.\n\n##1999: First premiership\n\nIn August 1999, Putin became the Prime Minister of Russia, replacing Sergei Stepashin. Putin's appointment was seen as a surprise, but he quickly proved himself to be a capable and effective leader.\n\n##1999–2000: Acting presidency\n\nOn December 31, 1999, President Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned, and Putin became the acting President of Russia. Putin's first major challenge as president was the Second Chechen War, which began in 1999.\n\n##2000–2004: First presidential term\n\nIn March 2000, Putin was elected as the President of Russia, winning 53.4% of the vote. Putin's first presidential term was marked by a focus on economic reform and the strengthening of the Russian state.\n\n##2004–2008: Second presidential term\n\nPutin was re-elected in 2004, winning 71.3% of the vote. During his second term, Putin continued to consolidate his power and implement his vision for Russia's development.\n\n##2008–2012: Second premiership\n\nIn 2008, Putin stepped down as president due to constitutional term limits and became the Prime Minister of Russia, with Dmitry Medvedev as president. Putin's second premiership was marked by a focus on economic development and the strengthening of Russia's international position.\n\n##2012–2018: Third presidential term\n\nIn 2012, Putin was elected as the President of Russia for a third term, winning 63.6% of the vote. Putin's third term was marked by a focus on domestic policy and the strengthening of Russia's international position.\n\n###Annexation of Crimea\n\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, a move that was widely condemned by the international community. Putin's decision to annex Crimea was seen as a major turning point in his presidency and marked a significant shift in Russia's relations with the West.\n\n###Intervention in Syria\n\nIn 2015, Russia launched a military intervention in Syria, with the aim of supporting the Syrian government against Islamist rebels. Putin's decision to intervene in Syria was seen as a major turning point in the conflict and marked a significant shift in Russia's relations with the Middle East.\n\n###Russia's interference in the 2016 US election\n\nIn 2016, Russia was accused of interfering in the US presidential election, with the aim of supporting Donald Trump's candidacy. Putin's government denied any involvement, but the allegations marked a significant deterioration in Russia's relations with the US.\n\n##2018–2024: Fourth presidential term\n\nIn 2018, Putin was elected as the President of Russia for a fourth term, winning 76.7% of the vote. Putin's fourth term has been marked by a focus on domestic policy and the strengthening of Russia's international position.\n\n###COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIn 2020, Russia was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the country's economy and healthcare system. Putin's government implemented a range of measures to combat the pandemic, including lockdowns and vaccination programs.\n\n###Constitutional referendum and amendments\n\nIn 2020, Russia held a constitutional referendum, which approved a range of amendments to the country's constitution. The amendments included changes to the presidency, the judiciary, and the role of the government.\n\n###Iran trade deal\n\nIn 2020, Russia signed a major trade deal with Iran, which aimed to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation. The deal marked a significant shift in Russia's relations with the Middle East.\n\n###2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis\n\nIn 2021, Russia launched a major military buildup on its border with Ukraine, which sparked a significant crisis in the region.

She played a significant role in her husband's life and career, particularly during his premiership, and was known for her elegant style, charm, and intelligence.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n\nClarissa Churchill, the daughter of Sir Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, and Clementine Churchill, was born in 1917. She spent her early years in Paris, where her father was the British Ambassador to France. The family later moved to Tuscany, Italy, and then to London, where Clarissa grew up in a household that was deeply involved in politics and public life.\n\n## Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nDuring the Second World War, Clarissa studied at Oxford University, where she became friends with many notable figures, including Randolph Churchill, her cousin, and Evelyn Waugh, the author. She later worked at the Foreign Office, where she met many influential people in the British government and diplomatic corps.\n\n## Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa became a prominent figure in London society, known for her beauty, intelligence, and wit. She was a popular guest at social gatherings and parties, and was particularly close to her father, Winston Churchill, who was then the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n# 2007 memoir\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa Eden published her memoir, \"A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden,\" which provided a unique insight into her life and experiences. The book covered her childhood, her relationships with her family and friends, and her life with Anthony Eden.\n\n# Friends and acquaintances\n\n## Early admirers\n\nClarissa had many admirers and friends throughout her life, including the author Evelyn Waugh, who was a close friend, and the politician and historian, Harold Nicolson, who was a great admirer of hers.\n\n## Other friends\n\nShe was also friends with many other notable figures, including the artist, Graham Sutherland, who painted her portrait, and the politician, Rab Butler, who was a close friend of her husband's.\n\n# Relationship with Anthony Eden\n\n## Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa met Anthony Eden, then a young Member of Parliament, through her father, Winston Churchill, during the Second World War. Eden was a close friend and ally of Churchill's, and the two men worked together closely during the war.\n\n## Marriage to Eden\n\n### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden were married in 1952, when Eden was 55 and Clarissa was 35. The marriage was widely seen as a good match, as both partners were well-connected and well-respected in their fields. However, some people felt that Clarissa was too young for Eden, and that the marriage was a mismatch.\n\n### Married life\n\nDespite these reservations, the marriage was happy and successful. Clarissa brought a sense of style and elegance to Eden's life, and he brought a sense of stability and security to hers. Together, they had two sons, Simon and Robert.\n\n# Eden's premiership\n\n## Chatelaine at Downing Street and Chequers\n\nWhen Anthony Eden became Prime Minister in 1955, Clarissa became the chatelaine of Downing Street and Chequers, the official country residence of the Prime Minister. She played an important role in supporting her husband during this time, and was known for her charm and hospitality.\n\n## Suez Crisis\n\n### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nThe Suez Crisis, which took place in 1956, was a major challenge for the Eden government. Clarissa later recalled that the crisis was like \"the Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room,\" as the phone rang constantly with calls from world leaders and advisors.\n\n### Political influence\n\nClarissa played an important role in advising her husband during the Suez Crisis, and was known to have influenced his decisions. She was a strong supporter of the invasion of Egypt, and was critical of the United States for its failure to support the British action.\n\n### Protective influence\n\nClarissa also played a protective role during the Suez Crisis, shielding her husband from the intense pressure and criticism that he was facing. She was a source of comfort and support, and helped to keep him calm and focused during a difficult time.\n\n## Aftermath of Suez\n\n### Goldeneye\n\nAfter the Suez Crisis, the Edens retreated to Goldeneye, their home in Jamaica, where they spent several months recovering from the strain of the crisis. Clarissa later recalled that this was a happy time, as they were able to relax and enjoy each other's company away from the pressures of politics.\n\n### Eden's resignation\n\nIn January 1957, Anthony Eden resigned as Prime Minister, citing ill health. Clarissa was deeply saddened by this decision, and felt that it was a mistake.

The earthquake was one of the strongest to hit the region in recent years, and its impact was felt across the country.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe earthquake occurred at 8:43 AM local time, with its epicenter located in the town of Tayum, Abra Province. According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale, with a depth of 17 kilometers (10.6 miles). The earthquake was a result of a complex interplay of tectonic forces, involving the movement of the Philippine Sea plate and the Eurasian plate.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nIn the hours and days following the earthquake, numerous aftershocks were recorded, with the strongest having a magnitude of 5.6. These aftershocks caused further damage and disruption, particularly in areas where buildings and infrastructure had already been weakened by the initial earthquake.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was felt across a wide area, with the PHIVOLCS reporting that the earthquake had a maximum intensity of VIII (Very Destructive) in the town of Tayum, where the epicenter was located. In other areas, the intensity was reported as VII (Destructive) to VI (Strong).\n\n## Tsunami\n\nA tsunami warning was issued shortly after the earthquake, with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) warning of possible tsunami waves affecting coastal areas. However, no tsunami waves were reported, and the warning was later lifted.\n\n## Liquefaction\n\nLiquefaction, a phenomenon where shaking causes water-saturated soil to lose strength and behave like a liquid, was reported in several areas. This caused further damage to buildings and infrastructure, particularly in areas with loose or unstable soil.\n\n# Response\n\nThe Philippine government responded quickly to the disaster, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declaring a state of calamity in the affected areas. Emergency responders and aid workers were deployed to the affected areas, with search and rescue operations underway to locate missing persons.\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community also offered assistance, with countries such as the United States, China, and Japan providing aid and support.

The conflict resulted in significant human suffering, displacement, and a re-evaluation of the regional balance of power.\n\n# Background\n\nNagorno-Karabakh, a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, has been a point of contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia since the early 20th century. In 1991, the region declared independence from Azerbaijan, leading to a devastating war between Armenia and Azerbaijan that lasted until 1994. The conflict resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and the establishment of a fragile ceasefire. Despite numerous attempts at negotiation, a lasting peace agreement was never reached.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2023 offensive, tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia had been escalating. In August 2023, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev made a series of public statements emphasizing the country's commitment to regaining control over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan responded by stating that any attempt by Azerbaijan to use force would be met with resistance.\n\n# Offensive\n\n## 19 September\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a large-scale military operation against Nagorno-Karabakh. The attack began with artillery and missile strikes against key infrastructure and military positions, followed by a ground assault by Azerbaijani troops. The Artsakh Defense Army, the military force of the breakaway region, responded with force, but was significantly outnumbered and outgunned.\n\n## 20 September\n\nOver the next 24 hours, Azerbaijani forces continued to push deep into Nagorno-Karabakh, capturing key towns and villages. The Artsakh Defense Army was forced to retreat, leaving behind significant amounts of military equipment and supplies. As the Azerbaijani military advanced, reports emerged of significant human suffering, including civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nIn the days following the Azerbaijani offensive, tens of thousands of Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh, seeking safety in Armenia. The exodus was marked by scenes of chaos and desperation, with many people forced to abandon their homes and belongings. The Armenian government established a number of temporary shelters and reception centers to accommodate the refugees.\n\n## Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nAs Azerbaijani forces consolidated their control over Nagorno-Karabakh, a number of high-ranking officials from the breakaway region were arrested and detained. The Azerbaijani government accused the officials of separatism and treason, and vowed to put them on trial.\n\n## Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n\nIn the aftermath of the Azerbaijani offensive, negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan resumed, facilitated by international mediators. The talks focused on the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh, with Azerbaijan pushing for the region's dissolution and integration into Azerbaijan. Armenia, meanwhile, advocated for a continued role for the Artsakh authorities in the region's governance.\n\n## Ceasefire violations\n\nDespite the negotiations, ceasefire violations continued to occur, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The incidents highlighted the fragility of the peace process and the need for a more robust ceasefire agreement.\n\n## Humanitarian aid\n\nAs the humanitarian situation in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to deteriorate, international organizations and governments provided significant amounts of aid to the region. The assistance included food, shelter, and medical supplies, as well", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Azerbaijani_offensive_in_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Offensive\n##19 September\n##20 September\n#Aftermath\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n##Ceasefire violations\n##Humanitarian aid\n##Diplomatic efforts\n###Normalisation efforts\n#Risk of genocide\n##Reports of violence against Armenians\n##Azerbaijani concentration camp plans\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n###Armenia\n####Armenian diaspora\n###Russia\n###Turkey\n###European Union\n###United Nations\n###Council of Europe\n###Other countries\n###Other international organizations\n##Foreign involvement\n###Israel\n###Turkey\n###Armenia\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The coalition aimed to present a united front of the left in the 2022 French legislative election and has since become a significant force in French politics.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union was formed in May 2022, following the 2022 French presidential election. The coalition was created through an agreement between several left-wing parties, including La France Insoumise (FI), the Socialist Party (PS), the French Communist Party (PCF), and the Greens (EELV). The parties agreed to put aside their differences and present a united front in the legislative election to challenge the incumbent government.\n\n## Expansion\n\nIn the days following the formation of the coalition, several smaller left-wing parties joined the NUPES, including the Radical Party of the Left (PRG) and the New Deal (ND). The coalition also received support from various civil society organizations and trade unions.\n\n## 2022 French legislative election\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in nearly all constituencies in the 2022 French legislative election. The coalition's campaign focused on issues such as climate change, social justice, and economic inequality. Despite internal tensions and disagreements, the NUPES managed to present a relatively united front and gained significant support from voters.\n\n## Electoral results and aftermath\n\nThe NUPES won 131 seats in the National Assembly, making it the main opposition force to the government. The coalition's performance was seen as a significant achievement, given the fragmentation of the left in previous elections. However, the NUPES fell short of its goal of winning a majority of seats and forming a left-wing government.\n\n## Election of René Pilato\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, the NUPES elected René Pilato as its leader in the National Assembly. Pilato, a member of La France Insoumise, was seen as a compromise candidate who could unite the different factions within the coalition.\n\n## Quatennens Affair\n\nIn September 2022, the NUPES was rocked by a scandal involving Adrien Quatennens, a member of La France Insoumise and the coalition's coordinator. Quatennens was accused of domestic violence, leading to his suspension from the coalition and his resignation as coordinator. The incident highlighted internal tensions within the NUPES and raised questions about the coalition's ability to manage its internal conflicts.\n\n## Bayou Affair\n\nIn November 2022, the NUPES was involved in another controversy surrounding the appointment of a new coordinator. The coalition's leadership nominated Manuel Bompard, a member of La France Insoumise, to replace Quatennens. However, the nomination was met with opposition from some members of the Socialist Party, who accused Bompard of being too radical. The incident highlighted the ongoing tensions between the different factions within the NUPES.\n\n## Tensions with the Communist Party\n\nThe NUPES has also experienced tensions with the French Communist Party, which has been a member of the coalition since its formation. In December 2022, the PCF announced that it would be withdrawing its support for the coalition's leader in the National Assembly, René Pilato. The move was seen as a sign of the ongoing divisions within the NUPES and the difficulties of maintaining a united front among its member parties.\n\n## Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n\nIn January 2023, the Socialist Party, one of the main member parties of the NUPES, held a national convention to elect a new leader. The convention was marked by infighting between different factions, with some members calling for a more radical approach and others advocating for a more moderate stance. In the end, Martine Froger, a member of the party's left wing, was elected as the new leader of the PS.\n\n## Socialist Party suspension\n\nIn February 2023, the NUPES suspended the Socialist Party's participation in the coalition's decision-making bodies. The move was seen as a response to the ongoing tensions between the PS and other member parties, particularly La France Insoumise.\n\n# Members\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union is composed of several member parties, including:\n\n* La France Insoumise (FI)\n* Socialist Party (PS)\n* French Communist Party (PCF)\n* Greens (EELV)\n* Radical Party of the Left (PRG)\n* New Deal (ND)\n\n## Former members\n\n* The NUPES has also had several former member parties, including the Democratic Movement (MoDem), which withdrew from the coalition in 2022.\n\n# Candidates 2022\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in nearly all constituencies in the 2022 French legislative election. The coalition's candidates were selected through a process of negotiations between the different member parties.\n\n## Breakdown by constituency\n\n* The NUPES presented candidates in 577 constituencies, with the following breakdown by party:\n\t+ La France Insoumise: 225 candidates\n\t+ Socialist Party: 184 candidates\n\t+ French Communist Party: 83 candidates\n\t+ Greens: 74 candidates\n\t+ Radical Party of the Left: 23 candidates\n\t+ New Deal: 18 candidates\n\n## Dissident candidates\n\n* In some constituencies, the NUPES faced competition from dissident candidates who were not officially endorsed by the coalition. These candidates were often members of the same party as the NUPES candidate, but had chosen to run independently.\n\n# Ideology and platform\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union is a left-wing coalition that advocates for a range of policies aimed at promoting social justice, environmental protection, and economic equality. The coalition's platform includes measures such as:\n\n* Increasing the minimum wage and reducing income inequality\n* Implementing a Green New Deal to address climate change\n* Expanding public services and reducing poverty\n* Promoting social justice and equality\n\n# Electoral history\n\n## Legislative elections\n\n* The NUPES was formed in 2022 and has only contested one legislative election to date. In the 2022 French legislative election, the coalition won 131 seats in the National Assembly.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe formation of the New Ecological and Social People's Union has been met with a range of reactions from different sections of French society.\n\n## PS majority and social-democratic left\n\n* The Socialist Party, one of the main member parties of the NUPES, has been supportive of the coalition and has sought to promote its own brand of social democracy within the NUPES.\n\n## PS minority and opposition\n\n* However, some members of the Socialist Party have been critical of the NUPES and have argued that it is too radical. These members have often found themselves at odds with the coalition's leadership and have sought to promote a more moderate approach.\n\n## Extra-parliamentary left\n\n* The NUPES has also been met with skepticism from some sections of the extra-parliamentary left, who have argued that the coalition is too focused on electoral politics and has neglected the need for more radical action.\n\n## Presidential majority\n\n* The NUPES has been opposed by the presidential majority, which has sought to promote its own brand of centrist politics. The presidential majority has often been critical of the NUPES and has sought to portray it as too radical and divisive.\n\n# See also\n\n* French politics\n* Left-wing politics\n* Green politics\n* Social democracy\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Ecological_and_Social_People's_Union\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The disaster resulted in the loss of 158 lives, with many more injured, and sent shockwaves across the nation and around the world. This article provides an in-depth examination of the events leading up to the tragedy, the disaster itself, and the subsequent response and aftermath.\n\n# Background\n\n## History of the district\n\nItaewon is a popular entertainment district in Seoul, known for its vibrant nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. The area has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century when it was a major hub for American military personnel stationed in Korea. Over the years, Itaewon has evolved into a cosmopolitan neighborhood, attracting visitors from all over the world. The district's narrow streets and alleys are lined with bars, clubs, and restaurants, making it a favorite haunt for young people and partygoers.\n\n## Layout of the area\n\nThe Itaewon district is situated in the heart of Seoul, with a unique layout that has contributed to its popularity. The area is characterized by narrow, winding streets and alleys, which can become congested, especially during peak hours. The main street, Itaewon-ro, is a pedestrian-friendly area lined with shops, restaurants, and bars. However, the surrounding alleys and side streets are often narrow and poorly lit, making navigation challenging, especially for large crowds.\n\n# Conditions before the disaster\n\n## Lack of government preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to the Halloween celebrations, concerns were raised about the potential for overcrowding and safety issues in Itaewon. However, the government and local authorities failed to take adequate measures to address these concerns. Despite warnings from experts and local residents, the authorities did not implement sufficient crowd control measures, such as restricting access to the area or providing adequate emergency services.\n\n# Disaster\n\nOn the night of October 29, 2022, a massive crowd of revelers gathered in Itaewon to celebrate Halloween. The area was packed with people, many of whom were dressed in costumes and eager to enjoy the festivities. However, as the night wore on, the crowd began to surge, with many people becoming trapped in the narrow alleys and side streets. The situation quickly spiralled out of control, with people being crushed and trampled in the chaos.\n\n# Immediate emergency response\n\nThe emergency services were quickly overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster. Ambulances and rescue teams were delayed in reaching the scene due to the congested streets and lack of access. Many people were forced to rely on bystanders and Good Samaritans for assistance, with some even using makeshift stretchers to carry the injured to safety.\n\n# Victims\n\n## Identification of victims\n\nThe identification of victims was a challenging and emotional process, with many families left waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. The authorities set up a makeshift morgue in the area, where families could go to identify the bodies of their loved ones. However, the process was often slow and bureaucratic, adding to the distress of those affected.\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe disaster also had a profound impact on the mental health of those affected. Many survivors reported experiencing trauma, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of the disaster. The authorities established a counseling service to provide support to those affected, but many people struggled to come to terms with the trauma they had experienced.\n\n## Publication of the names of the fatalities\n\nThe authorities eventually released the names of the fatalities, which was a difficult and emotional moment for the families and loved ones of those affected. The publication of the names was a poignant reminder of the human cost of the disaster and the devastating impact it had on so many lives.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Immediate response\n\nThe government's immediate response to the disaster was widely criticized as slow and inadequate. The authorities were accused of failing to take sufficient measures to address the safety concerns in Itaewon and of being unprepared for the scale of the disaster.\n\n## Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched, which aimed to identify the causes of the tragedy and to hold those responsible accountable. The investigation was led by the police and the prosecutor's office, with assistance from experts and other agencies.\n\n## Parliamentary inquiry\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was also established to examine the disaster and the government's response. The inquiry aimed to identify the root causes of the tragedy and to make recommendations for preventing similar disasters in the future.\n\n# Criticism and protests\n\n## Protests\n\nThe disaster sparked widespread outrage and protests, with many people demanding justice and accountability for those responsible. Protesters marched through the streets of Seoul, calling for the resignation of the government and for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n## Criticisms of the investigation\n\nThe investigation into the disaster was criticized for being slow and inadequate, with many people accusing the authorities of covering up the truth. Critics argued that the investigation was too narrow in scope and failed to address the broader systemic issues that contributed to the tragedy.\n\n## Criticisms of the government\n\nThe government was also criticized for its handling of the disaster and its response to the crisis. Critics argued that the government was slow to respond and failed to take sufficient measures to address the safety concerns in Itaewon. The government was also accused of trying to shift the blame onto others, rather than taking responsibility for the tragedy.\n\n# Memorials\n\n## Mourning and memorial sites\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, many people visited the site of the tragedy to pay their respects and to leave flowers and memorials. The area became a makeshift memorial site, with many people leaving messages and tributes to the victims.\n\n## Buddhist orders\n\nBuddhist orders and other religious groups also played an important role in the aftermath of the disaster, providing spiritual support and comfort to those affected. Many Buddhist monks and nuns visited the site of the tragedy to offer prayers and blessings, and to provide support to the families of the victims.\n\n# International response\n\nThe disaster sparked an outpouring of international sympathy and support, with many countries and organizations offering condolences and assistance to the people of South Korea. The international community came together to support the victims and their families, and to offer support to the government and people of South Korea.\n\n# Impact on businesses\n\nThe disaster had a significant impact on businesses in the Itaewon area, with many bars, restaurants, and shops forced to close temporarily or permanently. The area's reputation as a popular tourist destination was also damaged, with many visitors cancelling their plans to visit Seoul.\n\n# In the media\n\nThe disaster received widespread media coverage, both domestically and internationally. The media played an important role in raising awareness of the tragedy and in providing information and support to those affected.\n\n## Disaster-related ethics guidelines\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, many media outlets faced criticism for their handling of the story, with some accused of sensationalism and insensitivity. The media was forced to confront the ethical challenges of reporting on a disaster of this scale, and to consider the impact of their coverage on those affected.\n\n# Academic analysis\n\nThe disaster has also been the subject of academic analysis, with many experts examining the causes and consequences of the tragedy. The disaster has been studied from a range of perspectives, including sociology, psychology, and public policy.\n\n# See also\n\n* Crowd control\n* Crowd crush\n* Disaster response\n* Emergency management\n* Public safety\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Seoul Halloween crowd crush, and is based on publicly available information.\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Seoul_Halloween_crowd_crush\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##History of the district\n##Layout of the area\n#Conditions before the disaster\n##Lack of government preparation\n#Disaster\n#Immediate emergency response\n#Victims\n##Identification of victims\n##Mental health\n##Publication of the names of the fatalities\n#Government response\n##Immediate response\n##Investigation\n##Parliamentary inquiry\n#Criticism and protests\n##Protests\n##Criticisms of the investigation\n##Criticisms of the government\n#Memorials\n##Mourning and memorial sites\n##Buddhist orders\n#International response\n#Impact on businesses\n#In the media\n##Disaster-related ethics guidelines\n#Academic analysis\n#See also\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The suspensions affected a range of accounts, including those of journalists, researchers, and flight-tracking services. The suspensions were widely reported and sparked controversy, with many users and commentators criticizing Twitter's handling of the situation.\n\n# Background\n\nTwitter, a social media platform founded in 2006, has a long history of dealing with issues related to user accounts and content moderation. The platform has faced criticism for its handling of harassment, hate speech, and misinformation, and has implemented various policies and measures aimed at addressing these issues. In recent years, Twitter has also faced scrutiny over its handling of high-profile accounts, including those of politicians and celebrities.\n\nIn November 2022, Twitter's new owner, Elon Musk, announced a series of changes to the platform's policies and moderation practices. Musk, who acquired Twitter in October 2022, stated that he planned to reduce the platform's reliance on content moderation and instead focus on promoting \"free speech.\" Musk's announcement sparked concerns among some users and commentators, who worried that the changes could lead to an increase in harassment and hate speech on the platform.\n\n# Account suspensions\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions began on December 14, 2022, when a number of accounts were suspended without warning. The suspended accounts included those of journalists, researchers, and flight-tracking services.\n\n## Twitter policy changes\n\nTwitter's policy changes, announced by Musk in November 2022, were seen as a key factor in the December suspensions. Musk stated that Twitter would no longer enforce its policy on \"platform manipulation,\" which prohibited users from using the platform to manipulate or deceive others. Musk also announced that Twitter would reduce its use of \"shadow banning,\" a practice in which the platform limits the visibility of certain accounts or tweets without notifying the user.\n\n## Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n\nOne of the first groups of accounts to be suspended was a number of flight-tracking services, including @ElonJet and @jxckson. These accounts used publicly available flight data to track the movements of private aircraft, including those owned by Musk. Musk had previously expressed frustration with the accounts, stating that they were a \"security risk.\"\n\n## Suspension of journalist accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, a number of journalists' accounts were suspended, including those of reporters from CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. The suspended journalists had all covered Musk and Twitter in their reporting, and some had been critical of Musk's handling of the platform.\n\n## Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter and Musk initially offered little explanation for the suspensions, leading to widespread criticism and speculation. Musk eventually stated that the suspensions were related to a \"crazy stalker\" who had been using the platform to track his movements. Musk also stated that he had personally ordered the suspensions, citing concerns for his safety and the safety of his family.\n\n# Reinstatement of some accounts\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Twitter reinstated some of the suspended accounts, including those of the journalists. Musk stated that the reinstatements were the result of a \"review\" of the suspensions, but did not provide further explanation.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions sparked a range of responses from users, commentators, and organizations.\n\n## Suspended journalists\n\nThe suspended journalists were critical of Twitter's handling of the situation, with some stating that the suspensions were an attack on press freedom. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, one of the suspended journalists, stated that the suspensions were \"a threat to the free press.\"\n\n## Other commentators\n\nOther commentators were also critical of Twitter's handling of the situation, with some stating that the suspensions were a sign of Musk's authoritarian tendencies. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, stated that the suspensions were \"a disturbing example of the dangers of centralized control over online speech.\"\n\n# See also\n\n* Twitter\n* Elon Musk\n* Free speech\n* Content moderation\n* Social media\n* Online harassment\n* Press freedom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The integration has been a gradual process, with various agreements, organizations, and institutions established over the years to promote economic, social, and political cooperation among European countries.\n\n# History\n\nThe history of European integration can be traced back to the aftermath of World War II. The devastation and chaos caused by the war led to a renewed desire for peace, stability, and cooperation among European nations. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1951, was the first supranational organization in Europe, aimed at integrating the coal and steel industries of six European countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe success of the ECSC led to the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, which aimed to establish a common market among its member states. The EEC was later renamed the European Community (EC) and eventually became part of the European Union (EU) in 1993.\n\n# Theories of Integration\n\nTheories of integration have evolved over the years, reflecting changes in the European integration process.\n\n## Proto-integration period\n\nDuring the proto-integration period, which spanned from the end of World War II to the 1960s, the focus was on functional integration, with the establishment of organizations such as the ECSC and the EEC.\n\n## First phase: explaining integration, 1960s onwards\n\nThe first phase of integration theory, from the 1960s onwards, focused on explaining the integration process. The neofunctionalist approach, led by scholars such as Ernst Haas, emphasized the role of supranational institutions and the spillover effect, where integration in one area leads to further integration in other areas.\n\n## Second phase: analyzing governance, 1980s onwards\n\nThe second phase of integration theory, from the 1980s onwards, focused on analyzing governance and the role of institutions in the integration process. The intergovernmentalist approach, led by scholars such as Andrew Moravcsik, emphasized the role of national governments and the bargaining process between them.\n\n## Third phase: constructing the EU, 1990s onwards\n\nThe third phase of integration theory, from the 1990s onwards, focused on constructing the EU and its institutions. The constructivist approach, led by scholars such as Thomas Christiansen, emphasized the role of ideas, norms, and identity in shaping the integration process.\n\n# Citizens' organisations calling for further integration\n\nSeveral citizens' organizations have been established to promote further European integration. These organizations include the European Movement International, the Union of European Federalists, and the European Federalist Party.\n\n# Overlap of membership in various agreements\n\nThere is a significant overlap of membership in various agreements and organizations in Europe.\n\n## Common membership of member states of the European Union\n\nAll member states of the European Union are also members of the Council of Europe, the European Free Trade Association, and the European Broadcasting Union.\n\n## Most integrated countries\n\nThe most integrated countries in Europe are those that are members of the European Union, the Schengen Area, and the Eurozone. These countries include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.\n\n# Geographic scope\n\nThe geographic scope of European integration extends beyond the European continent.\n\n## Beyond geographic Europe\n\nSeveral countries outside of geographic Europe are members of European organizations, such as Turkey, which is a member of the Council of Europe and the European Free Trade Association.\n\n## Limited to regions within geographic Europe\n\nHowever, several regions within geographic Europe are not fully integrated into the European Union, such as the Nordic countries, the Baltic Sea region, and the Balkans.\n\n### Nordic countries\n\nThe Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, are members of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area, but not the European Union.\n\n### Baltic Sea region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, is a member of the European Union, but not the Schengen Area or the Eurozone.\n\n### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden, is a regional organization that aims to promote economic and cultural cooperation between its member states.\n\n### Low Countries region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region, including Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, is a member of the European Union, the Schengen Area, and the Eurozone.\n\n### Black Sea region\n\nThe Black Sea region, including Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine, is a member of the European Union, but not the Schengen Area or the Eurozone.\n\n### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland are members of the European Union, but not the Schengen Area or the Eurozone.\n\n### Central Europe\n\nCentral Europe, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, is a member of the European Union, the Schengen Area, and the Eurozone.\n\n### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, is a member of the European Union, but not the Schengen Area or the Eurozone.\n\n### Danube region\n\nThe Danube region, including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, is a regional organization that aims to promote economic and cultural cooperation between its member states.\n\n### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia, is a regional organization that aims to promote economic and cultural cooperation between its member states.\n\n# Council of Europe\n\nThe Council of Europe is a supranational organization that aims to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in Europe.

The ship was originally commissioned as Slava in 1983, but was renamed Moskva in 2000. The cruiser played a significant role in the Russian naval fleet, serving as the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet.\n\n#History\n\n##As Slava\n\nThe Slava was laid down on November 4, 1976, at the 61 Kommunara Shipbuilding Plant in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. The ship was launched on July 27, 1979, and was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on January 30, 1983. Initially, the Slava was part of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, but in 1990, it was transferred to the Black Sea Fleet. The cruiser was designed to provide air defense and anti-surface capabilities, equipped with 16 P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missiles, 64 S-300F Favorit surface-to-air missiles, and various gun systems.\n\n##As Moskva\n\nIn 2000, the Slava was renamed Moskva in honor of the capital city of Russia. The ship underwent a major overhaul and modernization from 2000 to 2005, which included the installation of new air defense systems, electronic warfare systems, and communication equipment. The Moskva became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet in 2006 and has since participated in various naval exercises and operations, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Moskva played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The ship was involved in the Snake Island campaign, where it provided gunfire support to Russian troops attempting to capture the strategic island.\n\n###Snake Island campaign\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the Moskva, along with other Russian warships, approached Snake Island, a Ukrainian naval outpost in the Black Sea. The ship demanded the surrender of the Ukrainian troops stationed on the island, but the Ukrainians refused. The Moskva then opened fire on the island, using its 130mm guns to target the Ukrainian positions. The Russian troops eventually captured the island, but the Moskva's actions were widely condemned by the international community.\n\n###Sinking\n\nOn April 13, 2022, the Moskva was struck by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles while sailing in the Black Sea, approximately 60 nautical miles off the coast of Odessa, Ukraine. The ship suffered significant damage and caught fire, leading to a loss of power and control. The Russian Ministry of Defense initially reported that the ship had been damaged by an ammunition explosion, but later confirmed that it had been hit by Ukrainian missiles. The Moskva sank in the early hours of April 14, 2022, resulting in the loss of an estimated 500 lives. The sinking of the Moskva was a significant blow to the Russian Navy and marked a major turning point in the conflict.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Moskva was one of the most advanced warships in the Russian Navy, equipped with state-of-the-art air defense systems and anti-surface capabilities. The ship's sinking was a significant loss for Russia, both in terms of military capability and prestige. The incident also raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian naval defenses and the ability of the Ukrainian military to counter Russian aggression.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has resulted in thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nBackground\n\n### War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has its roots in the War in Darfur, which began in 2003 between the government of Sudan and rebel groups in the Darfur region. The Sudanese government responded to the rebellion by arming and supporting militias, including the Janjaweed, which was later rebranded as the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF was led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who became a key player in Sudanese politics.\n\n### Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the ousting of President Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan since 1989. A transitional government was established, led by a Sovereign Council, which included representatives of the military and civilian groups. However, the transition was marred by tensions between the military and civilian groups, which ultimately led to the conflict.\n\n### Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) are two rebel groups that have been involved in the conflict. The SPLM-N was formed in 2011, after South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The group is led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu and is based in the Nuba Mountains. The SLM, on the other hand, was formed in 2001 and is based in the Darfur region.\n\n### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF had been escalating. The RSF had been expanding its influence and control over key areas of Sudan, including the capital city, Khartoum. The SAF, which had long been the dominant military force in Sudan, saw the RSF as a threat to its power and authority.\n\nCourse of the War\n\n### April–May 2023\n\n#### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began on April 15, 2023, when fighting broke out in Khartoum between the SAF and the RSF. The RSF had been expanding its control over the city, and the SAF saw this as a threat to its authority. The fighting was intense, with reports of artillery and aerial bombardments.\n\n#### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The agreement was brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of forces from Khartoum. However, the agreement was short-lived, and fighting resumed within days.\n\n### June–September 2023\n\n#### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, fighting continued in Khartoum, with reports of artillery and aerial bombardments. The RSF made gains in the city, capturing key areas, including the presidential palace.\n\n#### Diplomatic efforts\n\nInternational efforts to broker a peace agreement continued, with the African Union, the European Union, and the United Nations all involved in mediation efforts.

Suchianu was born on November 16, 1896, in the town of Roman, in the province of Moldavia, Romania. His family was part of the local intelligentsia, and his parents encouraged his early interest in literature and philosophy. Suchianu began his education at the local high school, where he developed a passion for the works of Romanian writers such as Mihai Eminescu and Ion Creangă. He later enrolled at the University of Iași, where he studied literature and philosophy.\n\nDuring his university years, Suchianu became acquainted with the works of prominent European philosophers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Henri Bergson. These thinkers would later influence his own philosophical ideas and literary criticism. In 1918, Suchianu published his first articles in the literary magazine Viața Românească, marking the beginning of his career as a writer and critic.\n\n## Interwar culture critic\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Suchianu established himself as a prominent figure in Romanian literary circles. He wrote for various magazines and newspapers, including Viața Românească, Gândirea, and Universul, and published several books of literary criticism and philosophy. His work focused on the analysis of Romanian literature, as well as the cultural and philosophical trends of the time.\n\nSuchianu's criticism was known for its depth and nuance, and he was particularly interested in exploring the relationship between literature and society. He was a strong advocate for the idea that literature should reflect the social and cultural realities of the time, and he criticized writers who he believed were out of touch with the needs and concerns of the common people.\n\n## Under fascism\n\nIn the 1930s, Romania began to move towards fascism, and Suchianu found himself increasingly at odds with the new regime. He was critical of the fascist ideology and its attempts to suppress intellectual freedom and artistic expression. In 1938, he published an article in which he denounced the fascist regime and its efforts to manipulate public opinion through propaganda.\n\nAs a result of his criticism, Suchianu faced persecution from the fascist authorities. He was banned from publishing, and his books were removed from circulation. He was also subjected to harassment and intimidation, and he was forced to go into hiding to avoid arrest.\n\n## 1944 coup and communization\n\nIn August 1944, a coup led by King Michael I overthrew the fascist regime, and Romania switched sides in World War II. Suchianu emerged from hiding and resumed his writing and criticism. However, he soon found himself facing a new challenge in the form of the communist regime that began to take power in Romania.\n\nSuchianu was initially optimistic about the new regime, believing that it would bring about social and economic justice. However, he soon became disillusioned with the communist authorities' attempts to suppress intellectual freedom and artistic expression. He wrote several articles criticizing the regime's censorship policies and its efforts to impose a rigid ideological orthodoxy on writers and artists.\n\n## Old age and death\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Suchianu's health began to decline, and he was forced to slow down his writing and criticism. He continued to work, however, and he published several books during this period. He also became increasingly reclusive, preferring to avoid the public eye and the attention of the communist authorities.\n\nD.I. Suchianu died on December 16, 1985, at the age of 89, in Bucharest, Romania. He was remembered as a prominent figure in Romanian literary circles, and his work continues to be studied and appreciated by scholars and readers today.\n\n# Legacy\n\nD.I. Suchianu's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a prominent literary critic and writer, who made significant contributions to Romanian literature and culture. His work continues to be studied and appreciated by scholars and readers today, and he is widely regarded as one of the most important Romanian writers of the 20th century.\n\nHowever, Suchianu's legacy is also marked by controversy and debate. Some have criticized his early support for the fascist regime, and his later criticism of the communist authorities has been seen as overly harsh by some. Others have praised his courage and integrity, and his willingness to speak out against injustice and oppression.\n\nDespite these controversies, Suchianu's work remains an important part of Romanian literary and cultural heritage. His writing and criticism continue to inspire and influence new generations of writers and scholars, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of intellectual freedom and artistic expression.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident involved two World War II-era aircraft, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra, which collided in mid-air and crashed to the ground, killing all six people on board.\n\n# Aircraft\n\nThe two aircraft involved in the collision were a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and a Bell P-63 Kingcobra. The B-17, registration N7227C, was a four-engine heavy bomber built in 1944 and was one of the most iconic aircraft of World War II. The P-63, registration N6767, was a single-engine fighter aircraft built in 1943 and was known for its sleek design and powerful engine.\n\nBoth aircraft were part of the Commemorative Air Force (CAF), a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving and flying historic aircraft. The CAF had organized the Wings Over Dallas air show to showcase its collection of World War II-era aircraft and to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.\n\n## Aircraft History\n\nThe Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was built in 1944 and served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, the aircraft was sold to a civilian owner and was used for various purposes, including as a cargo plane and a fire bomber. In 1988, the aircraft was acquired by the CAF and was restored to its original military configuration.\n\nThe Bell P-63 Kingcobra was built in 1943 and served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, the aircraft was sold to a civilian owner and was used for racing and aerobatics. In 2003, the aircraft was acquired by the CAF and was restored to its original military configuration.\n\n# Crash\n\nThe collision occurred at approximately 1:20 pm local time on November 12, 2022, during a flying demonstration at the Wings Over Dallas air show. The B-17, piloted by Terry Barker, was flying in formation with the P-63, piloted by Craig Hutain, when the two aircraft collided in mid-air.\n\nThe impact was severe, and both aircraft broke apart and crashed to the ground in a nearby field. The wreckage was spread over a wide area, and debris from the aircraft was scattered across the field and nearby roads.\n\n## Eyewitness Accounts\n\nEyewitnesses described the collision as a loud and intense impact, followed by a massive fireball. \"It was like a huge explosion,\" said one eyewitness. \"I saw the two planes collide, and then they just disintegrated.\"\n\nAnother eyewitness described the scene as \"surreal.\" \"I couldn't believe what I was seeing,\" she said. \"It was like something out of a movie.\"\n\n## Rescue Efforts\n\nEmergency responders were quick to arrive at the scene, but their efforts were hindered by the remote location and the severity of the wreckage. \"It was a very difficult scene to access,\" said one emergency responder. \"We had to use off-road vehicles to get to the wreckage.\"\n\nDespite their efforts, all six people on board the two aircraft were killed in the collision. The victims were identified as Terry Barker, Craig Hutain, Dan Ragan, Kevin Michels, Leonard \"Len\" Root, and Curt Rowe.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe six people killed in the collision were all experienced pilots and aviation enthusiasts. Terry Barker, the pilot of the B-17, was a retired airline captain with over 40 years of flying experience. Craig Hutain, the pilot of the P-63, was a former Air Force pilot with over 20 years of flying experience.\n\nDan Ragan, Kevin Michels, Leonard \"Len\" Root, and Curt Rowe were all crew members on the B-17. Ragan was a retired Air Force mechanic, Michels was a former Navy pilot, Root was a retired airline pilot, and Rowe was a former Air Force pilot.\n\n## Tributes\n\nThe victims were remembered as dedicated aviation enthusiasts and patriots. \"They were all passionate about aviation and about preserving the history of World War II,\" said a spokesperson for the CAF.\n\nA memorial service was held at the Dallas Executive Airport on November 15, 2022, to honor the victims. The service was attended by family members, friends, and fellow aviation enthusiasts.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation into the collision. The NTSB has gathered evidence from the wreckage and has interviewed witnesses.\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that the collision was caused by a combination of factors, including the proximity of the two aircraft and the failure of the pilots to maintain safe separation.\n\n## Investigation Timeline\n\nThe NTSB has released a timeline of the investigation, which includes the following milestones:\n\n* November 12, 2022: The collision occurs.\n* November 13, 2022: The NTSB begins its investigation.\n* November 15, 2022: The NTSB releases a preliminary report on the collision.\n* December 2022: The NTSB releases a factual report on the collision.\n* Spring 2023: The NTSB releases a final report on the collision.\n\n## Investigation Team\n\nThe NTSB investigation team includes experts from various fields, including aviation, engineering, and safety. The team is led by an NTSB investigator-in-charge, who is responsible for overseeing the investigation and ensuring that all evidence is gathered and analyzed.\n\n# Public Response\n\nThe collision has sparked a public outcry, with many people expressing shock and sadness at the loss of life. \"It's just tragic,\" said one person. \"Those pilots were heroes, and they will be missed.\"\n\nOthers have praised the emergency responders for their quick response and bravery. \"They did an amazing job,\" said one person. \"They risked their lives to try and save those pilots.\"\n\n## Air Show Safety\n\nThe collision has raised concerns about air show safety. \"It's a reminder that air shows can be dangerous,\" said one expert. \"Pilots and organizers need to take every precaution to ensure safety.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that it will review its regulations for air shows to ensure that they are safe and effective.\n\n## Commemorative Air Force Response\n\nThe CAF has released a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the victims. \"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friends and fellow aviators,\" said a CAF spokesperson. \"We will continue to fly and to preserve the history of World War II, but we will do so with a heavy heart.\"\n\nThe CAF has also announced that it will conduct its own investigation into the collision, in addition to the NTSB investigation.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Dallas_air_show_mid-air_collision\" following this outline:\n\n#Aircraft\n#Crash\n#Victims\n#Investigation\n#Public response\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The proceedings against Chase, an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, took place in 1804-1805, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson.\n\n#Background\n\nSamuel Chase was a prominent figure in American law and politics, having served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, a justice of the Maryland Court of Appeals, and a United States District Judge before his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1796. However, Chase's judicial career was marked by controversy, particularly his outspoken criticism of the Democratic-Republican Party and his perceived bias in favor of the Federalist Party.\n\nIn the early 19th century, tensions between the Democratic-Republican Party and the Federalist Party were running high, with the Democratic-Republicans controlling the White House and Congress. Chase's actions on the bench, including his criticisms of the Democratic-Republican Party and his acquittal of a Democratic-Republican politician accused of treason, further antagonized the Democratic-Republicans.\n\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct, with 73 representatives voting in favor and 32 opposed. The inquiry was led by Representative John Randolph of Virginia, a prominent Democratic-Republican and vocal critic of Chase.\n\n##Early inquiry developments\n\nThe inquiry focused on several incidents, including Chase's acquittal of the Democratic-Republican politician accused of treason, his criticisms of the Democratic-Republican Party, and allegations of bias in his judicial decisions. The inquiry also examined Chase's conduct during the treason trial of James Callender, a Democratic-Republican journalist who had been critical of the Federalist Party.\n\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn October 12, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution impeaching Chase on eight articles of impeachment, which alleged a range of misconduct, including:\n\n* Article I: Chase's acquittal of the Democratic-Republican politician accused of treason\n* Article II: Chase's criticisms of the Democratic-Republican Party\n* Article III: Allegations of bias in Chase's judicial decisions\n* Article IV: Chase's conduct during the treason trial of James Callender\n* Article V: Chase's alleged disregard for the authority of the House of Representatives\n* Article VI: Chase's alleged failure to maintain impartiality on the bench\n* Article VII: Chase's alleged abuse of power in issuing a writ of habeas corpus\n* Article VIII: Chase's alleged failure to uphold the Constitution\n\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nThe subsequent months of inquiry saw further testimony and evidence presented against Chase, including allegations of drunkenness on the bench and of making derogatory comments about the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn December 4, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted the eight articles of impeachment, with 73 representatives voting in favor and 32 opposed.\n\n###Article I\n\nArticle I alleged that Chase had improperly acquitted the Democratic-Republican politician accused of treason.\n\n###Article II\n\nArticle II alleged that Chase had made inflammatory and partisan comments about the Democratic-Republican Party.\n\n###Article III\n\nArticle III alleged that Chase had shown bias in his judicial decisions, particularly in the treason trial of James Callender.\n\n###Article IV\n\nArticle IV alleged that Chase had conducted the treason trial of James Callender in an unfair and biased manner.\n\n###Article V\n\nArticle V alleged that Chase had disregarded the authority of the House of Representatives.\n\n###Article VI\n\nArticle VI alleged that Chase had failed to maintain impartiality on the bench.\n\n###Article VII\n\nArticle VII alleged that Chase had abused his power in issuing a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n###Article VIII\n\nArticle VIII alleged that Chase had failed to uphold the Constitution.\n\n###Vote overview\n\nThe House of Representatives voted to adopt the articles of impeachment, with 73 representatives voting in favor and 32 opposed.\n\n#Appointment of House managers\n\nThe House of Representatives appointed a team of managers, led by Representative John Randolph, to present the case against Chase in the Senate.\n\n#Senate trial\n\n##Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial was presided over by Vice President George Clinton, with the Chief Justice of the United States, William Paterson, serving as the presiding officer.\n\n##Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted rules for the trial, including the requirement that Chase be present and that the trial be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.\n\n##Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805, with the reading of the articles of impeachment.\n\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was decorated and arranged for the trial, with Chase seated at a desk and the House managers seated opposite.\n\n##Pleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase saw Chase enter a plea of not guilty to the articles of impeachment.\n\n##Argument phase\n\n###Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe House managers presented their case against Chase, arguing that his conduct on the bench had been improper and that he had shown bias in his judicial decisions.\n\n###Defense's presentation\n\nChase's defense team argued that the articles of impeachment were unconstitutional and that Chase had acted properly in his judicial decisions.\n\n###Closing remarks\n\nThe House managers and Chase's defense team delivered closing remarks, with the House managers arguing that Chase's conduct had been a clear abuse of power and that he should be removed from office.\n\n##Verdict\n\nOn March 1, 1805, the Senate voted on the articles of impeachment, with Chase acquitted on all eight counts. The acquittal was seen as a major defeat for the Democratic-Republican Party and a victory for the Federalist Party.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Immediate aftermath\n\nThe acquittal of Chase was seen as a major blow to the Democratic-Republican Party, which had hoped to use the impeachment process to remove a perceived enemy from the bench.\n\n##Legacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase remains a significant event in American history, marking the first and only time a Supreme Court justice has been impeached by the House of Representatives. The acquittal of Chase established an important precedent for the independence of the judiciary and the limits of congressional power.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Since its completion in 1941, the monument has been featured in numerous forms of media, including films, television shows, music, and literature. This widespread presence in popular culture can be attributed to its unique and imposing design, as well as its association with American values and ideals.\n\n# Reasons for Popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity in popular culture can be attributed to several factors. One reason is its sheer size and grandeur, which makes it a visually striking and memorable image. The monument's location in the Black Hills of South Dakota, a region steeped in American history and folklore, also adds to its appeal. Additionally, the fact that the sculpture features four influential American presidents – George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln – makes it a powerful symbol of American democracy and leadership.\n\nAnother reason for Mount Rushmore's popularity is its versatility as a cultural icon. The monument can be used to represent a range of themes and ideas, from patriotism and nationalism to freedom and democracy. This versatility has made it a popular subject in various forms of media, from films and television shows to music and literature.\n\n# Common Themes\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous films, television shows, and other forms of media, often as a symbol of American values and ideals. Several common themes have emerged in these portrayals, including destruction and alterations to the faces.\n\n## Destruction\n\nOne common theme in Mount Rushmore's portrayal in popular culture is destruction. This can take many forms, from natural disasters to man-made catastrophes. For example, in the 1997 film \"Mars Attacks!\", the monument is destroyed by a Martian spaceship. Similarly, in the 2008 film \"2012\", Mount Rushmore is depicted as being destroyed by a massive earthquake.\n\nDestruction of Mount Rushmore is often used as a metaphor for the fragility of American society and the threat of external forces to American values. This theme is particularly common in disaster movies and science fiction films, where the monument is often used as a symbol of American strength and resilience.\n\n## Alterations and Additions to the Faces\n\nAnother common theme in Mount Rushmore's portrayal in popular culture is alterations and additions to the faces. This can range from humorous and satirical portrayals, such as the addition of a pair of sunglasses or a hat, to more serious and thought-provoking depictions, such as the addition of a fifth face or a change to one of the existing faces.\n\nFor example, in the 1985 film \"The Goonies\", the characters discover a hidden cave behind Mount Rushmore, where they find a series of booby traps and puzzles. In one scene, the characters use a device to alter the faces of the presidents, adding a series of humorous and silly features.\n\nAlterations and additions to the faces of Mount Rushmore are often used as a way to comment on American society and politics. For example, in the 2006 film \"Team America: World Police\", the faces of the presidents are altered to resemble those of famous actors and musicians, satirizing the cult of celebrity in American culture.\n\n# Imitations of the Style\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style and design have been imitated in numerous other sculptures and monuments around the world. For example, the \"Presidents Park\" sculpture in Williamsburg, Virginia, features a series of giant busts of American presidents, similar to those found at Mount Rushmore.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Crazy Horse Memorial\" in South Dakota, currently under construction, features a massive sculpture of the Native American leader Crazy Horse, carved into the side of a mountain. The memorial is designed to be a companion piece to Mount Rushmore, and features a similar style and design.\n\nImitations of Mount Rushmore's style often serve as a way to pay homage to the original monument, while also creating a unique and distinctive work of art. By imitating the style of Mount Rushmore, artists and sculptors can tap into the cultural significance and iconic status of the original monument.\n\n# Major Portrayals\n\nMount Rushmore has been featured in numerous major films and television shows, often as a symbol of American values and ideals. One of the most famous portrayals of Mount Rushmore is in the 1959 film \"North by Northwest\".\n\n## In North by Northwest\n\nIn \"North by Northwest\", Mount Rushmore is featured prominently in the film's final scene, where the protagonist, Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant), is chased by the villainous Phillip Vandamm (played by James Mason). The scene features a series of iconic shots of Mount Rushmore, including a famous scene where Thornhill and his love interest, Eve Kendall (played by Eva Marie Saint), are chased across the face of the monument.\n\nThe portrayal of Mount Rushmore in \"North by Northwest\" is often cited as one of the most iconic and influential in popular culture. The film's use of the monument as a symbol of American strength and resilience has been imitated and parodied countless times in other films and television shows.\n\n# In Music\n\nMount Rushmore has also been featured in numerous songs and music videos, often as a symbol of American values and ideals. For example, the song \"Mount Rushmore\" by the band \"Sports\" features lyrics that reference the monument and its cultural significance.\n\nSimilarly, the music video for the song \"Born in the U.S.A.\" by Bruce Springsteen features footage of Mount Rushmore, as well as other iconic American landmarks. The video is often cited as one of the most patriotic and nostalgic in rock music, and features a series of powerful and evocative images of American culture and society.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of films featuring Mount Rushmore\n* List of music videos featuring Mount Rushmore\n* Mount Rushmore National Memorial\n* Presidents of the United States\n* American culture\n* American history", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Situated along the Ottawa River, the village has undergone significant transformations since its establishment in the 19th century. From its early days as a mill town to its current status as a gentrified residential area, Britannia Village has maintained its unique character and charm.\n\n# History\n\n## Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 by Philemon Wright, an American entrepreneur who recognized the potential of the area's natural resources. Wright established a sawmill and gristmill along the Ottawa River, which became the economic backbone of the community. The village grew rapidly, attracting settlers and laborers who worked in the mills and surrounding farms. During this period, Britannia Village was a thriving industrial center, with the mills producing lumber and grain for local and international markets.\n\n## Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn the late 19th century, the village underwent a significant transformation. As the industrial economy declined, Britannia Village became a popular summer-cottage resort for Ottawa's wealthy elite. The area's natural beauty, with its scenic views of the Ottawa River and surrounding woods, made it an attractive destination for those seeking a retreat from the city. Many of the original mill town buildings were converted into summer homes, and new cottages were constructed to cater to the growing number of visitors.\n\n### Engineering feats\n\nDuring this period, Britannia Village witnessed several engineering feats that facilitated its growth as a resort town. The construction of the Britannia Bay Bridge in 1908, which spanned the Ottawa River, improved access to the area and enabled the development of new residential neighborhoods. Additionally, the installation of a streetcar line in 1910 connected Britannia Village to downtown Ottawa, making it easier for visitors to travel to and from the city.\n\n### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nOne of the most notable attractions in Britannia Village during this period was the Britannia Amusement Park, which operated from 1907 to 1940. The park featured a range of amenities, including a beach, a dance hall, and several amusement rides. It was a popular destination for both locals and visitors, and its closure in 1940 marked the end of an era for the community.\n\n## Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nIn the post-war period, Britannia Village underwent another significant transformation. As the city of Ottawa expanded, the village became a rural commuter town, with many residents traveling to the city for work. The construction of the Queensway highway in the 1960s further facilitated this trend, making it easier for commuters to travel to and from the city. During this period, the village experienced significant growth, with new residential developments and commercial areas emerging to cater to the growing population.\n\n## Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone a revitalization of sorts. Efforts to gentrify the area have led to the renovation of many of the original mill town buildings, which have been converted into upscale residences and commercial spaces. Additionally, the village has become a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with the nearby Britannia Park offering a range of recreational activities, including hiking, biking, and kayaking.\n\n### Flood proofing\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Britannia Village in recent years has been the issue of flooding. The village is located in a floodplain, and the Ottawa River has overflowed its banks on several occasions, causing significant damage to properties. In response to this issue, the city has implemented various flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a floodwall and the installation of flood-control gates.\n\n### Gentrification\n\nThe gentrification of Britannia Village has been a contentious issue, with some residents expressing concerns about the impact of new development on the community's character and affordability. While the renovation of old buildings and the influx of new businesses have brought new life to the area, they have also led to increased property values and rents, making it difficult for long-time residents to remain in the community.\n\n# Heritage buildings and architectural style\n\nBritannia Village is home to a number of heritage buildings, many of which date back to the 19th century. The village's architectural style is characterized by a mix of Victorian, Edwardian, and Arts and Crafts influences, reflecting the different periods of its development.\n\n## Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSeveral buildings in Britannia Village have been designated as heritage properties by the City of Ottawa. These include:\n\n* 280 Britannia Road (c. 1870)\n* 290 Britannia Road (c. 1880)\n* 300 Britannia Road (c. 1890)\n* 310 Britannia Road (c. 1900)\n\n## Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nWhile many of the original heritage buildings in Britannia Village have been preserved, modern residences in the area often incorporate heritage attributes, such as:\n\n* Brick or stone façades\n* Wooden trim and detailing\n* Multi-paned windows\n* Slate or metal roofing\n\nThese features pay homage to the village's rich history and architectural heritage, while also providing a unique and charming living environment for residents.\n\n# Character\n\nBritannia Village is a community with a strong sense of character and identity. Its unique blend of natural beauty, rich history, and small-town charm makes it a desirable place to live and visit. The village's strong sense of community is reflected in its many community events and festivals, which celebrate its heritage and bring residents together.\n\n# Notables in the community\n\nSeveral notable individuals have called Britannia Village home, including:\n\n* Philemon Wright, founder of the village\n* Thomas Ahearn, Ottawa entrepreneur and philanthropist\n* Alexander Campbell, politician and lawyer\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Britannia Village, Ottawa, including its history, heritage buildings, and character. Further research is recommended to explore the village's rich history and cultural significance in more detail.\n\n# References\n\nSources:\n\n* City of Ottawa. (n.d.).

It emphasized the importance of law, authority, and state power in maintaining social order and stability. This school of thought had a significant impact on the development of Chinese philosophy and politics, shaping the way Chinese rulers governed their subjects and influencing the course of Chinese history.\n\nRetrospective current\n-------------------\n\nThe retrospective current of Legalism refers to the way this philosophical school viewed the past and its relationship to the present. Legalists believed that the past was marked by chaos and disorder, and that the only way to create a stable and prosperous society was to establish a strong, centralized state with clear laws and regulations.\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nIn Chapter 43 of the Han Feizi, a key Legalist text, the author argues that the only way to achieve order and stability is through the establishment of clear laws and regulations. This chapter emphasizes the importance of creating a system of laws that is fair, consistent, and applicable to all members of society.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nDespite its emphasis on law and authority, Legalism was often categorized as a subset of Confucianism by later Chinese scholars. This categorization reflects the fact that many of the key concepts and ideas developed by Legalist thinkers were influenced by Confucian thought.\n\nMilitary mobilization\n-------------------\n\nOne of the key features of Legalist thought was its emphasis on military mobilization. Legalists believed that a strong military was essential for maintaining social order and protecting the state from external threats. This emphasis on military mobilization is reflected in the writings of key Legalist thinkers, such as Han Feizi.\n\nSima Qian\n---------\n\nSima Qian (145-86 BCE) was a Chinese historian who wrote extensively about the Legalist school of thought. In his book, \"Records of the Grand Historian,\" Sima Qian provides a detailed account of the development of Legalism and its key thinkers.\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n---------------------\n\nThe Huang-Lao school of thought was a philosophical movement that emerged during the Warring States period. It emphasized the importance of living in harmony with nature and following the natural order of things. The Mawangdui texts, a collection of silk manuscripts discovered in the 1970s, provide valuable insights into the teachings of the Huang-Lao school.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao school of thought was heavily influenced by the teachings of Laozi, the founder of Daoism. Laozi's emphasis on living in harmony with nature and following the natural order of things is reflected in the teachings of the Huang-Lao school.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao (350-275 BCE) was a key thinker of the Huang-Lao school, while Zhuangzi (369-286 BCE) was a prominent Daoist philosopher. The teachings of Shen Dao and Zhuangzi on the importance of living in harmony with nature and following the natural order of things reflect the influence of Laozi's thought on the Huang-Lao school.\n\nChanging with the times\n---------------------\n\nThe concept of \"changing with the times\" refers to the idea that social and political institutions must adapt to changing circumstances in order to remain effective. This concept is central to the teachings of the Legalist school of thought.\n\n### A.C. Graham\n\nA.C. Graham (1919-1991) was a British sinologist who wrote extensively about Chinese philosophy, including the Legalist school of thought. In his book, \"Disputers of the Tao,\" Graham provides a detailed analysis of the development of Legalism and its key thinkers.\n\nConfucian influences\n------------------\n\nDespite its emphasis on law and authority, the Legalist school of thought was heavily influenced by Confucian thought. Many of the key concepts and ideas developed by Legalist thinkers, such as the importance of social hierarchy and the need for a strong, centralized state, reflect the influence of Confucian thought.\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao was a key thinker of the Huang-Lao school, but his teachings also reflect the influence of Confucian thought. Shen Dao's emphasis on the importance of social hierarchy and the need for a strong, centralized state reflect the influence of Confucian thought on his teachings.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n-------------------\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei are two key concepts in Chinese philosophy that are closely related to the teachings of the Legalist school of thought. Xing-Ming refers to the idea that human nature is inherently good, while Wu wei refers to the concept of non-action or effortless action.\n\nHan Feizi\n---------\n\nHan Feizi (280-233 BCE) was a key thinker of the Legalist school of thought. His book, \"Han Feizi,\" provides a detailed analysis of the teachings of the Legalist school and its key concepts.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nDaodejing 17 is a key chapter of the Daodejing, a central text of Daoist philosophy. This chapter emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and following the natural order of things.\n\nSchool of names\n----------------\n\nThe School of Names was a philosophical movement that emerged during the Warring States period. It emphasized the importance of language and the need for clear definitions and distinctions.\n\nEradicating punishments\n----------------------\n\nThe concept of \"eradicating punishments\" refers to the idea that the state should eliminate punishments and instead focus on rewarding good behavior. This concept is central to the teachings of the Legalist school of thought.\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi's book provides a detailed analysis of the concept of eradicating punishments and its implications for the state.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe concept of justice is closely related to the teachings of the Legalist school of thought. The Legalists believed that justice was essential for maintaining social order and stability.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n-------------------------\n\nThe Legalist mythos refers to the stories and legends that surround the development of the Legalist school of thought.\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi was a key thinker of the Legalist school of thought. His writings provide valuable insights into the teachings of the Legalist school and its key concepts.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 bce)\n\nLiu An was a key thinker of the Huang-Lao school of thought. His writings provide valuable insights into the teachings of the Huang-Lao school and its key concepts.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School was a philosophical movement that emerged during the Warring States period. It emphasized the importance of law and authority in maintaining social order and stability.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n-------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" following this outline:\n\n#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

The trophy has a rich history dating back to 1935, and its presentation is a highlight of the province's hockey calendar.\n\n#History\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was established in 1935 by the son of G.W. Herder, a well-known businessman from St. John's, Newfoundland. The Herder family had a long association with hockey in the province, and the trophy was donated to recognize the achievements of senior hockey teams. The first winner of the trophy was the St. John's All-Stars, who defeated the Corner Brook All-Stars in the inaugural championship series.\n\n#The Herder family\n\nThe Herder family was a prominent family in St. John's, with a history of business and community involvement. G.W. Herder, the patriarch of the family, was a successful businessman who owned several companies, including a hardware store and a lumber mill. His son, who donated the trophy, was also involved in the family business and was a keen hockey enthusiast.\n\n#The trophy\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver-plated trophy with a wooden base, standing approximately 18 inches tall. The trophy features an inscription that reads: \"Presented by the Herder Family in memory of G.W. Herder to the champion of the Newfoundland and Labrador Senior Hockey League.\" The trophy is kept on display at the Newfoundland and Labrador Sports Hall of Fame in St. John's.\n\n#Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder Memorial Trophy was donated, the trophy donor placed several conditions on its presentation. These conditions were intended to ensure that the trophy was awarded to the true champion of the Newfoundland and Labrador Senior Hockey League.\n\nThe conditions were as follows:\n\n1. The trophy would be awarded to the team that won the most games in a best-of-seven championship series.\n2. The championship series would be played between the winners of the Eastern and Western divisions of the league.\n3. The trophy would be presented to the winning team at a formal ceremony.\n4. The winning team would be required to return the trophy to the league at the end of the season.\n5. The trophy would be kept on display at the Newfoundland and Labrador Sports Hall of Fame.\n6. The league would be responsible for maintaining the trophy and ensuring its safekeeping.\n7. The trophy would be awarded annually, unless the league decided to cancel the championship series.\n\n##Exceptions to the original conditions\n\nOver the years, there have been several exceptions to the original conditions placed by the trophy donor.\n\n###Condition #2\n\nIn 1947, the league changed its format to a single division, and the championship series was played between the top two teams in the league. This change was made to reduce travel costs and to make the league more competitive.\n\n###Condition #4\n\nIn 1955, the league decided to allow the winning team to keep the trophy for the entire year, rather than returning it to the league at the end of the season.

As the police struggle to find any leads, a determined cop, IG Mehta (Sunny Deol), is brought in to crack the case. Mehta soon discovers that the murders are not just random acts of violence, but are actually a form of revenge taken by a serial killer who is targeting film critics who have wronged him in the past.\n\nAs Mehta delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the killer is none other than an artist named Danny (Dulquer Salmaan), who was once a struggling painter but was destroyed by the harsh criticism of film critics. Danny, who is revealed to be a genius artist, became obsessed with the idea of taking revenge on those who had wronged him, and began to target film critics who had written negative reviews of his work.\n\nAs the cat-and-mouse game between Mehta and Danny intensifies, the film takes a series of dark and unexpected turns. Along the way, Mehta must also contend with his own personal demons, including a troubled past and a complicated relationship with his daughter.

Rahman, who is known for his work on films such as Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours.

She then clerked for Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998. In 1998, Jackson joined the law firm Goodwin Procter, where she worked as a litigator until 1999. She then served as a staff attorney and later as a supervising attorney at the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia from 1999 to 2003.\n\n# U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2010 and served on the Commission until 2014. During her time on the Commission, Jackson worked on several high-profile projects, including the revision of the federal sentencing guidelines for mortgage fraud and the development of new guidelines for sentencing in cases involving child pornography.\n\n# District Court (2013–2021)\n\nIn 2012, President Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States District Judge for the District of Columbia. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2013 and served on the District Court until 2021. During her time on the District Court, Jackson presided over several high-profile cases, including a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\n## Selected rulings\n\nIn 2018, Jackson ruled in favor of a group of labor unions in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to rescind a rule requiring employers to disclose payments made to anti-union consultants. She held that the administration's decision was arbitrary and capricious and therefore unlawful.\n\nIn 2019, Jackson ruled in favor of a group of asylum seekers in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to deny asylum to individuals who had crossed the border between ports of entry. She held that the administration's decision was inconsistent with federal law and therefore unlawful.\n\n# U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Jackson to serve as a United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit. She was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 and served on the Court of Appeals until 2022. During her time on the Court of Appeals, Jackson heard several high-profile cases, including a lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to end the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\n\n# Nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nOn February 25, 2022, President Biden nominated Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer. Her nomination was met with widespread support from Democrats and civil rights organizations, but was opposed by many Republicans.\n\n# U.S. Supreme Court (2022–present)\n\nJackson was confirmed by the Senate on April 7, 2022, and was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on June 30, 2022. She is the first African American woman to serve on the Court.\n\n## Labor disputes\n\nJackson has been a strong supporter of labor unions and workers' rights. In her first term on the Court, she dissented in a case involving a challenge to the National Labor Relations Act, arguing that the statute's protections for workers were essential to promoting fair labor practices.\n\n## Affirmative action\n\nJackson has expressed support for affirmative action programs, which she believes are essential to promoting diversity and inclusion in education and employment. In a case involving a challenge to Harvard University's affirmative action policies, she argued that the university's policies were lawful and necessary to promote diversity on campus.\n\n## Judicial philosophy\n\nJackson has described herself as a textualist and an originalist, meaning that she believes that the Constitution and federal statutes should be interpreted according to their plain meaning and original intent. She has also expressed a commitment to ensuring that the law is applied fairly and impartially to all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\n# Personal life\n\nJackson is married to Patrick G.

The term has become a cultural phenomenon, symbolizing the unprecedented event in film history where two highly anticipated movies, targeting different demographics, were released on the same day.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Release date dispute\n\nThe release date of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was initially set for different dates. However, in a surprise move, Warner Bros. Pictures, the distributor of \"Barbie,\" announced that the film's release would be moved to July 21, 2023, coinciding with the already scheduled release date of \"Oppenheimer\" by Universal Pictures. This decision sparked a heated debate among film enthusiasts, industry experts, and the general public.\n\n### Public reaction\n\nThe public reaction to the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was mixed. Some moviegoers expressed excitement at the prospect of having two major films to choose from on the same day, while others were concerned that the competition would negatively impact the box office performance of one or both films. Social media platforms were flooded with discussions, memes, and hashtags, including #Barbenheimer, which quickly gained popularity.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing strategies employed by both studios were closely watched by industry observers. Warner Bros. Pictures focused on promoting \"Barbie\" as a family-friendly film, targeting young girls and families. In contrast, Universal Pictures positioned \"Oppenheimer\" as a biographical drama, appealing to fans of historical dramas and science enthusiasts. Both studios invested heavily in advertising, with \"Barbie\" receiving a reported $100 million marketing budget and \"Oppenheimer\" receiving a reported $50 million.\n\n### Double feature viewing\n\nIn response to the simultaneous release, some movie theater chains offered a unique promotion, allowing customers to purchase a single ticket to watch both films back-to-back. This \"double feature\" viewing option was seen as a way to capitalize on the excitement surrounding the two films.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\n#### Projections\n\nPre-release box office projections varied widely, with some analysts predicting that \"Barbie\" would outperform \"Oppenheimer,\" while others suggested that the biographical drama would attract a larger audience.\n\n#### Gross\n\nThe combined opening weekend box office gross for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" exceeded expectations, with \"Barbie\" grossing over $155 million and \"Oppenheimer\" grossing over $80 million. The total opening weekend gross for both films was over $235 million, making it one of the largest combined opening weekends in film history.\n\n### Film industry reaction\n\nThe film industry reaction to the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was largely positive. Many industry experts praised the bold move by Warner Bros. Pictures and Universal Pictures, citing the potential benefits of increased box office revenue and exposure for both films.\n\n### Japanese response\n\nIn Japan, the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" sparked a unique reaction. The country's film industry has traditionally been dominated by domestic productions, but the success of the two Hollywood films has led to increased interest in importing and distributing Western films.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe success of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" can be attributed to a combination of factors, including effective marketing, strong word-of-mouth, and the appeal of the films' respective genres. The simultaneous release also created a sense of excitement and urgency, encouraging moviegoers to see both films.\n\n### Reviews\n\nCritical reviews for both films were largely positive, with \"Barbie\" receiving praise for its visuals and performances, and \"Oppenheimer\" being lauded for its historical accuracy and Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the titular character.\n\n### Accolades\n\nBoth films received numerous award nominations, including several Academy Award nominations. \"Barbie\" was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects, while \"Oppenheimer\" received nominations for Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Picture.\n\nCounterprogramming\n------------------\n\n### Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n\nThe simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" has been compared to the \"Glicked\" phenomenon, where a smaller film benefits from being released alongside a larger, more popular film. In this case, \"Oppenheimer\" may have benefited from the attention and publicity surrounding \"Barbie,\" allowing it to reach a wider audience.\n\nNotes\n------\n\nThis article uses the term \"Barbenheimer\" to refer to the simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\" This term is not officially recognized by either Warner Bros. Pictures or Universal Pictures.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Barbie (2023 film)\n* Oppenheimer (2023 film)\n* Box office\n* Film industry\n* Hollywood\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNone.\n\nFurther reading\n----------------\n\n* \"The 'Barbenheimer' Phenomenon: How Two Films Changed the Box Office\" by The Hollywood Reporter\n* \"The Unlikely Success of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer'\" by Variety\n* \"The 'Glicked' Phenomenon: How Smaller Films Can Benefit from Big Releases\" by The Guardian\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* Official website of \"Barbie\"\n* Official website of \"Oppenheimer\"\n* Box Office Mojo: \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Barbenheimer\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Release date dispute\n###Public reaction\n##Marketing\n##Double feature viewing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###Projections\n###Gross\n##Film industry reaction\n##Japanese response\n##Analysis\n##Reviews\n##Accolades\n#Counterprogramming\n##Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While the Games were a celebration of athletic achievement and international unity, they were also marred by numerous concerns and controversies. This article provides an overview of the various issues that arose during the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n# Criticism of Host Selection\n\nThe selection of Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics was widely criticized by human rights groups, politicians, and some athletes. The main concerns centered around China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of minority groups, such as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Many argued that awarding the Olympics to China would legitimize the country's human rights abuses and provide a platform for the Chinese government to promote its propaganda.\n\n# Organizing Concerns and Controversies\n\n## Cost and Climate\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were one of the most expensive Games in history, with estimated costs exceeding $38 billion. The high costs were largely due to the construction of new infrastructure, including the National Speed Skating Oval and the Big Air Shougang. Additionally, concerns were raised about the environmental impact of the Games, particularly with regards to the use of artificial snow and the disruption of natural habitats.\n\n## Promotional Song\n\nThe official promotional song for the 2022 Winter Olympics, \"Together for a Shared Future,\" was criticized for its lyrics, which some interpreted as propaganda promoting Chinese nationalism. The song was also accused of being overly focused on China's role in the Olympics, rather than the athletes and the spirit of the Games.\n\n# Diplomatic Boycotts or Non-Attendance\n\n## Background\n\nIn response to concerns over human rights abuses in China, several countries announced diplomatic boycotts of the 2022 Winter Olympics. This meant that while athletes from these countries would still compete, their governments would not send official delegations to the Games.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to announce a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The decision was made by President Joe Biden, who cited concerns over China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia also announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing concerns over human rights abuses in China. The decision was made by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who stated that the move was a \"principled\" response to China's actions.\n\n## India\n\nIndia announced that it would not send an official delegation to the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing concerns over the participation of Chinese soldiers who had clashed with Indian troops in a border dispute.\n\n## Calls for Boycotts by Other Countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, were called upon to join the diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics. However, not all countries heeded the call, with some choosing to send official delegations to the Games.\n\n## Chinese Government Response\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the diplomatic boycotts by accusing the participating countries of \"politicizing\" the Olympics. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, stated that the boycotts were \"unacceptable\" and would have no impact on the success of the Games.\n\n## IOC Response\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) responded to the diplomatic boycotts by stating that the Olympics were a celebration of athletic achievement and international unity, and that politics should not be involved. IOC President Thomas Bach stated that the organization respected the decisions of individual countries, but encouraged all nations to participate in the spirit of the Games.\n\n# Athletes and Team Officials Complaints\n\n## Quarantine Facilities\n\nSeveral athletes and team officials complained about the quarantine facilities provided by the Chinese government. Some reported that the facilities were inadequate, with poor food and living conditions.\n\n## Food\n\nAthletes and team officials also complained about the food provided at the Olympics, with some reporting that it was inadequate or unhealthy. Some countries, such as the United States, brought their own food to the Games.\n\n## Weather Conditions\n\nThe weather conditions during the 2022 Winter Olympics were also a point of contention, with some athletes complaining about the cold temperatures and wind. However, others praised the conditions, saying that they were ideal for winter sports.\n\n# Team Russia\n\n## Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe participation of Russian athletes in the 2022 Winter Olympics was overshadowed by the country's invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, which began on February 24, 2022, led to widespread condemnation from the international community.\n\n# Environmental and Health Issues\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were held during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several athletes and team officials tested positive for the virus. The Chinese government implemented strict health protocols, including mask-wearing and social distancing, to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\n## Insufficient Snowfall\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were also affected by insufficient snowfall, which forced the use of artificial snow in some events.\n\n## Energy Crisis\n\nChina faced an energy crisis during the 2022 Winter Olympics, with some areas experiencing power outages. The crisis was caused by a combination of factors, including high demand and supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n\nThe construction of infrastructure for the 2022 Winter Olympics had a significant impact on the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a protected area in China. The reserve was damaged by the construction of roads and other infrastructure, leading to concerns about the impact on local wildlife.\n\n# Human Rights Issues\n\n## Sportswashing\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were criticized for being used as a tool for \"sportswashing,\" a practice in which countries use sports to improve their international reputation and distract from human rights abuses.\n\n## Athlete Safety\n\nThere were concerns about the safety of athletes during the 2022 Winter Olympics, particularly with regards to the risk of injury or illness. Some athletes reported that they had been pressured to compete despite being injured or ill.\n\n## Athletes' Freedom of Speech\n\nThere were also concerns about the freedom of speech of athletes during the 2022 Winter Olympics.

The island is known for its iconic twin volcanic peaks, the Pitons, which have become a symbol of the country's unique identity. With a population of approximately 179,000 people, Saint Lucia is a popular tourist destination and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nEtymology\n----------\n\nThe origin of the name \"Saint Lucia\" is attributed to the French, who named the island after Saint Lucy of Syracuse, a 4th-century Christian martyr. The name was first used by the French in 1638, and it has been retained ever since.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Pre-colonial period\n\nThe first known inhabitants of Saint Lucia were the Arawak people, an indigenous tribe that migrated from the mainland hundreds of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Arawak people were skilled farmers, fishermen, and craftsmen, and they developed a complex society with their own language, culture, and traditions.\n\n### Early European period\n\nIn 1498, Christopher Columbus sighted Saint Lucia on his fourth voyage to the New World. However, it was the French who established the first European settlement on the island in 1638. The French colonizers brought enslaved Africans to the island, who were forced to work on plantations producing sugar, coffee, and cocoa. The French and British fought over control of the island throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, with the British eventually gaining control in 1814.\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, Saint Lucia became a major producer of sugar, with the industry driving the island's economy. The transatlantic slave trade brought thousands of enslaved Africans to the island, who were subjected to harsh conditions and brutal treatment. After slavery was abolished in 1834, indentured servants from India and other parts of Asia were brought to the island to work on plantations.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Saint Lucia began to move towards independence from British colonial rule. The island gained internal self-government in 1967, and on February 22, 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent nation. The country's first prime minister was John Compton, who played a key role in the island's transition to independence.\n\n### Post-independence era\n\nSince gaining independence, Saint Lucia has continued to develop its economy and improve living standards for its citizens. The country has invested in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and has become a popular tourist destination. In 2011, Saint Lucia became the 15th country to join the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), a regional organization that aims to promote economic integration and social justice in the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nGeography\n----------\n\n### Climate\n\nSaint Lucia has a tropical climate, with average temperatures ranging from 22°C to 30°C (72°F to 86°F) throughout the year. The island experiences a wet season from June to November, with the most significant rainfall occurring in July and August. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is characterized by low humidity and plenty of sunshine.\n\n### Geology\n\nSaint Lucia is a volcanic island, with the iconic Pitons rising dramatically from the sea. The Pitons are two volcanic peaks, Gros Piton and Petit Piton, which are connected by a ridge. The island's geology is characterized by volcanic rock, with numerous hot springs and geothermal areas. The island's volcanic origin has created a diverse range of landscapes, including beaches, forests, and mountains.\n\nGovernment\n----------\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\nSaint Lucia is divided into 11 administrative districts, each with its own local government. The districts are:\n\n1. Anse-la-Raye\n2. Babonneau\n3. Castries\n4. Choiseul\n5. Dennery\n6. Gros-Islet\n7. Laborie\n8. Micoud\n9. Praslin\n10. Soufrière\n11. Vieux-Fort\n\n### Law and crime\n\nSaint Lucia has a parliamentary system of government, with the prime minister serving as head of government. The country has an independent judiciary, with the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court serving as the highest court. Crime rates in Saint Lucia are relatively low, with the most common crimes being theft, burglary, and assault.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nSaint Lucia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organization of American States, and the Association of Caribbean States. The country has diplomatic relations with numerous countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Saint Lucia is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), a regional organization that aims to promote economic integration and cooperation in the Caribbean.\n\nEconomy\n-------\n\n### Tourism\n\nTourism is a major sector of the Saint Lucian economy, with the industry generating significant revenue for the country. Visitors are drawn to the island's natural beauty, including its beaches, forests, and volcanic peaks. The country's tourism industry is focused on high-end resorts and eco-tourism, with a range of activities available, including hiking, birdwatching, and scuba diving.\n\n### Agriculture\n\nAgriculture is another important sector of the Saint Lucian economy, with the country producing a range of crops, including bananas, cocoa, and coffee. The industry is focused on small-scale farming, with many farmers producing crops for local consumption.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\nSaint Lucia has a well-developed infrastructure, with a range of amenities available, including roads, ports, and airports. The country's main airport, Hewanorra International Airport, is located in Vieux-Fort, and offers flights to destinations in the Caribbean, North America, and Europe.\n\nDemographics\n------------\n\n### Ethnic groups\n\nThe population of Saint Lucia is predominantly of African descent, with many people also having European and indigenous ancestry. The country's ethnic groups include:\n\n* African: 85.3%\n* Mixed: 10.9%\n* East Indian: 2.2%\n* European: 0.8%\n* Other: 0.8%\n\n### Languages\n\nThe official language of Saint Lucia is English, although many people also speak Saint Lucian Creole, a French-based creole language.\n\n### Religion\n\nThe majority of people in Saint Lucia are Christian, with the largest denominations being Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.

The by-election was called following the resignation of incumbent mayor John Tory, who had served in the position since 2014.\n\n# Background\n\n## Resignation of John Tory and subsequent vacancy\n\nOn February 10, 2023, John Tory announced his resignation as mayor of Toronto, effective February 17, 2023. Tory's resignation came after it was revealed that he had engaged in an extramarital affair with a member of his staff. The affair had begun in 2020 and had continued until 2022, when it was ended by Tory. The news of the affair and Tory's subsequent resignation sparked widespread media attention and public interest.\n\nFollowing Tory's resignation, the City of Toronto was required to hold a by-election to fill the resulting vacancy. The by-election was called by the city clerk, and the date was set for June 26, 2023.\n\n## By-election process\n\nThe by-election process in Toronto is governed by the City of Toronto Act, 2006, and the Municipal Elections Act, 1996. Under these laws, a by-election must be held within 60 days of a vacancy occurring in the office of the mayor. The by-election is conducted using a first-past-the-post system, where the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.\n\n# Mayoral debates\n\nA series of debates were held during the by-election campaign, featuring the candidates vying for the office of mayor. The debates were organized by various media outlets and community groups, and were designed to provide voters with an opportunity to hear from the candidates and learn about their policies and positions.\n\nThe debates were widely covered in the media, and were seen as an important part of the by-election campaign. They provided voters with a chance to assess the candidates' leadership skills, knowledge of the issues, and ability to think on their feet.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 15 candidates registered to run in the by-election. The candidates came from a variety of backgrounds, including politics, business, and community activism.\n\n## Declined\n\nSeveral high-profile individuals were rumored to be considering a run in the by-election, but ultimately declined to enter the race. These included former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne, former Toronto councillor Adam Vaughan, and businessman and philanthropist David Cheriton.\n\n# Endorsements\n\nDuring the campaign, several candidates received endorsements from prominent individuals and organizations. These endorsements were seen as important, as they provided candidates with a level of credibility and legitimacy.\n\nOne of the most notable endorsements was that of former Toronto mayor David Miller, who endorsed candidate Olivia Chow. Miller's endorsement was seen as a significant boost to Chow's campaign, as he is a well-respected figure in Toronto politics.\n\n# Opinion polls\n\nA series of opinion polls were conducted during the campaign, in an effort to gauge public opinion and predict the outcome of the election. The polls were conducted by various polling firms, and were based on surveys of Toronto voters.\n\nThe polls showed a range of results, with different candidates leading at different times. However, one candidate consistently polled ahead of the others, and was seen as the front-runner throughout the campaign.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the by-election were announced on June 26, 2023. The winner of the election was Olivia Chow, who received 37.4% of the vote. Chow was followed by Ana Bailão, who received 25.6% of the vote, and Brad Bradford, who received 14.5% of the vote.\n\nChow's victory was seen as a significant upset, as she had been trailing in the polls for much of the campaign. However, she ran a strong campaign, and was able to build momentum in the final weeks leading up to the election.\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Toronto_mayoral_by-election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Resignation of John Tory and subsequent vacancy\n##By-election process\n#Mayoral debates\n#Candidates\n##Declined\n#Endorsements\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The Shahed 136 has gained significant attention in recent years due to its deployment in various conflict zones, including Yemen, Ukraine, and Syria.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nThe Shahed 136 is a loitering munition, a type of drone designed to hover over a target area for an extended period before descending and detonating an explosive warhead. The drone has a delta-wing design and is powered by a single piston engine. It has a length of approximately 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) and a wingspan of around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). The Shahed 136 is equipped with a warhead weighing around 40 kilograms (88 pounds), which is capable of causing significant damage to armored vehicles and other hardened targets.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been deployed by various countries, including Iran, Russia, and Yemen's Houthi rebels. The drone has been used in a variety of roles, including reconnaissance, surveillance, and combat missions. The Shahed 136's ability to loiter over a target area for extended periods makes it an effective tool for gathering intelligence and conducting precision strikes.\n\n## Comms and guidance system\n\nThe Shahed 136 uses a combination of GPS and inertial navigation systems to guide itself to its target. The drone is also equipped with a communication system that allows it to receive commands and transmit data back to its operators.\n\n## Electronics\n\nThe Shahed 136's electronics are designed to be highly reliable and resistant to electronic countermeasures. The drone is equipped with a range of sensors, including cameras, infrared detectors, and radar, which allow it to detect and track targets.\n\n# Geran-2\n\nThe Geran-2 is a Russian-made variant of the Shahed 136, which was unveiled in 2022. The Geran-2 is reportedly manufactured in Russia using Iranian designs and components. The drone is similar in design to the Shahed 136 but has some distinct differences, including a modified fuselage and a new propulsion system.\n\n# Combat history\n\n## Yemeni Civil War\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been used extensively by Yemen's Houthi rebels in their conflict against the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led coalition allies. The drone has been used to attack a range of targets, including military bases, oil facilities, and civilian infrastructure.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n### First appearances\n\nThe Shahed 136 first appeared in Ukraine in September 2022, when Russian forces began using the drone to attack Ukrainian targets. The drone was initially used to attack military targets, but later began to be used against civilian infrastructure, including power plants and apartment buildings.\n\n### October waves\n\nIn October 2022, Russia launched a series of drone attacks against Ukraine using the Shahed 136. The attacks targeted major cities across Ukraine, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Lviv. The drones were used to attack critical infrastructure, including power plants, water treatment facilities, and hospitals.\n\n### Ukrainian defense\n\nThe Ukrainian military has developed a range of tactics to counter the Shahed 136, including the use of surface-to-air missiles and anti-drone systems. The Ukrainian military has also developed a network of drone detection and tracking systems, which allow it to monitor and respond to Shahed 136 drone activity.\n\n### Production in Russia\n\nIn 2022, it was reported that Russia had begun manufacturing the Shahed 136 in Russia, using Iranian designs and components. The production of the Shahed 136 in Russia has raised concerns about the potential for the drone to be used in future conflicts.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe use of the Shahed 136 by Russia in Ukraine has been widely condemned by Western countries, which have accused Russia of using the drone to target civilians and critical infrastructure. The Ukrainian government has also accused Russia of using the Shahed 136 to commit war crimes.\n\n## 2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nIn 2022, the Shahed 136 was used by Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan to attack Kurdish targets. The drone was used to attack military bases and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools.\n\n## 2023 Indian Ocean\n\nIn 2023, it was reported that the Shahed 136 had been used by Iranian-backed militias to attack oil tankers in the Indian Ocean. The attacks were reportedly carried out in response to US and Israeli military operations in the region.\n\n## 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n\nIn 2024, Iran used the Shahed 136 to attack Israeli targets, including military bases and civilian infrastructure. The attacks were reportedly carried out in response to Israeli military operations in the region.\n\n# Classification controversy\n\nThe Shahed 136 has been the subject of controversy over its classification as a drone or a cruise missile. The drone's ability to loiter over a target area for extended periods and its use of a warhead have led some to classify it as a cruise missile, while others argue that it is a type of drone.\n\n# Relations with other Shahed drones\n\n## Shahed 131\n\nThe Shahed 131 is a variant of the Shahed 136, which is designed for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. The Shahed 131 has a similar design to the Shahed 136 but is equipped with a range of sensors and cameras, which allow it to gather intelligence and conduct surveillance.\n\n## Shahed 238\n\nThe Shahed 238 is a larger variant of the Shahed 136, which is designed for combat and strike missions. The Shahed 238 has a longer range and a heavier payload than the Shahed 136, making it a more effective tool for conducting precision strikes.\n\n# Operators\n\nThe Shahed 136 is operated by a range of countries, including Iran, Russia, and Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of unmanned aerial vehicles\n* Iranian military industry\n* Russian military industry\n\n# External links\n\n* HESA official website\n* Iranian Ministry of Defense official website\n* Russian Ministry of Defense official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"HESA_Shahed_136\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n##Description\n##Deployment\n##Comms and guidance system\n##Electronics\n#Geran-2\n#Combat history\n##Yemeni Civil War\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###First appearances\n###October waves\n###Ukrainian defense\n###Production in Russia\n###Reactions\n##2022 Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan\n##2023 Indian Ocean\n##2024 Iranian strikes on Israel\n#Classification controversy\n#Relations with other Shahed drones\n##Shahed 131\n##Shahed 238\n#Operators\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
