The film is based on the classic tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, developed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The movie follows a group of misfits as they embark on a thrilling journey filled with danger, magic, and camaraderie.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a fantasy world filled with mythical creatures, legendary heroes, and ancient magic. The story revolves around Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine), a charismatic thief and scoundrel who is determined to pull off the heist of a lifetime. Edgin is joined by a motley crew of adventurers, each with their unique skills and personalities. There's Holga Kilgore (Michelle Rodriguez), a battle-hardened warrior with a penchant for violence; Xenk Yendar (Regé-Jean Page), a charming and cunning rogue; Doric (Sophia Lillis), a half-orc who is both fierce and gentle; and Simon Aumar (Justice Smith), a bumbling but lovable wizard.\n\nAs the group navigates the complex web of intrigue and deception, they find themselves entangled in a sinister plot that threatens the very fabric of their world. Along the way, they must confront their own demons, forge unexpected alliances, and learn to trust each other if they hope to survive.

The season began on 13 August 2021 and concluded on 22 May 2022.\n\nSummary\n--------\n\n### The race for first place\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season saw a closely contested title race between Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea. Manchester City eventually won their fourth Premier League title in five years, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool. Chelsea finished third, 19 points behind the champions.\n\n### Newcastle takeover\n\nIn October 2021, the Premier League approved the takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The deal was worth £305 million, with the consortium purchasing an 80% stake in the club. The takeover marked a significant change in the ownership of the club, with the new owners pledging to invest in the team and improve the club's infrastructure.\n\n### COVID-19 outbreaks force postponements\n\nThe 2021–22 Premier League season was affected by COVID-19 outbreaks, with several matches postponed due to positive cases among players and staff. The outbreaks led to a congested fixture list, with some teams playing multiple matches in a short period.\n\n### Abramovich sanctions\n\nIn March 2022, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government due to his alleged ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions froze Abramovich's assets, including his stake in Chelsea, and prevented the club from selling tickets or merchandise. The club was eventually sold to a consortium led by Todd Boehly in May 2022.\n\n### Final day climax\n\nThe final day of the season saw a dramatic conclusion to the title race, with Manchester City coming from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2 and win the title. Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1, but it was not enough to overtake Manchester City.\n\n#### Title\n\nManchester City won their fourth Premier League title in five years, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool. The title was won on the final day of the season, with Manchester City coming from behind to beat Aston Villa 3-2.\n\n#### Relegation\n\nNorwich City, Watford, and Everton were relegated to the Championship, finishing 20th, 19th, and 18th respectively.\n\n#### Champions League, Europa League and Conference League spots\n\nManchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, and Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the Champions League, while Arsenal and Manchester United qualified for the Europa League.

The coup led to the overthrow of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, who had been in power since 2009.\n\n#Background\n\nGabon, a country located in Central Africa, has a history of authoritarian rule and political instability. The country gained independence from France in 1960, and since then, it has been ruled by the Bongo family, with Omar Bongo serving as president from 1967 until his death in 2009. His son, Ali Bongo Ondimba, succeeded him and has been in power ever since.\n\n##2023 elections\n\nIn August 2023, Gabon held presidential elections, which were widely seen as a sham. The elections were marked by allegations of voter suppression, ballot stuffing, and other forms of electoral malfeasance. President Ali Bongo Ondimba was declared the winner, with 64% of the vote, but the opposition rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged.\n\n#Coup\n\nThe coup was launched on August 30, 2023, by a group of military officers who were dissatisfied with the government's handling of the economy and the country's political situation. The military officers, who were led by General Brice Oligui, seized control of key government buildings, including the presidential palace, and announced that they had taken power.\n\n##Events\n\nThe coup was carried out with relative ease, as the government's security forces were quickly overwhelmed by the military. President Ali Bongo Ondimba was nowhere to be found, and it was later reported that he had fled the country. The military officers declared a state of emergency and announced that they would be forming a new government.\n\n##Arrests of Ali Bongo and other officials\n\nOn August 31, 2023, it was announced that President Ali Bongo Ondimba had been arrested, along with several other high-ranking government officials.

The election was the first to be held after the 2022 presidential election, in which Emmanuel Macron was re-elected for a second term as President of France.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 legislative election was the first to be held under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, who had been elected for a second term in the presidential election held in April 2022. The election took place in the aftermath of the presidential election, in which Macron had defeated Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (RN) by a margin of 58.55% to 41.45%.\n\nThe legislative election was seen as a key test for Macron's presidency, as he sought to secure a majority in the National Assembly to implement his policies. The election was also seen as an opportunity for the opposition parties to challenge Macron's dominance and to present alternative policies to the French people.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe French legislative election uses a two-round system to elect the members of the National Assembly. In the first round, voters in each constituency elect a candidate to represent them in the National Assembly. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the valid votes cast in the constituency, they are elected in the first round. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the valid votes, a second round is held between the top two candidates, with the candidate receiving the most votes being elected.\n\n# Dates\n\nThe first round of the legislative election was held on 12 June 2022, with the second round being held on 19 June 2022. The official campaign period began on 30 May 2022 and ended on 10 June 2022 for the first round, and on 13 June 2022 for the second round.\n\n# Major Parties and Alliances\n\nThe main parties and alliances that contested the 2022 legislative election were:\n\n* La République En Marche! (LREM), the party founded by Emmanuel Macron in 2016, which was seeking to retain its majority in the National Assembly.\n* National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen, which was seeking to increase its representation in the National Assembly and to present a challenge to Macron's presidency.\n* The Socialist Party (PS), which was seeking to rebuild its representation in the National Assembly after a poor performance in the 2017 legislative election.\n* The Republicans (LR), which was seeking to increase its representation in the National Assembly and to present a challenge to Macron's presidency from the right.\n* La France Insoumise (LFI), a left-wing party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, which was seeking to increase its representation in the National Assembly and to present a challenge to Macron's presidency from the left.\n\n## Deputies not Standing for Reelection\n\nA number of deputies chose not to stand for re-election in the 2022 legislative election, including several high-profile members of the National Assembly. These included:\n\n* François de Rugy, the former President of the National Assembly, who announced that he would not be standing for re-election due to his involvement in a scandal over his use of public funds.\n* Richard Ferrand, the leader of the LREM group in the National Assembly, who announced that he would not be standing for re-election due to his involvement in a scandal over his use of public funds.\n* Olivier Véran, the former Minister of Health, who announced that he would not be standing for re-election in order to focus on his work as a doctor.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nThe opinion polls in the run-up to the 2022 legislative election suggested that La République En Marche! would retain its majority in the National Assembly, but that the party would face a challenge from the opposition parties. The polls also suggested that the National Rally would increase its representation in the National Assembly, and that La France Insoumise would also make gains.\n\n# Results\n\n## First Round\n\nThe first round of the legislative election was held on 12 June 2022. The results of the first round showed that La République En Marche! had won the most votes, with 25.75% of the valid votes cast. The National Rally had come second, with 19.05% of the valid votes, followed by La France Insoumise, which had won 13.02% of the valid votes.\n\n## Second Round\n\nThe second round of the legislative election was held on 19 June 2022. The results of the second round showed that La République En Marche! had won 245 seats in the National Assembly, followed by the National Rally, which had won 89 seats. La France Insoumise had won 72 seats, while the Socialist Party had won 27 seats.\n\n## National Results\n\nThe national results of the 2022 legislative election were as follows:\n\n* La République En Marche!: 245 seats\n* National Rally: 89 seats\n* La France Insoumise: 72 seats\n* Socialist Party: 27 seats\n* The Republicans: 61 seats\n* Democratic Movement: 48 seats\n* The Greens: 23 seats\n* Communist Party: 12 seats\n* Miscellaneous left: 22 seats\n* Miscellaneous right: 10 seats\n* Regionalists: 10 seats\n\n## Results by Constituency\n\nThe results of the 2022 legislative election by constituency were as follows:\n\n* La République En Marche!: 245 seats\n\t+ Won 128 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 117 seats in the second round\n* National Rally: 89 seats\n\t+ Won 5 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 84 seats in the second round\n* La France Insoumise: 72 seats\n\t+ Won 4 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 68 seats in the second round\n* Socialist Party: 27 seats\n\t+ Won 2 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 25 seats in the second round\n* The Republicans: 61 seats\n\t+ Won 1 seat in the first round\n\t+ Won 60 seats in the second round\n* Democratic Movement: 48 seats\n\t+ Won 6 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 42 seats in the second round\n* The Greens: 23 seats\n\t+ Won 1 seat in the first round\n\t+ Won 22 seats in the second round\n* Communist Party: 12 seats\n\t+ Won 1 seat in the first round\n\t+ Won 11 seats in the second round\n* Miscellaneous left: 22 seats\n\t+ Won 2 seats in the first round\n\t+ Won 20 seats in the second round\n* Miscellaneous right: 10 seats\n\t+ Won 1 seat in the first round\n\t+ Won 9 seats in the second round\n* Regionalists: 10 seats\n\t+ Won 1 seat in the first round\n\t+ Won 9 seats in the second round\n\n## Electorate\n\nThe electorate for the 2022 legislative election was as follows:\n\n* Eligible voters: 48,781,687\n* Turnout: 47.5%\n* Valid votes: 37,986,916\n* Invalid votes: 2,242,284\n* Blank votes: 2,249,017\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Formation of Parliamentary Groups\n\nThe formation of parliamentary groups in the National Assembly was as follows:\n\n* La République En Marche!: 245 deputies\n* National Rally: 89 deputies\n* La France Insoumise: 72 deputies\n* Socialist Party: 27 deputies\n* The Republicans: 61 deputies\n* Democratic Movement: 48 deputies\n* The Greens: 23 deputies\n* Communist Party: 12 deputies\n* Miscellaneous left: 22 deputies\n* Miscellaneous right: 10 deputies\n* Regionalists: 10 deputies\n\n## Vote of No Confidence\n\nA vote of no confidence in the government was held on 5 July 2022, with the opposition parties seeking to bring down the government.

They also explored themes of trauma, mortality, and the cyclical nature of violence.\n\n##Casting\n\nThe cast of Halloween Ends includes several returning actors from the previous two films, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Andi Matichak, and Will Patton. Rohan Campbell was cast as Corey Cunningham, the film's new villain.

The attack was carried out by a group of Albanian separatists against a Yugoslav army outpost, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. The incident marked a turning point in the Kosovo conflict, leading to increased tensions between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav government, as well as international efforts to resolve the crisis.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Kosovo conflict had its roots in the early 1990s, as tensions rose between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav government. Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia, had a predominantly Albanian population, which sought greater autonomy or independence from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government, under the leadership of Slobodan Milošević, responded to these demands with force, leading to a series of violent clashes and human rights abuses.\n\nIn 1999, the situation escalated into a full-scale war between the Yugoslav army and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an Albanian separatist group. The conflict ended with the intervention of NATO forces, which bombed Yugoslav military targets and forced the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from Kosovo.\n\nHowever, the region remained volatile, with tensions between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav government persisting. The Banjska attack was a manifestation of this ongoing conflict.\n\n#Attack\n\n##Weaponry\n\nThe attackers, armed with small arms, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades, launched a surprise assault on the Yugoslav army outpost in Banjska. The outpost was lightly defended, with only a few dozen soldiers stationed there.\n\n##Attackers\n\nThe attackers were identified as members of the Albanian National Army (ANA), a separatist group that had emerged in the aftermath of the Kosovo war. The ANA was comprised of former KLA fighters and other Albanian nationalists who sought to continue the armed struggle for independence.\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe attack resulted in significant casualties on both sides. According to reports, 14 Yugoslav soldiers were killed, while several others were wounded. The ANA also suffered losses, with estimates suggesting that between 5-10 attackers were killed.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Resolutions\n\n###Kosovo and Albania\n\nThe Banjska attack led to widespread condemnation from Kosovo Albanian leaders, who distanced themselves from the ANA and its actions. The Kosovo government, led by President Ibrahim Rugova, issued a statement denouncing the attack and calling for calm.\n\nIn Albania, the government also condemned the attack, with Prime Minister Ilir Meta stating that Albania would not support any actions that could destabilize the region.\n\n###European Union\n\nThe European Union (EU) responded to the attack by calling for restraint and calm. The EU's High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, issued a statement urging all parties to refrain from violence and to engage in dialogue.\n\n##Serbian state involvement\n\nThe Yugoslav government, led by President Vojislav Koštunica, responded to the attack by accusing Kosovo Albanian leaders of complicity in the ANA's actions. The government also announced plans to increase its military presence in the region, citing concerns about the security situation.\n\n##Serbian military buildup and base construction\n\nIn the aftermath of the Banjska attack, the Yugoslav army began to build up its military presence in the region. The army constructed new bases and checkpoints, and increased the number of troops stationed in Kosovo.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Kosovo\n\nThe Banjska attack was widely condemned by Kosovo Albanian leaders, who saw it as a setback for their efforts to achieve independence through peaceful means. The attack also led to increased tensions between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav government, with many Albanians fearing that the attack would be used as a pretext for further repression.\n\n##Serbia\n\nIn Serbia, the attack was seen as a provocation by Albanian separatists, and was widely condemned by the government and media. The attack also led to increased nationalist sentiment, with many Serbs calling for tougher action against Kosovo Albanians.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community responded to the Banjska attack with concern, calling for calm and restraint. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement condemning the attack and urging all parties to engage in dialogue.\n\nThe Banjska attack marked a turning point in the Kosovo conflict, highlighting the ongoing tensions between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav government. The attack also underscored the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and led to increased international efforts to find a solution.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Banjska_attack\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Attack\n##Weaponry\n##Attackers\n##Casualties\n#Aftermath\n##Resolutions\n###Kosovo and Albania\n###European Union\n##Serbian state involvement\n##Serbian military buildup and base construction\n#Reactions\n##Kosovo\n##Serbia\n##International\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His work often explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, blending elements of magical realism, fantasy, and historical fiction. Born in Bombay, India, Rushdie moved to England at a young age and later became a prominent figure in the literary world. His novels have been translated into numerous languages, and he has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to literature.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nSalman Rushdie was born on June 19, 1947, in Bombay, India, to Anis Ahmed Rushdie and Negin Bhatt. His father was a Cambridge-educated lawyer, and his mother was a teacher. Rushdie's family moved to England when he was 14 years old, and he attended Rugby School in Warwickshire. He later studied history at King's College, Cambridge, where he earned a Master of Arts degree.\n\n#Career\n\n##Copywriter\n\nBefore becoming a full-time novelist, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather in London. During this time, he wrote advertising campaigns for various clients, including the famous \"Naughty but Nice\" slogan for the cream cake brand Mr. Kipling.\n\n##Literary works\n\n###Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987\n\nRushdie's first novel, \"Grimus,\" was published in 1975 to moderate success. However, it was his second novel, \"Midnight's Children,\" published in 1981, that brought him international recognition and critical acclaim. The novel tells the story of India's transition to independence and the subsequent struggles of its people. \"Midnight's Children\" won the Booker Prize in 1981, catapulting Rushdie to literary stardom.\n\n###The Satanic Verses and Haroun and the Sea of Stories, 1988–1990\n\nRushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" was published in 1988 and sparked widespread controversy. The novel explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, and includes a fictionalized account of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The book was banned in several countries, and Rushdie was forced to go into hiding due to death threats and a fatwā issued by Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nDuring this time, Rushdie wrote \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories,\" a children's novel that explores the power of storytelling and imagination. The book was published in 1990 and has since become a classic of children's literature.\n\n###Further works, 1990s–2000s\n\nRushdie's subsequent novels include \"The Moor's Last Sigh\" (1995), \"The Ground Beneath Her Feet\" (1999), and \"Fury\" (2001).

United States House of Representatives elections in New York will be held on November 8, 2022, to elect the 26 U.S. Representatives from the state of New York, one from each of the state's 26 congressional districts. The elections will coincide with the elections for other federal and state offices.\n\n# 2020-22 redistricting controversy\n\nFollowing the 2020 United States Census, New York lost one congressional seat due to its slow population growth. As a result, the state's congressional districts were redrawn for the 2022 elections. However, the redistricting process was marred by controversy and disputes between Democrats and Republicans over the map's fairness and competitiveness. The map was eventually approved by the New York State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Kathy Hochul.\n\n# Overview\n\n## Votes by ballot line\n\nIn New York, candidates can appear on the ballot under multiple party lines. The following table shows the number of votes received by candidates on each ballot line in the 2022 congressional elections.\n\n| Ballot Line | Votes |\n| --- | --- |\n| Democratic |  |\n| Republican |  |\n| Conservative |  |\n| Working Families |  |\n| Independence |  |\n| Libertarian |  |\n| Green |  |\n| Other |  |\n\n## Votes by district\n\nThe following table shows the number of votes

She was a member of the prominent Spencer-Churchill family and played a significant role in her husband's life and career.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Paris, Tuscany and London (1937–1939)\n\nClarissa Spencer-Churchill was born on June 28, 1920, in London, England, to John Spencer-Churchill, the 10th Duke of Marlborough, and his wife, Alexandra Mary Cadogan. She was the younger sister of John Spencer-Churchill, the 11th Duke of Marlborough. The family spent their early years in Paris, where Clarissa's father was the British ambassador. The family later moved to Tuscany, Italy, and finally settled in London.\n\n## Second World War: Oxford and the Foreign Office\n\nDuring World War II, Clarissa studied at Oxford University, where she met her future husband, Anthony Eden, who was then the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Clarissa worked at the Foreign Office, where she was tasked with decoding messages and handling confidential documents. Her experience at the Foreign Office gave her a unique understanding of the inner workings of the British government.\n\n## Post-war\n\nAfter the war, Clarissa continued to work in the Foreign Office, where she became acquainted with many prominent politicians and diplomats. Her experience and knowledge of international affairs made her an invaluable asset to her husband's career.\n\n# 2007 memoir\n\nIn 2007, Clarissa published her memoir, \"A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden\", which provided a unique insight into her life and experiences. The memoir covered her childhood, her marriage to Anthony Eden, and her experiences as the wife of the Prime Minister.\n\n# Friends and acquaintances\n\n## Early admirers\n\nClarissa was known for her beauty and charm, which attracted many admirers, including the novelist Evelyn Waugh and the poet and politician, Harold Nicolson. Waugh was particularly taken with Clarissa and often sought her opinion on his work.\n\n## Other friends\n\nClarissa's friends included many prominent figures of the time, including the writer, Nancy Mitford, and the politician, Duff Cooper. Her friendships with these individuals gave her a unique perspective on the social and cultural landscape of post-war Britain.\n\n# Relationship with Anthony Eden\n\n## Winston Churchill and the wartime link\n\nClarissa met Anthony Eden through her uncle, Winston Churchill, who was then the Prime Minister. Eden was a close friend and ally of Churchill's, and the two men worked closely together during the war. Clarissa's connection to Churchill helped to establish her relationship with Eden.\n\n## Marriage to Eden\n\nClarissa and Anthony Eden married in 1952, when Eden was still the Foreign Secretary. The marriage was seen as a union between two prominent families, and it was widely reported in the press.\n\n### Attitudes to the marriage\n\nThe marriage was not without controversy, however. Some commentators felt that Clarissa was too young and inexperienced to be the wife of the Foreign Secretary. Others felt that Eden was too old and set in his ways to be married to someone as vibrant and energetic as Clarissa.\n\n### Married life\n\nDespite these criticisms, the marriage was a happy one. Clarissa brought a sense of youth and energy to Eden's life, and he, in turn, provided her with a sense of stability and security.

Clarissa's experience and knowledge of international affairs made her an invaluable asset to her husband during this time. She was often called upon to advise him on matters of state and to provide a unique perspective on the crisis.\n\n### \"The Suez Canal flowing through my drawing room\"\n\nClarissa's involvement in the Suez Crisis was not without controversy, however.

She was fiercely loyal to him, and she worked tirelessly to promote his interests and advance his career. Her influence helped to shield him from criticism and opposition, and she was often called upon to defend him in public.\n\n## Aftermath of Suez\n\nThe aftermath of the Suez Crisis was a difficult time for the Eden government. The crisis had damaged the government's reputation and had created a sense of uncertainty and instability. Clarissa's influence helped to steady the ship, and she played a key role in promoting her husband's interests and advancing his career.\n\n### Goldeneye\n\nIn the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, Eden's health began to decline. He suffered a series of illnesses, including a bout of jaundice, and he was eventually forced to resign as Prime Minister. Clarissa was by his side throughout this time, and she played a key role in promoting his interests and advancing his career. The couple spent much of their time at Goldeneye, their home in Jamaica, where Eden was able to rest and recover.\n\n### Eden's resignation\n\nEden's resignation as Prime Minister in 1957 marked the end of an era. Clarissa's influence had been a key factor in his success, and her loyalty and devotion had been unwavering. Despite the challenges and controversies of their time in office, the couple's marriage remained strong, and they continued to support each other in the years that followed.\n\n# Eden's retirement and death\n\nAfter his resignation, Eden retired from politics and devoted himself to his writing and his family. Clarissa was by his side throughout this time, and she continued to promote his interests and advance his career. Eden died in 1977, at the age of 79, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most important and influential politicians of the 20th century.\n\n# Widowhood\n\n## Longevity\n\nClarissa outlived her husband by over 30 years, passing away on November 15, 2021, at the age of 101. Her longevity was a testament to her strength and resilience, and she remained a prominent figure in British society until the end of her life.\n\n# In popular culture\n\nClarissa's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, films, and television programs.

The 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War resulted in Azerbaijan regaining control over parts of the region, but tensions remained high.\n\n#Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the offensive, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of failing to implement the provisions of the 2020 ceasefire agreement, while Armenia alleged that Azerbaijan was preparing for a new military operation.\n\n#Offensive\n\n##19 September\n\nOn September 19, 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani forces advanced on multiple fronts, using artillery, drones, and infantry. The Armenian military responded with counterattacks, but Azerbaijani forces made significant gains.\n\n##20 September\n\nBy September 20, Azerbaijani forces had captured several key towns and villages, including the strategic town of Martakert. The Armenian military continued to resist, but Azerbaijani forces maintained their momentum.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nAs Azerbaijani forces advanced, thousands of ethnic Armenians fled their homes, seeking refuge in Armenia or other parts of Nagorno-Karabakh. The displacement of civilians raised concerns about humanitarian access and the potential for human rights abuses.\n\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n\nFollowing the capture of key towns, Azerbaijani forces arrested several high-ranki", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Azerbaijani_offensive_in_Nagorno-Karabakh\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Offensive\n##19 September\n##20 September\n#Aftermath\n##Flight of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh\n##Arrests of Artsakhi officials\n##Negotiations and dissolution of Artsakh\n##Ceasefire violations\n##Humanitarian aid\n##Diplomatic efforts\n###Normalisation efforts\n#Risk of genocide\n##Reports of violence against Armenians\n##Azerbaijani concentration camp plans\n#International aspects\n##Reactions\n###Armenia\n####Armenian diaspora\n###Russia\n###Turkey\n###European Union\n###United Nations\n###Council of Europe\n###Other countries\n###Other international organizations\n##Foreign involvement\n###Israel\n###Turkey\n###Armenia\n#Analysis\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The alliance brings together several parties from the French left, including the Socialist Party, the French Communist Party, and the Greens. The NUPES was created to contest the 2022 French legislative election and to present a unified left-wing alternative to the presidential majority.\n\n#History\n\n##Formation\n\nThe New Ecological and Social People's Union was formed in May 2022, following the 2022 French presidential election. The alliance was created by the Socialist Party, the French Communist Party, the Greens, and several other left-wing parties, with the aim of contesting the upcoming legislative election. The NUPES was officially launched on May 4, 2022, at a press conference in Paris.\n\n##Expansion\n\nIn the following weeks, several other parties joined the NUPES, including the Radical Party of the Left, the Socialist Party's allies in the New Deal, and the Republican and Socialist Left. The alliance also received support from several independent left-wing politicians and civil society organizations.\n\n##2022 French legislative election\n\nThe NUPES contested the 2022 French legislative election, which took place on June 12 and 19, 2022. The alliance presented candidates in nearly all constituencies, with the aim of winning a majority of seats in the National Assembly. The NUPES campaign focused on issues such as social justice, environmental protection, and democratic reform.\n\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n\nThe NUPES won 131 seats in the National Assembly, making it the second-largest group in the legislature. The alliance performed well in urban areas and among young voters, but struggled in rural areas and among working-class voters. The NUPES's electoral results were seen as a success, given the alliance's recent formation and the challenges faced by the French left in recent years.\n\n##Election of René Pilato\n\nFollowing the legislative election, René Pilato was elected as the NUPES's group leader in the National Assembly. Pilato, a Socialist Party deputy, was chosen to lead the alliance's parliamentary group due to his experience and his ability to unite the different parties within the NUPES.\n\n##Quatennens Affair\n\nIn July 2022, the NUPES was hit by a scandal involving Adrien Quatennens, a La France Insoumise deputy and the NUPES's coordinator. Quatennens was accused of domestic violence by his wife, and was subsequently suspended from the NUPES's leadership. The Quatennens Affair led to tensions within the NUPES, with some parties calling for Quatennens's expulsion from the alliance.\n\n##Bayou Affair\n\nIn August 2022, the NUPES was hit by another scandal involving Sandrine Rousseau, a Green deputy and the NUPES's spokesperson. Rousseau was accused of bullying and harassment by several former staff members, and was subsequently suspended from the NUPES's leadership. The Bayou Affair led to further tensions within the NUPES, with some parties calling for Rousseau's expulsion from the alliance.\n\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n\nThe NUPES has experienced tensions with the French Communist Party (PCF), one of the alliance's founding members. The PCF has criticized the NUPES's leadership and its electoral strategy, and has called for a more radical left-wing approach. The tensions between the NUPES and the PCF have led to speculation about the future of the alliance.\n\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n\nIn September 2022, the Socialist Party, one of the NUPES's founding members, was hit by an internal crisis. The party's leadership was criticized for its handling of the NUPES and its electoral strategy, leading to the election of Martine Froger as the party's new leader. Froger, a former minister, was chosen to lead the Socialist Party due to her experience and her ability to unite the party's different factions.\n\n##Socialist Party suspension\n\nIn October 2022, the Socialist Party was suspended from the NUPES due to its internal crisis and its criticism of the alliance's leadership. The suspension of the Socialist Party led to further tensions within the NUPES, with some parties calling for the party's expulsion from the alliance.\n\n#Members\n\nThe NUPES has several member parties, including:\n\n* Socialist Party\n* French Communist Party\n* Greens\n* Radical Party of the Left\n* New Deal\n* Republican and Socialist Left\n\n##Former members\n\n* La France Insoumise (left the NUPES in 2022 due to the Quatennens Affair)\n* Socialist Party (suspended from the NUPES in 2022 due to its internal crisis)\n\n#Candidates 2022\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in nearly all constituencies during the 2022 French legislative election. The alliance's candidates were chosen due to their experience, their commitment to the NUPES's values, and their ability to win seats in the National Assembly.\n\n##Breakdown by constituency\n\nThe NUPES presented candidates in 556 constituencies during the 2022 French legislative election. The alliance performed well in urban areas and among young voters, but struggled in rural areas and among working-class voters.\n\n##Dissident candidates\n\nSeveral dissident candidates ran against the NUPES's official candidates during the 2022 French legislative election. The dissident candidates were often supported by local parties or civil society organizations, and were critical of the NUPES's leadership and its electoral strategy.\n\n#Ideology and platform\n\nThe NUPES is a left-wing alliance that advocates for social justice, environmental protection, and democratic reform. The alliance's platform includes policies such as:\n\n* Increasing the minimum wage and improving working conditions\n* Reducing inequality and promoting social mobility\n* Protecting the environment and promoting sustainable development\n* Reforming the electoral system and increasing citizen participation\n* Promoting human rights and social justice\n\n#Electoral history\n\nThe NUPES was created in 2022 to contest the French legislative election. The alliance has not contested any other elections, but is expected to participate in future elections.\n\n##Legislative elections\n\n* 2022 French legislative election: 131 seats (second-largest group in the National Assembly)\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe NUPES has received different reactions from various political parties and civil society organizations.\n\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n\nThe NUPES has been supported by the Socialist Party and other social-democratic parties, which see the alliance as a way to promote social justice and democratic reform.\n\n##PS minority and opposition\n\nThe NUPES has been criticized by some Socialist Party members and other opposition parties, which see the alliance as too radical or too focused on environmental issues.\n\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n\nThe NUPES has been supported by some extra-parliamentary left-wing organizations, which see the alliance as a way to promote social justice and challenge the neoliberal consensus.\n\n##Presidential majority\n\nThe NUPES has been opposed by the presidential majority, which sees the alliance as a threat to its power and its policies.\n\n#See also\n\n* French left\n* Socialist Party\n* French Communist Party\n* Greens\n* La France Insoumise\n* New Deal\n* Republican and Socialist Left\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"New_Ecological_and_Social_People's_Union\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Formation\n##Expansion\n##2022 French legislative election\n##Electoral results and aftermath\n##Election of René Pilato\n##Quatennens Affair\n##Bayou Affair\n##Tensions with the Communist Party\n##Socialist infighting and election of Martine Froger\n##Socialist Party suspension\n#Members\n##Former members\n#Candidates 2022\n##Breakdown by constituency\n##Dissident candidates\n#Ideology and platform\n#Electoral history\n##Legislative elections\n#Reactions\n##PS majority and social-democratic left\n##PS minority and opposition\n##Extra-parliamentary left\n##Presidential majority\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The area has been a popular destination for both locals and tourists, with its narrow streets lined with bars, clubs, and restaurants. Over the years, Itaewon has become known for its vibrant and eclectic atmosphere, with a mix of Korean and international culture.\n\n## Layout of the area\n\nThe area where the disaster occurred is a narrow alleyway that connects the main street of Itaewon to a smaller side street. The alleyway is approximately 3.2 meters wide and 62 meters long, with a steep slope that leads downhill. The area is surrounded by tall buildings and narrow streets, which can make it difficult for emergency responders to access the area.\n\n# Conditions before the disaster\n\n## Lack of government preparation\n\nIn the days leading up to the disaster, there were concerns raised about the safety of the area. The local government had not implemented any special crowd control measures, despite the large number of people expected to attend the Halloween celebrations. The police had also not increased their presence in the area, which has been criticized as a contributing factor to the disaster.\n\n# Disaster\n\nOn the evening of October 29, 2022, a large crowd of people had gathered in the alleyway to celebrate Halloween.

Musk, a self-proclaimed advocate for free speech, has made several changes to Twitter's policies and moderation practices, which have been met with both praise and criticism.\n\nPrior to the December suspensions, Twitter had updated its rules to prohibit the sharing of \"live location information\" and \"links to third-party URL trackers\" of individuals, including public figures. The policy changes were aimed at protecting users' safety and preventing harassment.\n\n# Account Suspensions\n\nThe account suspensions in December 2022 were primarily related to two incidents: the suspension of flight-tracking accounts and the suspension of journalist accounts.\n\n## Twitter Policy Changes\n\nOn December 12, 2022, Twitter suspended several flight-tracking accounts, including @ElonJet, which tracked the flight movements of Elon Musk's private jet. The account, run by a student named Jack Sweeney, had gained significant attention and followers due to its accurate and timely updates on Musk's jet movements.\n\nTwitter claimed that the account was suspended due to a violation of its policies on sharing \"live location information\" of individuals. However, many users and commentators argued that the suspension was an attempt to silence criticism and monitoring of Musk's activities.\n\n## Suspension of Flight-Tracking Accounts\n\nIn addition to @ElonJet, several other flight-tracking accounts were suspended, including @CelebJets and @JxckSweeney. The suspensions sparked concerns among aviation enthusiasts and transparency advocates, who argued that the accounts provided valuable information about the movements of public figures.\n\n## Suspension of Journalist Accounts\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Twitter suspended several journalist accounts, including those of CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, The New York Times' Ryan Mac, and The Washington Post's Drew Harwell. The journalists were known for their critical reporting on Twitter and Musk's acquisition of the platform.\n\nTwitter claimed that the suspensions were due to a violation of its policies on \"doxxing,\" or sharing personal information about individuals. However, many users and commentators argued that the suspensions were an attempt to silence critical voices and stifle journalism.\n\n## Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n\nTwitter and Musk provided limited explanations for the suspensions, citing the company's policies on sharing \"live location information\" and \"doxxing.\" Musk claimed that the suspensions were necessary to protect users' safety and prevent harassment.\n\nHowever, many users and commentators argued that the suspensions were arbitrary and inconsistent, citing examples of other accounts that had shared similar information without facing consequences.\n\n# Reinstatement of Some Accounts\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Twitter reinstated several of the suspended journalist accounts, including those of O'Sullivan, Mac, and Harwell. The reinstatements came after widespread criticism and pressure from media outlets and advocacy groups.\n\nHowever, the flight-tracking accounts, including @ElonJet, remained suspended. Sweeney, the creator of @ElonJet, announced that he would be moving to a rival social media platform, Mastodon.\n\n# Responses\n\nThe December 2022 Twitter suspensions sparked widespread criticism and concern among users, commentators, and advocacy groups.\n\n## Suspended Journalists\n\nThe suspended journalists expressed disappointment and frustration with the suspensions, arguing that they were an attempt to silence critical voices and stifle journalism.\n\n## Other Commentators\n\nMany commentators and advocacy groups criticized the suspensions, citing concerns about freedom of speech, transparency, and accountability. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group, argued that the suspensions were \"a clear attempt to silence critics and stifle journalism.\"\n\nThe incident highlighted the ongoing challenges facing Twitter and other social media platforms in balancing free speech with safety and moderation concerns. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how Twitter and other platforms will navigate these complex issues.\n\n# See also\n\n* Twitter\n* Elon Musk\n* Freedom of speech\n* Social media\n* Online harassment\n* Journalism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"December_2022_Twitter_suspensions\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Account suspensions\n##Twitter policy changes\n##Suspension of flight-tracking accounts\n##Suspension of journalist accounts\n##Explanation from Twitter and Musk\n#Reinstatement of some accounts\n#Responses\n##Suspended journalists\n##Other commentators\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The integration process has its roots in the aftermath of World War II, with the aim of preventing future conflicts and promoting economic growth. Over the years, European integration has evolved through various agreements, institutions, and policies, shaping the modern European landscape.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe history of European integration is marked by several key milestones. The first major step was the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952, which brought together six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to manage their coal and steel resources jointly. This was followed by the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958, which aimed to create a common market among its member states.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Single European Act was signed, which paved the way for the creation of a single market and laid the groundwork for future integration. The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 created the European Union (EU) and introduced a single currency, the euro. Since then, the EU has continued to expand, with new member states joining and deepening integration through various policies and agreements.\n\nTheories of Integration\n----------------------\n\n### Proto-integration Period\n\nTheories of European integration have evolved over time, reflecting changing circumstances and priorities. In the early years, the focus was on economic integration, with the aim of creating a common market and promoting economic growth.\n\n### First Phase: Explaining Integration (1960s onwards)\n\nThe first phase of integration theory focused on explaining the integration process and its driving forces. The neofunctionalist approach, developed by Ernst Haas, emphasized the role of functional spillover, where cooperation in one area leads to cooperation in others. The intergovernmentalist approach, developed by Andrew Moravcsik, emphasized the role of state interests and intergovernmental bargaining.\n\n### Second Phase: Analyzing Governance (1980s onwards)\n\nThe second phase of integration theory focused on analyzing the governance of the EU and its institutions. The institutionalist approach, developed by Paul Pierson, emphasized the role of EU institutions in shaping policy outcomes. The constructivist approach, developed by Thomas Christiansen, emphasized the role of social norms and identity in shaping EU governance.\n\n### Third Phase: Constructing the EU (1990s onwards)\n\nThe third phase of integration theory focused on constructing the EU and its policies. The policy network approach, developed by David Marsh, emphasized the role of policy networks and advocacy coalitions in shaping EU policies. The governance approach, developed by Beate Kohler-Koch, emphasized the role of multilevel governance and the interaction between EU institutions and member states.\n\nCitizens' Organisations Calling for Further Integration\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSeveral citizens' organisations have called for further European integration, citing the benefits of a more cohesive and cooperative continent. These organisations include the European Movement International, the Union of European Federalists, and the European Youth Forum.\n\nOverlap of Membership in Various Agreements\n------------------------------------------\n\n### Common Membership of Member States of the European Union\n\nMany European countries are members of multiple agreements and organisations, reflecting their commitment to European integration. All EU member states are members of the European Economic Area (EEA), the Schengen Area, and the eurozone.\n\n### Most Integrated Countries\n\nThe most integrated countries in Europe are those that are members of the EU, the EEA, and the eurozone. These countries include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.\n\nGeographic Scope\n----------------\n\n### Beyond Geographic Europe\n\nEuropean integration has a geographic scope that extends beyond the continent of Europe. The EU has agreements with countries in North Africa, the Middle East, and other regions, reflecting its global role and influence.\n\n### Limited to Regions within Geographic Europe\n\nEuropean integration is also limited to regions within geographic Europe, reflecting the diversity and complexity of the continent. These regions include the Nordic countries, the Baltic Sea region, the Low Countries, the Black Sea region, and others.\n\n#### Nordic Countries\n\nThe Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) have a high level of integration, reflecting their shared cultural and economic ties.\n\n#### Baltic Sea Region\n\nThe Baltic Sea region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden) has a high level of integration, reflecting its strategic location and economic importance.\n\n#### Nordic-Baltic Eight\n\nThe Nordic-Baltic Eight (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden) have a high level of integration, reflecting their shared cultural and economic ties.\n\n#### Low Countries Region (Benelux)\n\nThe Low Countries region (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) has a high level of integration, reflecting its shared cultural and economic ties.\n\n#### Black Sea Region\n\nThe Black Sea region (Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine) has a lower level of integration, reflecting its diversity and complexity.\n\n#### United Kingdom and Ireland\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have a lower level of integration, reflecting their unique cultural and economic ties.\n\n#### Central Europe\n\nCentral Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) has a high level of integration, reflecting its strategic location and economic importance.\n\n#### Eastern Europe\n\nEastern Europe (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) has a lower level of integration, reflecting its diversity and complexity.\n\n#### Danube Region\n\nThe Danube region (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia) has a high level of integration, reflecting its strategic location and economic importance.\n\n#### Balkans\n\nThe Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia) have a lower level of integration, reflecting their diversity and complexity.\n\nCouncil of Europe\n-----------------\n\nThe Council of Europe is a pan-European organisation that promotes democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.

The ship was commissioned in 1983 as Slava, and after a major modernization, it was renamed Moskva in 2000. The cruiser played a significant role in various naval operations, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This article provides an overview of the ship's history, its operations, and its eventual sinking during the conflict.\n\n#History\n\n##As Slava\n\nThe Slava-class cruiser was designed to provide air defense and anti-surface warfare capabilities to the Soviet Navy. The lead ship of the class, Slava, was laid down on November 6, 1976, at the 61 Kommunara Shipyard in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. The ship was launched on July 27, 1979, and commissioned on January 30, 1983. After its commissioning, Slava served as the flagship of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet.\n\nDuring its early service, Slava participated in various naval exercises and visited several foreign ports, including those in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The ship's armament included 16 P-500 Bazalt anti-ship missiles, 64 S-300F Fort air defense missiles, and various guns and torpedo tubes.\n\n##As Moskva\n\nIn 1990, Slava underwent a major modernization at the Sevastopol Shipyard, which included the installation of new radar and electronic warfare systems. The ship was also equipped with the P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missile system, which replaced the older P-500 Bazalt system.\n\nAfter the modernization, Slava was renamed Moskva on May 16, 2000, in honor of the Russian capital city. The ship continued to serve as the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and participated in various naval exercises and operations.\n\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nMoskva played a significant role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The ship was involved in several key operations, including the blockade of Ukrainian ports and the bombardment of Ukrainian coastal cities.\n\n###Snake Island campaign\n\nOne of the most notable operations involving Moskva was the capture of Snake Island, a small Ukrainian island in the Black Sea. On February 24, 2022, a group of Russian warships, including Moskva, approached the island and demanded the surrender of the Ukrainian defenders. The Ukrainians refused, and the Russians launched a bombardment of the island, which resulted in the capture of the island by Russian forces.\n\n###Sinking\n\nOn April 13, 2022, Moskva was reportedly struck by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles while it was operating in the Black Sea. The ship suffered significant damage and began to list to one side. Despite efforts to save the ship, Moskva eventually sank in the early hours of April 14, 2022.\n\nThe sinking of Moskva was a significant blow to the Russian Navy and marked one of the most notable losses of a warship in recent history. The incident also raised questions about the effectiveness of Russian air defenses and the vulnerability of its warships to anti-ship missiles.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe sinking of Moskva was widely reported in the media, and the incident sparked a significant reaction from both Russia and Ukraine. The incident also highlighted the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the significant losses suffered by both sides.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russian_cruiser_Moskva\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##As Slava\n##As Moskva\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Snake Island campaign\n###Sinking\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The war is fought between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that was previously part of the SAF. The conflict has also involved other armed groups, including the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM).\n\n# Background\n\n## War in Darfur and the formation of the RSF\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has its roots in the War in Darfur, which began in 2003. The war was fought between the government of Sudan and several rebel groups, including the SLM and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). The government responded to the rebellion with a campaign of violence and intimidation, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions.\n\nIn 2013, the RSF was formed as a paramilitary group within the SAF. The RSF was composed of former janjaweed militiamen, who had been accused of committing atrocities during the War in Darfur. The RSF was led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who became a key ally of the Sudanese government.\n\n## Political transition\n\nIn 2019, a popular uprising led to the overthrow of the Sudanese government, which had been in power for over 30 years. A transitional government was established, which was composed of both military and civilian leaders. However, the transition was marked by tensions between the military and civilian leaders, who had different visions for the future of Sudan.\n\n## Origins of the SPLM-N and the SLM\n\nThe SPLM-N and the SLM are two rebel groups that have been involved in the conflict in Sudan. The SPLM-N is a splinter group of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), which was founded in the 1980s. The SPLM-N is led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, who has been a key figure in the conflict in Sudan.\n\nThe SLM is a rebel group that was founded in the 1990s. The SLM is led by Abdelwahid al-Nur, who has been a key figure in the conflict in Darfur.\n\n## Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the outbreak of the conflict, tensions between the SAF and the RSF had been escalating. The RSF had been seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of power in the transitional government. However, the SAF had been resisting these demands, leading to a breakdown in relations between the two groups.\n\n# Course of the war\n\n## April–May 2023\n\n### Battle of Khartoum\n\nThe conflict began on April 15, 2023, when the RSF launched an attack on the SAF in Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. The attack was sparked by a dispute over the control of the city's airport. The SAF responded with force, leading to a fierce battle that lasted for several days.\n\n### Treaty of Jeddah\n\nOn May 10, 2023, the SAF and the RSF signed the Treaty of Jeddah, which was brokered by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The treaty called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of both sides from Khartoum. However, the treaty was short-lived, as fighting broke out again just days later.\n\n## June–September 2023\n\n### Continued fighting in Khartoum\n\nDespite the Treaty of Jeddah, fighting continued in Khartoum throughout the summer of 2023. The RSF launched several attacks on the SAF, which responded with force. The fighting was marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### Diplomatic efforts\n\nThroughout the summer of 2023, diplomatic efforts were underway to try to bring an end to the conflict. The African Union and the United Nations both launched initiatives to try to broker a peace agreement. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n### SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) involvement\n\nIn July 2023, the SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) announced that it would be joining the conflict on the side of the RSF. The SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) had been involved in the conflict in Sudan for several years, and its decision to join the RSF marked a significant escalation of the conflict.\n\n### Darfur front\n\nIn August 2023, the conflict spread to Darfur, where the SLM and other rebel groups launched attacks on the SAF. The fighting was marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n## October–December 2023\n\n### SAF collapse in Darfur\n\nIn October 2023, the SAF suffered a significant defeat in Darfur, where it lost control of several key cities. The defeat marked a turning point in the conflict, as the RSF and its allies began to gain the upper hand.\n\n### Peace negotiations stall\n\nIn November 2023, peace negotiations between the SAF and the RSF stalled, as both sides refused to compromise on key issues. The failure of the negotiations marked a significant setback for efforts to bring an end to the conflict.\n\n### RSF Crossing of the Nile\n\nIn December 2023, the RSF launched a major attack on the SAF, crossing the Nile River and capturing several key cities. The attack marked a significant escalation of the conflict, as the RSF and its allies began to gain control of large swaths of territory.\n\n## January–April 2024\n\n### Hemedti travels abroad\n\nIn January 2024, Hemedti traveled abroad, visiting several countries in the region. The trip was seen as an attempt by Hemedti to build support for the RSF and its allies.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan and Gezira\n\nIn February 2024, fighting broke out in Kordofan and Gezira, two states in central Sudan. The fighting was marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### SAF gains in Omdurman\n\nIn March 2024, the SAF launched a major attack on the RSF in Omdurman, a city in central Sudan. The attack marked a significant gain for the SAF, as it began to retake control of territory that had been lost to the RSF.\n\n## April 2024–present\n\n### Fighting in Darfur\n\nFighting continues in Darfur, where the SLM and other rebel groups are battling the SAF. The fighting is marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### Fighting in Kordofan\n\nFighting also continues in Kordofan, where the RSF and its allies are battling the SAF. The fighting is marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### Fighting along the Nile\n\nFighting has also broken out along the Nile River, where the RSF and its allies are battling the SAF. The fighting is marked by reports of civilian casualties and displacement.\n\n### SAF offensives\n\nThe SAF has launched several offensives against the RSF and its allies, but these have been largely unsuccessful. The conflict continues to escalate, with both sides suffering significant losses.\n\n# Casualties\n\n## Darfur\n\nThe conflict in Darfur has resulted in significant civilian casualties and displacement.

Suchianu\n================\n\nD.I. Suchianu was a Romanian literary critic, essayist, and cultural commentator who played a significant role in shaping the country's interwar cultural landscape. His life and work spanned several decades, during which he witnessed and responded to some of the most pivotal events in Romanian history.\n\nBiography\n----------\n\n### Early life and debut\n\nD.I. Suchianu was born in 1895 in a small town in the province of Moldavia, Romania. His early life was marked by a passion for literature and learning, which led him to pursue higher education in the field of philology. Suchianu's academic background and intellectual curiosity laid the foundation for his future career as a literary critic and cultural commentator.\n\nSuchianu's debut as a literary critic took place in the early 1920s, when he began contributing articles to various Romanian literary magazines and journals. His early work focused primarily on Romanian literature, with a particular emphasis on the works of major Romanian writers such as Mihai Eminescu and Ion Luca Caragiale. Suchianu's critical approach was characterized by a deep understanding of literary theory and a keen eye for detail, which earned him recognition and respect within literary circles.\n\n### Interwar culture critic\n\nThe interwar period was a time of great cultural and intellectual ferment in Romania, and Suchianu was at the forefront of this movement. He was a prominent figure in the country's literary and cultural scene, known for his incisive criticism and insightful commentary on a wide range of topics. Suchianu's work during this period was marked by a strong commitment to modernism and a desire to promote Romanian culture and literature on the international stage.\n\nSuchianu was also an active participant in the country's vibrant cultural debates, engaging in public discussions and polemics with other prominent intellectuals and writers. His contributions to these debates helped shape the course of Romanian cultural and intellectual life, and his influence can still be felt today.\n\n### Under fascism\n\nThe rise of fascist ideology in Romania in the 1930s had a profound impact on the country's cultural and intellectual life. Suchianu, like many other Romanian intellectuals, was deeply concerned about the threat posed by fascism to the country's democratic institutions and cultural values.\n\nDespite the increasingly repressive atmosphere, Suchianu continued to write and speak out against fascism, using his platform as a critic and commentator to condemn the regime's brutality and intolerance. His courage and conviction during this period earned him the respect and admiration of many, and his work remains an important testament to the power of intellectual resistance in the face of oppression.\n\n### 1944 coup and communization\n\nThe August 1944 coup, which brought an end to Romania's fascist regime and paved the way for the country's transition to communism, marked a significant turning point in Suchianu's life and work. While many Romanian intellectuals were initially optimistic about the prospect of a new era of social and cultural transformation, Suchianu was more cautious, recognizing the potential dangers and uncertainties of the new regime.\n\nAs the communist regime consolidated its power and began to impose its own brand of cultural orthodoxy, Suchianu found himself increasingly at odds with the new authorities. His independent thinking and critical approach, which had been valued in the interwar period, were now seen as liabilities, and he faced growing pressure to conform to the regime's ideological demands.\n\n### Old age and death\n\nDespite the challenges and difficulties he faced, Suchianu continued to write and work until his death in 1985. His later years were marked by a sense of melancholy and loss, as he watched the country he loved and the culture he had helped shape succumb to the forces of communist authoritarianism.\n\nSuchianu's legacy, however, endures, a testament to the power of intellectual courage and the enduring importance of critical thinking and independent judgment.\n\nLegacy\n-------\n\nD.I. Suchianu's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the many different roles he played as a literary critic, cultural commentator, and intellectual. His contributions to Romanian literature and culture are immeasurable, and his influence can still be felt today.\n\nSuchianu's critical approach, which emphasized the importance of intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and independent judgment, remains a model for aspiring critics and scholars. His commitment to modernism and his desire to promote Romanian culture and literature on the international stage helped shape the country's cultural and intellectual identity.\n\nAt the same time, Suchianu's experiences under fascist and communist regimes serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of intellectual freedom and the dangers of ideological orthodoxy. His courage and conviction in the face of oppression are an inspiration to all those who value the pursuit of knowledge and the power of critical thinking.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a general overview of D.I. Suchianu's life and work. For a more detailed analysis of his critical approach and intellectual contributions, readers are encouraged to consult the relevant scholarly literature.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"D._I._Suchianu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and debut\n##Interwar culture critic\n##Under fascism\n##1944 coup and communization\n##Old age and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was the first time the city had hosted the event.\n\n#Host city and events\n\nKansas City was chosen as the host city for the 2023 NFL Draft in May 2021. The event was held at Union Station, with a large outdoor stage and fan festival area.

The first round was held on April 27, with the remaining rounds taking place on April 28-29. The draft was broadcast on ESPN, NFL Network, and ABC.\n\nThe first overall selection was quarterback Bryce Young, chosen by the Carolina Panthers.

These picks were made at the end of the third round.\n\nThe first compensatory pick was made by the Arizona Cardinals, who selected wide receiver Antoine Wesley. The second compensatory pick was made by the Los Angeles Rams, who selected linebacker Clay Johnston.\n\n#Supplemental draft\n\nThe NFL held its 2023 Supplemental Draft on July 11, 2023. The supplemental draft is held for players who were not eligible for the regular NFL Draft, but who have since become eligible.\n\nOne player was selected in the supplemental draft: defensive back Adonis Alexander, who was selected by the Washington Commanders in the sixth round.\n\n#Notes\n\nThe 2023 NFL Draft was notable for several reasons. It was the first draft held in Kansas City, and it featured a number of high-profile trades and selections.\n\nThe draft also saw a number of players selected from smaller colleges and universities, including quarterback Malik Cunningham, who was selected from Louisville.\n\n#Summary\n\n##Selections by NCAA conference\n\nThe 2023 NFL Draft saw players selected from a number of different NCAA conferences.

Chase, a prominent Federalist and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was accused of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" by the House of Representatives in 1804. The impeachment proceedings were sparked by Chase's alleged partisan bias and misconduct on the bench.\n\n# Background\n\nSamuel Chase was appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Washington in 1796. A strong Federalist, Chase was a vocal advocate for a strong central government and a strict interpretation of the Constitution. However, his partisanship and outspoken nature often put him at odds with his colleagues and the Jeffersonian Republicans, who controlled Congress.\n\nChase's behavior on the bench had long been a subject of controversy. He was known for his harsh rhetoric and biases against Republican defendants. In 1800, Chase presided over the treason trial of John Fries, a Republican accused of leading a tax protest in Pennsylvania. Chase's conduct during the trial was widely criticized, with many accusing him of bias and misconduct.\n\n# Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n\n## Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n\nOn March 12, 1804, the House of Representatives voted to launch an impeachment inquiry into Chase's conduct. The resolution, introduced by Representative John Randolph, authorized a committee to investigate Chase's behavior and determine whether he should be impeached.\n\n## Early inquiry developments\n\nThe committee, consisting of five Republicans, began its inquiry in April 1804. They collected testimony from various witnesses, including lawyers, judges, and politicians who had interacted with Chase. The committee also reviewed Chase's opinions and conduct in several high-profile cases, including the Fries trial.\n\n## Adoption of impeachment resolution\n\nOn October 31, 1804, the House of Representatives adopted a resolution impeaching Chase. The resolution charged Chase with \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" and specified eight articles of impeachment.\n\n## Subsequent months of inquiry\n\nOver the next several months, the committee continued to gather evidence and testimony. They also received several petitions from citizens and lawyers supporting Chase's impeachment.\n\n## Adoption of articles of impeachment\n\nOn February 4, 1805, the House of Representatives adopted the eight articles of impeachment against Chase.\n\n### Article I\n\nArticle I charged Chase with \"arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust\" behavior in the Fries trial.\n\n### Article II\n\nArticle II accused Chase of \"unlawful and unconstitutional\" conduct in the Fries trial, specifically his decision to deny Fries' request for a continuance.\n\n### Article III\n\nArticle III charged Chase with \"high-handed and arbitrary\" behavior in a 1799 case involving a Republican defendant.\n\n### Article IV\n\nArticle IV accused Chase of \"improper and unbecoming\" conduct in a 1800 case involving a Federalist defendant.\n\n### Article V\n\nArticle V charged Chase with \"unjust and oppressive\" behavior in a 1802 case involving a Republican defendant.\n\n### Article VI\n\nArticle VI accused Chase of \"high-handed and arbitrary\" behavior in a 1803 case involving a Federalist defendant.\n\n### Article VII\n\nArticle VII charged Chase with \"improper and unbecoming\" conduct in a 1804 case involving a Republican defendant.\n\n### Article VIII\n\nArticle VIII accused Chase of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" in his general conduct as a judge.\n\n### Vote overview\n\nThe vote to adopt the articles of impeachment was largely along party lines, with 73 Republicans voting in favor and 32 Federalists opposing.\n\n# Appointment of House managers\n\nThe House of Representatives appointed a team of managers to prosecute the impeachment case against Chase. The team consisted of six Republicans, including Representative John Randolph.\n\n# Senate trial\n\n## Officers of the trial\n\nThe Senate trial was presided over by Vice President George Clinton, who served as the President pro tempore of the Senate.\n\n## Rules of the trial\n\nThe Senate adopted a set of rules governing the trial, including rules for the presentation of evidence and the conduct of the parties.\n\n## Start of the proceedings\n\nThe trial began on February 4, 1805, with the reading of the articles of impeachment and the swearing-in of the Senate as a court of impeachment.\n\n## Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n\nThe Senate Chamber was specially decorated for the occasion, with a raised platform for the judges and a separate area for the House managers.\n\n## Pleading phase\n\nThe pleading phase began on February 9, 1805, with the House managers presenting their case against Chase. Chase's lawyers responded on February 14, 1805.\n\n## Argument phase\n\n### Prosecution's presentation\n\nThe prosecution's presentation began on February 19, 1805, with Representative John Randolph delivering the opening argument. The House managers presented their case over several days, calling numerous witnesses and presenting evidence.\n\n### Defense's presentation\n\nThe defense's presentation began on March 1, 1805, with Chase's lawyers presenting their case. They argued that Chase's conduct was not impeachable and that the charges were politically motivated.\n\n### Closing remarks\n\nThe closing remarks were delivered on March 11, 1805, with both sides summing up their cases.\n\n## Verdict\n\nThe Senate voted on the articles of impeachment on March 1, 1805. Chase was acquitted on all eight articles, with a two-thirds majority required for conviction.\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Immediate aftermath\n\nChase's acquittal was widely seen as a victory for the Federalist party and a defeat for the Jeffersonian Republicans. Chase remained on the Supreme Court until his death in 1811.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe impeachment of Samuel Chase set an important precedent for the impeachment of judges and politicians in the United States. It also highlighted the importance of judicial independence and the need for judges to remain impartial in their decision-making.\n\n# References\n\n## Sources cited\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Impeachment_of_Samuel_Chase\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Impeachment in the House of Representatives\n##Vote to launch impeachment inquiry\n##Early inquiry developments\n##Adoption of impeachment resolution\n##Subsequent months of inquiry\n##Adoption of articles of impeachment\n###Article I\n###Article II\n###Article III\n###Article IV\n###Article V\n###Article VI\n###Article VII\n###Article VIII\n###Vote overview\n#Appointment of House managers\n#Senate trial\n##Officers of the trial\n##Rules of the trial\n##Start of the proceedings\n##Decoration and arrangement of the Senate Chamber\n##Pleading phase\n##Argument phase\n###Prosecution's presentation\n###Defense's presentation\n###Closing remarks\n##Verdict\n#Aftermath\n##Immediate aftermath\n##Legacy\n#References\n##Sources cited\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Since its completion in 1941, the monument has been featured in numerous forms of media, including films, television shows, music, and literature. This article explores the reasons behind Mount Rushmore's enduring popularity in popular culture, common themes that emerge in its depiction, and notable examples of its portrayal in various media.\n\n# Reasons for popularity\n\nMount Rushmore's popularity in popular culture can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its unique design and massive scale make it a visually striking and recognizable landmark. The monument's imposing presence, combined with its remote location in the American wilderness, has captivated the imagination of artists, writers, and filmmakers. Additionally, Mount Rushmore's association with American history and democracy has led to its use as a symbol of patriotism, freedom, and national identity.\n\nThe monument's creation story, which involved the vision and perseverance of sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his team, has also contributed to its appeal. The project's massive scale, technical challenges, and long construction period (1927-1941) have inspired numerous accounts and adaptations, from books and articles to documentaries and films.\n\n# Common themes\n\n## Destruction\n\nOne common theme in Mount Rushmore's depiction in popular culture is destruction or damage to the monument. This theme often serves as a metaphor for the fragility of American democracy, the threat of external forces, or the consequences of human actions. Examples of this theme can be seen in films such as \"Superman II\" (1980), where the villainous General Zod threatens to destroy the monument, and \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996), where Martian invaders blast Mount Rushmore with their advanced technology.\n\n## Alterations and additions to the faces\n\nAnother common theme is the alteration or addition of faces to the monument. This can be seen as a commentary on the changing nature of American society, the inclusion or exclusion of certain groups, or the reinterpretation of historical figures. In the film \"Team America: World Police\" (2004), a group of marionettes, including a caricature of Michael Moore, are added to the monument, while in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\" (2006), the face of Homer Simpson is temporarily added to the sculpture.\n\n# Imitations of the style\n\nMount Rushmore's unique style has inspired numerous imitations and parodies in popular culture. These can range from advertisements and logos to sculptures and public art installations. One notable example is the \"Mount Rushmore of Rock\" sculpture in Wisconsin, which features the faces of Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, and Chuck Berry.\n\n# Major portrayals\n\n## In North by Northwest\n\nOne of the most iconic portrayals of Mount Rushmore in popular culture is in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"North by Northwest\" (1959). The movie's final scene features a dramatic chase sequence at the monument, where the protagonist, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), must evade villains and save the day. The scene has become a classic of American cinema, with Mount Rushmore serving as a symbol of American ingenuity and determination.\n\n# In music\n\nMount Rushmore has also been referenced in numerous songs and music videos. One notable example is the song \"Mount Rushmore\" by the band The Fall, which appears on their 1988 album \"I Am Kurious Oranj\". The song features lyrics that explore the monument's symbolism and cultural significance, while also critiquing American politics and society.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of monuments and memorials in the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in South Dakota\n* United States presidential memorials\n\nMount Rushmore's enduring popularity in popular culture is a testament to its status as an American icon. From its depiction in films and television shows to its reference in music and literature, the monument continues to inspire artists and audiences alike. As a symbol of American history and democracy, Mount Rushmore remains a powerful and enduring presence in popular culture.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mount_Rushmore_in_popular_culture\" following this outline:\n\n#Reasons for popularity\n#Common themes\n##Destruction\n##Alterations and additions to the faces\n#Imitations of the style\n#Major portrayals\n##In North by Northwest\n#In music\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Situated on the Ottawa River, the village has a rich history dating back to the 19th century, with various stages of development transforming it into the unique and charming neighborhood it is today.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Mill town (1826–1887)\n\nBritannia Village was founded in 1826 as a mill town, with the construction of the Britannia Sawmill and the Britannia Textile Mill. The village quickly grew, attracting workers and their families to the area. The sawmill produced lumber for the construction of buildings in Ottawa, while the textile mill manufactured cloth and other textiles. The village's economy thrived, with several other industries, including a gristmill, a blacksmith shop, and a general store, emerging to support the growing population.\n\n### Summer-cottage resort (1887–1960)\n\nIn 1887, the Britannia Sawmill and Textile Mill were sold to the Grand Trunk Railway, which began to develop the area as a summer-cottage resort. The railway company built a hotel, a golf course, and several cottages, attracting tourists from Ottawa and other parts of Canada. The village became a popular destination for those seeking to escape the city heat and enjoy outdoor activities such as swimming, fishing, and boating. During this period, several engineering feats were accomplished, including the construction of a canal and a series of locks, which allowed boats to navigate the Ottawa River.\n\n#### Engineering feats\n\nOne of the most notable engineering feats in Britannia Village was the construction of the Britannia Canal, which connected the Ottawa River to the Deschênes Rapids. The canal, completed in 1887, allowed boats to bypass the rapids and navigate the river safely. The canal was an important transportation route, facilitating the movement of goods and people between Ottawa and other parts of Canada.\n\n#### Britannia Amusement Park\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Britannia Amusement Park was established, featuring a variety of rides, including a roller coaster, a Ferris wheel, and a carousel. The park also included a dance hall, a restaurant, and a beach area, making it a popular destination for families and young people.\n\n### Rural commuter town (1960–2000)\n\nIn the 1960s, Britannia Village began to transition from a summer-cottage resort to a rural commuter town. As Ottawa's suburbs expanded, the village became an attractive option for people working in the city but seeking a more rural lifestyle. The construction of the Queensway highway in the 1960s made it easier for commuters to travel to and from Ottawa, leading to an influx of new residents.\n\n### Revitalization (since 2000)\n\nIn recent years, Britannia Village has undergone significant revitalization efforts, driven by the City of Ottawa and local residents. The village has been transformed into a thriving community, with a mix of old and new homes, shops, and restaurants.\n\n#### Flood proofing\n\nOne of the major challenges facing Britannia Village has been flooding. The village is located in a floodplain, and the Ottawa River has overflowed its banks on several occasions, causing significant damage to homes and businesses. In response, the City of Ottawa has implemented various flood-proofing measures, including the construction of a floodwall and the installation of flood-control gates.\n\n#### Gentrification\n\nAs Britannia Village has become more popular, concerns have been raised about gentrification. The influx of new residents and businesses has driven up property values, making it difficult for long-time residents to afford their homes. The City of Ottawa has implemented measures to address these concerns, including the creation of affordable housing units and the development of community programs to support low-income residents.\n\nHeritage buildings and architectural style\n----------------------------------------\n\nBritannia Village is home to many heritage buildings, showcasing a range of architectural styles. The village's history as a mill town and summer-cottage resort is reflected in its buildings, which feature a mix of industrial, Victorian, and Arts and Crafts styles.\n\n### Addresses of buildings with heritage status\n\nSeveral buildings in Britannia Village have been designated as heritage buildings by the City of Ottawa. These include:\n\n* The Britannia Sawmill, built in 1826\n* The Britannia Textile Mill, built in 1830\n* The Grand Trunk Railway Hotel, built in 1887\n* The Britannia Canal Locks, built in 1887\n* The Britannia Amusement Park Dance Hall, built in 1910\n\n### Heritage attributes in modern residences\n\nMany modern residences in Britannia Village incorporate heritage attributes, such as exposed brick, wooden beams, and large windows. These features pay homage to the village's industrial and architectural heritage, while also providing a unique and charming living environment.\n\nCharacter\n----------\n\nBritannia Village is a unique and charming community, with a strong sense of history and identity. The village's mix of old and new homes, shops, and restaurants creates a vibrant and eclectic atmosphere, attracting visitors and residents from across Ottawa.\n\nNotables in the community\n-------------------------\n\nBritannia Village has been home to several notable residents, including:\n\n* Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister, who summered in the village in the late 19th century\n* Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Canada's seventh prime minister, who also summered in the village\n* The Bronfman family, who owned the Seagram Company and summered in the village\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nBritannia Village is a thriving community, with a rich history and a unique character. The village's mix of old and new homes, shops, and restaurants creates a vibrant and eclectic atmosphere, attracting visitors and residents from across Ottawa.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* City of Ottawa.

It was a distinct school of thought that focused on the use of law, statecraft, and punishments to achieve social order and stability. The Legalists rejected traditional Confucian values and emphasized the importance of a strong state and a rational, efficient system of governance. This article provides an overview of the key aspects of Legalist thought, its development, and its influence on Chinese history.\n\nRetrospective Current\n--------------------\n\nThe Legalist school was not a unified, coherent movement, but rather a collection of thinkers and ideas that shared certain commonalities. The retrospective current refers to the way in which later scholars and historians have imposed a sense of unity and coherence on the Legalist school.\n\n### Chapter 43 Ding fa\n\nChapter 43 of the Han Feizi, a key Legalist text, is titled \"Ding fa\" or \"Fixing the Standards.\" In this chapter, Han Fei argues that the ruler must establish clear laws and standards, and that these laws must be enforced consistently and impartially. This idea of \"fixing the standards\" is central to Legalist thought, and emphasizes the importance of clear, rational laws in maintaining social order.\n\n### Imperial Confucian category\n\nThe Imperial Confucian category refers to the way in which the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) incorporated Confucianism into the imperial bureaucracy. During this period, Confucianism became the dominant ideology of the imperial court, and the Legalist school was largely suppressed. However, many of the key ideas and concepts of Legalism continued to influence imperial policy and governance.\n\nMilitary Mobilization\n-------------------\n\nThe Legalists were deeply concerned with the problem of military mobilization, and how to create a strong, efficient military that could defend the state against external threats. They argued that the key to military success lay in the creation of a well-organized, well-trained army, and that the ruler must be willing to use force decisively and ruthlessly in order to achieve victory.\n\nSima Qian\n----------\n\nSima Qian (145 – 86 BCE) was a historian and scholar who lived during the Han dynasty. He is best known for his magnum opus, the Records of the Grand Historian, which provides a comprehensive history of China from the earliest times to the Han dynasty. Sima Qian was deeply critical of the Legalist school, and saw them as responsible for many of the problems and injustices of the Qin dynasty (221 – 206 BCE).\n\nHuang-Lao and Mawangdui\n------------------------\n\nThe Huang-Lao school was a philosophical movement that emerged during the 4th century BCE. It was characterized by a syncretic blend of Daoist and Legalist ideas, and emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the natural world. The Mawangdui texts, a collection of ancient manuscripts discovered in the 1970s, provide valuable insights into the thought and practices of the Huang-Lao school.\n\n### Huang-Lao and Laozi\n\nThe Huang-Lao school was deeply influenced by the thought of Laozi, the legendary founder of Daoism. They saw Laozi as a key figure in the development of their own philosophy, and incorporated many of his ideas and concepts into their own thought.\n\n### Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n\nShen Dao (c. 350 – c. 275 BCE) was a key figure in the Huang-Lao school, and was deeply influenced by the thought of Zhuangzi, a Daoist philosopher. Shen Dao's thought emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the natural world, and of cultivating a sense of inner balance and tranquility.\n\nChanging with the Times\n-----------------------\n\nThe Legalists were deeply concerned with the problem of how to adapt to changing circumstances, and how to create a system of governance that could respond effectively to changing conditions. They argued that the ruler must be willing to change and adapt, and that the key to success lay in the ability to respond flexibly and creatively to changing circumstances.\n\n### A.C. Graham\n\nA.C. Graham (1919 – 1991) was a British sinologist and philosopher who wrote extensively on the thought of the Legalist school. He saw the Legalists as a key part of the broader philosophical landscape of ancient China, and argued that their thought had a profound influence on the development of Chinese philosophy.\n\nConfucian Influences\n---------------------\n\nThe Legalists were deeply critical of Confucianism, and saw it as a major obstacle to the creation of a strong, efficient state. However, many of the key ideas and concepts of Confucianism continued to influence Legalist thought, and the two schools interacted and intersected in complex ways.\n\n### Shen Dao\n\nShen Dao, a key figure in the Huang-Lao school, was deeply influenced by Confucian thought. He saw the importance of cultivating virtues such as ren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness), and argued that the ruler must be guided by a sense of moral principle.\n\nXing-Ming and Wu wei\n--------------------\n\nThe concepts of xing-ming (shaping and naming) and wu wei (non-action) were central to Legalist thought. Xing-ming referred to the process of creating clear, rational laws and standards, while wu wei referred to the idea of taking no action, or allowing things to unfold naturally.\n\nHan Feizi\n----------\n\nHan Feizi (c. 280 – c. 233 BCE) was a key figure in the Legalist school, and is best known for his magnum opus, the Han Feizi. This text provides a comprehensive overview of Legalist thought, and emphasizes the importance of clear, rational laws and a strong, efficient state.\n\n### Daodejing 17\n\nChapter 17 of the Daodejing, a key Daoist text, provides a critique of the Legalist school. It argues that the Legalists are concerned only with the external trappings of power, and that they neglect the importance of cultivating inner balance and tranquility.\n\nSchool of Names\n----------------\n\nThe School of Names was a philosophical movement that emerged during the 4th century BCE. It was characterized by a focus on the importance of language and naming, and emphasized the idea that words and concepts have a profound influence on our understanding of the world.\n\nEradicating Punishments\n----------------------\n\nThe Legalists argued that the key to maintaining social order lay in the creation of a system of punishments that was clear, consistent, and fair. They saw punishments as a necessary evil, and argued that they must be used decisively and ruthlessly in order to maintain social order.\n\n### Han Feizi\n\nHan Feizi argued that the key to eradicating punishments lay in the creation of a system of clear, rational laws. He saw punishments as a necessary evil, but argued that they must be used sparingly and only in cases where the law had been clearly broken.\n\n### Justice\n\nThe concept of justice was central to Legalist thought. They argued that the key to maintaining social order lay in the creation of a system of justice that was clear, consistent, and fair. They saw justice as a key part of the broader system of governance, and argued that it must be used decisively and ruthlessly in order to maintain social order.\n\nSources in Legalist Mythos\n---------------------------\n\nThe Legalist school has a rich and complex mythology, and many of the key ideas and concepts of Legalist thought are rooted in myth and legend.\n\n### Jia Yi (200–169 BCE)\n\nJia Yi was a scholar and historian who lived during the Han dynasty. He is best known for his magnum opus, the Xinshu, which provides a comprehensive overview of Legalist thought.\n\n### Liu An (179–122 bce)\n\nLiu An was a scholar and historian who lived during the Han dynasty. He is best known for his magnum opus, the Huainanzi, which provides a comprehensive overview of Daoist thought.\n\n### The Fa School\n\nThe Fa School was a philosophical movement that emerged during the 4th century BCE. It was characterized by a focus on the importance of law and governance, and emphasized the idea that the key to maintaining social order lay in the creation of a system of clear, rational laws.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nSources\n-------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Legalism_(Chinese_philosophy)\" following this outline:\n\n#Retrospective current\n##Chapter 43 Ding fa\n##Imperial Confucian category\n#Military mobilization\n#Sima Qian\n#Huang-Lao and Mawangdui\n##Huang-Lao and Laozi\n##Shen Dao and Zhuangzi\n#Changing with the times\n##A.C.

The trophy is awarded to the winner of a best-of-seven series between the champions of the NLJHL's two divisions, the Eastern Division and the Western Division. The Herder Memorial Trophy is considered one of the most iconic and coveted championships in Canadian junior hockey.\n\n# History\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy was established in 1989 by the Newfoundland and Labrador Junior Hockey League to commemorate the contributions of the Herder family to the sport of hockey in the province. The trophy is named after the Herder family, who were instrumental in developing and promoting hockey in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Herder family's passion for hockey and their commitment to the sport have had a lasting impact on the province's hockey community.\n\n# The Herder family\n\nThe Herder family has a long and storied history in Newfoundland and Labrador hockey. The family's involvement in hockey dates back to the early 20th century, when they first began playing and promoting the sport in the province. Over the years, the Herder family has produced numerous talented players, coaches, and officials who have made significant contributions to the sport. The family's dedication to hockey has been recognized through numerous awards and honors, including the establishment of the Herder Memorial Trophy.\n\n# The trophy\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy is a silver cup trophy that stands approximately 18 inches tall and weighs around 20 pounds.

The trophy is considered a symbol of excellence in Newfoundland and Labrador junior hockey, and it is highly coveted by players, coaches, and teams throughout the province.\n\n# Conditions placed by the trophy donor\n\nWhen the Herder Memorial Trophy was established, the donor placed several conditions on the award. These conditions were designed to ensure that the trophy was awarded in a fair and competitive manner, and that it remained a prestigious and highly sought-after championship. The conditions included:\n\n* The trophy would be awarded annually to the winner of a best-of-seven series between the champions of the NLJHL's two divisions.\n* The series would be played in a predetermined format, with the winner of the series being the first team to win four games.\n* The trophy would be presented to the winning team at a ceremony following the final game of the series.\n* The winner of the trophy would be required to display it prominently in their home arena or a designated location.\n* The trophy would be insured against loss or damage, and the winner would be responsible for ensuring its safekeeping.\n* The trophy would be awarded in perpetuity, with the winner of the championship series being the custodian of the trophy for the following year.\n* The trophy would be maintained and updated annually, with the names of the winners being engraved on the cup.\n\n## Exceptions to the original conditions\n\nOver the years, there have been several exceptions to the original conditions placed on the Herder Memorial Trophy.

This change was made to reduce the number of games played in the series and to give teams more time to prepare for the playoffs.\n\n### Condition #4\n\nIn 2010, the winner of the Herder Memorial Trophy was unable to display the trophy in their home arena due to renovations. The trophy was instead displayed at a local sports museum, where it was available for public viewing.\n\n### Condition #7\n\nIn 2015, the NLJHL changed the format of the championship series again, this time to a best-of-seven series with a twist. The series would feature a home-and-home format, with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 2, 4, and 6. This change was made to give both teams more home games in the series.\n\n# Series format\n\nThe Herder Memorial Trophy series is played in a best-of-seven format, with the winner being the first team to win four games. The series features a home-and-home format, with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 2, 4, and 6.\n\n## Series format history\n\nThe format of the Herder Memorial Trophy series has changed several times over the years.

This rare occurrence of two highly anticipated movies opening on the same day sparked significant attention and interest among film enthusiasts, industry experts, and the general public.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Release date dispute\n\nThe release date of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" was initially set for different dates. However, due to various reasons, including production delays and strategic marketing decisions, both films ultimately settled on the same release date. This move was met with surprise and curiosity, as it is uncommon for two major films to open on the same day, especially when both are expected to perform well at the box office.\n\n### Public reaction\n\nThe announcement of the simultaneous release date sparked a lively debate among fans and film enthusiasts on social media platforms. Some people expressed excitement and anticipation, eager to see how the two films would perform against each other. Others were concerned that the dual release would lead to divided attention and negatively impact the box office performance of one or both films.\n\n### Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaigns for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were highly publicized, with both films generating significant buzz and attention. The studios behind the films, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, respectively, invested heavily in promotional activities, including trailers, TV spots, and social media advertising. The marketing efforts were designed to appeal to different demographics, with \"Barbie\" targeting a younger audience and \"Oppenheimer\" aiming for a more mature crowd.\n\n### Double feature viewing\n\nTo capitalize on the unique situation, some theaters offered double feature viewings of both films, allowing audiences to watch both movies back-to-back. This move was seen as a way to encourage fans to experience both films and provide a unique cinematic experience.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\n#### Projections\n\nPrior to the release, box office projections varied widely, with some analysts predicting that one film would dominate the other. However, as the release date approached, it became clear that both films had the potential to perform well, with some experts forecasting a close competition.\n\n#### Gross\n\nThe opening weekend box office results saw both films performing strongly, with \"Barbie\" grossing over $155 million and \"Oppenheimer\" earning over $80 million. The combined box office gross of both films exceeded $235 million, making it one of the biggest opening weekends of the year.\n\n### Film industry reaction\n\nThe film industry reaction to the simultaneous release was largely positive, with many experts praising the bold move. Some analysts noted that the dual release could lead to increased box office revenue, as fans of both films would be more likely to visit theaters. Others saw the move as a way to create a unique marketing opportunity, generating buzz and attention that might not have been possible with separate release dates.\n\n### Japanese response\n\nIn Japan, the simultaneous release was met with significant interest, with both films performing well at the box office. The Japanese market is known for its unique cinematic culture, and the dual release was seen as a way to capitalize on the country's love for film.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe success of the simultaneous release can be attributed to various factors, including the strong marketing campaigns and the unique appeal of both films. The double feature viewings also played a role, allowing audiences to experience both films in a single sitting. However, some analysts noted that the dual release may have led to divided attention, potentially impacting the box office performance of one or both films.\n\n### Reviews\n\nThe critical response to both films was largely positive, with many reviewers praising the performances, direction, and overall quality of the movies. However, some critics noted that the simultaneous release may have led to overhyped expectations, making it difficult for the films to live up to the buzz.\n\n### Accolades\n\nBoth films received several award nominations, including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. The success of the films was seen as a testament to the talent and dedication of the cast and crew.\n\nCounterprogramming\n-----------------\n\n### Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n\nThe simultaneous release of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" raised questions about the potential for a \"Glicked\" phenomenon, where two films compete for attention and box office revenue. However, as the release date approached, it became clear that both films had the potential to perform well, and the dual release was seen as a way to create a unique marketing opportunity.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Barbie (2023 film)\n* Oppenheimer (2023 film)\n* Simultaneous release\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* \"The 'Barbenheimer' Phenomenon: How Two Films Became a Cultural Event\" by The New York Times\n* \"The Box Office Battle: 'Barbie' vs. 'Oppenheimer'\" by Variety\n* \"The 'Glicked' Phenomenon: How Two Films Can Compete for Attention\" by The Hollywood Reporter\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Barbenheimer\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Release date dispute\n###Public reaction\n##Marketing\n##Double feature viewing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n###Projections\n###Gross\n##Film industry reaction\n##Japanese response\n##Analysis\n##Reviews\n##Accolades\n#Counterprogramming\n##Potential \"Glicked\" phenomenon\n#Notes\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The games were surrounded by several concerns and controversies, which drew attention from athletes, officials, and media worldwide.\n\n# Criticism of Host Selection\n\nThe selection of Beijing as the host city for the 2022 Winter Olympics was met with criticism and concerns. Beijing became the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics, after previously hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics. Human rights groups and activists criticized the decision, citing China's human rights record and the country's treatment of minority groups, such as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\n# Organizing Concerns and Controversies\n\n## Cost and Climate\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were expected to be one of the most expensive in history, with estimated costs ranging from $3 billion to $38.5 billion. The games required significant investment in infrastructure, including the construction of new venues, hotels, and transportation systems. Additionally, concerns were raised about the climate and weather conditions in Beijing, which experiences cold and dry winters. The lack of natural snowfall in the region raised concerns about the environmental impact of artificial snowmaking.\n\n## Promotional Song\n\nThe promotional song for the 2022 Winter Olympics, titled \"Together for a Shared Future,\" was criticized for its similarity to a Japanese song, \"Seiiki,\" which was released in 2019. The song's creators denied any plagiarism, but the incident sparked a heated debate on social media.\n\n# Diplomatic Boycotts or Non-Attendance\n\n## Background\n\nIn the months leading up to the games, several countries announced diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance at the 2022 Winter Olympics. The boycotts were largely in response to China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\n## United States\n\nOn December 6, 2021, the United States announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity\" in Xinjiang. The decision meant that no U.S. government officials would attend the games, but American athletes would still be allowed to compete.\n\n## Australia\n\nAustralia followed the United States in announcing a diplomatic boycott of the games, citing human rights concerns. Australian athletes would still be allowed to compete, but no government officials would attend.\n\n## India\n\nIndia announced that it would not send any government officials to the games, citing the participation of a Chinese military commander in the Olympic torch relay. The commander had been involved in a border clash between Indian and Chinese troops in 2020.\n\n## Calls for Boycotts by Other Countries\n\nSeveral other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, were called upon to boycott the games or take a diplomatic stance. However, most countries opted not to participate in a full-scale boycott, instead sending reduced delegations or making statements critical of China's human rights record.\n\n## Chinese Government Response\n\nThe Chinese government responded to the boycotts by accusing Western countries of \"politicizing\" the games and engaging in a \"Cold War mentality.\" Chinese officials also claimed that the boycotts would not affect the success of the games.\n\n## IOC Response\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) maintained its stance of neutrality, stating that the organization was not involved in politics and that the games would go ahead as planned. IOC President Thomas Bach called on countries to respect the Olympic Charter and not use the games for political purposes.\n\n# Athletes and Team Officials Complaints\n\n## Quarantine Facilities\n\nSeveral athletes and team officials complained about the quarantine facilities provided by the Chinese government. The facilities were described as inadequate, with some athletes reporting that they were not provided with sufficient food or water.\n\n## Food\n\nAthletes also complained about the food provided at the games, citing concerns about quality and variety. Some athletes reported that they were not provided with sufficient nutrition to support their training and competition.\n\n## Weather Conditions\n\nThe weather conditions in Beijing were also a source of concern for athletes, with cold temperatures and wind chill affecting several events.\n\n# Team Russia\n\n## Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 led to a significant increase in tensions at the games. The IOC and other countries condemned the invasion, and there were calls for Russia to be banned from the Olympics.\n\n# Environmental and Health Issues\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the games, with strict health protocols in place to prevent the spread of the virus. However, several athletes and officials tested positive for the virus, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of the protocols.\n\n## Insufficient Snowfall\n\nThe lack of natural snowfall in Beijing required the use of artificial snowmaking, which had a significant environmental impact. The snowmaking process used large amounts of water and energy, raising concerns about the sustainability of the games.\n\n## Energy Crisis\n\nThe games also faced an energy crisis, with concerns about the availability of power to support the events. The Chinese government implemented measures to reduce energy consumption, but the situation remained a concern throughout the games.\n\n## Impact on Songshan National Nature Reserve\n\nThe construction of venues and infrastructure for the games had a significant impact on the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a protected area in Beijing. Environmental groups raised concerns about the damage to the reserve and the potential long-term effects on the ecosystem.\n\n# Human Rights Issues\n\n## Sportswashing\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics were criticized for being used as a tool for \"sportswashing,\" or the practice of using sports to improve a country's reputation and distract from human rights abuses. China's human rights record, particularly with regards to the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, was a major concern.\n\n## Athlete Safety\n\nAthletes also raised concerns about their safety at the games, citing the lack of transparency and accountability in the Chinese government's handling of human rights issues.\n\n## Athletes' Freedom of Speech\n\nSeveral athletes spoke out about the need for greater freedom of speech at the games, citing concerns about censorship and the silencing of critics.\n\n## Protests\n\nThere were several protests and demonstrations at the games, with athletes and activists speaking out against human rights abuses and calling for greater accountability.\n\n# Propaganda and Information Operations Issues\n\n## Propaganda and Information Operations\n\nThe Chinese government was accused of engaging in propaganda and information operations to shape public opinion and influence the narrative around the games.\n\n## Censorship\n\n### Negative News Censored during the Games\n\nSeveral instances of censorship were reported during the games, with negative news and criticism of the Chinese government being blocked or removed from social media.\n\n### Alleged Suspension of US Athlete's Twitter Account\n\nThere was an incident in which a US athlete's Twitter account was allegedly suspended after they spoke out against the Chinese government's human rights record.\n\n## Espionage Directed at Athletes\n\nThere were concerns about espionage directed at athletes, with reports of Chinese government agents attempting to gather intelligence on athletes and their activities.\n\n## Sjoerd den Daas Incident\n\nA Dutch journalist, Sjoerd den Daas, was detained by Chinese authorities after he reported on human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The incident raised concerns about the safety of journalists and the freedom of the press.\n\n# Olympic Torch Relay\n\nThe Olympic torch relay was criticized for its route, which passed through several sensitive areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang. There were concerns about the potential for protests and disruptions along the route.\n\n# Hanbok Row\n\nA controversy arose over the wearing of hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, by a Chinese athlete during the opening ceremony.
