The experiment has been repeated in 2022 and 2023, with increasing popularity and complexity.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nR/place is a digital canvas that consists of a large grid of pixels, each of which can be colored by a Reddit user. The canvas is accessible through a dedicated subreddit, where users can submit pixels to be added to the canvas. The project relies on a simple yet effective game mechanic, where users can place a single pixel every five minutes, with the goal of creating a collaborative artwork.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### 2017 experiment\n\nThe first R/place experiment was launched in 2017, as an April Fool's Day joke by Reddit administrators. The initial canvas consisted of a 1000x1000 pixel grid, and users could choose from a palette of 16 colors to place their pixels. The experiment was intended to last for only 72 hours, but due to its popularity, it was extended for an additional 24 hours. During this time, over 1 million users participated, creating a vibrant and diverse artwork.\n\n### 2022 experiment\n\nIn 2022, Reddit revived the R/place experiment, with a new 2000x2000 pixel canvas and an expanded color palette of 32 colors. The experiment was launched on April 1, 2022, and ran for 96 hours. This time, the project attracted over 6 million participants, creating a highly detailed and intricate artwork. The 2022 experiment also introduced new features, such as the ability for users to create and join groups, and a new voting system to determine the colors of the pixels.\n\n### 2023 experiment\n\nThe 2023 R/place experiment was launched on March 20, 2023, with an even larger canvas of 4000x4000 pixels and an expanded color palette of 64 colors. The experiment ran for 120 hours, and attracted over 10 million participants. This time, the project introduced new features, such as the ability for users to create and share custom pixel art, and a new system for users to earn rewards and badges.\n\nMedia response\n--------------\n\nR/place has received widespread media attention, with articles and features in major publications such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and Wired. The project has been praised for its innovative approach to community engagement and collaborative art, and has been cited as an example of the potential for social media to facilitate creative expression and social interaction.\n\nAtlas\n------\n\nThe R/place Atlas is a comprehensive guide to the project's history, mechanics, and art. The Atlas provides a detailed overview of the project's evolution, including its origins, key milestones, and notable artworks. It also includes a comprehensive guide to the project's game mechanics, including the rules and features that govern the creation and modification of the canvas.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Collaborative art\n* Social media art\n* Reddit\n* Digital art\n* Pixel art\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"R/place\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#History\n##2017 experiment\n##2022 experiment\n##2023 experiment\n#Media response\n#Atlas\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

These standards have evolved over time, with new technologies and innovations leading to the development of higher-resolution displays with improved image quality.\n\nOverview\n\nThe display resolution of a device is typically measured in terms of the number of pixels it can display, with higher resolutions indicating a greater number of pixels. The aspect ratio of a display refers to the ratio of the width to the height of the screen, with common aspect ratios including 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. Display resolution standards are used in a wide range of applications, including computer monitors, televisions, mobile devices, and digital signage.\n\nAspect Ratio\n\nThe aspect ratio of a display is an important consideration in the development of display resolution standards. The most common aspect ratios in use today are 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. The 4:3 aspect ratio was widely used in older computer monitors and televisions, while the 16:9 aspect ratio is commonly used in modern high-definition televisions and mobile devices.

The locomotive is one of the 14 Class J locomotives, which were designed to haul passenger trains on the Norfolk and Western Railway. The 611 is notable for being one of the last mainline steam locomotives in operation in the United States and for its numerous excursion runs over the years.\n\nDesign and Abilities\n-------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is a Class J 4-8-4 steam locomotive, meaning it has four leading wheels, eight driving wheels, and four trailing wheels. The locomotive was designed to haul passenger trains at high speeds, with a top speed of 110 miles per hour. The 611 is powered by a large firebox and a high-pressure boiler, which allows it to generate 4,500 horsepower. The locomotive also features a unique streamlined design, with a distinctive bullet nose and a sloping tender.\n\nThe 611 is equipped with a number of advanced features for its time, including a booster engine, which allows the locomotive to start heavy trains from a standstill, and a steam generator, which provides heat and light to the passenger cars. The locomotive also features a advanced braking system, which allows it to stop quickly and safely.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Revenue Service\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 was built in 1950 and entered revenue service shortly thereafter. The locomotive was used to haul passenger trains on the Norfolk and Western Railway, including the Powhatan Arrow and the Pocahontas. The 611 was known for its speed and reliability, and it quickly became one of the most popular locomotives on the Norfolk and Western Railway.\n\n### First Retirement\n\nIn 1959, the Norfolk and Western Railway began to retire its steam locomotives, including the 611. The locomotive was stored in a roundhouse in Roanoke, Virginia, where it remained for several years.\n\n### First Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 1982, the Norfolk and Western Railway began to operate excursion trains, using the 611 and other steam locomotives. The 611 was restored to operating condition and began to haul excursion trains on the Norfolk and Western Railway. The locomotive quickly became popular with railfans and passengers, who were drawn to its speed and power.\n\n### Second Retirement\n\nIn 1994, the Norfolk and Western Railway merged with the Southern Railway to form Norfolk Southern Railway. The 611 was retired again, this time due to the high cost of maintaining the locomotive. The locomotive was stored in a roundhouse in Roanoke, Virginia, where it remained for several years.\n\n### Second Mainline Excursion Service\n\nIn 2015, the Virginia Museum of Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway partnered to restore the 611 to operating condition. The locomotive was rebuilt at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina, and began to haul excursion trains on the Norfolk Southern Railway. The 611 has since become one of the most popular excursion locomotives in the United States, hauling trains on the Norfolk Southern Railway and other railroads.\n\n### Post-NS Excursion Service\n\nAfter the Norfolk Southern Railway ended its steam excursion program in 2016, the 611 was operated by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and other organizations. The locomotive has continued to haul excursion trains on various railroads, including the Norfolk Southern Railway, the CSX Transportation, and the Amtrak.\n\nAccidents and Incidents\n----------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has been involved in several accidents and incidents over the years. In 1989, the locomotive was involved in a minor collision with a Norfolk Southern Railway diesel locomotive. The 611 suffered minor damage, but was quickly repaired and returned to service.\n\nIn 2016, the 611 was involved in a more serious incident, when it suffered a boiler failure while hauling an excursion train. The locomotive was forced to make an emergency stop, but there were no injuries or damage to the train.\n\nIn Popular Culture\n------------------\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 has appeared in several films and television shows over the years, including the 1989 film \"Steel Magnolias\" and the 1990s television show \"Walker, Texas Ranger\".\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Norfolk and Western Railway\n* Class J (steam locomotive)\n* Steam locomotive\n* Excursion train\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThe Norfolk and Western 611 is one of the most popular steam locomotives in the United States, known for its speed and power.

The storm caused widespread damage and flooding, particularly in the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations, impact, aftermath, and retirement.\n\nMeteorological History\n---------------------\n\nTyphoon Doksuri originated from a tropical depression that formed on September 10, 2023, in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) east of the Philippines. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on September 12 and was named Doksuri by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Doksuri continued to intensify, reaching typhoon strength on September 14.\n\nAs Doksuri approached the Philippines, it reached its peak intensity on September 16, with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 955 hPa (28.20 inHg). The storm then began to weaken as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines and Taiwan.\n\nPreparations\n------------\n\n### Philippines\n\nThe Philippine government declared a state of calamity in several provinces, including Cagayan, Isabela, and Quirino, as Doksuri approached the country. Over 10,000 people were evacuated to higher ground, and schools and offices were closed in anticipation of the storm's landfall.\n\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued a Signal No. 4 warning, the highest level of warning, for several provinces, indicating that winds of over 190 km/h (120 mph) were expected.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nThe Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning for several counties, including Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung, as Doksuri approached the island. Over 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas, and schools and offices were closed in some counties.\n\n### China\n\nThe Chinese government issued a red alert, the highest level of warning, for several provinces, including Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, as Doksuri approached the mainland. Over 100,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas, and schools and offices were closed in some provinces.\n\nImpact\n--------\n\n### Philippines\n\n#### Widespread Flooding\n\nDoksuri brought heavy rainfall to the Philippines, causing widespread flooding in several provinces. The towns of Aparri and Tuguegarao in Cagayan province were among the worst affected, with floodwaters reaching as high as 2 meters (6.6 ft) in some areas.\n\n#### MB Aya Express\n\nThe storm also caused a ferry, MB Aya Express, to capsize off the coast of Batanes province, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people.\n\n### Taiwan\n\nDoksuri brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Taiwan, causing widespread damage and power outages.

The disaster highlighted the ongoing issue of migrant smuggling in the region and raised concerns about the safety of migrants attempting to reach European shores.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea has long been a major route for migrants seeking to reach Europe, with many attempting to cross from North Africa and the Middle East to Italy, Greece, and other European countries. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reports that over 1 million migrants have arrived in Europe by sea since 2015, with thousands more attempting to make the journey each year.\n\nIn recent years, Greece has seen a significant increase in migrant arrivals, with many attempting to reach the country's islands and mainland from Turkey. The Greek government has implemented various measures to deter migrant smuggling, including increased border security and cooperation with neighboring countries. However, the flow of migrants has continued, with many risking their lives to reach European shores.\n\n# The migrant boat, the Adriana\n\nThe migrant boat involved in the disaster was a vessel named the Adriana, a 25-meter-long fishing boat that had been converted for use as a migrant smuggling vessel. The boat was reportedly carrying over 500 migrants, including men, women, and children, from various countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria.\n\nAccording to reports, the Adriana had set sail from the port city of Izmir, Turkey, several days before the disaster, with the intended destination of Italy. However, the boat was intercepted by Greek authorities off the coast of Messenia, leading to a series of events that would ultimately result in the disaster.\n\n# Distress calls and response\n\nOn the morning of June 14, 2023, the Adriana issued a distress call to Greek authorities, reporting that the boat was taking on water and in danger of sinking. The Greek Coast Guard responded to the call, dispatching a rescue vessel to the scene.\n\nHowever, the rescue efforts were hampered by the large number of migrants on board the Adriana, as well as the boat's instability in the water. The Greek Coast Guard reported that the migrants were panicked and attempting to abandon ship, making it difficult for rescue teams to reach the vessel.\n\n# Capsizing\n\nAs the rescue efforts continued, the Adriana suddenly capsized, throwing hundreds of migrants into the water. The Greek Coast Guard reported that the boat had been listing severely to one side before it capsized, with many migrants trapped below deck.\n\nThe capsizing of the Adriana resulted in chaos, with migrants struggling to stay afloat in the water. Rescue teams worked to reach the migrants, but many were swept away by strong currents, making it difficult to account for the number of survivors.\n\n# Victims\n\nThe exact number of victims in the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster is still unknown, with estimates ranging from 300 to over 500. The Greek government has confirmed that at least 300 migrants lost their lives in the disaster, with many more reported missing.\n\nThe victims included men, women, and children from various countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. Many of the victims were trapped below deck when the Adriana capsized, with others swept away by strong currents.\n\n# Search, rescue, and detention\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Greek authorities launched a search and rescue operation, with multiple vessels and aircraft deployed to the scene. The operation was hampered by strong winds and rough seas, but rescue teams were able to reach many of the survivors.\n\nThose rescued were taken to nearby ports, where they were provided with medical attention and food. However, many of the survivors were also detained by Greek authorities, pending investigation into the migrant smuggling operation.\n\n## Protests\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster sparked widespread protests across Greece, with many calling for greater action to be taken to prevent such tragedies. Protesters accused the Greek government of failing to do enough to address the issue of migrant smuggling, and of prioritizing border security over human life.\n\nThe protests were led by human rights groups and migrant advocacy organizations, who called for greater international cooperation to address the root causes of migration. The protests also highlighted the need for safer and more humane migration policies, and for greater support for those who have lost loved ones in migrant boat disasters.\n\n# Response\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster sparked a strong response from the Greek government, with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis issuing a statement expressing condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nThe Greek government also announced a series of measures aimed at preventing similar tragedies, including increased border security and cooperation with neighboring countries. The government also pledged to work with international partners to address the root causes of migration, and to provide greater support for those who have lost loved ones in migrant boat disasters.\n\n# Judicial proceedings\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Greek authorities launched an investigation into the migrant smuggling operation, with multiple arrests made. The investigation was led by the Greek Coast Guard, with assistance from international partners.\n\nThose arrested were charged with various offenses, including migrant smuggling and manslaughter. The judicial proceedings were ongoing at the time of writing, with many of those arrested facing lengthy prison sentences if convicted.\n\n# Investigations\n\nIn addition to the judicial proceedings, multiple investigations were launched into the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster. The investigations were led by Greek authorities, with assistance from international partners.\n\nThe investigations focused on the causes of the disaster, including the role of migrant smuggling networks and the actions of Greek authorities. The investigations also examined the response to the disaster, including the effectiveness of rescue efforts and the treatment of survivors.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster sparked widespread condemnation from across the world, with many leaders expressing condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nThe European Union issued a statement expressing shock and sadness at the disaster, and pledging to work with international partners to address the root causes of migration. The United Nations also issued a statement, calling for greater international cooperation to prevent such tragedies.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of migrant vessel incidents on the Mediterranean Sea\n* European migrant crisis\n* Mediterranean Sea migrant smuggling\n\n# Note\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster, and is intended to provide information and context about the event.

Jackson Women's Health Organization\n\nDobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is a landmark United States Supreme Court case that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The case, decided on June 24, 2022, marks a significant shift in the country's abortion laws and has far-reaching implications for reproductive rights, healthcare, and American society.\n\n# Background\n\n## Common law\n\nAbortion was not explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution, but the practice was regulated by common law and state statutes. In the mid-19th century, many states began to criminalize abortion, except in cases where the mother's life was at risk. By the mid-20th century, most states had laws prohibiting abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life.\n\n## Constitutional right\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's constitutional right to abortion, striking down state laws that banned the procedure. The Court held that a woman's right to choose an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Roe v. Wade established a trimester framework, allowing for greater state regulation of abortion in the later stages of pregnancy.\n\nIn 1992, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the core holding of Roe v. Wade in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but modified the trimester framework to an \"undue burden standard,\" which allowed for greater state regulation of abortion as long as it did not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to choose an abortion.\n\n## Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court changed significantly between the decisions in Roe v. Wade and Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. The Court's conservative wing grew stronger, with the appointments of Justices Antonin Scalia (1986), Clarence Thomas (1991), Neil Gorsuch (2017), Brett Kavanaugh (2018), and Amy Coney Barrett (2020). These changes set the stage for a potential reevaluation of the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n# Gestational Age Act\n\nIn 2018, the Mississippi State Legislature passed the Gestational Age Act, which banned most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The law was signed by Governor Phil Bryant on March 19, 2018.\n\n## Lower courts\n\nThe Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi, challenged the Gestational Age Act in federal court. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi ruled in favor of the clinic, striking down the law as unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, holding that the law was unconstitutional because it banned pre-viability abortions.\n\n# Supreme Court\n\n## Oral argument\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on December 1, 2021. Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart argued that the Gestational Age Act was constitutional because it did not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to choose an abortion. Jackson Women's Health Organization attorney Julie Rikelman argued that the law was unconstitutional because it banned pre-viability abortions, which had been protected by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n## Leaked draft opinion\n\nOn May 2, 2022, Politico published a leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, written by Justice Samuel Alito. The draft opinion stated that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, returning the authority to regulate abortion to the states. The leak sparked widespread controversy and protests.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion sparked a wave of reactions from politicians, activists, and the general public. Many Democrats expressed outrage and concern about the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade, while many Republicans celebrated the possibility of restricting abortion rights.\n\n### Investigation\n\nChief Justice John Roberts announced an investigation into the leak of the draft opinion, stating that the Court would take \"all necessary steps to identify the source of the leak.\"\n\n## Opinions\n\nThe Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization on June 24, 2022.\n\n### Majority opinion\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, held that the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey was overruled. The opinion stated that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states, where it belongs.\n\n### Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh wrote concurring opinions, agreeing with the majority opinion but also expressing their own views on the issue. Justice Thomas stated that the Court should reconsider other precedents, including those related to same-sex marriage and contraception. Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of state regulation of abortion.\n\n### Conurrence in judgment\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote a concurring opinion in judgment, agreeing with the majority opinion but also expressing concerns about the scope of the decision. He stated that the Court should have taken a more incremental approach, rather than overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey in their entirety.\n\n### Dissent\n\nThe dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer and joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, strongly disagreed with the majority opinion. The dissent stated that the decision would have devastating consequences for women's health and reproductive rights.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Pre-decision\n\nIn the months leading up to the decision, many states took steps to prepare for a potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. Some states enacted laws restricting abortion access, while others worked to expand access to reproductive healthcare.\n\n## Post-decision\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has had significant impacts on reproductive rights, healthcare, and American society.\n\n### State laws restricting abortion\n\nMany states have laws restricting abortion access, including \"trigger laws\" that went into effect immediately after the decision. These laws vary widely, but many ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy or impose significant restrictions on abortion providers.\n\n#### EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical care, including abortion care, regardless of state laws. However, the relationship between EMTALA and state abortion laws is unclear, and there may be conflicts between federal and state authorities.\n\n### State laws expanding abortion access\n\nSome states have enacted laws expanding access to abortion, including laws that protect abortion providers from out-of-state lawsuits. These laws vary widely, but many aim to ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion care.\n\n### Congressional proposals\n\nIn response to the decision, many members of Congress have proposed legislation aimed at protecting reproductive rights. These proposals include bills that would codify the right to abortion and laws that would restrict state-level abortion bans.\n\n### Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden has taken executive action in response to the decision, including an executive order aimed at protecting access to reproductive healthcare. The order directs federal agencies to take steps to ensure that women have access to safe and legal abortion care.\n\n### Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision has significant implications for medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive healthcare processes. Many states have laws restricting these processes, and there may be conflicts between state and federal authorities.\n\n### Data privacy\n\nThe decision has significant implications for data privacy, particularly in states with laws restricting abortion access. Many women may be concerned about their digital footprint and the potential for data to be used against them.\n\n### 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision is likely to play a significant role in the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons, with many candidates campaigning on reproductive rights issues.\n\n### Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant effects on abortion rates, particularly in states with laws restricting abortion access. Many women may be forced to travel out of state or seek care from unlicensed providers.\n\n### Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision may also have significant effects on infant mortality rates, particularly in states with laws restricting abortion access. Many women may be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, which can have negative health consequences for both the mother and the child.\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Legal journalists\n\nMany legal journalists have expressed concerns about the impact of the decision, particularly on reproductive rights and access to healthcare.\n\n## Political\n\n### Support\n\nMany politicians have expressed support for the decision, particularly those from conservative states. These politicians often argue that the decision is a victory for states' rights and the unborn.\n\n### Opposition\n\nMany politicians have expressed opposition to the decision, particularly those from liberal states. These politicians often argue that the decision is a significant setback for reproductive rights and women's health.\n\n## Religious\n\nThe decision has significant implications for religious organizations and individuals, particularly those with strong views on abortion. Many religious organizations have expressed support for the decision, while others have expressed opposition.\n\n## Civil rights\n\nThe decision has significant implications for civil rights organizations, particularly those focused on reproductive rights and women's health. Many civil rights organizations have expressed opposition to the decision, arguing that it is a significant setback for women's rights.\n\n## Health and education\n\nThe decision has significant implications for healthcare providers and educators, particularly those focused on reproductive health. Many healthcare providers and educators have expressed concerns about the impact of the decision, particularly on access to safe and legal abortion care.\n\n## International\n\nThe decision has significant implications for international organizations and governments, particularly those focused on reproductive rights and women's health. Many international organizations have expressed opposition to the decision, arguing that it is a significant setback for global reproductive rights.\n\n## News organizations\n\nMany news organizations have expressed concerns about the impact of the decision, particularly on reproductive rights and access to healthcare.\n\n## Public\n\nThe decision has sparked widespread public debate and protest, particularly among those concerned about reproductive rights and women's health.\n\n## Corporate and celebrity\n\nMany corporations and celebrities have expressed opposition to the decision, particularly those with strong views on reproductive rights. These corporations and celebrities often argue that the decision is a significant setback for women's rights and reproductive freedom.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Cultural and political effects\n\nThe decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is likely to have significant cultural and political effects, particularly on reproductive rights and women's health. The decision may also have significant implications for other social and cultural issues, including same-sex marriage and contraception.\n\n## Medical and sociological effects\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant medical and sociological effects, particularly on access to safe and legal abortion care.

The protests began as a response to the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports, but eventually grew to encompass a broader range of grievances against the government.\n\n#Background\n\n##Protest goals\n\nThe initial goals of the protest were to oppose the Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports, which protesters argued were an infringement on their individual freedoms. However, as the protests grew in size and scope, they began to encompass a broader range of grievances against the government, including opposition to lockdowns, mask mandates, and other public health measures.\n\n##Initial events and the start of the protest\n\nThe protest began on January 22, 2022, when a group of truckers and their supporters set out from Vancouver, British Columbia, bound for Ottawa, Ontario. The convoy was organized in response to the Canadian government's announcement that it would require all truckers crossing the US-Canada border to be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n###American influence\n\nThe Canada convoy protest was influenced in part by the American trucking industry, which had been actively opposing vaccine mandates and other public health measures in the United States. Some American truckers and their supporters participated in the Canadian protests, and there were reports of American funding and logistical support for the convoy.\n\n###Fundraising\n\nThe convoy was funded in part through a GoFundMe campaign, which raised over $10 million in donations from supporters. However, the campaign was later shut down by GoFundMe, which cited concerns about the potential misuse of funds.\n\n###Donor list hacked\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that the donor list for the convoy's GoFundMe campaign had been hacked, and that the names and contact information of donors had been leaked online. The leak raised concerns about the potential for harassment or intimidation of donors.\n\n##Vaccine mandates and passports\n\nThe Canadian government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were a major focus of the protests. The government had implemented a series of measures aimed at encouraging vaccination, including requirements for vaccination in certain workplaces and industries.\n\n###Vaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\n\nOne of the key triggers for the protest was the Canadian government's announcement that it would require all truckers crossing the US-Canada border to be vaccinated against COVID-19. This requirement was seen as an infringement on the rights of unvaccinated truckers, who argued that they should be able to continue working without being forced to get vaccinated.\n\n#Convoy to Ottawa\n\nThe convoy of truckers and their supporters traveled from Vancouver to Ottawa, a distance of over 4,000 kilometers. Along the way, they were greeted by supporters and protesters, and there were reports of clashes between the two groups.\n\n#Ottawa protest\n\nThe convoy arrived in Ottawa on January 28, 2022, and set up a protest camp in the city's downtown core. The protest quickly grew in size, with thousands of people participating.\n\n##Peak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\n\nAt its peak, the protest on Parliament Hill drew an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people, making it one of the largest protests in Canadian history.\n\n##Desecration and community harassment\n\nThere were reports of desecration of war memorials and community harassment during the protest. Protesters were accused of urinating on the National War Memorial and dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\n##Ottawa protests and entrenchment\n\nThe protest in Ottawa continued for several weeks, with protesters setting up a tent city in the city's downtown core. There were reports of clashes between protesters and police, and the city's residents began to feel the strain of the ongoing protest.\n\n##After clearance\n\nAfter the protest was cleared by police, there were reports of damage to property and infrastructure. The city's residents began the process of cleaning up and rebuilding.\n\n#Major blockades\n\nIn addition to the protest in Ottawa, there were several major blockades at border crossings across Canada.\n\n##Alberta–Montana\n\nOne of the most significant blockades took place at the Coutts, Alberta-Sweetgrass, Montana border crossing. The blockade, which was set up by a group of truckers and their supporters, blocked the movement of goods and people across the border.\n\n##Ontario–Michigan\n\nThere was also a blockade at the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Windsor, Ontario to Detroit, Michigan. The blockade, which was set up by a group of truckers and their supporters, blocked the movement of goods and people across the border.\n\n#Participants and response\n\n##Groups\n\nThe protest was supported by a range of groups, including truckers, farmers, and small business owners. There were also reports of support from far-right and anti-vaccine groups.\n\n##Counter-protests\n\nThere were several counter-protests against the convoy, including a protest in Ottawa that drew several hundred people.\n\n##Ottawa Police Service response\n\nThe Ottawa Police Service (OPS) was criticized for its handling of the protest. The OPS was accused of being too lenient with protesters, and of failing to take adequate action to address the ongoing disruption.\n\n##Integrated Command Centre response\n\nThe Integrated Command Centre (ICC) was established to coordinate the response to the protest. The ICC included representatives from the OPS, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and other agencies.\n\n###Clearance\n\nThe ICC played a key role in the clearance of the protest, which took place on February 18-19, 2022. The clearance operation involved the use of police force, including riot control measures and arrests.\n\n##Municipal response\n\nThe City of Ottawa was criticized for its response to the protest, which was seen as inadequate by many residents. The city's mayor, Jim Watson, was accused of failing to take adequate action to address the ongoing disruption.\n\n##Provincial response\n\nThe Province of Ontario was also criticized for its response to the protest. The provincial government was accused of failing to provide adequate support to the City of Ottawa, and of failing to take adequate action to address the ongoing disruption.\n\n##Federal response\n\nThe federal government was criticized for its response to the protest, which was seen as inadequate by many Canadians. The government was accused of failing to take adequate action to address the ongoing disruption, and of failing to provide adequate support to the City of Ottawa.\n\n###Emergencies Act\n\nThe federal government invoked the Emergencies Act on February 14, 2022, in response to the ongoing protest. The act gave the government sweeping powers to address the disruption, including the ability to regulate the movement of goods and people.\n\n#Related events\n\n##Other border crossing obstructions\n\nIn addition to the blockades at Coutts, Alberta-Sweetgrass, Montana and the Ambassador Bridge, there were several other border crossing obstructions across Canada.\n\n###British Columbia–Washington\n\nThere was a blockade at the Pacific Highway border crossing in Surrey, British Columbia.\n\n###Manitoba–North Dakota\n\nThere was a blockade at the Emerson, Manitoba-Pembina, North Dakota border crossing.\n\n##Other Canadian protests\n\nThere were several other protests across Canada, including in Toronto, Winnipeg, Fredericton, Nova Scotia, and Edmonton.\n\n###Toronto\n\nThere was a protest in Toronto that drew several hundred people.\n\n###Winnipeg\n\nThere was a protest in Winnipeg that drew several hundred people.\n\n###Fredericton\n\nThere was a protest in Fredericton that drew several hundred people.\n\n###Nova Scotia\n\nThere was a protest in Nova Scotia that drew several hundred people.\n\n###Edmonton\n\nThere was a protest in Edmonton that drew several hundred people.\n\n###Other\n\nThere were several other protests across Canada, including in smaller towns and cities.\n\n##International protests\n\nThere were several international protests in support of the Canada convoy protest, including in the United States, Australia, and Europe.\n\n##Rolling Thunder Ottawa\n\nThe Rolling Thunder Ottawa protest was a motorcycle convoy that took place in Ottawa in April 2022.

Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, Amis is the son of Kingsley Amis, a prominent novelist and poet, and Hilary Ann Bardwell. His literary career spans over four decades, during which he has written numerous novels, short stories, essays, and screenplays that have garnered both critical acclaim and controversy.\n\n# Early life\n\nAmis spent his early years in Oxford, where his father was a fellow at St. John's College. He was the second of three children, and his family moved frequently during his childhood, living in various parts of England and Wales. Amis's relationship with his father was complex and often tumultuous, marked by periods of estrangement and reconciliation. Kingsley Amis's influence on his son's writing style and literary ambitions is undeniable, however, and Martin Amis has often acknowledged the debt he owes to his father's literary legacy.\n\n# Early writing\n\nAmis's first novel, \"The Rachel Papers,\" was published in 1973, when he was just 24 years old. The book's success was immediate, and it established Amis as a rising star in the British literary scene. Over the next decade, Amis published several more novels, including \"Dead Babies\" (1975) and \"Success\" (1978), which cemented his reputation as a bold and innovative writer. His early work often explored themes of youth culture, social class, and the fragmentation of modern identity.\n\n# Main career\n\n## 1980s and 1990s\n\nThe 1980s saw Amis's career take off with the publication of \"Money: A Suicide Note\" (1984), a novel that explored the excesses of 1980s capitalism and the disintegration of social norms. The book's success was followed by \"London Fields\" (1989), a postmodern epic that defied genre conventions and cemented Amis's reputation as a literary provocateur. The 1990s saw the publication of \"Time's Arrow\" (1991), a novel that reimagined the life of a Nazi doctor, and \"The Information\" (1995), a sprawling narrative that explored the intersection of technology and human consciousness.\n\n## 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Amis continued to push the boundaries of literary fiction with the publication of \"Experience\" (2000), a memoir that explored his relationship with his father and his own literary ambitions. \"Yellow Dog\" (2003) and \"House of Meetings\" (2006) followed, the latter of which explored the intersection of politics and personal identity in post-Soviet Russia. \"The Pregnant Widow\" (2010) marked a new direction in Amis's work, exploring themes of love, identity, and the decline of Western civilization.\n\n## 2010s and 2020s\n\nIn the 2010s, Amis published several more novels, including \"Lionel Asbo: State of England\" (2012), a satire of modern Britain, and \"The Zone of Interest\" (2014), a novel that reimagined the life of a Nazi officer. \"The Rub of Time\" (2017) marked a new direction in Amis's work, exploring themes of mortality, identity, and the decline of Western civilization. \"Inside Story\" (2020) followed, a novel that explored the intersection of politics, culture, and personal identity in the post-9/11 world.\n\n## Other work\n\nIn addition to his novels, Amis has published numerous short stories, essays, and screenplays. His non-fiction work includes \"The War Against Cliché\" (2001), a collection of essays on literature and culture, and \"The Second Plane\" (2008), a collection of essays on politics and terrorism.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The shortage had significant effects on families with infants, including the sale and donation of breast milk, the use of alternative foods, hospitalizations, and the use of bots to purchase formula online. The shortage also led to a shortage in Canada and sparked a national conversation about the breast milk vs. formula debate and the federal response to the crisis.\n\n# Causes\n\n## Supply chain issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the global supply chain, leading to shortages and delays in the delivery of goods, including infant formula. The pandemic caused a surge in demand for infant formula, as many parents stockpiled the product in anticipation of future shortages. This surge in demand, combined with the existing supply chain issues, led to a shortage of infant formula in the United States.\n\n## Recall and plant shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Laboratories, one of the largest manufacturers of infant formula in the United States, issued a voluntary recall of certain types of formula due to concerns about contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacterium that can cause serious illness in infants. The recall led to a shutdown of Abbott's plant in Sturgis, Michigan, which was the largest infant formula manufacturing plant in the United States.\n\n### Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n\nThe shutdown of the Sturgis plant was not the first time that the facility had faced issues. In 2019, the FDA had issued a warning letter to Abbott about alleged problems at the plant, including the presence of Cronobacter sakazakii in the facility and inadequate cleaning and sanitation procedures. The warning letter also noted that the plant had failed to properly investigate and address complaints about the quality of its products.\n\n## Import restrictions\n\nThe United States has strict regulations on the importation of infant formula, which made it difficult for manufacturers to import formula from other countries to meet the demand. The regulations require that imported formula meet the same safety and nutritional standards as formula manufactured in the United States, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n## Market concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with only a few major manufacturers, including Abbott, Mead Johnson, and Gerber. This concentration can make it difficult for new manufacturers to enter the market and can limit the availability of formula in times of shortage.\n\n# Effects\n\n## Sale and donation of breast milk\n\nThe shortage of infant formula led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk, as some parents sought alternative sources of nutrition for their infants. Online marketplaces for breast milk saw a surge in activity, with some sellers offering breast milk for as much as $1 per ounce.\n\n## Use of alternative foods\n\nSome parents also turned to alternative foods, such as goat's milk or oat milk, as a substitute for infant formula. However, these alternatives may not provide the same nutritional benefits as formula, and their use can be problematic for infants with certain health conditions.\n\n## Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage of infant formula led to an increase in hospitalizations, as some infants became dehydrated or malnourished due to lack of access to formula. In some cases, infants were hospitalized for several days or even weeks, which can be costly and traumatic for families.\n\n## Bot usage\n\nThe shortage of infant formula also led to an increase in the use of bots to purchase formula online. Bots are computer programs that can quickly purchase large quantities of products online, which can make it difficult for human shoppers to access the products they need.\n\n## Shortage in Canada\n\nThe shortage of infant formula in the United States also had an impact on Canada, where many families rely on imports from the United States to meet their needs. The shortage led to a shortage of formula in Canada, particularly in rural areas where access to formula can be limited.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Efforts to prevent price gouging\n\nIn response to the shortage, some states and cities implemented measures to prevent price gouging, such as limits on the amount of formula that can be purchased at one time or restrictions on the resale of formula online.\n\n## Efforts to increase supply\n\nThe federal government also took steps to increase the supply of infant formula, including allowing the importation of formula from other countries and working with manufacturers to increase production.\n\n## Efforts to restore production\n\nAbbott Laboratories worked to restore production at its Sturgis plant, which involved addressing the concerns raised by the FDA and implementing new safety protocols.\n\n## Investigations\n\n### Congressional investigation\n\nThe U.S. Congress launched an investigation into the shortage of infant formula, which included hearings and the collection of documents from manufacturers and government agencies.\n\n### FDA investigation\n\nThe FDA also launched an investigation into the shortage, which focused on the agency's own response to the crisis and the adequacy of its regulations and guidelines.\n\n### ABC News investigation\n\nABC News conducted an investigation into the shortage, which included a review of documents and interviews with industry insiders.\n\n### DOJ investigation\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice also launched an investigation into the shortage, which focused on potential antitrust violations by manufacturers.\n\n# Commentary\n\n## Breast milk vs. formula debate\n\nThe shortage of infant formula sparked a national conversation about the breast milk vs. formula debate, with some advocates arguing that breast milk is the best option for infants and others arguing that formula is a necessary and safe alternative.\n\n## Criticism of federal response\n\nThe federal response to the shortage was criticized by some, who argued that the government did not act quickly enough to address the crisis and that its efforts were inadequate.\n\n### White House response\n\nThe White House was criticized for its response to the shortage, which some argued was slow and inadequate. The administration was accused of not doing enough to address the shortage and of failing to provide adequate support to families affected by the crisis.\n\n### Formula availability at the Southern border\n\nThe shortage of infant formula also raised concerns about the availability of formula at the Southern border, where many migrant families rely on formula to feed their infants. Some advocates argued that the government was not doing enough to ensure that formula was available to these families, who may not have access to other sources of nutrition.\n\n# See also\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* Cronobacter sakazakii\n* FDA\n* Abbott Laboratories\n* Mead Johnson\n* Gerber\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* Supply chain\n* Market concentration\n* Antitrust law\n* Price gouging\n* Bot\n* Online marketplace", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The crisis was marked by a military coup, widespread demonstrations, and a severe humanitarian situation.\n\n# Background\n\n## ECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) played a significant role in the Nigerien crisis. As a regional economic community, ECOWAS has a mandate to promote peace, stability, and democracy in its member states. In the months leading up to the crisis, ECOWAS had been involved in efforts to resolve a simmering dispute between the Nigerien government and the opposition.\n\n## Security situation\n\nNiger has long faced significant security challenges, including the threat of terrorism and banditry. The country is located in the Sahel region, which has been plagued by instability and violence in recent years. The security situation in Niger had deteriorated in the months leading up to the crisis, with frequent attacks by extremist groups and a growing sense of insecurity among the population.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## July\n\n### 29 July\n\nOn July 29, 2023, a group of military officers announced that they had seized power in Niger, overthrowing the democratically-elected government of President Mohamed Bazoum. The coup leaders, who called themselves the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland (CNSP), claimed that they had acted to prevent a collapse of the state and to restore stability to the country.\n\n### 30 July\n\n#### ECOWAS ultimatum and sanctions\n\nIn response to the coup, ECOWAS issued an ultimatum to the CNSP, demanding that they restore the democratically-elected government and respect the country's constitution. The regional body also imposed sanctions on Niger, including the closure of borders and the suspension of economic aid.\n\n#### Pro-coup demonstrations in Niamey\n\nDespite the international condemnation, thousands of people took to the streets of Niamey, the capital city, to demonstrate in support of the coup. The protesters, who were largely young and unemployed, called for the CNSP to remain in power and to implement reforms to address the country's economic and social challenges.\n\n### 31 July\n\nThe CNSP announced the formation of a new government, with General Abdourahamane Tchiani as the head of state. The new government was composed largely of military officers and technocrats, and was seen as a attempt to consolidate power and legitimacy.\n\n## August\n\n### 1 August\n\nThe CNSP announced a nationwide curfew, citing the need to maintain order and stability. The curfew was enforced by the military, and was seen as a attempt to suppress opposition and dissent.\n\n### 2 August\n\nA group of opposition leaders announced the formation of a new coalition, which they called the Front for the Restoration of Democracy (FRD).

Born with a natural talent for swimming, Young's career was marked by numerous achievements, including his historic swim across the Catalina Channel, which earned him widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\n# Early swimming achievements\n\nYoung's introduction to competitive swimming began at a young age, and he quickly demonstrated a natural aptitude for the sport. His early swimming achievements laid the foundation for his future success, and he soon became known as one of the top young swimmers in Canada.\n\n## Catalina swim training\n\nIn 1926, Young traveled to California to train for his most ambitious swim to date: crossing the Catalina Channel. The Catalina Channel, which separates Catalina Island from the mainland, is a notoriously challenging swim due to strong currents, cold water, and an abundance of marine life. Young spent several weeks training in the channel, building up his endurance and acclimating himself to the conditions.\n\n# Catalina channel swim\n\nOn January 15, 1927, Young became the first person to swim across the Catalina Channel, completing the 20.2-mile swim in 15 hours and 44 minutes. This remarkable achievement catapulted Young to international fame, and he was hailed as a swimming sensation.\n\n## Swam with tides\n\nYoung's strategy for crossing the channel involved swimming with the tides, which he had carefully studied during his training period. By timing his swim to coincide with the changing tides, Young was able to maximize his progress and conserve his energy.\n\n## Competition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's achievement was soon overshadowed by Norman Ross, an American swimmer who attempted to break Young's record in 1928. Ross completed the swim in 13 hours and 14 minutes, beating Young's time by over 2 hours. The rivalry between Young and Ross sparked a series of high-profile swims, with each athlete attempting to outdo the other.\n\n## Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nDespite his fame, Young struggled to capitalize on his achievement financially. He received limited compensation for his swims, and his fame did not translate into significant wealth. Nevertheless, Young continued to compete, driven by his passion for swimming and his desire to push himself to new limits.\n\n# Inconsistent swimming career\n\nYoung's swimming career was marked by inconsistency, with periods of high achievement followed by stretches of relative inactivity.\n\n## 1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young attempted to swim 21 miles across Lake Ontario, but was forced to abandon the swim due to strong winds and rough water.\n\n## 1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young successfully completed a 15-mile swim across Lake Ontario, setting a new record for the distance.\n\n## Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young won the Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a 20-mile swim held in the St. Lawrence River.\n\n## 1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young repeated his 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, setting a new record for the distance.\n\n## 1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young again completed the 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, solidifying his reputation as one of the top long-distance swimmers of his era.\n\n## Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young won the Lake Ontario swim, capping off a successful period in his career.\n\n## Late swim career\n\nAs the 1930s drew to a close, Young began to slow down, and his swimming career gradually came to an end. He continued to participate in occasional swims, but his focus shifted towards other pursuits.\n\n# Swim retirement and marriage\n\nYoung officially retired from competitive swimming in the early 1940s, and soon after, he married his first wife.\n\n## Marriages\n\nYoung was married twice, first to a woman named Ethel, and later to a woman named Margaret. Both marriages were long-lasting, and Young remained devoted to his wives throughout his life.\n\n# Late professional life\n\nAfter his retirement from swimming, Young went on to pursue a successful career in business, working as a salesman and later as a manager for a manufacturing company.\n\n# Honors\n\nYoung's contributions to the sport of swimming were recognized with numerous honors, including his induction into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1975.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of long-distance swims\n* Catalina Channel\n* Norman Ross\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, this article does not include any citations or references.

The team won several premierships, including a hat-trick of titles in the 1980s.\n* Temora: Temora was a successful club that won several premierships during its time in the league. The team was known for its strong midfield and potent forward line.\n\n#Football Grand Finals\n\nThe Central Riverina Football League Grand Final was the premier event on the league's calendar.

The acquisition process was complex and involved several twists and turns, ultimately resulting in Musk's successful purchase of the company.\n\n# Prelude\n\n## Background\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, had established itself as a prominent social media platform, known for its real-time information sharing and short-form content. However, the company had faced challenges in recent years, including stagnant user growth, increased competition from other social media platforms, and concerns over content moderation and online safety.\n\nElon Musk, a successful entrepreneur and business magnate, had been an active user of Twitter, using the platform to share updates about his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla. Musk had also been a vocal critic of Twitter's moderation policies and had suggested that he might consider buying the company.\n\n## Early developments\n\nIn January 2022, Musk began purchasing Twitter shares, eventually acquiring a 9.2% stake in the company. This move sparked speculation that Musk might be planning a takeover bid. Twitter's board of directors responded by adopting a \"poison pill\" defense, aimed at preventing Musk from acquiring more than 15% of the company's shares.\n\n# Buyout offer\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk made a formal offer to acquire Twitter for $54.20 per share, valuing the company at approximately $43 billion. Musk's offer was conditional on the company's board of directors accepting the bid and on the completion of due diligence.\n\nTwitter's board of directors responded by saying that they would carefully consider Musk's offer, but also emphasized that the company had a \"fiduciary duty\" to maximize shareholder value.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Twitter's board of directors announced that they had accepted Musk's offer, and the company would be acquired by Musk for $54.20 per share. The acquisition was subject to shareholder approval and regulatory clearance.\n\n# Attempted termination\n\n## Alleged hold\n\nIn May 2022, Musk announced that he was putting the acquisition on hold, citing concerns over the number of fake accounts on the platform. Musk claimed that Twitter had not provided him with sufficient information about the issue, and that he needed more time to investigate.\n\n## Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n\nOn July 8, 2022, Musk announced that he was withdrawing his offer to acquire Twitter, citing the company's failure to provide him with sufficient information about fake accounts. Twitter responded by saying that Musk's withdrawal was not valid, and that the company would take legal action to enforce the acquisition agreement.\n\n# Revival and closing\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nOn October 4, 2022, Musk announced that he was reviving his bid to acquire Twitter, and that he would proceed with the acquisition at the original price of $54.20 per share. Twitter's board of directors accepted Musk's revised offer, and the acquisition was completed on October 27, 2022.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by Musk marked a significant change in ownership and direction for the company. Musk became the sole owner of Twitter, and the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n## Post-acquisition\n\nAfter completing the acquisition, Musk announced that he would make significant changes to Twitter, including relaxing content moderation policies and introducing new features. Musk also announced that he would reduce Twitter's workforce, citing the need to cut costs and improve efficiency.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## Takeover bid\n\nThe announcement of Musk's takeover bid was met with a mixed reaction from investors and users. Some investors welcomed the bid, seeing it as an opportunity to realize value, while others expressed concerns about Musk's plans for the company.\n\n## Acquisition announcement\n\nThe announcement of the acquisition agreement was met with a more positive reaction, with some investors and users welcoming the prospect of Musk's ownership.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement was met with criticism from Twitter's board of directors and some investors, who argued that Musk was trying to back out of the deal.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the acquisition was met with a mixed reaction, with some investors and users welcoming Musk's ownership, while others expressed concerns about the implications for the company and its users.\n\n# Critical analysis\n\n## Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n\nMusk's takeover bid and the acquisition announcement were seen as a significant development in the technology industry, marking a major change in ownership and direction for Twitter. However, some analysts expressed concerns about Musk's plans for the company, citing his track record of making bold promises and his tendency to prioritize his own interests.\n\n## Attempted termination\n\nMusk's attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement was seen as a calculated move, aimed at negotiating a better deal or extracting concessions from Twitter's board of directors. However, the move was also seen as a sign of Musk's willingness to take risks and challenge conventional wisdom.\n\n## Revitalization of bid\n\nMusk's decision to revive his bid to acquire Twitter was seen as a surprise move, given the earlier attempt to terminate the agreement. However, the move was also seen as a sign of Musk's commitment to acquiring the company, and his willingness to overcome obstacles.\n\n## Completion of purchase\n\nThe completion of the acquisition marked a significant milestone in the history of Twitter, and raised questions about the implications for the company and its users. Some analysts expressed concerns about Musk's plans for the company, citing the potential for increased polarization and the spread of misinformation.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk marked a significant development in the technology industry, and raised questions about the implications for the company and its users. The acquisition also highlighted the growing influence of technology entrepreneurs and the increasing importance of social media in shaping public discourse.\n\n# References\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk\" following this outline:\n\n#Prelude\n##Background\n##Early developments\n#Buyout offer\n##Takeover bid\n##Acquisition announcement\n#Attempted termination\n##Alleged hold\n##Attempted withdrawal by Musk\n#Revival and closing\n##Revitalization of bid\n##Completion of purchase\n##Post-acquisition\n#Reactions\n##Takeover bid\n##Acquisition announcement\n##Attempted termination\n##Completion of purchase\n#Critical analysis\n##Takeover bid and acquisition announcement\n##Attempted termination\n##Revitalization of bid\n##Completion of purchase\n#Legacy\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 23, 1940, in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Pelé's impact on the sport extends far beyond his impressive playing career. A three-time World Cup winner, Pelé's legacy has inspired generations of footballers, and his influence on the sport continues to be felt today.\n\n#Early years\n\nPelé was born to Dondinho, a footballer, and Celeste Arantes. He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison, but his parents added \"Arantes\" to his name to honor his father's friend. Growing up in a poor household, Pelé's early life was marked by hardship, but his love for football was evident from an early age. He would often play with a makeshift ball made of rags and socks, and his father would teach him the basics of the game.\n\nPelé's talent was recognized early, and he joined the local club, Bauru Athletic Club, at the age of 11. Two years later, he moved to Santos FC, where he would spend the majority of his club career. Pelé's early years were marked by rapid development, and he quickly became known for his exceptional speed, skill, and scoring ability.\n\n#Club career\n\n##Santos\n\n###1956–1962: early years with Santos and declared a national treasure\n\nPelé made his professional debut for Santos in 1956, at the age of 15. He quickly became a regular starter and helped the club win several state championships. In 1958, Pelé was declared a national treasure by the Brazilian government, prohibiting him from being sold to foreign clubs. This move was seen as a way to keep Pelé in Brazil and to promote the country's football league.\n\n###1962–1965: Copa Libertadores success\n\nIn 1962, Santos won the Copa Libertadores, South America's premier club competition. Pelé played a crucial role in the team's success, scoring several important goals throughout the tournament. This victory marked the beginning of Santos' dominance in South American football, and Pelé was at the forefront of the team's success.\n\n###1965–1974: O Milésimo and final years with Santos\n\nIn 1965, Pelé scored his 1,000th goal, known as O Milésimo, in a match against Vasco da Gama. This achievement cemented his status as one of the greatest goal-scorers of all time. Pelé continued to play for Santos until 1974, winning several more championships and individual awards.\n\n##Tours with Santos\n\nSantos FC embarked on several international tours during Pelé's time with the club. These tours helped to promote Brazilian football and to showcase Pelé's skills to a global audience. One notable tour took place in 1967, when Santos played against several top European clubs, including Real Madrid and Benfica.\n\n##New York Cosmos\n\nIn 1975, Pelé joined the New York Cosmos, a team in the North American Soccer League (NASL). He played for the Cosmos from 1975 to 1977, helping the team win the NASL championship in 1977. Pelé's move to the United States was seen as a way to promote football in the country and to bring attention to the NASL.\n\n#International career\n\n##1958 World Cup\n\nPelé made his international debut for Brazil in 1957, at the age of 16. He was included in the Brazilian squad for the 1958 World Cup, where he played a crucial role in the team's victory. Pelé scored six goals in the tournament, including two in the final against Sweden. Brazil won the World Cup with a 5-2 victory over Sweden, and Pelé was hailed as a national hero.\n\n##1959 South American Championship\n\nIn 1959, Brazil won the South American Championship, with Pelé scoring eight goals in the tournament. This victory marked Brazil's first major international trophy since the 1958 World Cup.\n\n##1962 World Cup\n\nPelé was injured during the 1962 World Cup, which limited his participation in the tournament. Brazil still managed to win the World Cup, defeating Czechoslovakia 3-1 in the final.\n\n##1966 World Cup\n\nPelé was again injured during the 1966 World Cup, and Brazil was eliminated in the group stage. This was a disappointing tournament for Brazil, and Pelé's injuries were seen as a major factor in the team's poor performance.\n\n##1970 World Cup\n\nPelé played in his final World Cup in 1970, where Brazil won the tournament for the third time. Pelé scored four goals in the tournament, including one in the final against Italy. Brazil won the World Cup with a 4-1 victory over Italy, and Pelé was hailed as a national hero once again.\n\n#Style of play\n\nPelé's style of play was characterized by his exceptional speed, skill, and scoring ability. He was a versatile player who could play anywhere on the field, from striker to midfielder. Pelé's vision and passing ability were also highly praised, and he was known for his ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Accolades\n\nPelé has received numerous accolades throughout his career, including three World Cup titles, two Copa Libertadores titles, and several individual awards. He was named the FIFA World Player of the Century in 1999, and he was included in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players in 2004.\n\n##\"Pelé Pact\" and Puma sponsorship\n\nIn 1970, Pelé signed a sponsorship deal with Puma, which marked the beginning of the \"Pelé Pact.\" This deal was seen as a way to promote football and to bring attention to the sport. Pelé's partnership with Puma has continued to this day, and he remains one of the company's most high-profile endorsers.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nPelé has been married three times and has five children. His first marriage was to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi, and they had two daughters together. Pelé's second marriage was to Assíria Lemos Seixas, and they had two sons together. Pelé's third marriage was to Xuxa Meneghel, a Brazilian singer and actress.\n\n##Politics\n\nPelé has been involved in politics throughout his career, and he has been a vocal supporter of several charitable causes. In 1994, Pelé was appointed as the Minister of Sports in Brazil, a position he held until 1998.\n\n##Religion\n\nPelé is a devout Catholic, and he has often spoken about the importance of his faith in his life. He has also been involved in several charitable initiatives, including the construction of a church in his hometown of Três Corações.\n\n##Health\n\nPelé has struggled with health issues throughout his life, including a series of injuries that limited his playing career. In 2014, Pelé was hospitalized for several days due to a urinary tract infection. He has also undergone several surgeries, including a hip replacement in 2012.\n\n#After football\n\nPelé retired from football in 1977, at the age of 36. He went on to become a successful businessman and entrepreneur, investing in several companies and charitable initiatives. Pelé has also remained involved in football, serving as a coach and a consultant for several teams.\n\n#Death and funeral\n\nPelé passed away on December 29, 2022, at the age of 82, after a long battle with colon cancer. His funeral was held on January 2, 2023, at the Santos FC stadium, and he was buried in the Ecumenical Memorial Necropolis in Santos, Brazil.\n\n#Career statistics\n\n##Club\n\n* Santos FC: 1956-1974 ( appearances: 636, goals: 643)\n* New York Cosmos: 1975-1977 ( appearances: 63, goals: 31)\n\n##International\n\n* Brazil: 1957-1971 ( appearances: 92, goals: 77)\n\n#Honours\n\n* World Cup: 1958, 1962, 1970\n* Copa Libertadores: 1962, 1963\n* Intercontinental Cup: 1962, 1963\n* South American Championship: 1959\n* NASL Championship: 1977\n\n#Filmography\n\n* Escape to Victory (1981)\n* Pelé (1977)\n* A Minor Miracle (1983)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of FIFA World Cup winning captains\n* List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks\n* List of most capped Brazilian football players\n\n#Notes\n\n* Pelé's exact number of goals is disputed, with some sources claiming he scored over 1,000 goals in his career.\n\n#References\n\n* ( none )\n\n#Bibliography\n\n* Pelé, My Life and the Beautiful Game (1977)\n* Pelé, Why Soccer Matters (2014)\n\n#External links\n\n* Pelé's official website\n* FIFA's official website\n* Santos FC's official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pelé\" following this outline:\n\n#Early years\n#Club career\n##Santos\n###1956–1962: early years with Santos and declared a national treasure\n###1962–1965: Copa Libertadores success\n###1965–1974: O Milésimo and final years with Santos\n##Tours with Santos\n##New York Cosmos\n#International career\n##1958 World Cup\n##1959 South American Championship\n##1962 World Cup\n##1966 World Cup\n##1970 World Cup\n#Style of play\n#Legacy\n##Accolades\n##\"Pelé Pact\" and Puma sponsorship\n#Personal life\n##Relationships and children\n##Politics\n##Religion\n##Health\n#After football\n#Death and funeral\n#Career statistics\n##Club\n##International\n#Honours\n#Filmography\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 film Avatar, which became the highest-grossing film of all time. The film takes place 13 years after the events of the first film and follows Jake Sully, Neytiri, and their family as they navigate the dangers of Pandora and the return of human threats.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film begins with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) living in the forest of Pandora with their children, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Tuktirey (Trinity Bliss), and adopted son Spider (Jack Champion), a human boy who was left behind during the human evacuation of Pandora. The family is struggling to maintain their way of life as the human threat, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), returns to the planet.\n\nQuaritch, who has been resurrected in a genetically engineered Na'vi body called a \"Recombinant,\" seeks revenge against Jake and the Na'vi for his past defeat. The Sully family is forced to flee their home and seek refuge with the Metkayina clan, a group of Na'vi who live in the oceanic reefs of Pandora.\n\nThe Metkayina are led by Tonowari (Cliff Curtis) and his wife, Ronal (Kate Winslet), who are hesitant to trust the Sully family. However, they eventually form a bond with the family, particularly with Lo'ak, who forms a connection with a tulkun, a massive sea creature that is revered by the Metkayina.\n\nAs the Sully family navigates their new life with the Metkayina, they must also confront the human threat, which is led by Quaritch and his team of recombinants. The film's climax features an epic battle between the Na'vi and the humans, with the Sully family fighting to protect their new home and way of life.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a diverse cast, including:\n\n* Sam Worthington as Jake Sully\n* Zoe Saldana as Neytiri\n* Sigourney Weaver as Kiri, the adopted daughter of Jake and Neytiri\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch\n* Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the leader of the Metkayina clan\n* Kate Winslet as Ronal, the wife of Tonowari\n* Jamie Flatters as Neteyam, the son of Jake and Neytiri\n* Britain Dalton as Lo'ak, the son of Jake and Neytiri\n* Trinity Bliss as Tuktirey, the daughter of Jake and Neytiri\n* Jack Champion as Spider, the adopted son of Jake and Neytiri\n* Joel David Moore as Norm Spellman\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at\n* Edie Falco as General Ardmore\n* Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby\n* Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin\n\n# Themes and analysis\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water explores several themes, including the clash between technology and nature, the importance of family and community, and the struggle for identity and belonging.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the Na'vi and their connection to nature serves as a commentary on the impact of human technology on the environment. The Na'vi's deep connection to the natural world is contrasted with the humans' exploitative and destructive relationship with the environment.\n\nThe film also explores the theme of family and community, particularly through the Sully family's journey. The family's struggles to maintain their way of life and their relationships with each other serve as a reminder of the importance of family and community in times of adversity.\n\nThe character of Lo'ak, who forms a connection with a tulkun, serves as a symbol of the struggle for identity and belonging. Lo'ak's journey is a metaphor for the search for one's place in the world and the need to find acceptance and belonging.\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was first announced in 2010, shortly after the release of the first film. James Cameron had planned to make a sequel to Avatar, but the project was delayed due to the development of new technology and the production of other films.\n\nIn 2016, Cameron announced that he would be making four sequels to Avatar, with the first sequel scheduled for release in 2018. However, the release date was later pushed back to 2022 due to production delays.\n\n## Writing\n\nThe screenplay for Avatar: The Way of Water was written by James Cameron, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver. The script was developed over several years, with Cameron working closely with Jaffa and Silver to develop the story and characters.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe cast of Avatar: The Way of Water includes several actors from the original film, including Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.

The company used advanced technology, including motion capture and 3D printing, to create the film's elaborate visual effects.\n\n## Runtime\n\nThe runtime of Avatar: The Way of Water is 3 hours and 12 minutes, making it one of the longest films of 2022.\n\n# Music\n\nThe score for Avatar: The Way of Water was composed by Simon Franglen, who worked closely with James Cameron to develop the film's music.\n\nThe score features a combination of orchestral and choral elements, including music performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Avatar: The Way of Water was launched in 2022, with the release of several trailers and promotional materials.\n\nThe campaign included a series of social media promotions, as well as partnerships with several brands, including McDonald's and Coca-Cola.\n\n# Release\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was released in theaters on December 16, 2022, in several countries, including the United States, China, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film is expected to be released on home media, including DVD and Blu-ray, in 2023.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water was a major commercial success, grossing over $2 billion at the box office worldwide.\n\n### United States and Canada\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $600 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 2022.\n\n### China\n\nIn China, the film grossed over $200 million, making it one of the highest-grossing foreign films of 2022.\n\n### Other territories\n\nIn other territories, the film grossed over $1 billion, making it a major commercial success worldwide.\n\n## Critical response\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's visual effects, performances, and themes.\n\nThe film holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 400 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\n## Accolades\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water received several awards and nominations, including several Academy Award nominations.\n\n# Sequels\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water is the first of four planned sequels to Avatar.

The acts aimed to prevent mutinies, maintain order, and provide for the quartering of soldiers during peacetime. The Mutiny Acts played a crucial role in shaping the relationship between the military and civil authorities in the UK and its colonial territories.\n\n#Background\n\nPrior to the Mutiny Acts, the English army was governed by a mix of customary laws, royal prerogatives, and parliamentary statutes. The lack of a clear and comprehensive framework often led to disputes between military commanders, soldiers, and civil authorities. The need for a more systematic and codified approach to military discipline became increasingly pressing, particularly after the English Civil War. The Mutiny Acts were a response to these challenges, aiming to establish a clear and consistent framework for military governance.\n\n#Passage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, following the Glorious Revolution. The act was designed to address the pressing issue of military discipline and to provide for the quartering of soldiers. The act established a clear framework for military justice, outlining punishments for various offenses, including mutiny, desertion, and disobedience. The act also provided for the appointment of military courts-martial to try soldiers accused of these offenses.\n\n#Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nInitially, the Mutiny Act was intended as a temporary measure, but it was renewed annually by subsequent parliaments. This practice continued for over a century, with each renewal introducing minor amendments and adjustments to the original act. The Mutiny Acts were frequently updated to reflect changing circumstances, including the expansion of the British Empire and the growth of the military.\n\n#The Quartering Acts\n\nIn addition to regulating military discipline, the Mutiny Acts also addressed the issue of quartering soldiers. The Quartering Acts, passed in 1765 and 1774, allowed British soldiers to be quartered in the homes of American colonists, leading to widespread resentment and contributing to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The Quartering Acts were a direct result of the Mutiny Acts, highlighting the complex and often contentious relationship between military and civil authorities.\n\n#List\n\n##England\n\n* 1689: The first Mutiny Act is passed, establishing a framework for military justice and providing for the quartering of soldiers.\n* 1696: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing minor amendments and adjustments to the original act.\n\n##Great Britain\n\n* 1706: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growth of the British military and the expansion of the Empire.\n* 1716: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of mutiny and desertion.\n* 1729: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n##United Kingdom\n\n###1800s\n\n* 1803: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the Napoleonic Wars.\n* 1806: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of treason and sedition.\n* 1812: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including mutiny and desertion.\n\n###1810s\n\n* 1815: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the reorganization of the British military.\n* 1817: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of riot and tumult.\n* 1819: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n###1820s\n\n* 1822: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1825: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of mutiny and desertion.\n* 1827: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n###1830s\n\n* 1831: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1834: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of treason and sedition.\n* 1837: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including mutiny and desertion.\n\n###1840s\n\n* 1842: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1845: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of riot and tumult.\n* 1848: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n###1850s\n\n* 1851: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1854: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of mutiny and desertion.\n* 1857: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n###1860s\n\n* 1861: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1864: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of treason and sedition.\n* 1867: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including mutiny and desertion.\n\n###1870s\n\n* 1871: The Mutiny Act is renewed, reflecting the growing demands of the British Empire.\n* 1874: The Mutiny Act is amended to include provisions for the trial of soldiers accused of riot and tumult.\n* 1877: The Mutiny Act is renewed, introducing new punishments for various offenses, including disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\n#Marine Mutiny Acts\n\nIn addition to the Mutiny Acts, the British parliament also passed a series of Marine Mutiny Acts, specifically designed to regulate the discipline and maintenance of the Royal Navy.

As the system interacted with a moist and unstable airmass, a line of thunderstorms developed across eastern Texas and western Oklahoma. The storms quickly became severe, producing multiple tornadoes as they moved east.\n\nThe tornado outbreak was fueled by a combination of factors, including strong wind shear, high instability, and a strong low-level jet. The storms were able to tap into the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, allowing them to strengthen and produce large hail and damaging winds.\n\nAs the outbreak continued into the night, the storms began to weaken, but not before producing several more tornadoes. The last tornado of the outbreak touched down in eastern Oklahoma shortly after midnight on November 5.\n\n# Confirmed tornadoes\n\nA total of 15 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority of them touching down in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n## November 4 event\n\nThe first tornado of the outbreak touched down in eastern Texas at 2:45 PM CST.

The tornado caused extensive damage to homes and businesses, and injured several people.\n\n## November 5 event\n\nThe outbreak continued into the night, with multiple tornadoes touching down across eastern Oklahoma. One of the most significant tornadoes of the night was an EF2 that touched down in the town of Idabel, Oklahoma. The tornado caused significant damage to homes and businesses, and injured several people.\n\n## Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the outbreak was an EF3 that touched down in eastern Texas at 4:15 PM CST. The tornado, which was on the ground for over 30 miles, caused extensive damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Brookston, Caviness, and Midcity. The tornado then crossed into Oklahoma, where it caused significant damage to the town of Sawyer.\n\n## Bogota–Clarksville–Acworth, Texas/Idabel–Broken Bow–Eagletown, Oklahoma\n\nAnother significant tornado touched down in eastern Texas at 5:30 PM CST. The tornado, which was rated EF2, caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Bogota, Clarksville, and Acworth. The tornado then crossed into Oklahoma, where it caused extensive damage to the towns of Idabel, Broken Bow, and Eagletown.\n\n## Cason–Naples, Texas\n\nAn EF1 tornado touched down in eastern Texas at 6:45 PM CST. The tornado, which was on the ground for over 10 miles, caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Cason and Naples.\n\n## Simms–New Boston, Texas\n\nThe last tornado of the outbreak touched down in eastern Texas at 9:15 PM CST. The tornado, which was rated EF1, caused significant damage to homes and businesses in the towns of Simms and New Boston.\n\n# Non-tornadic effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the outbreak also produced large hail and damaging winds. The largest hail report was 2 inches in diameter, which was reported in the town of Idabel, Oklahoma. The strongest wind gust was 70 mph, which was reported in the town of Arthur City, Texas.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe tornado outbreak had a significant impact on the affected areas. Multiple homes and businesses were destroyed, and several people were injured. The outbreak also caused significant disruptions to transportation and communication services.\n\nThe economic impact of the outbreak was also significant.

He is best known for publishing the first newspaper in the colony, the North Carolina Gazette, and for his involvement in the Regulator Movement. Davis's life and career were marked by controversy, innovation, and a commitment to public service.\n\nEarly and Family Life\n---------------------\n\nJames Davis was born in 1721 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a family of modest means. His father was a merchant, and his mother was a homemaker. Davis received a basic education, but it is unclear if he attended college. In 1745, he married Elizabeth Ashe, the daughter of a prominent North Carolina family. The couple had several children together, including a son who would later follow in his father's footsteps as a printer.\n\nPrinting Career\n----------------\n\nDavis's printing career began in the 1740s, when he worked as an apprentice to a printer in Philadelphia. In 1749, he moved to New Bern, North Carolina, where he established his own printing business. Davis's shop quickly became a hub of activity, producing books, pamphlets, and newspapers for the growing colony.\n\n### North Carolina Gazette\n\nIn 1751, Davis began publishing the North Carolina Gazette, the first newspaper in the colony. The Gazette was a weekly publication that covered news from around the world, as well as local events and announcements. Davis's newspaper was an instant success, and it quickly became a vital source of information for the people of North Carolina.\n\nThe Gazette was known for its editorial content, which often reflected Davis's own views on politics and social issues. He was a strong advocate for colonial rights and was critical of British taxation policies. Davis's editorials often sparked controversy, but they also helped to shape public opinion in the colony.\n\n### The North Carolina Magazine\n\nIn addition to the Gazette, Davis published The North Carolina Magazine, a literary and scientific journal that featured articles on a wide range of topics. The Magazine was aimed at a more educated audience and included contributions from some of the leading thinkers of the day.\n\n### Counterfeiting Allegations\n\nIn 1768, Davis was accused of counterfeiting, a serious crime that carried severe penalties. The allegations were made by a group of rival printers, who claimed that Davis had produced fake currency to fund his printing business. Davis denied the charges, but he was arrested and held in jail for several months.\n\nThe counterfeiting allegations damaged Davis's reputation, but they did not end his career. He continued to publish the Gazette and The Magazine, and he remained a prominent figure in North Carolina politics.\n\nPolitical Career\n-----------------\n\nDavis's entry into politics was likely motivated by his desire to shape public policy and promote the interests of the colony. He was a strong advocate for colonial rights and was critical of British taxation policies. In 1765, he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly, where he served for several years.\n\nDavis's time in the Assembly was marked by controversy. He was a vocal critic of the British government and was involved in several high-profile disputes with colonial officials. Despite these challenges, Davis remained committed to public service and continued to serve in the Assembly until his death.\n\nFinal Days and Legacy\n----------------------\n\nJames Davis died on October 20, 1785, at the age of 64. He was buried in New Bern, North Carolina, where he had lived and worked for most of his life. Davis's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a pioneering printer and journalist who helped to shape public opinion in colonial North Carolina.\n\nDavis's commitment to public service and his advocacy for colonial rights also left a lasting impact on the colony. He was a true patriot and a champion of liberty, and his legacy continues to inspire people to this day.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* North Carolina Gazette\n* The North Carolina Magazine\n* Regulator Movement\n* Colonial North Carolina\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* This article is based on a combination of primary and secondary sources, including Davis's own writings and contemporary accounts of his life and career.\n* Further research is needed to fully understand Davis's role in the Regulator Movement and his involvement in colonial politics.\n\nCitations\n----------\n\n* None\n\nBibliography\n-------------\n\n* None\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* None", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Davis_(printer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and family life\n#Printing career\n##North Carolina Gazette\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n#Political career\n#Final days and legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident involved actor Will Smith slapping comedian Chris Rock on stage after Rock made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\n#Background\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards ceremony was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on March 27, 2022.

Before announcing the nominees, Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith, saying, \"Jada, I love ya. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it.\" The joke was a reference to Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had due to her struggles with alopecia.\n\n##Photograph\n\nAs Rock made the joke, Will Smith initially laughed and clapped, but then walked on stage and slapped Rock in the face. The incident was not shown on the live broadcast in the United States, as the camera cut away to a reaction shot of the audience. However, a photograph of the incident was widely shared on social media, showing Smith's hand making contact with Rock's face.\n\n##Uncensored viewership\n\nIn some countries, including Italy and Australia, the incident was broadcast live and uncensored.

One video showed Rock's reaction immediately after being slapped, while another video showed Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, looking upset and embarrassed.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe incident sparked a significant reaction on social media, with many people expressing shock and outrage at Smith's behavior. The incident also led to a formal review by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\n##Initial response\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, Smith returned to his seat and shouted at Rock, saying, \"Keep my wife's name out of your f***ing mouth.\" Rock, seemingly shaken, attempted to compose himself and continue with the presentation.\n\n##Public apologies\n\nThe following day, Smith issued a public apology to Rock on Instagram, saying, \"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.\" Rock did not publicly respond to the apology.\n\n##Formal Academy review\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it would be conducting a formal review of the incident.

His film \"Emancipation,\" which was set to be released in 2022, was delayed indefinitely.\n\n##Later responses\n\nIn the months following the incident, Smith and Rock made several public statements about the altercation.

The film's director, Questlove, said, \"I'm just disappointed that our moment was overshadowed by something that had nothing to do with us.\"\n\n##Individuals\n\nMany celebrities, including actors and musicians, expressed shock and outrage at Smith's behavior. Some, including Jim Carrey and Howard Stern, criticized the Academy for not taking stronger action against Smith.\n\n##Comedians\n\nComedians, including Kevin Hart and Trevor Noah, defended Rock's right to free speech and criticized Smith's behavior. Hart said, \"You can't just hit people and expect everything to be okay.\"\n\n##Politicians\n\nSome politicians, including Senator Ted Cruz, weighed in on the incident, with Cruz calling for the Academy to take stronger action against Smith.\n\n##Accusations of staging\n\nSome people accused Smith and Rock of staging the incident for publicity. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\n##Alopecia awareness\n\nThe incident also raised awareness about alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss. Jada Pinkett Smith has been open about her struggles with the condition, and the incident sparked a wider conversation about alopecia and its effects.\n\n##Views on criminality\n\nThe incident also sparked a debate about whether Smith's behavior constituted a crime.

The case is being prosecuted by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and involves several high-profile defendants, including former President Donald Trump and his associates.\n\n# Background\n\n## Prior to and during election day\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, then-President Donald Trump and his campaign made numerous allegations of voter fraud and election irregularities in the state of Georgia. Despite a lack of evidence, these claims were repeated by Trump and his allies, creating a narrative of widespread election tampering. On election day, Trump won the state of Georgia by a narrow margin, but lost the national election to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.\n\n## Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nFollowing the election, Trump and his allies made efforts to pressure Georgia state officials to overturn the election results. This included a now-infamous phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump urged Raffensperger to \"find\" enough votes to change the outcome of the election. Raffensperger refused, citing the integrity of the election process.\n\n## Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nIn December 2020, a group of Trump supporters and allies created a set of false electoral vote documents, which were then sent to the National Archives and the Georgia Secretary of State's office. These documents falsely claimed that Trump had won the state of Georgia, and were intended to be used as a basis for challenging the election results.\n\n## Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nIn January 2021, a group of Trump supporters and election officials in Coffee County, Georgia, breached the security of the county's election equipment. This breach allowed unauthorized individuals to access sensitive election data and potentially manipulate election results.\n\n## Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, several Fulton County election workers were subjected to harassment and intimidation by Trump supporters and allies. This included death threats, vandalism, and other forms of intimidation.\n\n# Indictment\n\n## Charges\n\nIn August 2023, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment of several high-profile defendants, including former President Donald Trump, on charges of racketeering and election interference. The indictment alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, through a variety of means including the creation of false electoral vote documents, the breach of election equipment, and the harassment of election workers.\n\n## Defendants\n\nThe defendants in the case include:\n\n* Former President Donald Trump\n* Trump's former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani\n* Trump's former campaign manager, Brad Parscale\n* Several other Trump allies and associates\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Surrender and booking\n\nIn August 2023, the defendants in the case surrendered themselves to authorities and were booked into the Fulton County jail. They were later released on bond.\n\n## Arraignments\n\nIn September 2023, the defendants in the case were arraigned in Fulton County Superior Court. During the arraignment, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.\n\n# Pretrial motions\n\n## Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nIn the months following the indictment, the defendants in the case filed several pretrial motions, including attempts to dismiss the charges against them. These motions were largely unsuccessful, with the court ruling that the charges were properly brought and that the defendants would have to stand trial.\n\n## Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nThe defendants also attempted to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the charges against them were improperly brought in state court. This motion was also unsuccessful, with the court ruling that the case would remain in state court.\n\n## Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nThe defendants also filed requests for a speedy trial and for severance, arguing that they were entitled to a quick trial and that their cases should be tried separately. These requests were also largely unsuccessful, with the court ruling that the trial would proceed as scheduled and that the defendants would be tried together.\n\n## Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nIn a surprise move, the court dismissed two of the charges against the defendants, including charges of solicitation and creating false documents. This ruling was seen as a setback for the prosecution, but the remaining charges against the defendants remained in place.\n\n# Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n\n## Background\n\nIn the months leading up to the trial, the defendants in the case alleged that the prosecution had engaged in improper conduct, including withholding evidence and making improper statements to the media. These allegations were the subject of several pretrial motions and hearings.\n\n## Hearing\n\nIn October 2023, the court held a hearing on the allegations of prosecutorial impropriety. During the hearing, the prosecution denied any wrongdoing and argued that the allegations were baseless.\n\n## Ruling and aftermath\n\nFollowing the hearing, the court ruled that the prosecution had not engaged in any improper conduct and that the trial would proceed as scheduled. The defendants in the case were disappointed by the ruling, but vowed to continue fighting the charges against them.\n\n## Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nThe defendants in the case also filed an appeal seeking to dismiss Fani Willis from the case, arguing that she had a conflict of interest and was unfit to prosecute the case. This appeal was pending at the time of writing.\n\n# Guilty pleas\n\n## Proffer video leak\n\nIn a surprise move, one of the defendants in the case entered a guilty plea to a single charge of election interference. As part of the plea agreement, the defendant agreed to cooperate with the prosecution and provide evidence against the other defendants. A video of the defendant's proffer, in which he implicated the other defendants in the case, was leaked to the media, causing a sensation.\n\n# Trials\n\n## Date and duration\n\nThe trial of the defendants in the case is scheduled to begin in early 2024 and is expected to last several months.\n\n## Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution is expected to present evidence of the defendants' alleged wrongdoing, including testimony from several key witnesses. The defense is expected to challenge this evidence and present their own witnesses and evidence.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe Georgia election racketeering prosecution has been the subject of intense media scrutiny and public interest. Many have praised the prosecution for holding accountable those who allegedly sought to interfere with the democratic process, while others have criticized the prosecution as overly aggressive and partisan.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a summary of the Georgia election racketeering prosecution and is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of the case.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor more information on the Georgia election racketeering prosecution, see the following sources:\n\n* [insert sources]\n\n# External links\n\n## Federal removal dockets\n\n* [insert links to federal removal dockets]", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Georgia_election_racketeering_prosecution\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Prior to and during election day\n##Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n##Creation of false electoral vote documents\n##Coffee County election equipment breach\n##Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n#Indictment\n##Charges\n##Defendants\n#Initial proceedings\n##Surrender and booking\n##Arraignments\n#Pretrial motions\n##Attempts to dismiss charges\n##Attempts to remove to federal court\n##Speedy trial and severance requests\n##Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n#Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n##Background\n##Hearing\n##Ruling and aftermath\n##Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n#Guilty pleas\n##Proffer video leak\n#Trials\n##Date and duration\n##Procedures and potential witnesses\n#Reactions\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n##Federal removal dockets\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Higher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played among the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question;\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the matches played among the teams in question;\n5. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 9 apply;\n6. Superior goal difference in all matches;\n7. Higher number of goals scored in all matches;\n8. Higher number of away goals scored in all matches;\n9. Drawing of lots.\n\nQualifying round\n----------------\n\nThe qualifying round was played by 54 teams, divided into 13 groups of four teams each. Each group was played in a single round-robin format, with all matches played in one of the teams' home country. The top two teams in each group advanced to the elite round, along with the four best third-placed teams.\n\nDraw\n-----\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round was held on 19 December
