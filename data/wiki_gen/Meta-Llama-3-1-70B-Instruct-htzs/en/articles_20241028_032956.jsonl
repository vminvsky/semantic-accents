The election was the fourth since the country's return to democracy in 2014 and the second under the incumbent Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama.\n\n# Background\n\nFiji has a complex and often tumultuous history of elections, with the country experiencing four coups since independence in 1970. The 2018 general election saw the FijiFirst party, led by Frank Bainimarama, win a narrow victory over the opposition Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA). The election was marked by allegations of electoral irregularities and concerns over the impartiality of the electoral commission.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2022 election, Fiji experienced significant economic growth, but also faced challenges such as rising cost of living, unemployment, and natural disasters.

Born on April 23, 1981, in Santa Cruz, California, Sharma is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential climbers of his generation. With a career spanning over three decades, Sharma has established himself as a pioneer in the sport, pushing the boundaries of human potential and redefining the concept of what is possible on the rock.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nSharma grew up in a supportive family that encouraged his passion for climbing from an early age. His parents, Bob and Gail Sharma, were both avid climbers who introduced Chris to the sport when he was just six years old. Sharma's natural talent, combined with his dedication and perseverance, quickly propelled him to the forefront of the climbing community.\n\nClimbing Career\n----------------\n\nSharma's climbing career can be divided into several distinct phases, each marked by significant achievements and innovations.\n\n### 1996–2002 (to Realization)\n\nSharma's early career was marked by a string of impressive ascents, including the first free solo of the notorious \"Nose\" route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. In 2001, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Realization\" (also known as \"Biographie\") in Céüse, France, a route that would become a benchmark for climbers around the world.\n\n### 2002–2008 (to Jumbo Love)\n\nIn the early 2000s, Sharma shifted his focus to sport climbing, exploring new destinations and establishing cutting-edge routes. In 2008, Sharma made the first ascent of \"Jumbo Love\" in Clark Mountain, California, a 250-foot (76 m) route that pushed the limits of human endurance and physicality.\n\n### 2008–2013 (to La Dura Dura)\n\nSharma's next major project was \"La Dura Dura\" in Oliana, Spain, a route that would go on to become one of the most famous climbs in the world. Sharma spent several years working on the route, eventually completing the first ascent in 2013.\n\n### Post 2013\n\nSince completing \"La Dura Dura,\" Sharma has continued to explore new destinations and establish innovative routes. In 2017, Sharma made the first ascent of \"El Bon Combat\" in Cuenca, Spain, a route that marked a new era in sport climbing.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nChris Sharma's impact on the world of climbing cannot be overstated. Through his pioneering ascents and advocacy for environmental sustainability, Sharma has inspired a generation of climbers to push the boundaries of human potential and explore new frontiers. Sharma's commitment to protecting the natural world has also led to the establishment of the Sharma Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting environmental conservation and sustainability.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\n### Zen\n\nSharma has spoken publicly about the importance of Zen Buddhism in his life, citing its influence on his approach to climbing and his personal philosophy. Sharma has also incorporated elements of Zen into his business ventures, including his clothing company, Sharma Climbing.\n\nNotable Ascents\n----------------\n\n### Redpointed Routes\n\n* \"Realization\" (Biographie), Céüse, France (2001)\n* \"Jumbo Love,\" Clark Mountain, California (2008)\n* \"La Dura Dura,\" Oliana, Spain (2013)\n* \"El Bon Combat,\" Cuenca, Spain (2017)\n\n### Onsighted Routes\n\n* \"Nose,\" El Capitan, Yosemite Valley (1996)\n* \"Freerider,\" El Capitan, Yosemite Valley (1998)\n\n### Deep-Water Solo Routes\n\n* \"Es Pontas,\" Mallorca, Spain (2003)\n* \"The Needle,\" El Potrero Chico, Mexico (2005)\n\n### Boulder Problems\n\n* \"The Game,\" Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (2005)\n* \"Practice of the Wild,\" Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (2006)\n\nBibliography\n-------------\n\n* Sharma, Chris.

The term \"tartan\" has become synonymous with Scottish culture and heritage, and its intricate designs have captivated people around the world. From its humble beginnings as a practical fabric for everyday use to its current status as a symbol of Scottish identity, tartan has evolved over the centuries to become an integral part of Scotland's rich cultural tapestry.\n\nEtymology and Terminology\n-------------------------\n\nThe word \"tartan\" is derived from the French word \"tartane,\" which refers to a type of woolen cloth. In Scotland, the term \"tartan\" was initially used to describe the fabric itself, rather than the specific patterns woven into it. Over time, however, the term has come to be associated with the distinctive plaid patterns that have become iconic of Scottish culture.\n\nWeaving and Design\n-----------------\n\n### Weaving Construction\n\nTartan is woven using a specific type of loom called a \"tappet loom.\" This type of loom allows the weaver to create complex patterns by raising and lowering the warp threads in a specific sequence. The warp threads are typically made of wool, while the weft threads can be made of wool, cotton, or other materials.\n\n### Styles and Design Principles\n\nThere are several different styles of tartan, each with its own unique characteristics and design principles. Some of the most common styles include:\n\n* **Symmetrical tartans**: These are the most common type of tartan, featuring symmetrical patterns that repeat on both sides of the center line.\n* **Asymmetrical tartans**: These tartans feature patterns that are not symmetrical, often with different colors and motifs on either side of the center line.\n* **Reversing tartans**: These tartans feature patterns that reverse on either side of the center line, often creating a mirror-like effect.\n\n### Colour, Palettes, and Meaning\n\nTartans are characterized by their distinctive color palettes, which can vary greatly depending on the specific design. Some tartans feature bright, bold colors, while others are more subdued and muted. The colors used in tartan designs often have specific meanings and associations, such as:\n\n* **Red**: symbolizing courage and bravery\n* **Blue**: symbolizing loyalty and fidelity\n* **Green**: symbolizing nature and the outdoors\n* **Yellow**: symbolizing sunshine and optimism\n\nEarly History\n-------------\n\n### Pre-medieval Origins\n\nThe earliest evidence of tartan-like textiles dates back to the Iron Age, with examples of woven plaid fabrics found in ancient Celtic burial sites. These early textiles were likely made using simple looms and were used for everyday clothing and other practical purposes.\n\n### Medieval\n\nDuring the medieval period, tartan became a staple of Scottish culture, with different clans and families developing their own unique tartan patterns. These early tartans were often made using natural dyes and were used for a variety of purposes, including clothing, blankets, and other textiles.\n\n### 16th century\n\nThe 16th century saw the rise of the Scottish textile industry, with tartan becoming a major export commodity. This period also saw the development of new tartan designs and patterns, often featuring intricate and complex motifs.\n\n### 17th century\n\nThe 17th century was marked by significant upheaval in Scotland, with the English Civil War and the subsequent Act of Proscription having a major impact on the country's textile industry. Many Scottish weavers were forced to flee the country or abandon their craft, leading to a decline in the production of tartan.\n\n### 18th century\n\n#### Union protest and Jacobite rebellion\n\nThe 18th century saw a resurgence in tartan production, with many Scottish weavers returning to their craft after the Act of Proscription was repealed. This period also saw the rise of the Jacobite movement, with tartan becoming a symbol of Scottish identity and resistance against English rule.\n\n#### Proscription and its aftermath\n\nThe final Jacobite rising in 1745 was crushed by the British government, leading to a renewed period of proscription against tartan. Many Scottish weavers were forced to abandon their craft, and the production of tartan declined significantly.\n\nRegimental Tartans\n-----------------\n\nRegimental tartans are specific tartans worn by Scottish military regiments. These tartans are often worn as part of formal dress uniforms and are a proud symbol of Scottish military heritage.\n\nClan Tartans\n-------------\n\n### Long-running debate\n\nThe question of whether clan tartans were actually worn by Scottish clans in the past has been the subject of long-running debate among historians and tartan enthusiasts. While some argue that clan tartans were a genuine tradition, others claim that they were invented in the 19th century as a marketing tool.\n\n### Earliest evidence\n\nThe earliest evidence of clan tartans dates back to the 18th century, with examples of tartans worn by Scottish clans during the Jacobite risings. However, these early tartans were not necessarily specific to individual clans, and were often worn by multiple clans and families.\n\n### Lack of further evidence of early adoption\n\nDespite extensive research, there is little evidence to suggest that clan tartans were widely adopted by Scottish clans before the 19th century. Many clans and families had their own unique tartan patterns, but these were not necessarily tied to specific clans or families.\n\n### 19th century broad adoption\n\nThe 19th century saw a significant increase in the adoption of clan tartans, with many Scottish clans and families developing their own unique tartan patterns. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\n### 20th century consolidation\n\nThe 20th century saw a consolidation of clan tartans, with many Scottish clans and families registering their tartans with the Scottish Tartans Authority. This period also saw a decline in the production of tartan, as many Scottish textile mills closed or relocated.\n\n### Recognition by clan chiefs\n\nToday, many Scottish clan chiefs recognize and endorse specific tartans as their official clan tartans. These tartans are often worn by clan members and are a proud symbol of Scottish heritage.\n\nModern General Use\n------------------\n\n### Late Georgian\n\n#### The King's jaunt in tartan\n\nThe late Georgian period saw a significant increase in the popularity of tartan, with King George IV wearing a tartan outfit during a visit to Scotland in 1822. This event helped to popularize tartan among the British aristocracy and upper classes.\n\n#### Civilian spread\n\nTartan soon spread beyond the aristocracy, with many civilians adopting tartan as a fashion statement. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\n### Victorian\n\n#### Vestiarium Scoticum\n\nThe Vestiarium Scoticum, a book of tartan designs published in 1842, helped to popularize tartan among the British upper classes. The book featured intricate and complex tartan designs, many of which were invented by the authors.\n\n#### The Queen and \"Balmorality\"\n\nQueen Victoria's love of tartan and all things Scottish helped to popularize tartan among the British upper classes. The Queen's adoption of tartan as a fashion statement was seen as a way of promoting Scottish culture and heritage.\n\n#### Ripple effects\n\nThe popularity of tartan among the British upper classes soon spread to other parts of the world, with many countries adopting tartan as a fashion statement. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\n### 20th century to present\n\n#### Diaspora and globalisation\n\nThe 20th century saw a significant increase in the global popularity of tartan, with many countries adopting tartan as a fashion statement. This period also saw the rise of tartan as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\n#### Industry and politics\n\nThe tartan industry has played a significant role in Scottish politics, with many textile mills and manufacturers campaigning for the protection of tartan as a Scottish cultural icon.\n\n#### In popular culture\n\nTartan has appeared in numerous films, TV shows, and music videos, often as a symbol of Scottish identity and heritage.\n\nPopular Designs\n----------------\n\nThere are many popular tartan designs, each with its own unique characteristics and associations. Some of the most popular designs include:\n\n* **Black Watch**: a dark, muted tartan worn by the Black Watch regiment\n* **Gordon**: a bright, bold tartan worn by the Gordon Highlanders\n* **Stewart**: a classic, symmetrical tartan worn by the Stewart clan\n\nTartans for Specific Purposes\n-----------------------------\n\n### Regional\n\nRegional tartans are specific tartans worn by people from specific regions or countries.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Erin O'Toole as party leader on February 2, 2022. The contest was won by Pierre Poilievre, a Member of Parliament from Ontario, who was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada had been led by Erin O'Toole since August 2020. However, O'Toole's leadership was marked by controversy and criticism from within the party, particularly from the party's right wing. In January 2022, O'Toole faced a confidence vote by the party's caucus, which he won by a narrow margin. However, the vote was seen as a sign of weakness, and O'Toole ultimately resigned as party leader on February 2, 2022.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2020\n\n* August 2020: Erin O'Toole is elected as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\n## 2021\n\n* January 2021: O'Toole faces criticism from within the party for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* June 2021: O'Toole is criticized for his response to the discovery of unmarked graves at a former residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia.\n* November 2021: O'Toole faces a non-confidence vote by the party's caucus, which he wins by a narrow margin.\n\n## 2022\n\n* February 2, 2022: Erin O'Toole resigns as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n* February 5, 2022: The Conservative Party's National Council sets the rules and timeline for the leadership election.\n* May 2022: The first debate is held among the leadership candidates.\n* June 2022: The second debate is held among the leadership candidates.\n* July 2022: The membership sales deadline is reached, and the party announces that over 600,000 members have been sold.\n* August 2022: The final debate is held among the leadership candidates.\n* September 10, 2022: The leadership election is held, and Pierre Poilievre is elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party.\n\n# Rules and Procedures\n\nThe rules and procedures for the leadership election were set by the Conservative Party's National Council.

The process continued until one candidate had a majority of the votes.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the leadership election was marked by a series of debates among the candidates. The debates were held in May, June, and August 2022, and were broadcast on television and online.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe leadership election was won by Pierre Poilievre, who was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Party.

Born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France, Godard has been a key figure in the French New Wave movement and has continued to produce influential films throughout his career.\n\n# Early life\n\nGodard was born into a wealthy family in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. His father, Paul Godard, was a Swiss doctor, and his mother, Odile Monod, was a French socialite. Godard's family moved to Switzerland when he was four years old, and he spent much of his childhood in Nyon, Switzerland. Godard's early life was marked by a love of literature and philosophy, and he was particularly influenced by the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n# Early career (1950–1959)\n\n## Film criticism\n\nGodard began his career in film as a critic, writing for the Cahiers du Cinéma, a French film magazine that was a key platform for the French New Wave movement. Godard's criticism was known for its intellectual rigor and its emphasis on the importance of film as an art form. He was particularly influenced by the works of André Bazin, a French film critic who argued that film should be valued for its unique aesthetic qualities rather than its ability to tell stories.\n\n## Filmmaking\n\nIn the late 1950s, Godard began to make his own films, starting with a series of short films that were heavily influenced by the Italian Neorealist movement. Godard's early films were marked by their use of location shooting and their focus on everyday life. His first feature film, \"Breathless,\" was released in 1960 and was a major success, both critically and commercially.\n\n# New Wave period (1960–1967)\n\n## Breathless\n\n\"Breathless\" was a groundbreaking film that marked a significant departure from traditional French cinema. The film's use of handheld camera work, location shooting, and improvisation created a sense of spontaneity and freedom that was new to French cinema. The film's story, which follows a car thief and his American girlfriend as they flee Paris, was also innovative in its use of non-linear narrative and its emphasis on the emotional lives of its characters.\n\n## Early work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's collaboration with actress Anna Karina marked a significant period in his career. Karina, who was also Godard's wife, appeared in several of his films, including \"Le petit soldat\" and \"Vivre sa vie.\" Karina's performances were marked by their intensity and vulnerability, and she became a key figure in the French New Wave movement.\n\n## Vivre sa vie\n\n\"Vivre sa vie\" was released in 1962 and was a major success, both critically and commercially. The film's story, which follows a young woman who becomes a prostitute, was innovative in its use of non-linear narrative and its emphasis on the emotional lives of its characters. The film's use of long takes and location shooting also created a sense of realism and immediacy.\n\n## Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\n\"Le petit soldat\" and \"Les Carabiniers\" were released in 1960 and 1963, respectively, and marked a significant departure from Godard's earlier work. Both films were more overtly political than Godard's earlier work, and they marked a significant shift towards a more radical and experimental style.\n\n## Contempt\n\n\"Contempt\" was released in 1963 and was a major success, both critically and commercially.

Her case raised concerns about the handling of missing person investigations and the impact of media coverage on affected families.\n\n# Background\n\nNicola Bulley was born on June 21, 1980, in Chorley, Lancashire, England. She grew up in the local area and attended St. Michael's High School. After completing her education, Bulley worked as a mortgage advisor and later as a sales manager for a mortgage broking firm. She was a mother of two young daughters and was married to Paul Ansell.\n\n# Disappearance\n\nOn January 27, 2023, Bulley dropped off her two daughters, aged 6 and 9, at the local school in St. Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire. She then took her dog, a springer spaniel named Willow, for a walk along the River Wyre, a route she frequently took. At around 8:50 am, Bulley's phone was discovered on a bench near the river, with her dog running loose. Her disappearance was reported to the police, and a search operation was launched.\n\n# Investigation\n\n## Police\n\nThe Lancashire Police launched an immediate investigation into Bulley's disappearance. The police searched the River Wyre, surrounding areas, and nearby woodlands, using dogs, drones, and underwater cameras. They also reviewed CCTV footage and spoke to witnesses who reported seeing Bulley on her walk. The police initially treated Bulley's disappearance as a missing person case and appealed for information from the public.\n\n## Private search team\n\nAs the police investigation continued, a private search team, led by Peter Faulding, a specialist in underwater searches, was brought in to assist. Faulding's team used advanced sonar equipment and underwater cameras to search the River Wyre and surrounding areas.\n\n# Recovery of body and inquest\n\nOn February 19, 2023, Bulley's body was found in the River Wyre, near the village of St. Michael's on Wyre, approximately one mile from where her phone and dog were discovered. The body was identified as Bulley through dental records. The Lancashire Coroner's Office opened an inquest into Bulley's death, which was adjourned pending further investigation.\n\n# Criticism of the media and of Lancashire Police\n\nBulley's family and friends criticized the media for their handling of the case, citing sensationalism and intrusion. The family also expressed frustration with the Lancashire Police, feeling that they were not kept informed about the investigation and were treated insensitively. The police were also criticized for releasing personal details about Bulley, including her struggles with anxiety and her alcohol consumption, which some argued were irrelevant to the investigation.\n\n# Independent review\n\nIn response to criticism, the Lancashire Police announced an independent review of their handling of the case. The review will examine the police's communication with Bulley's family, their decision to release personal details about her, and their overall investigation strategy.\n\n# Documentary\n\nA documentary series about Bulley's disappearance and death is reportedly in production, with the filmmakers claiming to have access to exclusive interviews with Bulley's family and friends. The documentary has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it will sensationalize the case and exploit Bulley's family for entertainment value.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of people who disappeared mysteriously\n* List of unsolved deaths in the United Kingdom\n\nNote: This article is a neutral, encyclopedic summary of the available information about the death of Nicola Bulley.

However, the match was marred by interference from Jay Lethal and Jeff Jarrett, who attacked Allin and allowed Joe to emerge victorious.\n\nThe next match saw The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) defeat The Lucha Brothers (Pentagon and Rey Fenix) in a tag team match. The match was a high-flying contest, with both teams trading near-falls and high-impact moves.

The match was a intense and physical contest, with both wrestlers trading near-falls and high-impact moves.

The phenomenon began in June 1947 and lasted for several months, captivating the nation's imagination and sparking widespread debate about the origins and meaning of these mysterious sightings.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe 1947 Flying Disc Craze was a unique event in American history, marked by an extraordinary level of public fascination and government attention. The period saw a proliferation of reports of UFO sightings, which were often sensationalized in the media and sparked a range of explanations, from the mundane to the extraordinary. This article provides an overview of the events of the summer of 1947, as well as the various interpretations and explanations that were offered at the time.\n\n# Events of Summer 1947\n\n## Initial reports\n\nThe first reported UFO sighting of the summer of 1947 occurred on June 24, when Kenneth Arnold, a businessman and pilot, reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington.

Throughout its history, Zionism has grappled with questions of Jewish identity, peoplehood, and the relationship between Jews and non-Jews. This article explores the complex and often contentious issue of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n# Literature Review\n\nScholars have long debated the role of racial thinking in the development of Zionism. Some have argued that Zionism was inherently racist, while others have seen it as a response to anti-Semitic racism. Recent studies have highlighted the complexities of racial thinking in Zionism, revealing a nuanced and multifaceted picture. For example, some scholars have explored the ways in which early Zionists drew on racial theories to construct a sense of Jewish identity, while others have examined the impact of racial conceptions on Zionist policies towards non-Jews.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has been shaped by centuries of Jewish history, culture, and experience. From the ancient Israelites to the modern Jewish diaspora, Jewish identity has been marked by a complex interplay of religious, ethnic, and national affiliations. The rise of modern nationalism in the 19th century further complicated Jewish identity, as Jews began to grapple with the question of whether they were a nation, a people, or simply a religious community.\n\n## Early Zionism\n\nEarly Zionism, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was marked by a strong emphasis on Jewish identity and peoplehood. Zionists such as Theodor Herzl, Max Nordau, and Martin Buber drew on a range of sources, including Jewish tradition, European nationalism, and racial theory, to construct a sense of Jewish identity. Herzl, for example, argued that Jews were a separate and distinct nation, with their own unique characteristics and destiny. Nordau, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of physical strength and racial purity in the creation of a Jewish state.\n\n## 1948–1960s\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the development of Zionist thought on Jewish identity. As Israel began to absorb large numbers of Jewish immigrants from around the world, the question of who was a Jew became increasingly pressing. The Israeli government's Law of Return, which granted automatic citizenship to any Jew who immigrated to Israel, further complicated the issue. Zionists such as David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharett grappled with the question of whether Israel should prioritize Jewish identity or universal values.\n\n## 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant shift in Zionist thought on Jewish identity, as Israel began to grapple with the implications of its own racial and ethnic diversity. The rise of Mizrahi (Middle Eastern) and Sephardic (Spanish) Jewish communities in Israel challenged the dominance of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish culture, leading to a reevaluation of Jewish identity and peoplehood. Zionists such as Shlomo Avineri and Eliezer Schweid emphasized the importance of Jewish culture and tradition in shaping Israeli identity.\n\n## The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe discovery of the human genome in 2000 marked a significant turning point in the study of Jewish identity. Genetic research has revealed a complex picture of Jewish origins and identity, challenging traditional notions of Jewish peoplehood. Zionists such as Raphael Falk and Yossi Shain have grappled with the implications of genetic research for Jewish identity, while others have raised concerns about the potential for genetic essentialism and racism.\n\n## Race and Non-Jews\n\nThroughout its history, Zionism has grappled with the question of how to relate to non-Jews, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Zionists such as Herzl and Nordau drew on racial theories to construct a sense of Jewish identity, which often involved distinguishing Jews from non-Jews. The Israeli government's policies towards Palestinian citizens of Israel, including restrictions on land ownership and citizenship, have been criticized for their racial and ethnic underpinnings.\n\n# Impact\n\nRacial conceptions of Jewish identity have had a significant impact on Zionist thought and policy, shaping the development of the State of Israel and its relationships with non-Jews. The emphasis on Jewish identity and peoplehood has led to a complex and often contentious relationship between Israel and its Palestinian citizens, as well as with other non-Jewish communities. The legacy of racial thinking in Zionism continues to shape Israeli society and politics, with ongoing debates about Jewish identity, citizenship, and national belonging.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish Identity\n* Racial Theory\n* Nationalism\n* Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Racial_conceptions_of_Jewish_identity_in_Zionism\" following this outline:\n\n#Literature review\n#History\n##Background\n##Early Zionism\n##1948–1960s\n##1960s–2000\n##The genome era: 2000 to the present\n##Race and non-Jews\n#Impact\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women's equality and fundraising for female-focused charities. IWD has been celebrated for over a century, with its origins dating back to the early 20th century.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Origins\n\nThe first International Women's Day was celebrated on February 28, 1909, in New York City, organized by the Socialist Party of America. The event was inspired by the 1908 garment workers' strike in New York, where thousands of women protested against poor working conditions and low wages. The strike was sparked by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers, most of whom were women.\n\n### The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1917, the Russian Revolution led to the establishment of the world's first socialist state. Women played a significant role in the revolution, and on March 8, 1917, they organized a strike for \"Bread and Peace\" in Petrograd, demanding an end to World War I and better working conditions. The strike was a catalyst for the February Revolution, which eventually led to the overthrow of the Russian monarchy.\n\nAfter the revolution, International Women's Day became a national holiday in the Soviet Union and other communist countries. The holiday was seen as a way to promote women's rights and equality, as well as to celebrate the achievements of women in the revolution.\n\n### Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day began to be celebrated in other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The holiday was often marked with rallies, parades, and other events, but it was not widely recognized or celebrated.\n\nIn the 1960s, the women's liberation movement in the United States and other countries helped to revive interest in International Women's Day. The holiday became a symbol of the feminist movement, with women demanding equal rights and an end to sexism and patriarchy.\n\n### Second–wave feminism\n\nThe 1970s saw a surge in feminist activism, with the rise of second-wave feminism. International Women's Day became a key date for feminist protests and rallies, with women demanding equal pay, reproductive rights, and an end to violence against women.\n\n### Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations (UN) recognized International Women's Day as a global holiday, with the theme \"United Nations Decade for Women.\" The UN has since played a significant role in promoting the holiday, with the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) organizing events and activities around the world.\n\n### Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has become increasingly commercialized, with corporations and brands using the holiday to promote their products and services. While some critics argue that this commercialization undermines the holiday's feminist roots, others see it as an opportunity to raise awareness and funds for women's causes.\n\nInternational Women's Day by year\n--------------------------------\n\n### 1995\n\nThe Beijing Platform for Action was adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China.

The plane was carrying several high-ranking members of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, and was flying from Moscow to St. Petersburg.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Wagner Group is a Russian private military company that has been involved in various conflicts around the world, including in Ukraine, Syria, and Libya. The group is known for its close ties to the Russian government and has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes.\n\n##Aircraft\n\nThe Embraer Legacy 600 is a business jet produced by the Brazilian company Embraer. It is a popular choice for corporate and private aviation due to its comfort, range, and reliability. The aircraft that crashed was registered in Bermuda and was operated by a Russian company.\n\n#Incident\n\nThe plane took off from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport at 1:30 PM local time and was headed to St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Airport. However, shortly after takeoff, the plane disappeared from radar, and air traffic control lost contact with the pilots. The wreckage was later found in a field near the town of Kuzhenkino, Tver Oblast, about 100 kilometers northwest of Moscow.\n\n#Passengers and crew\n\nOn board the plane were several high-ranking members of the Wagner Group, including its founder and leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin was a former convict who made his fortune in the catering business before turning to private military contracting. He was known for his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and had been involved in various conflicts around the world.\n\nOther passengers on the plane included several top Wagner Group executives, as well as a few civilians. The crew consisted of two experienced pilots.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the crash is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that the plane experienced technical difficulties shortly after takeoff. The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia) has launched an investigation into the crash, and a team of experts from the agency has been dispatched to the scene.\n\n##Assessments outside Russia\n\nWestern intelligence agencies have been quick to suggest that the crash may not have been an accident. Some have speculated that the plane may have been shot down or sabotaged, possibly by Ukrainian or other anti-Russian forces. However, there is currently no evidence to support these claims.\n\n#Effect on the Wagner Group\n\nThe crash is a significant blow to the Wagner Group, which has lost several key leaders and personnel. The group's operations are likely to be severely disrupted in the short term, and it may take some time for them to recover from the loss.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe crash has also raised questions about the safety record of the Embraer Legacy 600 and the efficacy of Russian aviation regulations. The Russian government has promised a full investigation into the crash, and any findings will be closely watched by the international aviation community.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Domestic\n\nThe crash has been met with shock and sadness in Russia, where the Wagner Group is seen as a symbol of Russian patriotism and military prowess. Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and has promised a full investigation into the crash.\n\n##International\n\nThe international community has also reacted with shock and sadness to the news of the crash. Western governments have expressed their condolences to the families of the victims and have called for a full and transparent investigation into the causes of the crash.\n\n#Memorials\n\nA memorial service was held in Moscow on August 25, 2023, to honor the victims of the crash. The service was attended by Russian government officials, Wagner Group personnel, and family members of the victims.\n\n#See also\n\n* Wagner Group\n* Embraer Legacy 600\n* List of aviation accidents and incidents\n* Private military company\n\n#References\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, no citations or references are included in this article)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, no external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Wagner_Group_plane_crash\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Aircraft\n#Incident\n#Passengers and crew\n#Investigation\n##Assessments outside Russia\n#Effect on the Wagner Group\n#Aftermath\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n#Memorials\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was won by Liz Truss, who defeated Rishi Sunak in the final round of voting.\n\n#Background\n\n##Brexit and the 2019 leadership election\n\nThe Conservative Party had been led by Theresa May since 2016, but she announced her resignation in May 2019, following the party's poor performance in the 2019 European Parliament election. Boris Johnson, who had been a key figure in the Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, won the subsequent leadership election, defeating Jeremy Hunt in the final round.\n\n##2019 general election\n\nJohnson led the Conservative Party to a decisive victory in the 2019 general election, winning 365 seats and securing a majority of 80 in the House of Commons. The party's campaign focused on delivering Brexit and moving on from the parliamentary gridlock that had characterized the previous two years.\n\n##COVID-19 pandemic and Partygate\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson's government implemented various measures to control the spread of the virus, including lockdowns and travel restrictions. However, Johnson himself was criticized for his handling of the pandemic, particularly his decision to attend parties at 10 Downing Street during lockdown periods, which became known as Partygate.\n\n##June 2022 confidence vote\n\nIn June 2022, Johnson survived a confidence vote among Conservative MPs, with 211 voting in favor of him and 148 against. However, the vote highlighted the deep divisions within the party and the growing opposition to Johnson's leadership.\n\n##Government crisis\n\nIn the days following the confidence vote, several senior ministers resigned from the government, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. The resignations triggered a wider government crisis, with many Conservative MPs calling for Johnson to step down as party leader and Prime Minister.\n\n#Election details\n\nThe Conservative Party's 1922 Committee, which oversees leadership elections, announced the rules and timetable for the contest on July 11, 2022. The election would be held in two stages: the first stage would involve Conservative MPs voting to select two candidates to go forward to the second stage, which would involve a postal ballot of party members.\n\n#Campaign\n\nThe campaign began on July 12, 2022, with several candidates announcing their intention to stand. The contest was dominated by debates over Brexit, the economy, and the party's future direction.\n\n#Candidates\n\n##Nominated\n\nEight candidates were nominated for the contest:\n\n* Kemi Badenoch\n* Suella Braverman\n* Jeremy Hunt\n* Penny Mordaunt\n* Rishi Sunak\n* Liz Truss\n* Tom Tugendhat\n* Nadhim Zahawi\n\n##Withdrew\n\nTwo candidates withdrew from the contest before the first round of voting:\n\n* Sajid Javid\n* Grant Shapps\n\n##Publicly expressed interest\n\nSeveral other Conservative MPs publicly expressed interest in standing for the leadership but ultimately did not enter the contest:\n\n* Priti Patel\n* Dominic Raab\n* Michael Gove\n\n##Declined\n\nSeveral high-profile Conservative MPs declined to stand for the leadership:\n\n* Boris Johnson\n* Theresa May\n\n##Endorsements\n\nSeveral candidates received endorsements from senior Conservative MPs:\n\n* Rishi Sunak was endorsed by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay and former Chancellor Philip Hammond.\n* Liz Truss was endorsed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\n#Timeline\n\n* July 11, 2022: The 1922 Committee announces the rules and timetable for the contest.\n* July 12, 2022: The campaign begins, with several candidates announcing their intention to stand.\n* July 13, 2022: The first round of voting takes place among Conservative MPs.\n* July 14, 2022: The second round of voting takes place among Conservative MPs.\n* July 18, 2022: The final two candidates are announced.\n* July 25, 2022: The first televised debate takes place.\n* August 1, 2022: The second televised debate takes place.\n* August 5, 2022: The postal ballot of party members opens.\n* September 2, 2022: The postal ballot closes.\n* September 5, 2022: The winner is announced.\n\n#Debates\n\n##Public reaction\n\nThe debates were widely watched and sparked significant public interest in the contest.

The term \"Reformation\" refers to the process of reforming the Catholic Church, which was the dominant Christian institution in Europe at the time. However, the movement went beyond mere reform and resulted in the creation of new Christian denominations, the Protestant churches, and a profound impact on Western society.\n\n# Terminology\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" is derived from the Latin word \"reformatio,\" meaning \"renewal\" or \"restoration.\" It was first used by the Protestant reformers themselves to describe their efforts to reform the Catholic Church. Over time, the term has been adopted by historians to describe the broader movement that transformed European society in the 16th century.\n\n# Background\n\n## Calamities\n\nThe 14th to 16th centuries were marked by a series of calamities that shook European society. The Black Death, which ravaged the continent in the 14th century, led to significant social, economic, and cultural changes. The rise of city-states and the growth of trade and commerce created new social classes and tensions. The Hundred Years' War between England and France (1337-1453) and the Ottoman conquests in Eastern Europe further destabilized the continent.\n\n## Late Medieval Christianity\n\n### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was the dominant institution in medieval Europe, exercising authority over all aspects of life, from politics and education to art and culture. The Church was organized into a hierarchical structure, with the Pope at the top, followed by cardinals, bishops, and priests. The Church controlled a vast network of monasteries, convents, and schools, and its clergy played a key role in the administration of justice, education, and social welfare.\n\n### Clergy\n\nThe clergy were a powerful and influential group in medieval society. They were responsible for the spiritual guidance of the faithful, the administration of the sacraments, and the collection of taxes and tributes. However, the clergy were also criticized for their corruption, ignorance, and immorality. Many clergy held multiple benefices, which led to absenteeism, and some engaged in simony, or the sale of church offices.\n\n### Papacy\n\nThe Papacy was the central authority of the Catholic Church, with the Pope exercising supreme authority over all matters of faith and morals. However, the Papacy was also criticized for its corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power. The Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which saw two rival Popes claim authority, further eroded confidence in the Papacy.\n\n### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Catholic Church attempted to reform itself through various initiatives. The Conciliar movement, which emerged in the 15th century, sought to reform the Church through ecumenical councils. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Church remained resistant to fundamental change.\n\n## Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, a cultural and intellectual movement that emphasized the potential of human beings to achieve great things through education and individual effort, emerged in the 14th to 16th centuries. Humanism led to a renewed interest in classical learning and a focus on individualism and human dignity. Laypeople, particularly in the cities, began to play a more active role in religious life, forming confraternities and participating in devotional practices.\n\n## Dissidents\n\nAs the Catholic Church failed to reform itself, dissident movements emerged, criticizing the Church's corruption, doctrine, and practices. The Waldensians, a group of heretics who emerged in the 12th century, rejected the authority of the Church and advocated for a return to apostolic simplicity. The Lollards, a movement that emerged in England in the 14th century, criticized the Church's corruption and advocated for a more literal interpretation of Scripture.\n\n# Beginnings\n\n## Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nMartin Luther, a German theologian and Augustinian friar, is often credited with launching the Reformation. In 1517, Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, criticizing the sale of indulgences and challenging the authority of the Pope. The theses were quickly disseminated throughout Europe, sparking a heated debate about the nature of the Church and the authority of Scripture.\n\n## New theology\n\nLuther's theology, which emphasized the authority of Scripture, the priesthood of all believers, and justification by faith alone, challenged the traditional understanding of the Church and its sacraments. The concept of sola scriptura, or the idea that Scripture is the sole source of authority in matters of faith, became a central tenet of Protestant theology.\n\n## Spread\n\nThe Reformation spread rapidly throughout Europe, fueled by the printing press, which allowed ideas to be disseminated quickly and widely. The movement gained support from princes, nobles, and townspeople, who saw the Reformation as a way to challenge the authority of the Catholic Church and promote local autonomy.\n\n## Resistance and oppression\n\nHowever, the Reformation also faced significant resistance and oppression from the Catholic Church and its allies. The Papacy condemned Luther and his followers as heretics, and the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, attempted to crush the movement through military force.\n\n# Alternatives\n\n## Saxon radicals and rebellious knights\n\nIn the early years of the Reformation, radical groups emerged, advocating for more extreme reforms. The Saxon radicals, who emerged in the 1520s, advocated for the abolition of the nobility and the establishment of a more equal society. The rebellious knights, who emerged in the 1530s, advocated for a more aristocratic form of government.\n\n## Zwingli\n\nHuldrych Zwingli, a Swiss theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation in the 1520s. Zwingli's theology, which emphasized the importance of Scripture and the sacraments, differed from Luther's in significant ways. Zwingli's movement, which became known as the Swiss Reformation, gained significant support in Switzerland and beyond.\n\n## Swiss Brethren\n\nThe Swiss Brethren, a group of radicals who emerged in the 1520s, advocated for a more extreme form of reform. They rejected the authority of the Church and the state, and advocated for a more literal interpretation of Scripture.\n\n## Peasants' War\n\nThe Peasants' War, which broke out in Germany in 1524, was a major uprising of peasants and townspeople against the nobility and the Church. The war was sparked by economic and social grievances, as well as the influence of radical Protestantism.\n\n# Consolidation\n\n## Princely Reformation in Germany\n\nIn the 1530s and 1540s, the Reformation gained significant support from princes and nobles in Germany. The Princely Reformation, as it became known, led to the establishment of Protestant churches in many German states.\n\n## Stalemate in Switzerland\n\nHowever, the Reformation in Switzerland was marked by a stalemate between Protestant and Catholic forces. The Swiss Confederation, which was divided between Protestant and Catholic cantons, was unable to resolve the conflict through military force.\n\n## Schleitheim Articles\n\nThe Schleitheim Articles, which were adopted by the Swiss Brethren in 1527, became a key document of the Radical Reformation. The articles advocated for a more literal interpretation of Scripture, the rejection of the authority of the Church and the state, and the establishment of a more equal society.\n\n## Confessions\n\nThe Protestant confessions, which emerged in the 1530s and 1540s, became key documents of the Reformation. The Augsburg Confession, which was adopted by the Lutheran churches in 1530, and the Helvetic Confession, which was adopted by the Swiss Reformed churches in 1536, became key statements of Protestant doctrine.\n\n## Royal Reformation in Scandinavia\n\nThe Reformation in Scandinavia was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the monarchs of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The Royal Reformation, as it became known, led to the establishment of Protestant churches in these countries.\n\n# Catholic reform\n\n## Beginnings\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation by initiating a series of reforms. The Council of Trent, which was convened in 1545, became a key moment in the Catholic Reformation.\n\n## New Orders\n\nThe Catholic Church also established new orders, such as the Jesuits, which were dedicated to reform and evangelization.\n\n## Council of Trent\n\nThe Council of Trent, which was convened in 1545, became a key moment in the Catholic Reformation. The council addressed issues such as clerical reform, the authority of Scripture, and the sacraments.\n\n# New waves\n\n## English reformation under Henry VIII\n\nThe Reformation in England was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by King Henry VIII. The English Reformation, as it became known, led to the establishment of the Church of England.\n\n## Münster\n\nThe Anabaptist movement, which emerged in the 1520s, advocated for a more extreme form of reform. The Anabaptists, who were led by figures such as Jan van Leiden, established a communal society in Münster, which became a key moment in the Radical Reformation.\n\n## Calvin and the Institutes of the Christian Religion\n\nJohn Calvin, a French theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Reformation in the 1530s. Calvin's theology, which emphasized the sovereignty of God and the authority of Scripture, became a key influence on Protestant thought.\n\n## Reformation in Britain\n\nThe Reformation in Britain was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the monarchs of England and Scotland. The Reformation in Scotland, which was led by figures such as John Knox, became a key moment in the Scottish Reformation.\n\n## Servetus and the Restoration of Christianity\n\nMichael Servetus, a Spanish theologian, emerged as a key figure in the Radical Reformation. Servetus's theology, which emphasized the importance of reason and the authority of Scripture, became a key influence on Protestant thought.\n\n# Wars of religion and tolerance\n\n## Schmalkaldic Wars\n\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars, which broke out in Germany in the 1540s, were a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces. The wars were sparked by the influence of Protestantism and the resistance of the Catholic Church.\n\n## French Wars of Religion\n\nThe French Wars of Religion, which broke out in France in the 1560s, were a series of conflicts between Protestant and Catholic forces. The wars were sparked by the influence of Protestantism and the resistance of the Catholic Church.\n\n## Revolt in the Netherlands\n\nThe Revolt in the Netherlands, which broke out in the 1560s, was a major uprising against Spanish rule. The revolt was sparked by economic and social grievances, as well as the influence of Protestantism.\n\n## Edict of Torda\n\nThe Edict of Torda, which was issued in 1568, became a key moment in the history of tolerance. The edict, which was issued by the Hungarian king John Sigismund Zápolya, granted freedom of worship to Protestants and Catholics.\n\n## Warsaw Confederation\n\nThe Warsaw Confederation, which was established in 1573, became a key moment in the history of tolerance. The confederation, which was established by the Polish nobility, granted freedom of worship to Protestants and Catholics.\n\n## Counter-Reformation and regional conflicts\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, which was launched by the Catholic Church in the 16th century, became a key moment in the history of the Reformation. The Counter-Reformation, which was marked by the establishment of new orders and the reform of the Catholic Church, became a key influence on Catholic thought.\n\n# Reformation outside Germany\n\n## Nordic countries\n\n### Iceland\n\nThe Reformation in Iceland was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the Icelandic parliament in 1541.\n\n## Great Britain\n\n### England\n\n#### English North America\n\nThe Reformation in English North America was marked by the establishment of Protestant colonies in the 17th century.\n\n### Wales\n\nThe Reformation in Wales was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the Welsh monarchs.\n\n### Scotland\n\nThe Reformation in Scotland was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the Scottish monarchs.\n\n## France\n\nThe Reformation in France was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the French monarchs.\n\n## Spain\n\nThe Reformation in Spain was marked by the resistance of the Catholic Church to Protestantism.\n\n## Italy\n\nThe Reformation in Italy was marked by the resistance of the Catholic Church to Protestantism.\n\n## Slovenia\n\nThe Reformation in Slovenia was marked by the adoption of Protestantism by the Slovenian nobility.\n\n## Greece\n\nThe Reformation in Greece was marked by the resistance of the Orthodox Church to Protestantism.\n\n# Spread\n\nThe Reformation spread rapidly throughout Europe, fueled by the printing press, which allowed ideas to be disseminated quickly and widely.\n\n# Conclusion and legacy\n\n## Thirty Years' War: 1618–1648\n\nThe Thirty Years' War, which broke out in Germany in 1618, was a major conflict between Protestant and Catholic forces.

They were a significant force in the ancient Mediterranean world, playing a key role in the history of Rome and the wider Italian peninsula.\n\n#Etymology\n\nThe name \"Samnites\" is derived from the Oscan word \"saunix,\" meaning \"those from the mountains\" or \"mountaineers.\" This refers to the mountainous region of Samnium, where the Samnites lived.\n\n#History\n\n##Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are not well documented, but it is believed that they were an Indo-European-speaking people who migrated to Italy from the north in the early 1st millennium BC. They settled in the Apennine Mountains, where they developed a distinct culture and identity.\n\nThe Samnites were not a single, unified state, but rather a collection of tribes and city-states that shared a common language, culture, and identity. These tribes were often at odds with one another, but they were united in their opposition to the growing power of Rome.\n\n##Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnite Wars were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Romans that took place from 343 to 290 BC. The wars were sparked by Roman expansion into Samnite territory, which the Samnites saw as a threat to their independence and way of life.\n\nThe First Samnite War (343-341 BC) was fought over control of the city of Capua, which was a key location in southern Italy. The war ended with a Roman victory, but the Samnites continued to resist Roman rule.\n\nThe Second Samnite War (327-304 BC) was sparked by a Samnite attack on the Roman city of Naples. The war was marked by a series of Roman victories, but the Samnites were able to hold out for several years.\n\nThe Third Samnite War (298-290 BC) was the final conflict between the Samnites and the Romans. The war ended with a decisive Roman victory, and the Samnites were forced to accept Roman rule.\n\n##Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites were integrated into the Roman Republic. Many Samnites were granted Roman citizenship, and they played an important role in Roman politics and society.\n\nHowever, the Samnites continued to maintain their distinct culture and identity. They were known for their skill as warriors and their fierce independence, and they played a key role in the Roman army.\n\nThe Samnites also played a significant role in the Social War (91-88 BC), a conflict between the Romans and their Italian allies. The war ended with the grant of Roman citizenship to all Italian allies, including the Samnites.\n\n#Society\n\n##Economy\n\nThe Samnite economy was based on agriculture and trade. The Samnites were skilled farmers, and they grew a variety of crops, including wheat, olives, and grapes. They also raised livestock, including cattle, pigs, and sheep.\n\nThe Samnites were also skilled traders, and they traded with other cities and states in the Mediterranean. They were known for their high-quality metalwork, including bronze and iron, and they exported these goods to other regions.\n\n##Government\n\nThe Samnite government was based on a system of city-states and tribes. Each city-state had its own government, which was typically headed by a council of elders or a monarch.\n\nThe Samnites also had a federal system of government, which was headed by a council of representatives from each city-state. This council was responsible for making decisions about foreign policy and defense.\n\n##Military\n\nThe Samnite military was known for its skill and bravery. The Samnites were skilled warriors, and they were known for their use of the gladius, a short sword that was used for close combat.\n\n###Armor\n\nThe Samnite armor was made of leather and metal. They wore a type of helmet called a \"galea,\" which was made of bronze or iron. They also wore a type of breastplate called a \"pectorale,\" which was made of bronze or iron.\n\n###Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites used a variety of weapons, including the gladius, a short sword that was used for close combat. They also used a type of spear called a \"hasta,\" which was used for thrusting and throwing. They also used a type of sling called a \"funda,\" which was used for throwing stones.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Religion\n\nThe Samnite religion was based on a system of polytheism, which recognized a variety of gods and goddesses. The Samnites worshipped a number of gods, including Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo.\n\nThe Samnites also believed in the importance of rituals and sacrifices. They would often make sacrifices to their gods, including animals and other offerings.\n\n##Gender roles\n\nThe Samnite society was patriarchal, and men played a dominant role in politics, society, and the economy. Women were responsible for managing the household and raising children.\n\nHowever, women also played an important role in Samnite society. They were known for their skill as weavers and textile workers, and they produced high-quality clothing and other textiles.\n\n##Art\n\nThe Samnite art was influenced by Greek and Etruscan art. They produced a variety of art forms, including sculpture, pottery, and metalwork.\n\nThe Samnites were known for their skill as metalworkers, and they produced high-quality metal objects, including bronze and iron.\n\n##Clothing\n\nThe Samnite clothing was simple and practical.

The search was part of an investigation into the handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records, including classified documents, by former President Donald Trump. The search warrant was obtained by the FBI after a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and a subsequent investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\n# Background\n\n## Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records\n\nThe handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records are governed by various laws and regulations. The Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978 requires the President to preserve and maintain records created or received during their term in office. The PRA also requires the President to transfer records to NARA at the end of their term.\n\n### Criminal laws listed on search warrant\n\nThe search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago listed three federal crimes: (1) removal or destruction of records (18 U.S.C. § 2071), (2) concealment or mutilation of federal records (18 U.S.C. § 1519), and (3) obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1510).\n\n### Classified material and the presidency\n\nThe handling of classified material is governed by various laws and regulations, including Executive Order 13526. This order requires the President to take steps to protect classified information and to ensure that it is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.\n\n#### Declassification, presidential powers and regulations\n\nThe President has the authority to declassify information, but this authority is subject to certain regulations and guidelines. The President can only declassify information that was originally classified by the executive branch. Additionally, the President must follow established procedures for declassifying information, including consulting with relevant agencies and ensuring that the declassification is consistent with national security interests.\n\n#### Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, protocols require the reporting of the incident to the relevant authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

The fort played a significant role in the early history of New York City and was a key location in the Dutch colonization of the Americas.\n\nHistory\n=======\n\nEstablishment (1621–1660)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch West India Company established a trading post on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, which they named \"New Amsterdam.\" The company built a small fortification to protect the post from attacks by Native American tribes and British colonists. The fort was originally a simple wooden structure, but it was later replaced with a more substantial stone fortification in 1626.\n\nThe Dutch West India Company used Fort Amsterdam as a hub for their fur trade operations in North America. The fort was also used as a base for Dutch explorers and traders who traveled to other parts of the continent. In 1626, Peter Minuit, the director of the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape Native American tribe for $24. The transaction was made at Fort Amsterdam, and it marked the beginning of Dutch rule over the island.\n\nEnglish rule (1664–1673)\n------------------------\n\nIn 1664, the British sent a fleet of ships to New Amsterdam to capture the colony from the Dutch. The Dutch governor of the colony, Peter Stuyvesant, resisted the British attack, but he was ultimately forced to surrender. The British renamed the colony \"New York\" after the Duke of York, who later became King James II.\n\nUnder British rule, Fort Amsterdam was renamed \"Fort James.\" The British used the fort as a base for their military operations in North America, and it played a key role in several conflicts, including King Philip's War and the Second Anglo-Dutch War.\n\nDutch rule (1673–1674)\n----------------------\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured New York from the British and renamed it \"New Orange.\" The Dutch also restored the original name of the fort, \"Fort Amsterdam.\" However, the Dutch rule over the colony was short-lived, as the British recaptured it in 1674.\n\nEnglish rule (1674–1689)\n-----------------------\n\nUnder British rule, Fort Amsterdam was renamed \"Fort James\" once again. The British used the fort as a base for their military operations in North America, and it played a key role in several conflicts, including the Monmouth Rebellion and the Leisler's Rebellion.\n\nColonist rule (1689–1691)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1689, a group of colonists led by Jacob Leisler seized control of Fort James and declared independence from British rule. Leisler's Rebellion was a short-lived but significant event in the history of New York City. The rebellion was ultimately put down by the British, and Leisler was executed for treason.\n\nBritish rule (1691–1775)\n-----------------------\n\nUnder British rule, Fort Amsterdam was renamed \"Fort George.\" The British used the fort as a base for their military operations in North America, and it played a key role in several conflicts, including the War of the Austrian Succession and the French and Indian War.\n\nPrelude to the revolution\n-------------------------\n\nIn the mid-18th century, tensions began to rise between the British government and the American colonies. The British government imposed a series of taxes on the colonies, including the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, which led to widespread protests and boycotts.\n\nColonist rule (1775–1776)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolution began, and Fort George was seized by a group of colonists. The colonists renamed the fort \"Fort Amsterdam\" once again, and it played a key role in the early years of the revolution.\n\nBritish rule (1776–1783)\n-----------------------\n\nIn 1776, the British recaptured New York City and Fort Amsterdam from the colonists. The British used the fort as a base for their military operations in North America, and it played a key role in several conflicts, including the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Long Island.\n\nAmerican rule (1783–1790)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1783, the British evacuated New York City and Fort Amsterdam, and the fort was taken over by the American government. The fort was renamed \"Fort George\" once again, and it was used as a base for the United States Army.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New Amsterdam\n* Dutch West India Company\n* Peter Minuit\n* Peter Stuyvesant\n* American Revolution\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nFurther reading\n================\n\n* Burrows, Edwin G. and Mike Wallace.

The election was the fifth in less than four years, following the dissolution of the 24th Knesset in June 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 Israeli legislative election was called following the collapse of the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The coalition, which was formed in June 2021, was composed of eight parties with diverse ideologies, including the centrist Yesh Atid, the right-wing New Hope, and the Islamist United Arab List. However, the coalition struggled to maintain a majority in the Knesset, and on June 20, 2022, Bennett announced his intention to dissolve the parliament and call for new elections.\n\nThe election campaign took place against the backdrop of rising tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as growing concerns about the Israeli economy and the cost of living. The campaign also saw the rise of new parties and leaders, including the far-right Religious Zionist Party and the centrist National Unity Party.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe election campaign was marked by intense competition between the various parties, with many candidates vying for attention and votes. The campaign was also notable for the use of social media and online advertising, which played a significant role in reaching voters.\n\nThe Likud party, led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ran a campaign focused on Netanyahu's experience and leadership, as well as his plans to reduce the cost of living and improve the economy. The party also emphasized its commitment to Israeli security and its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe Yesh Atid party, led by Yair Lapid, ran a campaign focused on Lapid's plans to reduce corruption and improve governance, as well as his commitment to social and economic reform. The party also emphasized its support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and its opposition to Netanyahu's leadership.\n\nThe Religious Zionist Party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, ran a campaign focused on its commitment to Jewish values and its opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The party also emphasized its support for the annexation of the West Bank and its opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* June 20, 2022: Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announces his intention to dissolve the 24th Knesset and call for new elections.\n* July 11, 2022: The 24th Knesset is officially dissolved, and the election campaign begins.\n* August 15, 2022: The deadline for parties to submit their lists of candidates.\n* September 12, 2022: The deadline for voters to register.\n* October 18, 2022: The start of the official election campaign.\n* November 1, 2022: Election day.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe Israeli electoral system is based on proportional representation, with the entire country serving as a single electoral district. The system is designed to ensure that smaller parties have a chance to participate in the Knesset, and to prevent any one party from dominating the parliament.\n\nThe electoral threshold, which is the minimum number of votes required for a party to enter the Knesset, is set at 3.25%. Parties that receive below this threshold are not allocated any seats in the Knesset.\n\n## Surplus-Vote Agreements\n\nIn the Israeli electoral system, parties can enter into surplus-vote agreements, which allow them to share surplus votes and increase their chances of winning seats. These agreements are typically made between parties that are ideologically close, and are designed to ensure that the parties receive the maximum number of seats possible.\n\n# Political Parties\n\n## Factions Before the Election\n\nPrior to the election, the Knesset was composed of the following factions:\n\n* Likud\n* Yesh Atid\n* Blue and White\n* Shas\n* United Torah Judaism\n* Labor\n* Meretz\n* New Hope\n* Yamina\n* United Arab List\n* Hadash-Ta'al\n* Balad\n\n## Retiring Incumbents\n\nSeveral incumbent members of the Knesset announced their intention not to run in the 2022 election, including:\n\n* Prime Minister Naftali Bennett\n* Defense Minister Benny Gantz\n* Foreign Minister Yair Lapid\n* Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar\n\n## Contesting Parties\n\nThe following parties contested the 2022 election:\n\n* Likud\n* Yesh Atid\n* Blue and White\n* Shas\n* United Torah Judaism\n* Labor\n* Meretz\n* New Hope\n* Yamina\n* United Arab List\n* Hadash-Ta'al\n* Balad\n* Religious Zionist Party\n* National Unity Party\n\n## Not Running\n\nThe following parties did not contest the 2022 election:\n\n* Gesher\n* Kulanu\n* Tzomet\n* Atid Ehad\n\n# Leadership Elections and Primaries\n\n## Balad\n\nThe Balad party held its leadership election in July 2022, in which Mtanes Shehadeh was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Hadash\n\nThe Hadash party held its leadership election in August 2022, in which Ayman Odeh was re-elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Labor\n\nThe Labor party held its leadership election in July 2022, in which Merav Michaeli was re-elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Likud\n\nThe Likud party held its leadership election in June 2022, in which Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Meretz\n\nThe Meretz party held its leadership election in August 2022, in which Zehava Gal-On was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Religious Zionist\n\nThe Religious Zionist party held its leadership election in July 2022, in which Bezalel Smotrich was elected as the party's leader.\n\n## Ta'al\n\nThe Ta'al party held its leadership election in August 2022, in which Ahmad Tibi was re-elected as the party's leader.\n\n## United Arab List\n\nThe United Arab List party held its leadership election in July 2022, in which Mansour Abbas was re-elected as the party's leader.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nOpinion polls conducted prior to the election showed a tight contest between the Likud and Yesh Atid parties, with the Likud party consistently leading in the polls.\n\n# Debates\n\nSeveral debates were held between the leaders of the major parties, including a debate between Netanyahu and Lapid on October 25, 2022.\n\n# Results\n\nThe final results of the 2022 Israeli legislative election were as follows:\n\n* Likud: 32 seats\n* Yesh Atid: 24 seats\n* Blue and White: 12 seats\n* Shas: 11 seats\n* United Torah Judaism: 7 seats\n* Labor: 6 seats\n* Meretz: 6 seats\n* New Hope: 5 seats\n* Yamina: 5 seats\n* United Arab List: 5 seats\n* Hadash-Ta'al: 5 seats\n* Balad: 4 seats\n* Religious Zionist Party: 7 seats\n* National Unity Party: 4 seats\n\n## Members of the Knesset Who Lost Their Seats\n\nSeveral incumbent members of the Knesset lost their seats in the 2022 election, including:\n\n* Defense Minister Benny Gantz\n* Foreign Minister Yair Lapid\n* Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar\n* Labor Party leader Merav Michaeli\n\n# Aftermath\n\n## Government Formation\n\nFollowing the election, the process of forming a new government began.

The incident occurred on April 30, 2021, during the 2021 Hartlepool by-election campaign, when Starmer and Rayner were filmed drinking beer and eating curry with Labour Party staff at a constituency office in Durham, England.\n\nDurham event\n-------------\n\nThe alleged breach of lockdown rules took place at the office of Mary Foy, the Labour MP for the City of Durham constituency. At the time, the UK was under strict COVID-19 lockdown rules, which prohibited indoor gatherings and social events. However, the Labour Party claimed that the gathering was a legitimate work event, and that the participants were simply taking a break to eat and drink while working late.\n\nVideo footage\n-------------\n\nA video of the event, which showed Starmer and Rayner drinking beer and eating curry with Labour Party staff, was obtained by the press in April 2022. The video was widely shared on social media and sparked outrage among Conservative Party politicians and supporters, who accused Starmer and Rayner of hypocrisy and breaching lockdown rules.\n\nResponse to Partygate\n---------------------\n\nThe Beergate scandal emerged in the midst of the Partygate scandal, which involved allegations that Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other Conservative Party politicians had breached lockdown rules by hosting social gatherings at 10 Downing Street. The Conservative Party had been facing intense pressure and criticism over the scandal, and the Beergate allegations were seen as an opportunity for the party to deflect attention away from its own wrongdoing.\n\nInitial police review\n---------------------\n\nIn response to the allegations, Durham Constabulary launched an initial review to determine whether a formal investigation was warranted. The review was led by the force's chief constable, Jo Farrell, who confirmed that the police had received complaints about the alleged breach of lockdown rules.\n\nCalls for further investigation\n-------------------------------\n\nConservative Party politicians and supporters called for a full investigation into the allegations, accusing Starmer and Rayner of hypocrisy and breaching lockdown rules. The party's chairman, Oliver Dowden, wrote to the police chief, urging her to investigate the matter further.\n\nPolice investigation\n--------------------\n\nStart of investigation\n----------------------\n\nIn May 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it had decided to launch a formal investigation into the allegations. The investigation was led by a senior detective, who was tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses.\n\nNew allegations\n----------------\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, new allegations emerged that Starmer and Rayner had breached lockdown rules on multiple occasions. The allegations included claims that the pair had attended a social gathering at a Labour Party office in London, and that they had failed to wear face masks while traveling on public transport.\n\nStarmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn response to the allegations, Starmer and Rayner pledged to resign as Labour Party leader and deputy leader if they were found to have breached lockdown rules. The pledges were seen as an attempt to demonstrate the pair's commitment to upholding the law and maintaining public trust.\n\nResponses to pledges\n----------------------\n\nThe pledges were met with skepticism by some Conservative Party politicians and supporters, who accused Starmer and Rayner of trying to preemptively manage the fallout from the scandal. Others praised the pair for taking responsibility and showing accountability.\n\nPolice questionnaires\n----------------------\n\nAs part of the investigation, Durham Constabulary sent questionnaires to Starmer, Rayner, and other Labour Party staff who were present at the Durham event. The questionnaires asked for details about the gathering, including what food and drink were consumed, and whether the participants were aware of the lockdown rules at the time.\n\nOutcome\n---------\n\nIn July 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that it had completed its investigation and found that Starmer and Rayner had not breached lockdown rules. The force concluded that the gathering was a legitimate work event, and that the participants had not committed any offenses.\n\nResponses to the outcome\n-------------------------\n\nThe outcome of the investigation was met with relief by Starmer and Rayner, who maintained that they had always acted within the law. The Labour Party welcomed the outcome, and accused the Conservative Party of trying to politicize the issue.\n\nRelated developments\n---------------------\n\nThe Beergate scandal led to a number of related developments, including calls for greater transparency and accountability within the Labour Party. The scandal also sparked a wider debate about the role of politicians in upholding the law and maintaining public trust.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Partygate\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Labour Party (UK)\n* Conservative Party (UK)\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is a factual account of the Beergate scandal, and is based on publicly available information.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Beergate\" following this outline:\n\n#Durham event\n##Video footage\n#Response to Partygate\n#Initial police review\n##Calls for further investigation\n#Police investigation\n##Start of investigation\n##New allegations\n##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges\n##Responses to pledges\n##Police questionnaires\n##Outcome\n##Responses to the outcome\n#Related developments\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle took place in and around the city of Sievierodonetsk, the administrative center of the Sievierodonetsk Raion in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. The city was a key target for Russian forces, as it was one of the last remaining major cities in the Luhansk Oblast under Ukrainian control.\n\n#Background\n\nSievierodonetsk is a city located in the Luhansk Oblast of Ukraine, approximately 110 kilometers northwest of Luhansk city. The city has a population of around 100,000 people and is an important industrial and cultural center in the region. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sievierodonetsk was a relatively peaceful city, with no major military conflicts taking place in the area.\n\nHowever, following the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Sievierodonetsk became a key target for Russian forces. The city was strategically located near the border with Russia and was seen as a crucial stepping stone for Russian forces seeking to capture the entire Luhansk Oblast.\n\n#Battle\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk began in late May 2022, as Russian forces launched a series of attacks on the city. The Ukrainian military had been preparing for the battle, having fortified the city's defenses and established a series of defensive lines around the city.\n\n##Encirclement attempts\n\nRussian forces initially attempted to encircle the city, seeking to cut off Ukrainian supply lines and prevent reinforcements from reaching the city. However, Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian advances, and the city remained connected to the rest of Ukraine.\n\nDespite this, Russian forces continued to make gains around the city, capturing several nearby towns and villages. This led to a series of intense battles, as Ukrainian forces sought to hold back the Russian advances.\n\n##Attack on the city\n\nOn June 6, 2022, Russian forces launched a direct attack on Sievierodonetsk, seeking to capture the city. The attack was preceded by a series of intense artillery bombardments, which caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian forces defended the city fiercely, but were ultimately unable to hold back the Russian advances. On June 12, 2022, Russian forces entered the city, marking the beginning of a prolonged and brutal urban battle.\n\n##Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Russian forces issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian forces in Sievierodonetsk, demanding that they surrender the city within 24 hours. However, Ukrainian forces rejected the ultimatum, vowing to continue defending the city.\n\nThe Ukrainian government also reiterated its commitment to defending Sievierodonetsk, with President Volodymyr Zelensky stating that the city would be defended \"at all cos", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Sievierodonetsk_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Encirclement attempts\n##Attack on the city\n##Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n##Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The league was a major force in the development of Australian football in the area, producing several top-level players and contributing to the growth of the sport in the region.\n\n#History\n\nThe Albury & District Football League was established in 1923, with five founding clubs: Albury, Border United, Corowa, Howlong, and North Albury. The league was formed to provide a structured competition for football clubs in the Albury region, which had previously been playing in a series of informal matches and tournaments. Over the years, the league expanded to include several other clubs, including East Albury, Lavington, and South Albury.\n\nDuring its early years, the league faced significant challenges, including the Great Depression and World War II. Despite these challenges, the league continued to operate, with some clubs experiencing periods of success on the field. The league's most successful club during this period was the North Albury team, which won several premierships and produced a number of top-level players.\n\nIn the post-war period, the league experienced a significant decline in popularity, due in part to the growth of other sports in the region, such as rugby league and soccer. The league's final season was played in 1949, with the Lavington club winning the premiership.\n\n##Notable Events\n\nOne of the most notable events in the league's history was the 1935 grand final between North Albury and Albury. The match was played in front of a large crowd at the Albury Sports Ground, with North Albury winning by a score of 14.14 (98) to 10.10 (70).\n\nAnother notable event was the 1947 match between Lavington and Corowa, which was played in front of a record crowd of over 5,000 spectators.

The earthquake was one of the deadliest natural disasters to affect the country in recent years, and its impact was felt across the region.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\nAfghanistan is located in a seismically active region, where the Indian tectonic plate is moving northwards into the Eurasian plate. This process, known as continental collision, has resulted in the formation of the Himalayan mountain range and the creation of several major faults in the region. The earthquake occurred in the eastern part of the country, near the border with Pakistan, where the Indian plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian plate.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale and a depth of approximately 50 kilometers. It was a reverse fault earthquake, where the ground on one side of the fault was pushed upwards relative to the other side. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Paktika Province of Afghanistan, approximately 44 kilometers southwest of the city of Khost.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake was felt across a wide area, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The intensity of the earthquake was reported to be severe, with buildings collapsing and widespread damage to infrastructure. The earthquake was also felt in the capital city of Kabul, where buildings shook and people were evacuated from their homes.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nSeveral aftershocks were reported in the days following the earthquake, including a magnitude 4.3 earthquake that occurred on June 24. The aftershocks caused further damage and disruption, and were a source of concern for rescue teams and aid workers.\n\n# Impact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe earthquake had a devastating impact on Afghanistan, where thousands of people were left homeless and without access to basic necessities. The provinces of Paktika and Khost were the worst affected, with entire villages being destroyed and many people killed or injured. The earthquake also caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in Pakistan, where several people were killed and injured. The provinces of North Waziristan and South Waziristan were the worst affected, with reports of buildings collapsing and widespread damage to infrastructure. The Pakistani government responded quickly to the disaster, with rescue teams and aid workers being deployed to the affected areas.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was chaotic, with rescue teams and aid workers struggling to reach the affected areas. The Afghan government declared a state of emergency and appealed for international aid, while the Pakistani government also provided assistance to its own affected areas. The international community responded quickly to the disaster, with several countries and organizations providing aid and support.\n\n# Domestic response\n\nThe Afghan government responded quickly to the disaster, with rescue teams and aid workers being deployed to the affected areas. The government also established a relief fund to support those affected by the earthquake. However, the response was hindered by the country's limited resources and infrastructure, as well as the ongoing conflict with the Taliban.\n\n# International response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to respond to the disaster, with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) providing $1 million in emergency aid. The US military also provided assistance, with helicopters and planes being used to transport aid and personnel to the affected areas.\n\n## International organizations\n\nSeveral international organizations, including the United Nations and the Red Cross, also responded to the disaster. The UN provided $10 million in emergency aid, while the Red Cross provided medical supplies and personnel to the affected areas. Other organizations, such as the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization, also provided assistance.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* List of natural disasters in Afghanistan\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Afghanistan earthquake: At least 1,000 people killed and 3,000 injured\".

It is believed that he grew up in a troubled environment and had a history of run-ins with the law, which ultimately led to his involvement in more serious crimes.\n\nAlleged 2017 Murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2017, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis, a Brazilian man who was found dead in his home. Cavalcante was reportedly a suspect in the investigation, but he managed to evade capture and flee the country.\n\nEscape to the United States\n---------------------------\n\nAfter allegedly committing the murder, Cavalcante escaped to the United States, where he assumed a new identity and attempted to start a new life. However, his past eventually caught up with him, and he became the subject of an international manhunt.\n\n2021 Murder of Deborah Brandão\n-----------------------------\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Cavalcante was accused of murdering Deborah Brandão, a 22-year-old Brazilian woman who was found dead in her apartment in the United States. Cavalcante was reportedly in a relationship with Brandão, and the murder was believed to be a domestic violence incident.\n\nThe murder sparked widespread outrage and led to a renewed effort by law enforcement to capture Cavalcante. He was subsequently arrested and charged with the crime, but he managed to escape from custody before his trial.\n\n2023 Prison Escape\n-----------------\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Cavalcante escaped from a maximum-security prison in the United States, where he was being held awaiting trial for the murder of Deborah Brandão.

Cavalcante was believed to be armed and dangerous, and authorities warned the public to be on the lookout for him.\n\n### Capture\n\nOn March 15, 2023, Cavalcante was finally captured in a rural area of the United States, after a tip from a member of the public led authorities to his location. He was taken into custody without incident and was returned to prison to face charges related to his escape.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nThe capture of Cavalcante brought an end to a long and complex manhunt, and authorities breathed a sigh of relief that the fugitive was finally off the streets. The incident highlighted the need for increased cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the importance of public vigilance in helping to keep communities safe.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* Danilo Cavalcante is currently being held in a maximum-security prison in the United States, where he is awaiting trial for multiple crimes.\n* The case against Cavalcante has sparked widespread outrage and debate about the effectiveness of the justice system in dealing with violent offenders.\n* Cavalcante's escape and subsequent recapture have led to calls for increased security measures in prisons and a review of the policies and procedures in place to prevent such incidents.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Danilo_Cavalcante\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Alleged 2017 murder of Valter Júnior Moreira dos Reis\n#Escape to the United States\n#2021 murder of Deborah Brandão\n#2023 prison escape\n##Manhunt\n##Capture\n##Aftermath\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The book is a personal account of Prince Harry's life, covering his childhood, his experiences as a member of the British royal family, and his decision to step back from his royal role.\n\n# Background and writing\n\nPrince Harry began writing his memoir in 2018, shortly after he married Meghan Markle. The book was initially scheduled for release in 2022, but it was delayed due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022. Prince Harry worked with ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer, who has written memoirs for other notable figures, including Andre Agassi and Phil Knight.\n\nPrince Harry has stated that he wrote the book to provide a more honest and personal account of his life, which he felt had been distorted by the media. He also wanted to share his experiences and insights with the public, in the hope that it might help others who have faced similar challenges.\n\n# Synopsis\n\nThe memoir is divided into several sections, each covering a significant period in Prince Harry's life.\n\n## Childhood and Diana's death\n\nThe book begins with Prince Harry's childhood, describing his idyllic early years with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and his father, Charles, Prince of Wales. Prince Harry writes fondly of his mother, who he credits with instilling in him a sense of compassion and empathy. He also describes the close relationship he had with his brother, Prince William.\n\nPrince Harry then recounts the events surrounding his mother's death in a car accident in Paris in 1997. He describes the shock and grief he felt, as well as the subsequent struggles he faced in coming to terms with the loss of his mother. Prince Harry has spoken publicly about the emotional toll his mother's death took on him, and the book provides a more detailed and personal account of his experiences.\n\n## Teenage years, drug use, and deployment to Afghanistan\n\nThe book also covers Prince Harry's teenage years, during which he struggled with the pressures of being a member of the royal family. He admits to using marijuana and cocaine, and describes the negative impact these experiences had on his mental health.\n\nPrince Harry then recounts his deployment to Afghanistan in 2007-2008, where he served as a helicopter pilot. He describes the camaraderie and sense of purpose he felt during his time in the military, as well as the challenges he faced in adjusting to life back in the UK.\n\n## Relationship with Charles and Camilla, William's wedding, and Caroline Flack\n\nPrince Harry also writes about his complicated relationship with his father and stepmother, Camilla Parker Bowles. He describes the tension and distance that developed between them, particularly after his mother's death.\n\nThe book also covers Prince Harry's experiences at his brother's wedding to Catherine Middleton in 2011.

The book is a philosophical and introspective exploration of the human condition, identity, and the search for meaning. Through a unique narrative structure and lyrical prose, Dubois delves into the complexities of human existence, weaving together themes of love, loss, and the quest for connection.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThe Book of Surfaces is a novel that defies easy categorization. Part philosophical treatise, part personal memoir, and part literary experiment, the book is a rich tapestry of ideas and emotions. At its core, the novel is a meditation on the human experience, exploring the tensions between surface and depth, appearance and reality. Through a series of vignettes, essays, and fragments, Dubois creates a portrait of a self in search of meaning and connection in a chaotic world.\n\nBackground and literary references\n--------------------------------\n\nDubois's work is often associated with the French literary tradition of philosophical and introspective writing. The Book of Surfaces draws on a range of influences, from the existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger to the postmodernism of Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. The novel's use of lyrical prose and its emphasis on the fragmented nature of human experience also evoke the works of modernist writers such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.\n\n##Influences and allusions\n\nThroughout the book, Dubois alludes to a range of literary and philosophical texts, from the works of Plato and Aristotle to the poetry of Baudelaire and Rimbaud. These allusions serve to underscore the novel's central themes of identity, meaning, and the search for connection. At the same time, Dubois's use of allusion and reference creates a sense of intertextuality, highlighting the ways in which human experience is shaped by the cultural and literary traditions that surround us.\n\nForm and content\n----------------\n\nThe Book of Surfaces is characterized by its innovative and experimental form. The novel is divided into a series of vignettes, essays, and fragments, each of which explores a different aspect of human experience. Through this structure, Dubois creates a sense of disjointedness and fragmentation, mirroring the ways in which human identity is shaped by multiple and often conflicting forces.\n\n##Narrative structure\n\nThe novel's narrative structure is deliberately non-linear, eschewing traditional notions of plot and character development. Instead, Dubois uses a series of vignettes and essays to create a portrait of a self in search of meaning and connection. This structure allows Dubois to explore a range of themes and ideas, from the nature of identity and the self to the role of love and relationships in human experience.\n\n##Themes and motifs\n\nAt its core, The Book of Surfaces is a novel about the human condition, exploring the tensions between surface and depth, appearance and reality. Through a range of themes and motifs, Dubois delves into the complexities of human existence, examining the ways in which we search for meaning and connection in a chaotic world. Key themes include the nature of identity and the self, the role of love and relationships, and the search for meaning and purpose.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nThe Book of Surfaces has received widespread critical acclaim for its innovative form, lyrical prose, and nuanced exploration of the human condition. Reviewers have praised Dubois's unique narrative structure, his use of allusion and reference, and his ability to capture the complexities of human experience.\n\n##Awards and nominations\n\nThe Book of Surfaces has been shortlisted for several major literary awards, including the Prix Goncourt and the Prix Femina. The novel has also been translated into a range of languages, including English, Spanish, and Italian.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* French literature\n* Existentialism\n* Postmodernism\n* Intertextuality\n* Philosophical fiction", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"IJP_The_Book_of_Surfaces\" following this outline:\n\n#Overview\n#Background and literary references\n#Form and content\n#Reception\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Mackenzie's charismatic leadership and emphasis on spiritual warfare and healing attracted many followers, particularly among the youth.\n\nHowever, as the organization grew, so did concerns about its teachings and practices.
