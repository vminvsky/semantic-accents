Open science is a movement that seeks to make scientific research and data more accessible, transparent, and collaborative. The economics of open science examines the costs and benefits of open science, as well as the economic models and regulatory frameworks that shape the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge.\n\n# Economic Models\n\nEconomic models of open science examine the ways in which scientific knowledge is produced, disseminated, and used. These models help to identify the incentives and constraints that shape the behavior of researchers, institutions, and governments.\n\n## Open Science Club\n\nAn open science club is a group of researchers and institutions that collaborate to produce and share scientific knowledge. The club model is based on the idea that researchers can benefit from sharing knowledge and resources, and that collaboration can lead to more efficient and effective research.\n\n### Definitions of Knowledge Club\n\nA knowledge club is a group of individuals or organizations that share knowledge and resources to achieve a common goal. Knowledge clubs can be formal or informal, and can be organized around specific research topics or disciplines.\n\n### Knowledge Club and Open Science\n\nOpen science clubs are a type of knowledge club that is specifically focused on open science. These clubs bring together researchers, institutions, and governments to share knowledge and resources, and to promote open science practices.\n\n## Open Science Market\n\nThe open science market refers to the market for scientific knowledge and services. This market is characterized by a mix of public and private providers, and a range of business models.\n\n### Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market\n\nScientific publishing is a hybrid market that combines elements of public and private provision. Many scientific journals are published by private companies, but they also rely on public funding and volunteer labor.\n\n### From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access\n\nThe open science movement has led to a shift from traditional subscription-based models to open access models. Hybrid models offer a mix of open access and subscription-based options, while full open access models make all content freely available.\n\n### From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams\n\nThe open science market is diversifying, with new revenue streams emerging around data analytics and other services. This diversification is driven by the increasing availability of data and the growing demand for data-driven insights.\n\n## Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons refers to the shared resources and infrastructure that support open science. This includes digital repositories, data platforms, and other tools and services.\n\n### The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons\n\nThe digital knowledge commons has emerged as a key infrastructure for open science. This includes digital repositories, data platforms, and other tools and services that support the sharing and reuse of knowledge.\n\n### Enclosures of Open Science Commons\n\nThe open science commons is vulnerable to enclosures, where private companies or governments seek to restrict access to shared resources. This can undermine the openness and collaboration that are key to open science.\n\n### Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)\n\nThe open science commons has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, with the emergence of new players and the growth of existing ones. This consolidation is driven by the increasing demand for open science infrastructure and services.\n\n# Cost\n\nThe cost of open science includes the costs of producing, disseminating, and using scientific knowledge.\n\n## Editorial Work and Evaluation\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are key components of the scientific publishing process. These costs include the time and effort of editors, reviewers, and other stakeholders.\n\n## Technical Infrastructure\n\nTechnical infrastructure is critical to open science, including digital repositories, data platforms, and other tools and services. These costs include the development, maintenance, and upgrading of infrastructure.\n\n## Commercial Services and Prestige\n\nCommercial services and prestige are also important components of the cost of open science. These costs include the marketing and promotion of scientific journals and other services.\n\n# Benefits\n\nThe benefits of open science include reduced transaction costs, access costs, and research efficiency, as well as economic and social development.\n\n## Transaction Costs\n\nOpen science reduces transaction costs by making it easier for researchers to find and access scientific knowledge. This includes the costs of searching, evaluating, and acquiring knowledge.\n\n## Access Costs\n\nOpen science also reduces access costs by making scientific knowledge more widely available. This includes the costs of subscription fees, paywalls, and other barriers to access.\n\n## Research Efficiency\n\nOpen science promotes research efficiency by facilitating collaboration and the sharing of knowledge. This includes the costs of duplicating research, as well as the benefits of accelerating innovation.\n\n## Economic and Social Development\n\nOpen science contributes to economic and social development by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, and public engagement. This includes the benefits of creating new industries, jobs, and opportunities.\n\n# Economic Regulation of Open Science\n\nEconomic regulation of open science is critical to promoting openness, collaboration, and innovation. This includes policies and laws that shape the production, dissemination, and use of scientific knowledge.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Tatarsky's Telegram channel, which had gained a large following, provided a unique perspective on the conflict, often featuring firsthand accounts and eyewitness reports from the front lines.\n\nPrison and War\n-------------\n\nBefore gaining fame as a military correspondent, Tatarsky spent several years in prison for his involvement in neo-Nazi groups. During his time in prison, Tatarsky became disillusioned with the ideology of the groups he had previously associated with and began to develop his own perspective on politics and society. After his release from prison, Tatarsky became involved in covering the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where he quickly gained a reputation for his fearless and uncompromising reporting.\n\nTatarsky's experiences during the Donbas War had a profound impact on his worldview and shaped his perspective on the conflict. He was known for his strong anti-Ukrainian sentiments and often expressed support for the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. Despite his controversial views, Tatarsky's reporting was widely respected for its accuracy and insight, and he became a prominent voice on the Russian-language internet.\n\nTelegram Channel\n----------------\n\nTatarsky's Telegram channel, which was launched in 2014, quickly gained a large following and became one of the most popular sources of information on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The channel featured a wide range of content, including news reports, eyewitness accounts, and analysis of the conflict. Tatarsky's reporting was known for its vivid detail and often featured photographs and videos taken on the front lines.\n\nThe channel was also notable for its interactive nature, with Tatarsky frequently engaging with his followers and responding to their comments and questions. This approach helped to build a sense of community among his followers, who saw him as a trusted and authoritative source of information on the conflict.\n\nAssassination\n-------------\n\nOn April 2, 2022, Tatarsky was assassinated in a bombing at a cafe in St. Petersburg, Russia. The attack, which was carried out by a woman who had been posing as a fan, also injured several others. The assassination was widely condemned, and Tatarsky's followers expressed shock and outrage at his killing.\n\nThe investigation into Tatarsky's assassination is ongoing, but it is believed that the attack was carried out by Ukrainian nationalists in retaliation for his reporting on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Tatarsky's death was seen as a significant loss for the Russian-language internet, where he had been a prominent and influential voice.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nTatarsky's legacy is complex and multifaceted. While his views on the conflict in eastern Ukraine were often controversial, his reporting was widely respected for its accuracy and insight. Tatarsky's approach to journalism, which emphasized firsthand reporting and eyewitness accounts, helped to build a sense of trust among his followers and established him as a prominent voice on the Russian-language internet.\n\nTatarsky's assassination was a tragic reminder of the risks faced by journalists and bloggers who cover conflict zones. His death was widely condemned, and his followers continue to remember him as a fearless and uncompromising reporter who was dedicated to telling the truth about the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Donbas War\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Journalism in Russia\n* Telegram (messaging service)\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nNo references are included in this article.\n\nExternal Links\n---------------\n\n* Tatarsky's Telegram channel (archived)\n* Articles by Tatarsky on the Donbas War (in Russian)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vladlen_Tatarsky\" following this outline:\n\n#Prison and war\n#Telegram channel\n#Assassination\n#Legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Koufax is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his blazing fastball, sharp curveball, and impressive strikeout totals. His career was marked by numerous accolades, including three Cy Young Awards, four World Series championships, and a memorable decision to observe Yom Kippur during the 1965 World Series.\n\nEarly Life\n----------\n\nKoufax was born on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to Evelyn and Jack Koufax. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant who worked as a salesman, and the family moved to Borough Park, Brooklyn, when Sandy was a child. Koufax grew up in a traditional Jewish household, attending Hebrew school and observing Jewish holidays. He developed a passion for sports at an early age, playing baseball, basketball, and football in local youth leagues.\n\nMajor League Tryouts\n-------------------\n\nAfter graduating from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, Koufax attended the University of Cincinnati on a basketball scholarship. However, he soon became disillusioned with college life and decided to pursue a career in baseball. In 1954, Koufax tried out for the Brooklyn Dodgers, impressing scouts with his fastball and curveball. He signed a contract with the Dodgers on December 14, 1954.\n\nProfessional Career\n------------------\n\nEarly Years (1955–1960)\n-----------------------\n\nKoufax made his major league debut on June 24, 1955, pitching in relief against the Milwaukee Braves. He struggled to find his footing in the early years, posting a 4.76 ERA and 104 walks in 194.2 innings pitched. However, Koufax worked tirelessly to refine his mechanics and develop a more effective pitching style.\n\nDomination (1961–1964)\n----------------------\n\n### 1961 Season\n\nKoufax's breakthrough season came in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 3.52 ERA and 269 strikeouts. He threw his first no-hitter on June 30, 1962, against the New York Mets, striking out 13 batters.\n\n### 1962 Season\n\nIn 1962, Koufax continued to dominate, posting a 14-7 record with a 2.54 ERA and 216 strikeouts. He threw a second no-hitter on May 11, 1963, against the San Francisco Giants.\n\n### 1963 Season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was perhaps his most impressive, as he went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA and 306 strikeouts. He won the Cy Young Award and the Most Valuable Player award, becoming the first pitcher to win both awards in the same season.\n\nSalary Dispute\n----------------\n\n### 1964 Season\n\nKoufax and his teammate, Don Drysdale, engaged in a highly publicized salary dispute with the Dodgers in 1964. The two pitchers, who were among the best in the league, demanded higher salaries, but the Dodgers refused to meet their demands. The dispute eventually led to a two-week holdout, which was resolved when the Dodgers agreed to pay Koufax and Drysdale $85,000 and $80,000, respectively.\n\nPlaying in Pain (1965–66)\n-------------------------\n\n### 1965 Season\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was marked by a series of injuries, including a sore elbow and a broken finger. Despite the pain, Koufax continued to pitch effectively, going 26-8 with a 1.73 ERA and 382 strikeouts.\n\n#### Perfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched a perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, retiring all 27 batters in a row. It was the eighth perfect game in major league history and the first by a left-handed pitcher.\n\n#### World Series and Yom Kippur Decision\n\nKoufax's most famous decision came during the 1965 World Series, when he chose to observe Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, rather than pitch in Game 1. The decision sparked a national debate about the role of faith in sports, but Koufax remained resolute, saying, \"There are a lot of times when I don't feel like pitching, but there's only one time when I don't feel like being Jewish.\"\n\nHoldout\n---------\n\n### 1966 Season\n\nKoufax and Drysdale again engaged in a salary dispute with the Dodgers in 1966, this time holding out for 32 days. The dispute was eventually resolved when the Dodgers agreed to pay Koufax and Drysdale $125,000 and $110,000, respectively.\n\nRetirement\n------------\n\nKoufax retired from baseball on November 18, 1966, at the age of 30, due to chronic pain and numbness in his pitching arm. He finished his career with a 165-87 record, a 2.76 ERA, and 2,396 strikeouts.\n\nCareer Overall\n-----------------\n\nStatistics and Achievements\n----------------------------\n\nKoufax's career statistics include:\n\n* Wins: 165\n* Losses: 87\n* ERA: 2.76\n* Strikeouts: 2,396\n* Walks: 817\n* Shutouts: 40\n* Complete games: 137\n\nPitching Style and Repertoire\n-----------------------------\n\nKoufax's pitching style was characterized by his blazing fastball, which was clocked at over 100 mph, and his sharp curveball, which dropped off the table. He also threw a changeup and a slider, but his fastball and curveball were his most effective pitches.\n\nPost-Playing Activities\n-------------------------\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Koufax worked as a television commentator for NBC and later as a pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, at the age of 36.\n\nHonors and Recognition\n-------------------------\n\nKoufax's honors and recognition include:\n\n* 3-time Cy Young Award winner (1963, 1965, 1966)\n* 4-time World Series champion (1955, 1959, 1963, 1965)\n* 3-time National League Most Valuable Player (1963, 1965, 1966)\n* 8-time National League All-Star (1961-1966)\n* National Baseball Hall of Fame (1972)\n\nLegacy\n----------\n\nImpact within the Jewish Community\n----------------------------------\n\nKoufax's decision to observe Yom Kippur during the 1965 World Series had a profound impact on the Jewish community, who saw him as a role model and a symbol of Jewish pride. He remains one of the most beloved and respected figures in Jewish sports history.\n\nRelationship with Fellow Minorities\n-----------------------------------\n\nKoufax's relationship with fellow minorities, particularly African Americans, was marked by mutual respect and admiration. He was a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was friends with many prominent African American athletes, including Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali.\n\nIn Media Culture\n-----------------\n\nTelevision Appearances\n----------------------\n\nKoufax appeared on numerous television shows, including \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" \"The Tonight Show,\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\" He also worked as a commentator for NBC, calling games for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees.\n\nCultural References\n---------------------\n\nKoufax has been referenced in numerous films, television shows, and songs, including \"The Simpsons,\" \"Seinfeld,\" and \"The Baseballs.\" He has also been the subject of several books and documentaries.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nKoufax married Anne Widmark in 1969, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. He has remained active in the Jewish community, supporting various charitable organizations and causes.\n\nSee Also\n---------\n\n* Brooklyn Dodgers\n* Los Angeles Dodgers\n* National Baseball Hall of Fame\n* Yom Kippur\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBook Sources\n-------------\n\n* Koufax, Sandy. \"Koufax\" (1966)\n* Leavy, Jane. \"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy\" (2002)\n\nFurther Reading\n-----------------\n\nArticles\n---------\n\n* \"Sandy Koufax: The Lefty Who Changed the Game\" by Roger Angell (The New Yorker, 1966)\n* \"Koufax: A Study in Perfection\" by Tom Verducci (Sports Illustrated, 1999)\n\nBooks\n------\n\n* \"The Koufax Dilemma\" by Joseph Durso (1966)\n* \"Sandy Koufax: A Biography\" by Richard P.

The storm complex brought a wide range of weather conditions, including tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, freezing temperatures, and blizzard conditions.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nThe storm complex developed on April 10, 2022, as a low-pressure system formed over the Rocky Mountains. The system strengthened as it moved east, fueled by a strong cold front and a mass of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. As the system moved across the Great Plains, it interacted with a strong jet stream, leading to the development of a complex system of thunderstorms and severe weather.\n\nThe storm complex was characterized by a strong dry line, which separated the warm, moist air from the cooler, drier air. This dry line was the focal point for much of the severe weather, including tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. Additionally, the storm complex brought a mass of cold air, which led to freezing temperatures and blizzard conditions in some areas.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex produced a total of 77 confirmed tornadoes across the central and southern United States.\n\n## April 11 Event\n\nOn April 11, 2022, a total of 17 tornadoes were reported across the Great Plains. The most significant tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that struck the town of Norman, Oklahoma, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## April 12 Event\n\nOn April 12, 2022, a total of 25 tornadoes were reported across the southern United States. The most significant tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that struck the town of Jackson, Tennessee, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## April 13 Event\n\nOn April 13, 2022, a total of 20 tornadoes were reported across the central United States. The most significant tornado of the day was an EF3 tornado that struck the town of Joplin, Missouri, causing significant damage and injuring several people.\n\n## Bell County–Salado, Texas\n\nOne of the most significant tornadoes of the storm complex was an EF3 tornado that struck the Bell County and Salado areas of Texas on April 12, 2022. The tornado caused significant damage and injured several people.\n\n# Non-Tornadic Effects\n\nIn addition to the tornadoes, the April 2022 North American storm complex brought a range of non-tornadic effects, including severe thunderstorms, freezing temperatures, and blizzard conditions.\n\n## Severe Storms\n\nThe storm complex brought a total of 137 severe thunderstorm reports across the central and southern United States. The most significant severe storms occurred on April 12, 2022, when a total of 57 severe thunderstorm reports were recorded.\n\n## Winter Weather Side\n\nThe storm complex brought a mass of cold air, which led to freezing temperatures and blizzard conditions in some areas.\n\n### Freezing Temperatures\n\nThe storm complex brought freezing temperatures to a wide range of areas, including parts of the Great Plains and the southern United States. The coldest temperatures were recorded in the Texas Panhandle, where temperatures dropped as low as -10°F (-23°C).\n\n### Blizzard\n\nThe storm complex brought blizzard conditions to parts of the Great Plains, including the states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The blizzard conditions were caused by a combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds, which made travel extremely hazardous.\n\n# Impact\n\nThe April 2022 North American storm complex had a significant impact on the central and southern United States.

The film serves as a sequel to the 2011 film Puss in Boots and the sixth installment in the Shrek franchise. The movie follows the titular character, Puss in Boots, as he faces a new adventure and grapples with his own mortality.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film takes place after the events of Puss in Boots (2011). Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) is now an older, wiser cat who has used up eight of his nine lives. He is struggling to come to terms with his own mortality and the fact that he will soon have to face his final adventure. One day, he meets a new enemy, the Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), a bounty hunter who is determined to kill Puss and collect the bounty on his head.\n\nPuss soon finds himself on a quest to find the Last Wish, a magical star that has the power to grant any wish. He is joined on his journey by Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek), a street-smart cat burglar, and Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillén), a therapy dog who becomes Puss's unlikely friend. Along the way, they face numerous obstacles, including treacherous landscapes, ferocious beasts, and treacherous foes.\n\nAs Puss navigates this perilous journey, he must also confront his own past and the mistakes he has made. He must come to terms with the fact that he is no longer the invincible hero he once was and that his time is running out. The film features a mix of action, adventure, comedy, and heart, as Puss in Boots faces his greatest challenge yet.\n\n# Voice cast\n\nThe film features an all-star voice cast, including:\n\n* Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots\n* Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws\n* Harvey Guillén as Perrito\n* Wagner Moura as the Wolf\n* Florence Pugh as Goldilocks\n* John Mulaney as Jack Horner\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Mama Bear\n* Samson Kayo as Papa Bear\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish was first announced in 2014, with Chris Meledandri, the founder of Illumination Entertainment, set to produce. However, the project was delayed due to various reasons, including the poor performance of the 2017 film The Emoji Movie and the departure of Meledandri from the project.\n\nIn 2018, it was announced that DreamWorks Animation had taken over the project, with Chris Miller set to direct and produce.

Anti-Zionism has taken many forms throughout history, from religious and ideological objections to political and social movements. This article provides an overview of the development of anti-Zionism before and after the creation of Israel in 1948.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n-------------------------\n\n### Early Jewish anti-Zionism\n\nJewish anti-Zionism has a long history, dating back to the late 19th century when Zionism first emerged as a movement. Some Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Spektor, opposed Zionism on the grounds that it was incompatible with Jewish tradition and would lead to the secularization of Jewish life. Others, such as the Jewish socialist movement, opposed Zionism as a form of nationalism that would distract from the class struggle.\n\n### Early Arab anti-Zionism\n\nArab anti-Zionism also emerged in the late 19th century, as Arab leaders began to recognize the threat that Zionism posed to their own nationalist aspirations. The Arab Congress of 1913, held in Paris, was one of the first major expressions of Arab opposition to Zionism. Arab leaders argued that Palestine was an integral part of the Arab world and that Jewish immigration would disrupt the demographic balance of the region.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1917, in which the British government expressed support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, sparked widespread outrage among Arab leaders. The declaration was seen as a betrayal of Arab trust and a threat to Arab self-determination. The Arab nationalist movement, which had been gaining momentum in the years leading up to World War I, became increasingly focused on opposing Zionism and the Balfour Declaration.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism continued to grow in both the Arab and Jewish communities. The Arab Revolt of 1936-1939, which was sparked by Arab opposition to Jewish immigration and land purchases, was one of the most significant expressions of anti-Zionism during this period. Jewish anti-Zionism also continued to evolve, with some Jewish leaders arguing that Zionism was incompatible with socialist or communist ideology.\n\n### The Biltmore programme and its anti-Zionism fall-out\n\nThe Biltmore programme, which was adopted by the World Zionist Organization in 1942, called for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth in Palestine. The programme was opposed by both Arab and Jewish anti-Zionists, who saw it as a threat to their respective nationalist aspirations.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious anti-Zionism has taken many forms throughout history. Some Christian denominations, such as the Quakers, have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is incompatible with Christian teachings on non-violence and social justice. Some Muslim leaders have also opposed Zionism, arguing that it is a form of colonialism that threatens the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the creation of Israel\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nThe period leading up to the creation of Israel in 1948 was marked by intense anti-Zionist activity. Arab leaders, who had long opposed Zionism, saw the creation of Israel as a threat to their nationalist aspirations. Jewish anti-Zionists, who had opposed the Biltmore programme, also continued to argue that Zionism was incompatible with Jewish tradition and would lead to the secularization of Jewish life.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union, which had initially supported the creation of Israel, soon became a major opponent of Zionism. The Soviet government saw Zionism as a form of nationalism that was incompatible with Marxist ideology. Soviet anti-Zionism was also motivated by a desire to gain influence in the Middle East and to undermine Western interests in the region.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian anti-Zionism continued to grow in the years following the creation of Israel. Arab leaders, who had opposed the creation of Israel, saw the new state as a threat to their nationalist aspirations. Palestinian leaders, who had been displaced by the creation of Israel, saw Zionism as a form of colonialism that had denied them their right to self-determination.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as racism\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, some anti-Zionist movements began to argue that Zionism was a form of racism. This perspective was influenced by the Black Power movement and the anti-colonial movement, which saw Zionism as a form of colonialism that threatened the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n#### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism became increasingly linked to anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Some anti-Zionist movements saw Zionism as a form of imperialism that threatened the rights of the Palestinian people. Others saw Zionism as a form of colonialism that was incompatible with socialist or communist ideology.\n\n#### After the Cold War\n\nAfter the Cold War, anti-Zionism continued to evolve. Some anti-Zionist movements began to focus on issues such as human rights and international law, arguing that Israel's treatment of the Palestinian people was a violation of these principles. Others continued to argue that Zionism was a form of racism or colonialism that threatened the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### Islamic perspectives\n\nIslamic perspectives on anti-Zionism are diverse and complex. Some Muslim leaders have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism that threatens the rights of the Palestinian people. Others have argued that Zionism is incompatible with Islamic teachings on justice and compassion.\n\n### Left-wing politics\n\nLeft-wing politics have played a significant role in the development of anti-Zionism. Some left-wing movements have seen Zionism as a form of nationalism that is incompatible with socialist or communist ideology. Others have argued that Zionism is a form of colonialism that threatens the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### Christian anti-Zionism\n\nChristian anti-Zionism has taken many forms throughout history. Some Christian denominations, such as the Quakers, have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is incompatible with Christian teachings on non-violence and social justice.\n\n#### Protestants\n\nProtestant anti-Zionism has been influenced by a range of factors, including Christian Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some Protestant denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church, have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is incompatible with Christian teachings on justice and compassion.\n\n#### Catholics\n\nCatholic anti-Zionism has also been influenced by a range of factors, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Christian teachings on justice and compassion. Some Catholic leaders, such as the Pope, have argued that Zionism is a form of nationalism that threatens the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### Haredi Judaism\n\nHaredi Judaism is a branch of Orthodox Judaism that has traditionally opposed Zionism. Haredi leaders have argued that Zionism is incompatible with Jewish tradition and will lead to the secularization of Jewish life.\n\nAllegations of antisemitism\n---------------------------\n\n### Jewish right to a state\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism have argued that it is incompatible with the Jewish right to a state. They argue that anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism that denies the Jewish people their right to self-determination.\n\n### Equating and correlating anti-Zionism with antisemitism\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism have argued that it is equivalent to antisemitism. They argue that anti-Zionism is a form of racism that targets the Jewish people and denies them their right to self-determination.\n\n### View that the two are not interlinked\n\nOthers have argued that anti-Zionism and antisemitism are not interlinked. They argue that anti-Zionism is a legitimate form of political discourse that is concerned with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\n### Shifting positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist spectrum\n\nSome individuals and groups have shifted their positions on the Zionist/anti-Zionist spectrum over time.

She grew up in a family of mixed Ukrainian and Russian heritage. After completing her secondary education, Ovsyannikova moved to Russia to pursue a career in journalism. She graduated from the Kuban State University in Krasnodar, where she studied journalism and philology.\n\nOvsyannikova began her career in journalism in the early 2000s, working as a reporter and editor for various Russian media outlets. In 2013, she joined Channel One Russia, one of the country's largest and most influential state-controlled television channels. Over the years, Ovsyannikova worked her way up the ranks, becoming a senior editor and producer for the channel's flagship news program, Vremya.\n\n# Anti-war protests\n\nOn March 14, 2022, Ovsyannikova staged an anti-war protest during a live broadcast of Vremya, holding a sign that read \"No War\" and \"Russians against war.\" The incident occurred while the channel's main news anchor, Ekaterina Andreeva, was reading the news. Ovsyannikova appeared on camera for several seconds, shouting \"Stop the war! Don't believe the propaganda! They're lying to you here!\"\n\n## Pre-recorded message\n\nBefore her on-air protest, Ovsyannikova had recorded a video message in which she explained her motivations for taking a stand against the war in Ukraine. In the message, she stated that she was ashamed to work for a channel that was spreading propaganda and lies about the war. She also expressed her concern about the impact of the war on ordinary Russians and Ukrainians.\n\n## Reactions\n\nOvsyannikova's protest sparked a mixture of reactions in Russia and around the world. Many Russians praised her courage and willingness to speak out against the war, while others condemned her actions as a betrayal of the country. The Russian government and state-controlled media outlets denounced Ovsyannikova as a traitor and a Western agent.\n\n## Persecutions and activism\n\nFollowing her on-air protest, Ovsyannikova was detained by Russian police and charged with violating a law against disseminating \"false information\" about the Russian military. She was released from custody after several hours, but not before being fined 30,000 rubles (approximately $350 USD).\n\nDespite the risks, Ovsyannikova continued to speak out against the war and the Russian government's actions. She gave interviews to international media outlets and participated in anti-war protests in Russia. In April 2022, she was awarded the Leipzig Prize for the Freedom and Future of the Media, a prestigious international award for courage in journalism.\n\n## Criticism\n\nSome critics have accused Ovsyannikova of being a hypocrite for having worked for Channel One Russia for many years before speaking out against the war. Others have questioned her motivations, suggesting that she was seeking to promote herself or gain international recognition.\n\n# Personal life\n\nOvsyannikova is married with two children. Her family has reportedly faced harassment and intimidation since her on-air protest, with some sources suggesting that they have been forced to go into hiding.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of Russian journalists\n* List of anti-war activists\n* Media freedom in Russia\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and does not include any confidential or proprietary sources.\n\n# References\n\n(Not included, as per the requirements)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"Marina Ovsyannikova: The Russian journalist who took a stand against the war\" (The Guardian)\n* \"The Courage of Marina Ovsyannikova\" (The New York Times)\n* \"Marina Ovsyannikova: A Russian journalist's anti-war protest\" (BBC News)\n\n# External links\n\n* Marina Ovsyannikova on Twitter\n* Marina Ovsyannikova on Instagram\n* Channel One Russia official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marina_Ovsyannikova\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and career\n#Anti-war protests\n##Pre-recorded message\n##Reactions\n##Persecutions and activism\n##Criticism\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The recognition of the DPR and LPR is a contentious issue, with some countries supporting their independence and others rejecting it.\n\n# History\n\nThe Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were declared in April 2014, following the Ukrainian revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The two regions, located in eastern Ukraine, have a significant Russian-speaking population and have historically been economically and culturally tied to Russia. The Ukrainian government, led by President Petro Poroshenko, has refused to recognize the DPR and LPR as independent states, viewing them as terrorist organizations.\n\nIn the years following their declaration, the DPR and LPR have received varying levels of support from Russia, which has been accused of providing military and financial aid to the separatist movements. The conflict between Ukrainian government forces and the DPR and LPR has resulted in thousands of deaths and displaced persons.\n\n# Aftermath of Russian recognition\n\nOn February 21, 2022, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as sovereign states, signing treaties of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the two republics. The move was widely condemned by the international community, with many countries viewing it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nIn response to Russia's recognition, the United States, the European Union, and other countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia. The Ukrainian government also severed diplomatic relations with Russia.\n\n# Countries and entities that recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n## UN member states\n\nRussia is the only UN member state to have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. However, several other countries have expressed support for the recognition of the two republics.\n\n## Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states, including Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria, have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These states are all located in the former Soviet Union and have their own separatist movements.\n\n# Positions by other countries\n\n## Countries and entities that supported recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n### UN member states\n\nSeveral UN member states, including Belarus, Cuba, and Syria, have expressed support for the recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states. These countries have historically been aligned with Russia and have supported its actions in Ukraine.\n\n## Countries and entities that did not support recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states\n\n### UN member states\n\nThe vast majority of UN member states have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. Many countries, including the United States, Canada, and the European Union member states, have condemned Russia's recognition of the two republics and have imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response.\n\n### Non-UN states\n\nSeveral non-UN states, including Taiwan and the Holy See, have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These states have historically been aligned with the West and have supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### International and regional organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These organizations have called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine and have supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n# See also\n\n* International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia\n* International recognition of Kosovo\n* International recognition of Transnistria\n* Russian annexation of Crimea\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual summary of the international recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic.

Rowling\n================\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling, better known by her pen name J.K. Rowling, is a British author, screenwriter, and philanthropist best known for writing the fantasy series Harry Potter. The Harry Potter series has become a cultural phenomenon, with the books being translated into over 80 languages and selling more than 500 million copies worldwide.\n\nName\n-----\n\nJoanne Kathleen Rowling was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She adopted the pen name J.K. Rowling, using her initials and her grandmother's surname, to maintain her personal life separate from her writing career.\n\nLife and Career\n----------------\n\n### Early life and family\n\nRowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Volant Rowling. Her father was a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and her mother was a science technician. She has a younger sister, Dianne. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, when Rowling was nine months old, and later to Tutshill, near Chepstow, when she was four years old.\n\nRowling's childhood was marked by poverty and her parents' marital problems. Her father, a member of the Church of England, had a strained relationship with his wife, who was a Catholic. The couple eventually separated when Rowling was a teenager.\n\n### Secondary school and university\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and later Wyedean Comprehensive School in Gloucestershire. She was an average student but excelled in English and languages. After completing her O-levels, she moved to London to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International.\n\nIn 1986, Rowling enrolled at the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. She spent a year abroad in Paris, teaching English as a foreign language. After graduating, she moved to London and worked as a researcher and secretary for various organizations.\n\n### Inspiration and mother's death\n\nRowling's mother died of multiple sclerosis in 1990, at the age of 45. This event had a profound impact on Rowling's writing. She began writing the first Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" in 1990, and the character of Harry's mother, Lily Potter, was inspired by her own mother.\n\n### Marriage, divorce, and single parenthood\n\nIn 1992, Rowling married Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes. The couple had a daughter, Jessica, in 1993. However, the marriage was short-lived, and they divorced in 1995. Rowling moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, with her daughter and struggled to make ends meet as a single parent.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling's manuscript for \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" was rejected by twelve publishers before Bloomsbury agreed to publish it in 1997. The book was published in the United States as \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" in 1998.\n\nThe success of the Harry Potter series was rapid and unprecedented. The books were translated into numerous languages, and the series became a cultural phenomenon.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter film series, produced by Warner Bros., consisted of eight movies released between 2001 and 2011. The films were based on the seven books in the series, with the last book being split into two films. The films were a critical and commercial success, grossing over $7.7 billion worldwide.\n\n### Religion, wealth, and remarriage\n\nRowling is a Christian and has stated that her faith has influenced her writing. She has also been open about her struggles with depression and the importance of her faith in helping her cope.\n\nIn 2001, Rowling married anesthesiologist Neil Murray. The couple has two sons, David and Mackenzie.\n\nRowling's wealth has been estimated at over $1 billion, making her one of the richest women in the world.\n\n### Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The book, a crime novel, received positive reviews and was later revealed to be written by Rowling.\n\nRowling has stated that she chose to write under a pseudonym to receive unbiased feedback and to prove that her writing could be successful without the influence of her Harry Potter fame.\n\n### Later Harry Potter works\n\nIn 2016, Rowling published \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" a two-part play set nineteen years after the events of the original series. The play was written in collaboration with Jack Thorne and John Tiffany.\n\nRowling has also published several companion books to the Harry Potter series, including \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" and \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\"\n\n### Children's stories\n\nRowling has published several children's books outside of the Harry Potter series, including \"The Ickabog\" and \"The Christmas Pig.\"\n\nInfluences\n------------\n\nRowling's writing has been influenced by various authors, including J.R.R. Tolkien, Philip Pullman, and Jane Austen.\n\nStyle and Themes\n-----------------\n\n### Style and allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by her use of vivid descriptions, complex characters, and intricate plotlines. She often incorporates allusions to mythology, folklore, and fairy tales into her stories.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's work often explores themes of friendship, love, prejudice, and the struggle between good and evil.\n\nReception\n------------\n\n### Gender and social division\n\nRowling's work has been praised for its portrayal of strong female characters and its exploration of social issues, such as poverty and prejudice.\n\nHowever, some critics have argued that the series perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces social divisions.\n\n### Religious reactions\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been the subject of controversy among some religious groups, who have accused Rowling of promoting witchcraft and paganism.\n\nLegacy\n--------\n\nRowling's work has had a significant impact on popular culture, inspiring countless fan art, fan fiction, and fan communities.\n\nRowling has also been recognized for her philanthropic work, particularly in the area of multiple sclerosis research and literacy programs.\n\nLegal Disputes\n----------------\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile legal disputes, including a lawsuit against her former agent and a dispute with a fan who attempted to publish a Harry Potter lexicon.\n\nPhilanthropy\n-------------\n\nRowling is a dedicated philanthropist, supporting various charities and causes, including multiple sclerosis research, literacy programs, and children's charities.\n\nViews\n------\n\n### Politics\n\nRowling has been vocal about her political views, supporting the Labour Party and advocating for social justice and human rights.\n\n### Press\n\nRowling has been critical of the press, particularly in regards to their treatment of her and her family.\n\n### Transgender people\n\nRowling has been criticized for her views on transgender people, which some have deemed transphobic.\n\nAwards and Honours\n-------------------\n\nRowling has received numerous awards and honors for her work, including the National Book Award, the Hugo Award, and the Order of the British Empire.\n\nBibliography\n-------------\n\n* \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (1997)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (1998)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (1999)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2000)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2003)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" (2005)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" (2007)\n* \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" (2013)\n* \"The Ickabog\" (2020)\n* \"The Christmas Pig\" (2021)\n\nFilmography\n------------\n\n### Film\n\n* \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (2001)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (2002)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (2004)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2005)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" (2007)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" (2009)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\" (2010)\n* \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" (2011)\n\n### Television\n\n* \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" (2016)\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nWorks Cited\n------------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"J._K._Rowling\" following this outline:\n\n#Name\n#Life and career\n##Early life and family\n##Secondary school and university\n##Inspiration and mother's death\n##Marriage, divorce and single parenthood\n##Publishing Harry Potter\n##Films\n##Religion, wealth and remarriage\n##Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n##Later Harry Potter works\n##Children's stories\n#Influences\n#Style and themes\n##Style and allusions\n##Themes\n#Reception\n##Gender and social division\n##Religious reactions\n#Legacy\n#Legal disputes\n#Philanthropy\n#Views\n##Politics\n##Press\n##Transgender people\n#Awards and honours\n#Bibliography\n#Filmography\n##Film\n##Television\n#Notes\n#References\n#Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the modern era, Russian cinema has produced some of the most influential and acclaimed films in the world. This article provides an overview of the development of Russian cinema, from its early beginnings to the present day.\n\n#Cinema of the Russian Empire\n\nThe first film screenings in Russia took place in 1896, and by the early 1900s, cinema had become a popular form of entertainment. During this period, Russian filmmakers began to produce their own films, often using French and German equipment and techniques. One of the earliest Russian filmmakers was Aleksandr Drankov, who produced the first Russian film, \"Stenka Razin,\" in 1908.\n\nThe Russian Empire's film industry continued to grow, with the establishment of film studios such as the Khanzhonkov Company and the Pathe-Russian Company. These studios produced a range of films, including documentaries, newsreels, and feature films. Some notable films from this period include \"The Defense of Sevastopol\" (1911) and \"The Miracle Worker\" (1912).\n\n#Cinema of the Soviet Union\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 marked a significant turning point in the development of Russian cinema. The new Soviet government recognized the potential of film as a tool for propaganda and education, and began to invest heavily in the film industry.\n\n##Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n\nDuring the early years of the Soviet Union, cinema was used as a means of promoting the new government's ideology. Films such as \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) and \"October\" (1928) were produced to commemorate the revolution and to promote the ideals of socialism. These films were often experimental in style, using innovative techniques such as montage and close-ups to convey their message.\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of the \"Socialist Realist\" movement in Soviet cinema, which emphasized the depiction of everyday life in the Soviet Union. Films such as \"The Jolly Fellows\" (1934) and \"Volga-Volga\" (1938) were produced to promote the idea of a happy and prosperous Soviet society.\n\n##Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953, Soviet cinema began to diversify, with filmmakers exploring new styles and themes. The 1960s saw the rise of the \"New Wave\" movement, which emphasized the use of innovative techniques and experimental storytelling. Films such as \"The Man with a Movie Camera\" (1960) and \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966) were produced during this period.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the \"Blockbuster\" film in the Soviet Union, with films such as \"Moscow-Cassiopeia\" (1973) and \"The White Sun of the Desert\" (1970) becoming hugely popular. These films often used science fiction and adventure themes to promote the ideals of socialism.\n\n#New Russian cinema\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a significant turning point in the development of Russian cinema. The new Russian government introduced market reforms, which led to a decline in state funding for film production. However, this also led to an increase in private investment and the emergence of new filmmakers.\n\n##1990s\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of a new generation of Russian filmmakers, who were influenced by Western cinema and who began to explore new themes and styles. Films such as \"The Day of the Full Moon\" (1998) and \"Khrustalyov, My Car!\" (1998) were produced during this period.\n\n##2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw the rise of the \"Blockbuster\" film in Russia, with films such as \"Night Watch\" (2004) and \"Day Watch\" (2006) becoming hugely popular. These films often used science fiction and fantasy themes to appeal to a wider audience.\n\n##2010s\n\nThe 2010s saw the rise of a new generation of Russian filmmakers, who were influenced by international cinema and who began to explore new themes and styles. Films such as \"How I Ended This Summer\" (2010) and \"Leviathan\" (2014) were produced during this period.\n\n##2020s\n\nThe 2020s have seen a continued growth in the Russian film industry, with films such as \"The Blackout\" (2020) and \"The Conference\" (2020) becoming popular.\n\n###2022 boycott\n\nIn 2022, a number of Western film studios and distributors announced that they would be boycotting the Russian film industry, in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. This has had a significant impact on the Russian film industry, with many films being delayed or cancelled.\n\n#Russian film production\n\nRussia has a thriving film production industry, with a number of major studios and production companies.\n\n##Leading production companies on the market\n\nSome of the leading production companies in Russia include:\n\n* Central Partnership\n* STV Film Company\n* 20th Century Fox CIS\n* Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing\n\n##List of highest-grossing films\n\nSome of the highest-grossing films in Russia include:\n\n* \"Stalingrad\" (2013) - $68 million\n* \"Leviathan\" (2014) - $4.5 million\n* \"Hardcore Henry\" (2015) - $12.5 million\n* \"The Blackout\" (2020) - $10 million\n\n##Film distribution\n\nRussia has a number of major film distributors, including:\n\n* Central Partnership\n* STV Film Company\n* 20th Century Fox CIS\n* Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing\n\n#Awards\n\nRussia has a number of major film awards, including:\n\n* Nika Awards\n* Golden Eagle Awards\n* Kinotavr Film Festival\n* Moscow International Film Festival\n\n#Festivals\n\nRussia has a number of major film festivals, including:\n\n* Moscow International Film Festival\n* Kinotavr Film Festival\n* St. Petersburg International Film Festival\n* Sochi International Film Festival\n\n#VOD platforms\n\nRussia has a number of major VOD platforms, including:\n\n* ivi.ru\n* Okko\n* Megogo\n* Amediateka\n\n#Cinematography schools\n\nRussia has a number of major cinematography schools, including:\n\n* Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography\n* Russian State University of Cinematography\n* Moscow Film School\n* St. Petersburg State University of Film and Television\n\n#See also\n\n* Cinema of the Soviet Union\n* Russian New Wave\n* List of Russian films\n* List of Soviet films\n\n#References\n\n* (Note: References will be added in the future)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* (Note: Further reading will be added in the future)\n\n#External links\n\n* (Note: External links will be added in the future)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cinema_of_Russia\" following this outline:\n\n#Cinema of the Russian Empire\n#Cinema of the Soviet Union\n##Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)\n##Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)\n#New Russian cinema\n##1990s\n##2000s\n##2010s\n##2020s\n###2022 boycott\n#Russian film production\n##Leading production companies on the market\n##List of highest-grossing films\n##Film distribution\n#Awards\n#Festivals\n#VOD platforms\n#Cinematography schools\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his 30-year tenure in WWE, where he established himself as one of the most iconic and beloved figures in professional wrestling history.\n\n# Early life\nMark Calaway was born on March 24, 1965, in Houston, Texas. He grew up in a middle-class family with his parents, Frank and Catherine Calaway, and his four siblings. Calaway was an athletic child and played basketball and football in high school. After graduating, he attended Angelina College in Lufkin, Texas, where he played basketball and earned an associate's degree.\n\n# Professional wrestling career\n\n## Early career (1987–1989)\nCalaway began his professional wrestling career in 1987, working for various independent promotions in Texas. He adopted the ring name \"Texas Red\" and developed a character that was a mix of a cowboy and a villain. In 1989, Calaway joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he worked as a jobber and developed his skills.\n\n## World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990)\nCalaway's time in WCW was marked by a series of uneventful matches and a lack of character development. He left the promotion in 1990 and joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which would eventually become World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).\n\n## World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE\n\n### Debut of The Undertaker (1990–1991)\nCalaway made his WWF debut on November 22, 1990, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event. He was introduced as The Undertaker, a character that was a mix of a mortician and a supernatural being. The character was created by WWF owner Vince McMahon, who wanted to create a wrestler that would be a cross between a villain and a superhero.\n\n### WWF Champion and beginning of The Streak (1991–1994)\nThe Undertaker quickly became a fan favorite and won his first WWF Championship in 1991. He held the title for several months before losing it to Hulk Hogan. The Undertaker then began a feud with Hogan, which culminated in a match at the 1991 Survivor Series. The match marked the beginning of The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania, which would become a hallmark of his career.\n\n### Rebirthed Deadman (1994–1996)\nIn 1994, The Undertaker's character underwent a significant transformation. He began to incorporate more supernatural elements into his character and developed a new gimmick that was centered around his ability to rise from the dead. This period of his career is often referred to as the \"Rebirthed Deadman\" era.\n\n### Lord of Darkness (1996–1998)\nIn 1996, The Undertaker's character took a darker turn. He became known as the \"Lord of Darkness\" and began to incorporate more occult elements into his character.

The case is related to Trump's alleged involvement in a scheme to pay hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. This article provides an overview of the background, initial proceedings, pre-trial proceedings, trial, and post-trial proceedings of the case.\n\n# Background\n\n## Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal\n\nIn 2016, adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006. Trump denied the affair, but it was later revealed that his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had paid Daniels $130,000 in hush money to keep the affair quiet during the presidential campaign.\n\n## Manhattan DA investigation and grand jury\n\nIn 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney's office launched an investigation into Trump's involvement in the hush money scheme. The investigation was led by District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and involved a grand jury, which was impaneled to hear evidence and determine whether Trump should be indicted.\n\n## Eligibility for president\n\nThe prosecution of Trump in New York has raised questions about his eligibility to run for president in the future.

The motion was denied, and the trial judge remained on the case.\n\n## Request for removal to federal court\n\nIn July 2023, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to remove the case to federal court, arguing that the charges involved federal crimes and that the federal courts had jurisdiction over the case.

The group has been at the center of controversy due to its alleged neo-Nazi ideology and human rights abuses.\n\n# History\n\n## Background and founding, February–April 2014\n\nThe Azov Brigade was formed in February 2014, during the Ukrainian revolution, as a response to the perceived weakness of the Ukrainian government in the face of Russian aggression. The group's founders were members of the Patriot of Ukraine organization, a far-right nationalist group that had been active in Ukraine since the 2000s. The Azov Brigade's initial goal was to defend Ukraine's territorial integrity and promote Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n## Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\n\nIn May 2014, the Azov Brigade was officially registered as a Special Tasks Patrol Police unit, allowing its members to receive training and equipment from the Ukrainian government. This move was seen as an attempt by the Ukrainian authorities to co-opt and regulate the activities of far-right groups like Azov.\n\n## Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\n\nIn November 2014, the Azov Brigade was reorganized and incorporated into the National Guard of Ukraine, a paramilitary force that operates under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This move gave the Azov Brigade access to greater resources and training, but also subjected it to greater oversight and control by the Ukrainian government.\n\n## Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\n\nIn January 2015, the Azov Brigade was involved in the Battle of Shyrokyne, a clash with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. The battle was widely seen as a key moment in the war, as it marked a significant escalation of the conflict and highlighted the Ukrainian government's willingness to use force to defend its territory.\n\n## 2016–2019\n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, the Azov Brigade continued to play a significant role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The group was involved in numerous battles and skirmishes with Russian-backed separatists, and its members were widely praised for their bravery and military skills.\n\n## Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n### Defense of Mariupol\n\nIn February 2022, the Azov Brigade played a key role in the defense of Mariupol, a strategic port city in eastern Ukraine that was besieged by Russian forces. The group's members fought bravely, but were ultimately forced to retreat to the city's Azovstal steel plant, where they continued to resist the Russian advance.\n\n### Other 'Azov' units\n\nIn addition to the Azov Brigade, there are several other units that operate under the Azov name. These include the Azov Regiment, which is part of the Ukrainian National Guard, and the Azov Battalion, which is a volunteer unit that operates under the authority of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.\n\n# Leadership and organisation\n\n## Commanders\n\nThe Azov Brigade has had several commanders since its founding in 2014. The group's first commander was Andriy Biletsky, a far-right nationalist who was instrumental in the group's formation. In 2016, Biletsky was replaced by Maksym Zhorin, who led the group until 2020. The current commander of the Azov Brigade is Denys Prokopenko.\n\n## Status\n\nThe Azov Brigade is officially recognized as a Special Tasks Patrol Police unit by the Ukrainian government. However, the group's status is somewhat ambiguous, as it operates outside of the normal chain of command and is not subject to the same level of oversight as other Ukrainian military units.\n\n## Foreign fighters\n\nThe Azov Brigade has attracted a significant number of foreign fighters since its founding in 2014. These fighters come from a variety of countries, including the United States, Canada, and Europe. The group's foreign fighters are often motivated by a desire to fight against Russian aggression and to promote Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n# Azov movement\n\n## Azov Civil Corps\n\nThe Azov Civil Corps is a civilian organization that is affiliated with the Azov Brigade. The group's goal is to promote Ukrainian nationalism and to support the activities of the Azov Brigade.\n\n## National Corps\n\nThe National Corps is a far-right nationalist party that was founded by Andriy Biletsky, the former commander of the Azov Brigade. The party's goal is to promote Ukrainian nationalism and to challenge the Ukrainian government's policies on issues such as corruption and national security.\n\n## Youth Corps\n\nThe Youth Corps is a youth organization that is affiliated with the Azov Brigade. The group's goal is to promote Ukrainian nationalism and to support the activities of the Azov Brigade.\n\n## National Militia, 2017–2020\n\nThe National Militia was a paramilitary organization that was affiliated with the Azov Brigade. The group's goal was to promote Ukrainian nationalism and to support the activities of the Azov Brigade. The National Militia was disbanded in 2020 due to concerns about its links to far-right extremism.\n\n## Centuria\n\nCenturia is a far-right nationalist organization that is affiliated with the Azov Brigade. The group's goal is to promote Ukrainian nationalism and to challenge the Ukrainian government's policies on issues such as corruption and national security.\n\n# Human rights violations\n\nThe Azov Brigade has been accused of numerous human rights violations since its founding in 2014. These include allegations of torture, extrajudicial killings, and forced conscription. The group has also been accused of promoting far-right ideology and of inciting violence against minority groups.\n\n# Neo-Nazism allegations\n\nThe Azov Brigade has been accused of promoting neo-Nazi ideology and of having links to far-right extremist groups. These allegations have been denied by the group's leadership, who claim that Azov is a patriotic organization that is dedicated to defending Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\n## Connection to antisemitism\n\nThe Azov Brigade has been accused of having links to antisemitic groups and of promoting antisemitic ideology. These allegations have been denied by the group's leadership, who claim that Azov is a tolerant organization that welcomes members from all backgrounds.\n\n# International arms and training controversies\n\n## United States\n\nThe Azov Brigade has received training and equipment from the United States, which has raised concerns about the group's links to far-right extremism. In 2018, the US Congress passed a bill that prohibited the use of US funds to train or equip the Azov Brigade.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe Azov Brigade has also received training and equipment from Canada, which has raised concerns about the group's links to far-right extremism. In 2020, the Canadian government announced that it would no longer provide training or equipment to the Azov Brigade.\n\n## Israel\n\nThe Azov Brigade has received training and equipment from Israel, which has raised concerns about the group's links to far-right extremism. In 2018, the Israeli government announced that it would no longer provide training or equipment to the Azov Brigade.\n\n## Greece\n\nThe Azov Brigade has received training and equipment from Greece, which has raised concerns about the group's links to far-right extremism. In 2020, the Greek government announced that it would no longer provide training or equipment to the Azov Brigade.\n\n# Use in Russian propaganda and information campaigns\n\n## Pre-2022\n\nThe Azov Brigade has been the subject of numerous Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns since its founding in 2014. These campaigns have sought to portray the group as a neo-Nazi organization that is dedicated to promoting Ukrainian nationalism and challenging Russian influence in Ukraine.\n\n## Russian invasion\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Azov Brigade was heavily featured in Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns. These campaigns sought to portray the group as a key obstacle to Russian victory and to justify the Russian government's decision to launch a military invasion of Ukraine.\n\n# Sham trials in Russia\n\nIn 2022, several members of the Azov Brigade were put on trial in Russia, where they were accused of war crimes and terrorism. The trials were widely seen as sham proceedings that were designed to justify the Russian government's actions in Ukraine.\n\n# See also\n\n* Russo-Ukrainian War\n* National Guard of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian nationalism\n* Far-right extremism in Ukraine\n\n# References\n\n# Notes\n\n# Further reading\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Azov_Brigade\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background and founding, February–April 2014\n##Special Tasks Patrol Police, May 2014\n##Reorganisation and incorporation into the National Guard of Ukraine, November 2014\n##Battle of Shyrokyne, January 2015\n##2016–2019\n##Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Defense of Mariupol\n###Other 'Azov' units\n#Leadership and organisation\n##Commanders\n##Status\n##Foreign fighters\n#Azov movement\n##Azov Civil Corps\n##National Corps\n##Youth Corps\n##National Militia, 2017–2020\n##Centuria\n#Human rights violations\n#Neo-Nazism allegations\n##Connection to antisemitism\n#International arms and training controversies\n##United States\n##Canada\n##Israel\n##Greece\n#Use in Russian propaganda and information campaigns\n##Pre-2022\n##Russian invasion\n#Sham trials in Russia\n#See also\n#References\n#Notes\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film's narrative revolves around the alleged forced conversion of three women from Kerala to Islam and their subsequent radicalization. The film's release sparked controversy and public debate, with some hailing it as a bold exposé and others criticizing it as a propagandist and Islamophobic work.\n\nPlot\n-----\n\nThe Kerala Story follows the lives of three women from Kerala, a state in southwestern India, who allegedly convert to Islam and become radicalized. The film's narrative is presented as a dramatization of real-life events, with the three women, Shalini, Asifa, and Leela, portrayed as victims of a larger conspiracy. As the story unfolds, the women become increasingly disillusioned with their lives and are eventually drawn to Islamist ideologies. The film's climax depicts the women's alleged involvement in terrorist activities.\n\nCast\n-----\n\n* Adah Sharma as Shalini\n* Yogita Bihani as Asifa\n* Siddhi Idnani as Leela\n\nProduction and release\n----------------------\n\nThe Kerala Story was directed by Sudipto Sen and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah. The film's production was reportedly inspired by the true stories of several women from Kerala who converted to Islam and became radicalized. The film was released on May 5, 2023, in theaters across India.\n\nPremise and factual accuracy\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Kerala Story's premise has been widely questioned, with many critics arguing that the film's narrative is based on unverified and exaggerated claims. The film's portrayal of the three women's conversions and radicalization has been criticized as sensationalized and inaccurate. Some have also pointed out that the film's narrative bears a striking resemblance to earlier reports of alleged \"love jihad\" cases in Kerala, which were later debunked as baseless.\n\nResponse and Controversy\n----------------------\n\nThe Kerala Story's release sparked widespread controversy and public debate. The film's supporters hailed it as a bold exposé of the alleged forced conversion of women to Islam, while its critics condemned it as a propagandist and Islamophobic work.\n\n### Promotion by ruling party\n\nThe film's release was actively promoted by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been accused of using the film as a tool to further its own ideological agenda. BJP leaders and supporters took to social media to promote the film, with some even calling for a boycott of Muslim-owned businesses.\n\n### Political opposition\n\nThe opposition Indian National Congress (INC) and other parties condemned the film as a propagandist work that aimed to divide society along communal lines. INC leaders accused the BJP of using the film to whip up anti-Muslim sentiment and distract from more pressing issues.\n\n### Public protests\n\nThe film's release sparked public protests across India, with many Muslims and secular activists taking to the streets to condemn the film as Islamophobic and propagandist. Protesters called for a ban on the film and demanded action against those responsible for promoting hate speech.\n\n### Bans and litigation\n\nThe film was banned in several states, including Kerala and Tamil Nadu, following widespread protests and concerns about public safety. The film's producers and director were also slapped with lawsuits, with some petitioners alleging that the film promoted hate speech and incited violence against Muslims.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Critical reception\n\nThe Kerala Story received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its bold narrative and others condemning it as a propagandist and Islamophobic work. Critics praised the film's technical aspects, including its cinematography and editing, but panned its narrative as sensationalized and inaccurate.\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film performed moderately well at the box office, despite the controversy surrounding its release. The film's producers reportedly earned significant profits, despite the bans and litigation.\n\nMusic\n------\n\nThe Kerala Story's soundtrack was composed by Vipin Patwa and featured several popular playback singers. The film's music received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its catchy tunes and others panning it as forgettable.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Islamophobia in India\n* Love jihad\n* Radicalization in India\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Kerala_Story\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production and release\n#Premise and factual accuracy\n#Response and Controversy\n##Promotion by ruling party\n##Political opposition\n##Public protests\n##Bans and litigation\n#Reception\n##Critical reception\n##Box office\n#Music\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, with a focus on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of planetary systems, and the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy. The JWST is the largest and most complex space telescope ever built, with a segmented primary mirror and a sunshield to keep its instruments cool.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### Location and orbit\n\nThe JWST is located at the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. L2 is a gravitationally stable location where the telescope can maintain a stable temperature and avoid the thermal and light interference from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The JWST will orbit the L2 point in a halo orbit, which will keep it in a stable position relative to the Sun and Earth.\n\n### Sunshield protection\n\nThe JWST is equipped with a sunshield that is designed to keep its instruments at a temperature of around -240°C. The sunshield is made up of five layers of a material called Kapton, which is a type of plastic film. The sunshield is deployed in a complex process that involves the unfolding of the layers and the tensioning of the material to create a stable and efficient heat shield.\n\n### Optics\n\nThe JWST has a segmented primary mirror that is made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors. The mirrors are made of beryllium and are coated with a thin layer of gold to reflect infrared light. The primary mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter and is designed to collect and focus light from distant objects. The JWST also has a secondary mirror that is used to focus the light from the primary mirror onto the instruments.\n\n### Scientific instruments\n\nThe JWST has four main scientific instruments: the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS). These instruments are designed to conduct a wide range of astronomical observations, including imaging, spectroscopy, and coronagraphy.\n\n### Spacecraft bus\n\nThe JWST spacecraft bus is the main structure of the telescope that supports the instruments and provides power, communication, and other essential systems. The spacecraft bus is designed to be highly stable and to maintain a precise temperature control to ensure the optimal performance of the instruments.\n\n### Servicing\n\nThe JWST is not designed to be serviced by astronauts, unlike the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the JWST is designed to be highly maintainable and can be repaired and upgraded remotely through a process called \" remote maintenance\".\n\n### Software\n\nThe JWST software is designed to control the telescope and its instruments, and to process the data collected by the telescope. The software is highly complex and is designed to be highly reliable and fault-tolerant.\n\nComparison with other telescopes\n-------------------------------\n\nThe JWST is the largest and most complex space telescope ever built, with a segmented primary mirror and a sunshield to keep its instruments cool. It is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, with a focus on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of planetary systems, and the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy. The JWST is more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been in operation since 1990, and is designed to make new discoveries that were not possible with previous telescopes.\n\nDevelopment history\n-----------------\n\n### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe JWST was first proposed in the 1990s as a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) and was designed to conduct infrared astronomy. The NGST was later renamed the James Webb Space Telescope in 2002, in honor of James E. Webb, the second administrator of NASA.\n\n### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nThe development of the JWST began in earnest in 2003, with the awarding of a contract to Northrop Grumman to build the telescope. However, the development of the JWST was delayed due to technical and budgetary issues, and the project was replanned in 2005. The replanning involved a significant reduction in the scope of the project and a delay in the launch date.\n\n### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nThe detailed design and construction of the JWST began in 2007, with the completion of the primary mirror and the sunshield. The JWST was assembled at the Northrop Grumman facility in Los Angeles, California, and was shipped to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for testing and integration.\n\n### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST has experienced significant cost and schedule issues during its development. The project was initially estimated to cost $3.5 billion and to be launched in 2011. However, the project has experienced numerous delays and cost overruns, and the current estimated cost is over $8.7 billion.\n\n### Partnership\n\nThe JWST is a partnership between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The ESA is providing the Ariane 5 rocket that will launch the JWST, while the CSA is providing the Fine Guidance Sensor.\n\n### Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST has been the subject of controversy due to concerns over the naming of the telescope. Some scientists have expressed concerns that the telescope was named after James E. Webb, who was a segregationist and who had a complex and controversial history.\n\nMission goals\n-------------\n\n### Orbit design\n\nThe JWST is designed to orbit the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. L2 is a gravitationally stable location where the telescope can maintain a stable temperature and avoid the thermal and light interference from the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\n### Infrared astronomy\n\nThe JWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, with a focus on the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the evolution of planetary systems, and the formation of stars and planetary systems in our own galaxy. The JWST is equipped with a segmented primary mirror and a sunshield to keep its instruments cool.\n\nGround support and operations\n-----------------------------\n\n### Micrometeoroid strike\n\nThe JWST is designed to withstand micrometeoroid strikes, which could potentially damage the telescope. The JWST is equipped with a protective shield that is designed to absorb the impact of micrometeoroids.\n\nFrom launch through commissioning\n--------------------------------\n\n### Launch\n\nThe JWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n### Transit and structural deployment\n\nAfter launch, the JWST began its transit to the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The JWST deployed its solar array and its high-gain antenna, and began its series of complex deployments, including the deployment of the sunshield and the primary mirror.\n\n### Commissioning and testing\n\nAfter arriving at L2, the JWST began its commissioning and testing phase. The JWST underwent a series of tests to ensure that its instruments and systems were functioning properly.\n\nAllocation of observation time\n-----------------------------\n\n### Early Release Science program\n\nThe Early Release Science program is a series of observations that are designed to provide a glimpse into the capabilities of the JWST. The program includes a series of observations of the Carina Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, and the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723.\n\n### General Observer Program\n\nThe General Observer Program is a series of observations that are designed to provide astronomers with access to the JWST. The program includes a series of observations of a wide range of astronomical objects, including stars, galaxies, and planetary systems.\n\nScientific results\n-----------------\n\n### First full-color images\n\nThe JWST released its first full-color images on July 11, 2022, including images of the Carina Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, and the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723.\n\n### Bright early galaxies\n\nThe JWST has discovered a number of bright early galaxies, including the galaxy GN-z11, which is seen as it was just 400 million years after the Big Bang.\n\n### Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n\nThe JWST has made a number of subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of a distant exoplanet, and the observation of the formation of stars in the Carina Nebula.\n\n### Gallery\n\n* Image of the Carina Nebula, taken by the JWST.\n* Image of the Southern Ring Nebula, taken by the JWST.\n* Image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, taken by the JWST.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Spitzer Space Telescope\n* European Space Agency\n* Canadian Space Agency\n* NASA\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Webb_Space_Telescope\" following this outline:\n\n#Features\n##Location and orbit\n##Sunshield protection\n##Optics\n##Scientific instruments\n##Spacecraft bus\n##Servicing\n##Software\n#Comparison with other telescopes\n#Development history\n##Background (development to 2003)\n##Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n##Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n##Cost and schedule issues\n##Partnership\n##Naming concerns\n#Mission goals\n##Orbit design\n##Infrared astronomy\n#Ground support and operations\n##Micrometeoroid strike\n#From launch through commissioning\n##Launch\n##Transit and structural deployment\n##Commissioning and testing\n#Allocation of observation time\n##Early Release Science program\n##General Observer Program\n#Scientific results\n##First full-color images\n##Bright early galaxies\n##Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n##Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The island has been influenced by various civilizations, including indigenous peoples, European colonizers, and African slaves, resulting in a unique blend of traditions and customs. This article will explore the geography, history, society, and legacy of Dzuluinicob, shedding light on its fascinating past and its importance in the modern world.\n\n#Geography\n\n##Physical\n\nDzuluinicob is a small island, measuring approximately 10 kilometers in length and 5 kilometers in width. It is situated in the northeastern part of the Caribbean Sea, about 50 kilometers north of the island of Martinique. The island's terrain is rugged, with steep hills and valleys, and its coastline is characterized by rocky cliffs and secluded beaches. The climate is tropical, with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The island is also prone to hurricanes, which can have devastating effects on the local ecosystem and infrastructure.\n\n##Political\n\nDzuluinicob is a dependency of the French overseas department of Martinique, and as such, it is subject to French law and administration. The island has a small population, estimated to be around 500 people, who live in a few small villages and hamlets. The local government is responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, while the French authorities provide support and funding for development projects.\n\n#History\n\n##Pre-Columbian\n\nThe first inhabitants of Dzuluinicob were indigenous peoples, who migrated to the island from the mainland hundreds of years ago. These early settlers were skilled hunter-gatherers and fishermen, and they developed a thriving community based on subsistence farming and trade with neighboring islands. The island's rich natural resources, including fertile soil, abundant fish, and fresh water, made it an attractive place to live and settle.\n\n##Columbian\n\nIn the 15th century, Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, and Dzuluinicob became a stopping point for European explorers and colonizers. The Spanish established a settlement on the island, which they used as a base for further exploration and conquest. However, the harsh climate and lack of resources led to the decline of the Spanish settlement, and the island was eventually abandoned.\n\nIn the 17th century, the French established a new settlement on Dzuluinicob, which they used as a base for their colonial expansion in the Caribbean. The French brought enslaved Africans to the island, who were forced to work on plantations producing sugar, coffee, and other crops. The transatlantic slave trade had a profound impact on the island's population and culture, shaping the course of its history for centuries to come.\n\n#Society\n\nDzuluinicob's society is characterized by a unique blend of indigenous, African, and European traditions. The island's small population is close-knit, with many families tracing their ancestry back to the original settlers. The local culture is rich and vibrant, with a strong emphasis on music, dance, and storytelling.\n\nThe island's economy is largely based on subsistence farming and fishing, with many families growing their own food and catching their own fish. However, the island also has a small but growing tourism industry, with visitors drawn to its stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Scholarly\n\nDzuluinicob has been the subject of extensive scholarly research, particularly in the fields of anthropology, history, and ecology. The island's unique cultural and environmental heritage has attracted researchers from around the world, who have studied its indigenous peoples, colonial history, and natural resources.\n\nThe island's legacy also extends beyond its academic significance, with its cultural and natural resources inspiring artists, writers, and musicians. Dzuluinicob's stunning landscapes and vibrant culture have been celebrated in literature, art, and music, ensuring its place in the imagination of people around the world.\n\n#Notes and references\n\n##Explanatory footnotes\n\nThis section would normally include explanatory footnotes that provide additional information or clarification on specific points in the article.\n\n##Short citations\n\nThis section would normally include short citations that provide a brief reference to sources used in the article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dzuluinicob\" following this outline:\n\n#Geography\n##Physical\n##Political\n#History\n##Pre-Columbian\n##Columbian\n#Society\n#Legacy\n##Scholarly\n#Notes and references\n##Explanatory footnotes\n##Short citations\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is based on the true story of the Agojie, an all-female military unit that protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey in the 19th century. The film stars Viola Davis, Thuso Mbedu, and Lashana Lynch, and follows the story of a young Agojie recruit who rises through the ranks to become a legendary warrior.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film is set in the 19th century, during the reign of King Ghezo of Dahomey. The story follows Nawi, a young woman who is brought to the palace as a gift to the king. Instead of being chosen as a concubine, Nawi is selected to join the Agojie, an elite all-female military unit that serves as the king's bodyguards. Under the guidance of the Agojie's leader, General Nanisca, Nawi undergoes rigorous training and proves herself to be a skilled and fierce warrior.\n\nAs Nawi rises through the ranks, she becomes embroiled in a conflict between the Dahomey kingdom and the neighboring kingdom of Oyo. The Oyo kingdom is seeking to conquer Dahomey and enslave its people, and the Agojie are determined to defend their kingdom at all costs. Along the way, Nawi must confront her own past and the secrets that have haunted her since childhood.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Viola Davis as General Nanisca, the leader of the Agojie\n* Thuso Mbedu as Nawi, a young Agojie recruit\n* Lashana Lynch as Izogie, a seasoned Agojie warrior\n* Sheila Atim as Amenza, a skilled Agojie fighter\n* Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as Santo Ferreira, a Portuguese slave trader\n* John Boyega as King Ghezo, the ruler of Dahomey\n* Jordan Bolger as Malik, a Dahomey prince\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe Woman King was first announced in 2015, with Maria Bello set to star and direct. However, the project stalled, and the film was redeveloped with Gina Prince-Bythewood at the helm. Prince-Bythewood was drawn to the project because of the opportunity to tell a story about powerful women in Africa. \"I wanted to make a film that celebrated the strength and resilience of women, and the Agojie are a fascinating and little-known part of history,\" she said.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in November 2021, in South Africa. The film was shot on location in various parts of the country, including the cities of Cape Town and Johannesburg. The cast underwent extensive training to prepare for the physically demanding roles, including martial arts and sword fighting.\n\n## Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film began in early 2022, with editor Terilyn A. Shropshire working closely with Prince-Bythewood to shape the final cut. The film's score was composed by Terence Blanchard, who incorporated traditional African music and instruments into the soundtrack.\n\n# Release\n\nThe Woman King premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation. The film was released in theaters on September 16, 2022, by Sony Pictures Releasing.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nThe Woman King was a commercial success, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The film performed particularly well in the United States, where it opened at number one at the box office.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe Woman King received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's action sequences, cinematography, and performances. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% approval rating, based on 200 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"The Woman King is a thrilling and emotionally resonant epic that celebrates the strength and resilience of women in Africa.\"\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe Woman King has received several awards and nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Actress (Viola Davis) and Best Original Score.\n\n# Historical accuracy\n\nThe Woman King is based on real historical events, but some artistic liberties were taken to enhance the storytelling and characters. The Agojie were a real military unit that existed in the Dahomey kingdom, and they were known for their bravery and fighting skills.\n\n## Characters\n\nWhile the main characters in the film are fictional, they are inspired by real women who served in the Agojie. General Nanisca, for example, is a composite character based on several different Agojie leaders.\n\n## Role in slavery\n\nThe film depicts the Agojie fighting against the slave trade, which is accurate. The Dahomey kingdom was a major player in the transatlantic slave trade, and the Agojie were involved in battles against European slave traders.\n\n# Controversy\n\nThe Woman King has been the subject of some controversy, with some critics accusing the film of glossing over the Dahomey kingdom's role in the slave trade. Others have criticized the film's portrayal of the Agojie as overly simplistic or stereotypical.\n\n# Notes\n\n* The Woman King is the first major Hollywood film to feature an all-female military unit as the main characters.\n* The film's costume designer, Gersha Phillips, won an award for her work on the film's costumes, which were inspired by traditional African clothing.\n* The film's score was performed by the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra, which featured several African musicians.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# Further reading\n\n* \"The Woman King: The Agojie of Dahomey\" by Wives of Shaka\n* \"African Queens: An Encyclopedia of Kingdoms, Empires, and Women of Power\" by Kathryn Lasky\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website\n* The Woman King on IMDb\n* The Woman King on Rotten Tomatoes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Woman_King\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Post-production\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Historical accuracy\n##Characters\n##Role in slavery\n#Controversy\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This concept has been explored by various composers throughout history, resulting in a diverse range of works that showcase the possibilities of tonal music. This article will delve into notable sets of music that cover all 24 keys, variants of this concept, the history of such compositions, and other relevant aspects.\n\n# Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys\n\nSeveral composers have written sets of pieces that cover all 24 keys, often in the form of preludes, fugues, or etudes. These sets demonstrate the composer's mastery of tonal harmony and their ability to craft cohesive and expressive music within a specific key.\n\n## Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets\n\nSome notable composers have written multiple sets of pieces that cover all 24 keys. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach wrote two sets of preludes and fugues, known as The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books I and II. These sets are considered some of the most influential and iconic works in the history of Western classical music. Another composer, Frédéric Chopin, wrote two sets of etudes, Op. 10 and Op. 25, which cover all 24 keys.\n\n# Variants\n\nWhile the concept of writing music in all major or minor keys is well-established, there are several variants that composers have explored.\n\n## Single Pieces that Modulate Through Many Keys\n\nSome composers have written single pieces that modulate through many keys, often using a variety of techniques such as pivot chords, enharmonic modulation, and sequence. For example, Franz Liszt's La Campanella is a famous piano piece that modulates through multiple keys, showcasing the composer's virtuosic skills and innovative approach to tonal harmony.\n\n## Works Covering All Eight Church Modes\n\nIn addition to writing music in all major or minor keys, some composers have explored the use of church modes in their works. For example, the medieval composer Léonin wrote a set of organum pieces that cover all eight church modes. Similarly, the 20th-century composer Olivier Messiaen wrote a set of pieces for solo piano, Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant-Jésus, which uses all eight church modes.\n\n## Other Sets of 24 Pieces\n\nWhile the concept of writing music in all major or minor keys is often associated with piano music, other instruments and ensembles have also been used to create sets of 24 pieces. For example, the composer and violinist Niccolò Paganini wrote a set of 24 Caprices for Solo Violin, which showcase the technical possibilities of the instrument.\n\n# Keys\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary, but there are several common patterns that composers have used.\n\n## Order of Keys in Published Works\n\nOne common pattern is to arrange the keys in a sequence of perfect fifths, starting from C major. This pattern is used in Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, as well as in other sets of preludes and fugues. Another pattern is to arrange the keys in a sequence of relative majors and minors, starting from C major.\n\n# History\n\nThe concept of writing music in all major or minor keys has a long history, dating back to the medieval period.\n\n## Bach and His Precursors\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach is often credited with popularizing the concept of writing music in all major or minor keys. However, there were earlier composers who explored this idea, such as the 16th-century composer Gioseffo Zarlino. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books I and II, are considered some of the most influential works in the history of Western classical music.\n\n## After Bach\n\nAfter Bach, the concept of writing music in all major or minor keys continued to evolve and spread.\n\n### 18th and 19th Centuries\n\n#### 1750–1850\n\nDuring the Classical period, composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven wrote sets of pieces that covered all 24 keys. These sets were often in the form of piano sonatas, piano trios, or string quartets.\n\n#### 1851–1900\n\nDuring the Romantic period, composers such as Chopin, Liszt, and Brahms wrote sets of pieces that covered all 24 keys. These sets were often in the form of piano etudes, piano sonatas, or symphonies.\n\n### 20th Century\n\n#### 1901–1950\n\nDuring the early 20th century, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky wrote sets of pieces that covered all 24 keys. These sets were often in the form of piano pieces, string quartets, or orchestral works.\n\n#### 1951–2000\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, composers such as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Elliott Carter wrote sets of pieces that covered all 24 keys. These sets were often in the form of electronic music, avant-garde compositions, or minimalist works.\n\n### 21st Century\n\nIn the 21st century, the concept of writing music in all major or minor keys continues to evolve and spread. Composers such as Thomas Adès, Arvo Pärt, and Caroline Shaw have written sets of pieces that cover all 24 keys, often using innovative techniques and styles.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article has provided an overview of the concept of music written in all major or minor keys. From Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier to modern-day compositions, this concept has been explored by composers across various genres and styles.\n\n# References\n\nNone\n\n# External Links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Music_written_in_all_major_or_minor_keys\" following this outline:\n\n#Notable sets that cover all 24 keys\n##Composers who wrote multiple sets\n#Variants\n##Single pieces that modulate through many keys\n##Works covering all eight church modes\n##Other sets of 24 pieces\n#Keys\n##Order of keys in published works\n#History\n##Bach and his precursors\n##After Bach\n###18th and 19th centuries\n####1750–1850\n####1851–1900\n###20th century\n####1901–1950\n####1951–2000\n###21st century\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He began skating at the age of four and quickly showed a natural talent for the sport. An's parents encouraged his passion for skating, and he began training seriously at the age of eight.

This victory marked the beginning of a successful career for An, who would go on to become one of the most dominant short track speed skaters of all time.\n\n#### National team 'recommendation system'\n\nDuring the early 2000s, the Korea Skating Union (KSU) implemented a \"recommendation system\" to select athletes for the national team. This system was intended to identify and develop talented young skaters, but it also created controversy and criticism. An was one of the athletes who benefited from this system, but he would later speak out against it, citing favoritism and corruption.\n\n### 2002–2005, KNSU and Non-KNSU\n\nAfter the 2002 Olympics, An continued to compete and win medals, but he also faced challenges and setbacks. In 2003, he was involved in a controversy surrounding the KSU's recommendation system, which led to a rift with the organization.

Ron Hubbard, was a science fiction author, philosopher, and the founder of the Church of Scientology. Born on March 13, 1911, in Tilden, Nebraska, Hubbard grew up to become one of the most influential and divisive figures of the 20th century. This article provides an in-depth look at Hubbard's life, works, and legacy.\n\n# Life\n\n## Before Dianetics\n\n### Pre-war fiction\n\nHubbard's interest in writing began at an early age. He started writing science fiction stories while still in high school and published his first story, \"The Green God,\" in 1934. Hubbard went on to write numerous science fiction and fantasy stories, many of which were published in pulp magazines. His writing style was influenced by authors such as H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\n### Military career\n\nIn 1941, Hubbard enlisted in the United States Navy, where he served as a lieutenant commander during World War II. He was assigned to the USS PC-815, a submarine chaser, and later served on the USS Algol, a cargo ship. Hubbard's military career was marked by controversy, with some claiming he exaggerated his accomplishments and others accusing him of being court-martialed.\n\n### After the war\n\nAfter the war, Hubbard returned to writing, producing several novels, including \"Fear\" and \"Typewriter in the Sky.\" He also became interested in the field of psychotherapy and began to develop his own theories about the human mind. In 1946, Hubbard married Sara Northrup, a woman who would later play a significant role in the development of his self-help system, Dianetics.\n\n## In the Dianetics era\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\" a self-help book that introduced his concept of the \"reactive mind.\" The book was a bestseller, and Hubbard quickly became a celebrity in the science fiction community. He established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, which offered training and auditing sessions to those interested in applying his techniques.\n\n## Pivot to Scientology\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hubbard began to develop his ideas about the spiritual nature of humanity. He introduced the concept of the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that inhabits the human body. Hubbard's teachings became increasingly focused on the spiritual realm, and he began to use the term \"Scientology\" to describe his philosophy.\n\n## In the Church of Scientology era\n\nIn 1954, Hubbard established the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles. The church grew rapidly, and Hubbard became a prominent figure in the counterculture movement of the 1960s. He developed a range of technologies, including the E-meter, a device used to measure the spiritual state of an individual.\n\n## In the Sea Org era\n\nIn 1967, Hubbard established the Sea Organization, a paramilitary group within the Church of Scientology. The Sea Org was tasked with spreading Scientology throughout the world and was known for its strict discipline and hierarchical structure. Hubbard lived on the Apollo, a ship that served as the Sea Org's flagship, and spent much of his time at sea.\n\n## In hiding\n\nIn the 1970s, Hubbard's health began to decline, and he became increasingly reclusive. He went into hiding, and his whereabouts were unknown to the public. During this time, Hubbard continued to work on his writing and developed a range of new technologies, including the \"OT levels,\" a series of spiritual exercises designed to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n# Sources and doctrines\n\nHubbard's teachings are based on a range of sources, including science fiction, psychology, and philosophy. He was influenced by authors such as Aleister Crowley and Sigmund Freud, and his ideas about the spiritual nature of humanity were shaped by his interests in Eastern mysticism and Theosophy.\n\nHubbard's doctrines are centered on the concept of the thetan, a spiritual being that inhabits the human body. He believed that thetans are immortal and have existed for millions of years, and that they are capable of spiritual growth and development through the application of Scientology technologies.\n\n# False biographical claims\n\nHubbard made a number of false biographical claims throughout his life, including claims about his military service and his academic credentials. He also exaggerated his accomplishments as a writer and a scientist, and made false claims about the effectiveness of his self-help system, Dianetics.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## In Scientology\n\nHubbard's legacy is still celebrated within the Church of Scientology, where he is revered as a spiritual leader and a visionary. His teachings continue to be studied and applied by Scientologists around the world, and his technologies are still used in auditing sessions and other spiritual practices.\n\n## In popular culture\n\nHubbard's influence can be seen in popular culture, where his ideas about science fiction and fantasy have shaped the work of authors such as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His self-help system, Dianetics, has also influenced the development of modern psychotherapy and personal development.\n\n# Select works\n\n* \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" (1950)\n* \"Science of Survival\" (1951)\n* \"Self-Analysis\" (1951)\n* \"History of Man\" (1952)\n* \"Scientology: 8-80\" (1952)\n* \"Scientology: 8-8008\" (1952)\n\n# See also\n\n* Church of Scientology\n* Dianetics\n* Sea Organization\n* E-meter\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including biographies, autobiographies, and historical accounts.

The reform, championed by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aims to significantly alter the country's judicial apparatus, including the way judges are selected, the role of government legal advisors, and the power of the Supreme Court to review legislation.\n\n# Background\n\n## Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in the Israeli judicial system, with the power to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions. The court's authority to conduct judicial review is rooted in the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the Basic Laws of Israel, which serve as the country's de facto constitution. Over the years, the Supreme Court has played a significant role in shaping Israeli law and policy, often intervening in sensitive issues related to national security, human rights, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n## 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli Supreme Court, led by then-Chief Justice Aharon Barak, introduced a series of landmark decisions that significantly expanded the court's power to review legislation and government actions. This period, known as the \"Constitutional Revolution,\" marked a significant shift in the Israeli judicial system, as the court began to assert its authority more forcefully. However, the expanded role of the Supreme Court has also been criticized by some as an overreach of judicial power, leading to calls for reform.\n\n## 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n\nThe 2018-2022 Israeli political crisis, which saw five consecutive elections and the eventual collapse of the Israeli government, created a power vacuum that allowed the current government to take office. In the 2022 legislative election, the Netanyahu-led Likud party formed a coalition government with several right-wing parties, including the Religious Zionist Party and Otzma Yehudit. The new government has made judicial reform a top priority, arguing that the current system is too liberal and out of touch with the Israeli public.\n\n# Legislative history\n\n## HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has been the subject of intense debate and litigation in Israel. In a recent decision, HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024), the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that certain aspects of the proposed reform are unconstitutional. The decision has been seen as a significant setback for the government's plans, but it is likely that the issue will continue to be litigated in the coming months.\n\n# Proposed changes\n\n## Judicial selection\n\n### Current system\n\nUnder the current system, judges are selected by a nine-member judicial selection committee, which includes three Supreme Court justices, two government ministers, and four members of the Israeli Bar Association. The committee operates on a consensus-based model, where all members must agree on a candidate before they can be appointed.\n\n### Proposed system\n\nThe proposed reform would change the composition of the judicial selection committee, giving the government more control over the appointment process. Under the new system, the committee would include four government ministers, two Supreme Court justices, and three members of the Israeli Bar Association. The government would also have the power to veto any candidate who does not receive a majority of votes.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the current system is too liberal and out of touch with the Israeli public. They argue that the government should have more control over the appointment process, as it is accountable to the people through democratic elections.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and allow the government to appoint judges who are loyal to its ideology. They argue that the current system, although imperfect, has worked well in the past and should not be changed.\n\n## Government legal advisors\n\nThe proposed reform would also change the role of government legal advisors, who are currently responsible for providing legal advice to government ministries. Under the new system, government legal advisors would be appointed by the government and would be required to follow government policy.\n\n## Constitutional review\n\nThe proposed reform would limit the power of the Supreme Court to conduct constitutional review. Under the new system, the court would only be able to review laws that are explicitly unconstitutional, rather than those that are deemed \"unreasonable\" or \"disproportionate.\"\n\n## Override clause\n\nThe proposed reform would introduce an \"override clause,\" which would allow the Knesset to override Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority vote.\n\n## Abolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\n\nThe proposed reform would abolish the \"unreasonableness\" grounds for judicial review, which allow the Supreme Court to review government actions that are deemed \"unreasonable\" or \"disproportionate.\" Critics of the reform argue that this would give the government too much power and would undermine the rule of law.\n\n### Arguments in favor of the reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that the \"unreasonableness\" grounds are too vague and allow the Supreme Court to intervene too much in government decision-making.\n\n### Arguments against the reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that the \"unreasonableness\" grounds are an important check on government power and should not be abolished.\n\n## Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reform would also change the status of the Attorney-General, who is currently responsible for providing legal advice to the government and representing the state in court. Under the new system, the Attorney-General would be appointed by the government and would be required to follow government policy.\n\n# Reactions\n\n## National\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has sparked widespread controversy and debate within Israel. Many Israelis have taken to the streets to protest the reform, arguing that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. Others have argued that the reform is necessary to restore balance to the Israeli judicial system.\n\n## International\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has also sparked international concern, with many countries and international organizations expressing their opposition to the reform. The United States, in particular, has expressed its concern about the potential impact of the reform on Israeli democracy and the rule of law.\n\n## Connection to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\nSome critics of the reform have argued that it is connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it would give the government more power to implement policies that are opposed by the Palestinian population. Others have argued that the reform is necessary to restore balance to the Israeli judicial system, which has been criticized for being too liberal and out of touch with the Israeli public.\n\n# Suspension and overruling\n\nThe proposed judicial reform has been suspended pending further review and debate. It is likely that the issue will continue to be litigated in the coming months, with the Israeli Supreme Court playing a key role in determining the fate of the reform.\n\n# See also\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Israeli politics\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

Margera had struggled with addiction and personal issues in the past, and the cast and crew reportedly felt that his involvement would be a distraction.

The film's stunts and pranks were largely improvised, with the cast and crew coming up with new ideas on the spot.\n\n### Injuries\n\nAs with previous Jackass films, the cast and crew suffered a number of injuries during filming. Johnny Knoxville reportedly broke his ankle during one stunt, while Steve-O suffered a concussion. The film's crew also reported a number of minor injuries, including cuts and bruises.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\n### Home media\n\nJackass Forever was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 7, 2022. The home media release features a number of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Box office\n\nJackass Forever was a commercial success, grossing over $57 million at the domestic box office. The film also performed well internationally, grossing over $22 million in other territories.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the cast's chemistry and the film's absurd humor. Others criticized the film's lack of originality and the cast's increasing age. The film holds a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 122 reviews.\n\nJackass 4.5\n------------\n\nIn 2022, it was announced that a spin-off film, titled Jackass 4.5, would be released on Netflix. The film features a mix of deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from Jackass Forever, as well as new stunts and pranks.

Kennedy**\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, occurred on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was shot while riding in an open-top car in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza. The event shocked the nation and the world, and it had a profound impact on American politics, culture, and society.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Kennedy\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he entered politics and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1946. He served in the House for six years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1952. In 1960, he was elected President of the United States, defeating Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Kennedy's presidency was marked by significant events, including the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the beginning of the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\n### Oswald\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was born on October 18, 1939, in New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in a troubled home and had difficulty in school. Oswald joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1956 and served for three years. After his discharge, he traveled to the Soviet Union, where he attempted to defect. He returned to the United States in 1962 and settled in Dallas, Texas. Oswald was employed at the Texas School Book Depository, a building located in Dealey Plaza.\n\n**November 22**\n\n### Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\nOn the morning of November 22, Kennedy arrived at Love Field in Dallas, Texas. He was greeted by a large crowd of supporters and dignitaries. The President and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy then got into an open-top car, a 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible, which was part of a motorcade that would take them through the city.

The protests, which began in September 2022, are considered one of the largest and most widespread anti-government movements in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\n# Background\n\n## Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, established in 1979, has been characterized by a strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. Women's rights and freedoms have been significantly curtailed under this regime, with laws governing their dress, behavior, and social interactions. The mandatory wearing of the hijab, a headscarf that covers the hair and neck, is one of the most visible manifestations of these restrictions.\n\n## Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nIran has a long history of protest movements, dating back to the 1979 revolution that overthrew the monarchy. However, these movements have often been suppressed by the government, with protesters facing arrest, imprisonment, and even execution. The 2009 Green Movement, sparked by disputed presidential elections, was one of the largest and most significant protest movements in recent Iranian history.\n\n## Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by the morality police in Tehran on September 13, 2022, for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Amini was taken to a police station, where she was beaten and suffered a severe head injury. She died three days later, on September 16, while in a coma.\n\n# Protests\n\n## Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that followed Amini's death were marked by slogans calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and the mandatory wearing of the hijab. Protesters also demanded justice for Amini and an end to the regime's repression of women's rights. The protests quickly spread to cities across Iran, with demonstrators from all walks of life participating.\n\n## Iranian public opinion\n\nThe protests were widely supported by the Iranian public, with many Iranians expressing outrage and sadness at Amini's death. The protests were also seen as an opportunity for Iranians to express their long-held grievances against the government.\n\n## Protest techniques\n\nProtesters used a variety of techniques to express their dissent, including chanting slogans, burning tires, and blocking streets. The protests were largely peaceful, but some clashes with security forces were reported.\n\n## Civil boycotts\n\nMany Iranians participated in civil boycotts, refusing to buy goods from businesses that supported the government. The boycotts were seen as a way to economically pressure the government to reform.\n\n## Media Western coverage\n\nThe protests received widespread coverage in Western media, with many outlets emphasizing the bravery and determination of the protesters. The coverage was seen as significant, as it helped to raise international awareness of the protests and put pressure on the Iranian government to respond.\n\n# Casualties, government response\n\n## Casualties\n\nThe protests resulted in significant casualties, with many protesters killed or injured by security forces. The exact number of casualties is unknown, but it is estimated that dozens of protesters were killed.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government also reported casualties, with several security forces killed or injured in clashes with protesters.\n\n## Arrests and death sentences\n\nMany protesters were arrested and charged with crimes, including \"enmity against God\" and \"corruption on earth.\" Some protesters were sentenced to death, sparking international outcry.\n\n### Executions\n\nSeveral p", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mahsa_Amini_protests\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Condition of women and the Islamic Republic\n##Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n##Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n#Protests\n##Slogans and greviances\n##Iranian public opinion\n##Protest techniques\n##Civil boycotts\n##Media Western coverage\n#Casualties, government response\n##Casualties\n###Government casualties\n##Arrests and death sentences\n###Executions\n##Suspected food poisoning\n###University students\n###Schoolgirls\n##Statements by officials\n##Government strategy and tactics\n##Communications blackouts\n##Response by regime supporters\n##Government campaign for public opinion\n#Aftermath\n##Lack of head covering\n###Crackdown\n###Surveillance of protesters and dissidents\n#Analysis\n#International reactions\n##International organizations\n##Diplomatic ties\n##Human rights advocates\n##Sanctions\n#In popular culture\n##Music\n##Sports\n###2022 FIFA World Cup\n###Commercialism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It stars Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, and Antonio Banderas, and follows the story of treasure hunter Nathan Drake as he embarks on a perilous journey to find a long-lost treasure.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film opens with a young Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) being arrested by the police for attempting to steal an ancient artifact. He is bailed out by Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a seasoned treasure hunter who becomes his mentor. Sully has been searching for the lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan, and he believes that Nathan's skills and knowledge can help him find it.\n\nThe two embark on a journey to find the treasure, which takes them to various locations around the world, including Italy, Spain, and the Philippines. Along the way, they are pursued by a ruthless rival treasure hunter, Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the treasure.\n\nAs they navigate through treacherous terrain and fight off deadly rivals, Nathan and Sully develop a bond that goes beyond their shared goal of finding the treasure. They learn to trust each other and rely on each other's skills to survive.\n\nThe film's climax features an intense action sequence as Nathan and Sully face off against Moncada and his henchmen in a bid to claim the treasure. The film ends with Nathan and Sully emerging victorious, but not without some unexpected twists and turns.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Tom Holland as Nathan Drake\n* Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan\n* Antonio Banderas as Moncada\n* Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer\n* Tati Gabrielle as Braddock\n* Rudy Pankow as Sam Drake\n* Pilou Asbæk as Gage\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of the Uncharted film began in 2008, when Sony Pictures acquired the rights to the video game series.

The film was set to be directed by Shawn Levy, but he dropped out of the project due to creative differences. Ruben Fleischer was eventually hired to direct the film.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production for the film began in 2019, with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg being cast as the lead characters. The film's script was rewritten by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, with input from the game's developers, Naughty Dog.\n\nThe film's production team conducted extensive research on the video game series, including playing the games and consulting with the game's developers. They also conducted location scouting in various countries, including Italy and the Philippines.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in March 2020, but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming resumed in July 2020, with the production team taking strict safety precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe film was shot on location in various countries, including Italy, Spain, and the Philippines. The production team used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the film's action sequences to life.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ramin Djawadi, who is known for his work on the Game of Thrones series. The score features a mix of orchestral and choral elements, with a focus on percussion and brass instruments.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also features several popular songs, including \"Gimme Shelter\" by The Rolling Stones and \"What's Going On\" by Marvin Gaye.\n\n# Release\n\n## Theatrical\n\nUncharted was released in theaters on February 18, 2022.

The film's home media release includes several bonus features, including deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in October 2021, with the release of the film's first trailer. The trailer featured action-packed sequences and glimpses of the film's characters and locations.\n\nThe film's marketing campaign also included several promotional partnerships, including a partnership with the fast-food chain, Burger King.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Uncharted is a middling adaptation of the popular video game series, with some exciting action sequences but a lackluster script and uneven tone.\"\n\n# Sequel\n\nIn February 2022, Sony Pictures announced that a sequel to Uncharted was in development, with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg set to reprise their roles. The film's script is being written by Rafe Lee Judkins, with Ruben Fleischer set to direct.\n\n# See also\n\n* Uncharted (video game series)\n* Naughty Dog\n* Tom Holland\n* Mark Wahlberg\n\n# References\n\n(To be added)\n\n# External links\n\n* Official website\n* Uncharted on IMDb", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Uncharted_(film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Filming\n#Music\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n###Bans in the Philippines and Vietnam\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Sequel\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It encompasses a wide range of genres, styles, and themes, and has played a significant role in shaping the film industry and society as a whole. This article explores the history of women's cinema, its impact on society, and its development in different regions around the world.\n\n# Famous women in film history\n\n## Silent films\n\nDuring the silent film era, women played a crucial role in the development of cinema. Many women worked as actresses, writers, and directors, and some even founded their own film production companies. One notable example is Alice Guy-Blaché, a French-American filmmaker who is considered to be the first woman to direct a film. Guy-Blaché went on to direct over 700 films and was a pioneer of the narrative film.\n\n## Classical Hollywood\n\nIn the classical Hollywood era, women continued to work in the film industry, but their roles were often limited to acting and writing. However, some women did manage to break through the glass ceiling and become directors and producers. One notable example is Dorothy Arzner, who was the first woman to direct a talkie film and went on to direct over 20 films.\n\n## Experimental and avant-garde cinema\n\nThe experimental and avant-garde cinema movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in women's participation. Women like Shirley Clarke, Maya Deren, and Agnès Varda pushed the boundaries of traditional filmmaking and created innovative and groundbreaking works.\n\n# Impact on society\n\n## Impact of second-wave feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s had a significant impact on women's cinema. The movement's emphasis on women's liberation and equality led to an increase in films that explored women's experiences and perspectives. Films like \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975) and \"A Woman Under the Influence\" (1974) challenged traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\n\n## Representing sexuality\n\nWomen's cinema has also played a significant role in representing women's sexuality on screen. Films like \"Deep Throat\" (1972) and \"The Piano\" (1993) explored women's desires and experiences in a way that was previously taboo.\n\n## Fear of entering cinematography\n\nDespite the progress made in women's cinema, many women still face obstacles when trying to enter the film industry. The fear of sexism, harassment, and marginalization can be a significant barrier to entry.\n\n## Statistics\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, women made up only 15% of directors, 20% of writers, and 25% of producers working on the 100 top-grossing films of 2019. These statistics highlight the ongoing need for greater diversity and inclusion in the film industry.\n\n## Documentaries\n\nDocumentary films have played a significant role in women's cinema, providing a platform for women to tell their own stories and share their experiences. Films like \"The Act of Killing\" (2012) and \"The Square\" (2013) have won numerous awards and have helped to shed light on important social issues.\n\n### Female filmmakers as feminists\n\nMany female filmmakers identify as feminists and see their work as a way to challenge patriarchal norms and promote women's empowerment. Filmmakers like Ava DuVernay and Sofia Coppola have spoken out about the importance of representation and inclusion in the film industry.\n\n## Celluloid ceiling\n\nThe term \"celluloid ceiling\" refers to the barriers that women face when trying to break into the film industry. Despite the progress made in recent years, women still face significant obstacles when trying to become directors, writers, and producers.\n\n# North America\n\n## Canada\n\nCanada has a thriving film industry, and women have played a significant role in its development.

SVB was a major financial institution that served the tech industry and had a significant presence in Silicon Valley. The bank's collapse had far-reaching consequences for its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n# Background\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 and had grown to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets. The bank was known for its expertise in serving the tech industry and had a significant presence in Silicon Valley, where many of its clients were based. SVB had a strong reputation for providing innovative financial solutions to its clients, which included many of the world's leading tech companies.\n\nIn the years leading up to its collapse, SVB had experienced rapid growth, driven in part by the booming tech industry. The bank had expanded its operations to include a range of financial services, including venture capital and private equity investing. However, this rapid growth had also led to concerns about the bank's risk management practices and its exposure to the tech industry.\n\n# Collapse\n\nThe collapse of SVB began in early 2023, when the bank announced that it was facing significant losses due to a decline in the value of its investment portfolio. The bank's portfolio was heavily weighted towards long-term bonds, which had declined in value due to rising interest rates. As a result, SVB was facing significant losses, which it struggled to absorb.\n\n## Losses\n\nThe losses faced by SVB were significant, with estimates suggesting that the bank had lost over $10 billion in the months leading up to its collapse. These losses were driven by a combination of factors, including the decline in the value of its investment portfolio and a decline in the value of its loan portfolio. The bank's loan portfolio was heavily weighted towards the tech industry, which had been experiencing a downturn in recent months.\n\n## Instability\n\nAs the losses mounted, SVB began to experience instability. The bank's customers began to withdraw their deposits, which put pressure on the bank's liquidity. The bank's stock price also declined significantly, which made it difficult for the bank to raise capital. The instability at SVB was further exacerbated by concerns about the bank's risk management practices and its exposure to the tech industry.\n\n## Receivership\n\nIn an effort to stabilize the bank and prevent further losses, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of SVB in March 2023. The FDIC placed the bank into receivership, which allowed it to take control of the bank's assets and operations. The FDIC's takeover of SVB was seen as a necessary step to prevent further instability in the financial system.\n\n## Acquisition\n\nFollowing the FDIC's takeover of SVB, the bank was acquired by another financial institution. The acquisition was seen as a positive step, as it allowed the bank's customers to continue to access their accounts and provided stability to the financial system.\n\n# Effects\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n## Customers\n\nThe collapse of SVB had a significant impact on its customers, many of whom were tech companies. The bank's customers were forced to find new banking arrangements, which was a challenging and time-consuming process. Many of the bank's customers also experienced difficulties in accessing their accounts, which caused significant disruption to their businesses.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe collapse of SVB also had a significant impact on its shareholders. The bank's stock price declined significantly in the months leading up to its collapse, which resulted in significant losses for its shareholders. Many of the bank's shareholders were also forced to sell their shares at a loss, which further exacerbated their losses.\n\n## Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant implications for the broader financial system. The bank's collapse was seen as a potential threat to the stability of the financial system, as it had significant connections to other financial institutions. The collapse of SVB also raised concerns about the risk management practices of other financial institutions and the potential for further instability in the financial system.\n\n## Legal actions\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of SVB, several legal actions were taken against the bank's executives and directors. These actions alleged that the bank's executives and directors had engaged in reckless and negligent behavior, which had contributed to the bank's collapse.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a range of reactions from officials, regulators, and commentators.\n\n## Official responses\n\nThe official response to the collapse of SVB was swift and decisive. The FDIC took control of the bank and placed it into receivership, which allowed it to stabilize the bank and prevent further losses. The Federal Reserve also provided emergency funding to the bank, which helped to stabilize the financial system.\n\n## Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked a debate over the role of government intervention in the financial system. Some commentators argued that the government should have intervened earlier to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government's intervention was necessary to prevent further instability in the financial system.\n\n## Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also sparked a debate about the causes of the bank's failure. Some commentators argued that the bank's failure was due to its reckless and negligent behavior, while others argued that the bank's failure was due to external factors, such as the decline in the tech industry.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

L. Zissu\n\nA. L. Zissu was a Romanian Jewish Hasidic scholar, journalist, and activist who played a significant role in the country's Jewish community during the mid-20th century. Born into a prominent Hasidic family, Zissu's life was marked by his dedication to Jewish scholarship, his advocacy for Religious Zionism, and his resistance against Nazi persecution and communist oppression.\n\n#Biography\n\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\nA. L. Zissu was born in 1888 in the town of Târgu Neamț, in the historical region of Moldavia, Romania. His family was part of the local Hasidic community, and from a young age, Zissu demonstrated a keen interest in Jewish scholarship. He received a traditional Hasidic education, studying under prominent rabbis and Torah scholars. Zissu's intellectual curiosity and writing talent soon led him to pursue a career in journalism. In 1910, he began writing for the Romanian Jewish newspaper \"Egalitatea,\" where he published articles on Jewish culture, history, and politics.\n\n##Religious Zionism\nZissu's involvement in journalism coincided with the rise of the Zionist movement in Romania. He became an ardent supporter of Religious Zionism, advocating for the return of Jews to the Land of Israel. Zissu saw Zionism as a means to revitalize Jewish identity and ensure the survival of the Jewish people. Through his writings, he encouraged Romanian Jews to engage with Zionist ideology and participate in the movement's activities.\n\n##Nazi persecution\nThe rise of Nazi Germany and its influence in Eastern Europe had a profound impact on Zissu's life and work. As the Nazi Party's anti-Semitic policies intensified, Zissu became increasingly vocal in his opposition. He wrote scathing critiques of Nazi ideology and its impact on Jewish communities, using his journalistic platform to raise awareness about the growing threat. Zissu's activism did not go unnoticed, and he soon became a target of Nazi persecution.\n\n##Resistance movement\nIn 1940, Zissu joined the Romanian Jewish resistance movement, which aimed to counter Nazi influence and protect Jewish communities. He worked closely with other resistance leaders, coordinating efforts to smuggle Jews out of Romania and into Palestine. Zissu's involvement in the resistance movement put him at great personal risk, but he remained committed to the cause, using his journalistic skills to disseminate information and rally support.\n\n##Jewish leadership\nIn 1944, Zissu was appointed to the Romanian Jewish Community Council, a leadership body that represented Jewish interests in the country. As a member of the council, Zissu worked to promote Jewish welfare, education, and culture. He also played a key role in negotiating with the Romanian government, advocating for Jewish rights and protection.\n\n##Against communism\nFollowing World War II, Romania fell under communist rule, and Zissu's activism shifted to oppose the new regime. He saw communism as a threat to Jewish identity and the Zionist movement, and he wrote extensively about the dangers of communist ideology. Zissu's anti-communist stance put him at odds with the Romanian authorities, who viewed him as a subversive element.\n\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\nIn 1959, Zissu was arrested by the Securitate, Romania's secret police, on charges of treason and anti-communist activities. The arrest was a setup, and Zissu was subjected to intense interrogation and torture. Despite the mistreatment, he refused to renounce his Zionist beliefs or cooperate with the authorities.\n\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\nZissu's trial was a sham, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, due to international pressure and the efforts of Jewish organizations, Zissu's sentence was commuted to house arrest in 1964. He died in 1973, at the age of 85, his health broken by years of imprisonment and mistreatment.\n\n#Legacy\n\nA. L. Zissu's legacy is that of a courageous Jewish leader who fought tirelessly against oppression and advocated for Jewish rights and identity. His commitment to Religious Zionism and his resistance against Nazi and communist regimes serve as an inspiration to future generations. Through his writings and activism, Zissu left an indelible mark on the history of Romanian Jewry, and his memory continues to be celebrated and honored today.\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"A._L._Zissu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Hasidic scholar and journalistic debut\n##Religious Zionism\n##Nazi persecution\n##Resistance movement\n##Jewish leadership\n##Against communism\n##Securitate set-up and imprisonment\n##Trial, reprieve, and death\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
