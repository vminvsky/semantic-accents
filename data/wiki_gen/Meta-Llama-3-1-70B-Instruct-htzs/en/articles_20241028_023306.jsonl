The exchange was headquartered in the Bahamas and was known for its high trading volumes and innovative products. However, in November 2022, FTX faced a major crisis that led to its bankruptcy and had far-reaching consequences for the cryptocurrency market.\n\n#History\n\nFTX was founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, two former traders at Jane Street, a global trading firm. The exchange was initially focused on offering cryptocurrency derivatives, including futures and options. FTX quickly gained popularity among traders due to its high liquidity, low fees, and innovative products.\n\nIn 2020, FTX raised $8 million in a seed funding round from investors such as Binance Labs, the venture arm of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The exchange continued to grow rapidly, and by 2021, it had become one of the largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges in the world.\n\nIn addition to its exchange business, FTX also operated a trading firm called Alameda Research, which was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried in 2017. Alameda was a quantitative trading firm that used advanced algorithms to trade cryptocurrencies and other assets.\n\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n\nIn the months leading up to the crisis, FTX and its affiliated trading firm Alameda Research had been facing financial difficulties. According to reports, Alameda had been using FTX customer funds to trade and had amassed significant losses.\n\nOn November 2, 2022, a report by CoinDesk revealed that a significant portion of Alameda's balance sheet was composed of FTX's native token, FTT. This raised concerns about the solvency of Alameda and the potential risks to FTX customers.\n\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n\nOn November 6, 2022, Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange and investor in FTX, announced that it would be selling its entire stake in FTT. This move was seen as a major blow to FTX, as Binance was one of its largest investors.\n\nFollowing Binance's announcement, the price of FTT began to plummet, leading to a sell-off in the token. FTX customers began to withdraw their funds from the exchange, leading to a liquidity crisis.\n\nOn November 8, 2022, Binance announced that it had reached a non-binding agreement to acquire FTX, pending due diligence. However, just hours later, Binance withdrew its bid, citing concerns about FTX's financial condition.\n\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n\nOn November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. The exchange announced that it would be ceasing all trading operations and would be conducting an orderly wind-down of its business.\n\nIn the days following the bankruptcy filing, it was revealed that FTX had been the victim of a major hack, with unauthorized transactions totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The hack was believed to have been carried out by an insider, and it was unclear whether the perpetrator was still at large.\n\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n\nThe collapse of FTX sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market, with many traders and investors facing significant losses. The price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies plummeted, and many other cryptocurrency exchanges and firms faced liquidity crises.\n\nThere were fears of a contagion effect, with many investors worried that the collapse of FTX could lead to a broader crisis in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n##Responses and effects\n\n###Effects on investors\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a devastating impact on many investors, with many facing significant losses. Some investors had invested their life savings in FTX, and the collapse of the exchange left them financially ruined.\n\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n\nThe collapse of FTX had a significant impact on other cryptocurrency firms and markets. Many firms faced liquidity crises, and some were forced to cease operations.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies plummeted, and many investors lost confidence in the cryptocurrency market.\n\n###Responses and commentary\n\nThe collapse of FTX was met with widespread criticism and commentary from the cryptocurrency community. Many commentators criticized the lack of regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market, and called for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nSome commentators also criticized the role of Binance and other major cryptocurrency exchanges in the collapse of FTX, suggesting that they had played a role in exacerbating the crisis.\n\n#Legal process\n\nFollowing the collapse of FTX, the exchange's founder Sam Bankman-Fried was the subject of a number of lawsuits and regulatory investigations. In December 2022, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States, where he faced charges of wire fraud and securities fraud.\n\nThe collapse of FTX also led to a number of regulatory investigations, with many governments and regulatory bodies launching probes into the exchange's activities.\n\n#Sponsorships\n\nFTX had been a major sponsor of a number of high-profile events and organizations, including the Miami Heat basketball team and the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team. Following the collapse of the exchange, many of these sponsorships were terminated.\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"FTX\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#November 2022 crisis and bankruptcy\n##Background: FTX and Alameda, Binance, and CoinDesk report\n##Crisis begins: Binance FTT sale, sell-off, and withdrawn rescue bid\n##Bankruptcy and unauthorized transactions\n##Widening impact and contagion fears\n##Responses and effects\n###Effects on investors\n###Effects on other cryptocurrency firms and cryptocurrency markets\n###Responses and commentary\n#Legal process\n#Sponsorships\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, Drake rose to prominence during the Elizabethan era and became a celebrated figure in English history.\n\n# Birth and early years\n\nFrancis Drake was born in 1540 in Tavistock, Devon, England, to Edmund Drake and Mary Mylwaye. His early life is not well documented, but it is believed that he grew up in a Protestant family and received a basic education. In his youth, Drake was apprenticed to a merchant shipowner and began his career at sea.\n\n# Early career at sea\n\nDrake's early career at sea was marked by involvement in the slave trade and privateering expeditions against Spanish ships.\n\n## Slave trade\n\nIn the 1560s, Drake was involved in the slave trade, transporting enslaved Africans to the Americas. This experience gave him knowledge of the Caribbean and its trade routes, which would later benefit him in his pirating and privateering expeditions.\n\n## Expedition of 1572–1573\n\nIn 1572, Drake embarked on an expedition to the Caribbean, where he raided Spanish ships and colonies. This expedition was likely sponsored by a group of English investors who hoped to profit from the capture of Spanish vessels and cargo.\n\n## Rathlin Island massacre\n\nIn 1575, Drake was involved in the Rathlin Island massacre, in which a group of English and Scottish soldiers attacked and killed hundreds of Scottish and Irish civilians who were hiding on the island. Drake's role in the massacre is not well documented, but it is believed that he was present during the attack.\n\n# Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n\nDrake's most famous expedition was his circumnavigation of the globe, which took place from 1577 to 1580.\n\n## Execution of Thomas Doughty\n\nBefore setting sail, Drake had Thomas Doughty, a fellow Englishman, executed for mutiny. Doughty had been accused of plotting against Drake and was put on trial by a council of Drake's officers. The execution was seen as a necessary measure to maintain discipline and order on the voyage.\n\n## Entering the Pacific (1578)\n\nIn 1578, Drake sailed through the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America and entered the Pacific Ocean. This was a significant achievement, as it marked the first time an English ship had navigated the strait.\n\n## Raids on Spanish American west coast\n\nOnce in the Pacific, Drake raided Spanish ships and colonies along the west coast of South America. He captured several vessels and took control of the Spanish ship Nuestra Señora de la Victoria, which he later used as his flagship.\n\n## Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n\nIn 1579, Drake landed on the coast of California, which he claimed for England and named Nova Albion. This claim was later disputed by the Spanish, who argued that the area was part of their colonial territory.\n\n## Across the Pacific and around Africa\n\nAfter leaving California, Drake sailed across the Pacific and around Africa, returning to England in 1580. This voyage marked the first time an English ship had circumnavigated the globe.\n\n## Return to Plymouth (1580)\n\nDrake returned to Plymouth, England, in 1580, where he was greeted as a hero. He brought back a large quantity of gold, silver, and other treasures, which he had captured during his raids on Spanish ships and colonies.\n\n## Knighthood and arms\n\nIn 1581, Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I for his services to the English crown. He was also granted a coat of arms, which featured a wyvern (a mythical creature) and the motto \"Sic Parvis Magna\" (\"Greatness from small beginnings\").\n\n# Political career\n\nDrake's success at sea and his popularity with the English public made him a natural candidate for politics. He served as a member of Parliament for Plymouth and later for Bossiney, Cornwall.\n\n# Great Expedition to America\n\nIn 1585, Drake was appointed commander of a fleet that was sent to the Americas to attack Spanish colonies and ships. This expedition was known as the Great Expedition to America.\n\n# Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, Drake played a key role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, a fleet of ships that was sent by King Philip II of Spain to invade England.\n\n## Cádiz raid\n\nIn 1587, Drake led a raid on the Spanish port of Cádiz, where he sank several ships and disrupted the Spanish naval preparations for the Armada.\n\n## Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n\nIn 1588, the Spanish Armada was defeated by a combination of bad weather, poor planning, and the English navy. Drake played a key role in the battle, commanding a fleet of ships that attacked the Spanish vessels.\n\n## English Armada\n\nIn 1589, Drake was appointed commander of a fleet that was sent to Spain to attack the Spanish navy and disrupt their trade routes. This expedition was known as the English Armada.\n\n# Defeats and death\n\nDrake's later years were marked by a series of defeats and setbacks. He was defeated by the Spanish at the Battle of Las Palmas in 1595 and died of dysentery in 1596, while on a voyage to the Caribbean.\n\n# Family and heritage\n\nDrake married twice, first to Mary Newman and then to Elizabeth Sydenham. He had no children, but his legacy lived on through his family and his descendants.\n\n# Legacy and honours\n\nDrake's legacy is still celebrated today. He is remembered as a hero of the English navy and a pioneer of exploration and privateering.\n\n## Geographical names\n\nDrake's name is commemorated in several geographical locations, including Drake's Bay in California, Drake's Passage at the tip of South America, and the Drake Strait in the Antarctic.\n\n# See also\n\n* English Armada\n* Spanish Armada\n* Francis Drake's circumnavigation\n* Privateering\n* Exploration\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per your request)\n\n# Bibliography\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per your request)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per your request)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Francis_Drake\" following this outline:\n\n#Birth and early years\n#Early career at sea\n##Slave trade\n##Expedition of 1572–1573\n##Rathlin Island massacre\n#Circumnavigation (1577–1580)\n##Execution of Thomas Doughty\n##Entering the Pacific (1578)\n##Raids on Spanish American west coast\n##Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)\n##Across the Pacific and around Africa\n##Return to Plymouth (1580)\n##Knighthood and arms\n#Political career\n#Great Expedition to America\n#Conflict with the Spanish Armada\n##Cádiz raid\n##Defeat of the Spanish Armada\n##English Armada\n#Defeats and death\n#Family and heritage\n#Legacy and honours\n##Geographical names\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident has sparked controversy and investigations, with implications for Biden's presidency and the handling of classified information.\n\n# Background\n\nAs Vice President under Barack Obama, Joe Biden had access to sensitive and classified information. After leaving office in 2017, Biden maintained a office at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a think tank located in Washington, D.C. The center was affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, where Biden was a professor. Biden's office at the center was used to store documents and other materials related to his work as Vice President.\n\n# Discoveries and other developments\n\n## First batch of documents\n\nIn November 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a batch of classified documents at the Penn Biden Center. The documents were found in a locked cabinet in Biden's office, and they were reportedly related to Biden's work as Vice President. The discovery was made by Biden's lawyers, who were packing up his office at the center.\n\n## DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n\nOn November 9, 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent a letter to Bob Bauer, Biden's lawyer, requesting that the documents be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The letter stated that the documents were subject to the Presidential Records Act, which requires that presidential records be preserved and turned over to NARA.\n\n## Second batch of documents\n\nOn December 20, 2022, Biden's lawyers discovered a second batch of classified documents at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The documents were found in a room in Biden's garage, and they were reportedly related to Biden's work as Vice President.\n\n## FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n\nOn January 20, 2023, the FBI conducted a search of Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware. The search was reportedly related to the discovery of the second batch of classified documents. The FBI seized several boxes of documents and other materials during the search.\n\n## Other searches\n\nIn addition to the search of Biden's home, the FBI also searched his office at the Penn Biden Center. The search was reportedly related to the discovery of the first batch of classified documents.\n\n# Initial responses\n\n## Biden and his legal team\n\nBiden and his legal team have maintained that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake. Biden's lawyers have stated that they are cooperating fully with the investigation and are working to turn over all relevant documents to NARA.\n\n## Elected officials\n\n### Republican elected officials\n\nRepublican elected officials have been critical of Biden's handling of the classified documents. Some have called for Biden to be investigated and potentially charged with a crime. Others have accused Biden of hypocrisy, noting that he had previously criticized former President Donald Trump for his handling of classified documents.\n\n### Democratic elected officials\n\nDemocratic elected officials have been more supportive of Biden, with many expressing confidence that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. Some have noted that the discovery of the classified documents was an honest mistake and that Biden is cooperating fully with the investigation.\n\n## Media analysis\n\nThe media has had a mixed reaction to the discovery of the classified documents. Some outlets have been critical of Biden's handling of the documents, while others have noted that the discovery was an honest mistake.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThere has been some misinformation spread about the discovery of the classified documents. Some have falsely claimed that Biden intentionally hid the documents or that he was trying to destroy evidence.\n\n## Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n\nIn January 2023, it was reported that classified documents had been found at the residence of former Vice President Mike Pence. The discovery was seen as a potential embarrassment for Pence, who had previously criticized Biden for his handling of classified documents.\n\n# Investigations\n\n## Special counsel\n\nIn January 2023, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate the discovery of the classified documents. The special counsel, Robert Hur, is a former U.S. Attorney who has experience handling sensitive investigations.\n\n### Decision that charges were unwarranted\n\nIn June 2023, the special counsel announced that he had completed his investigation and had determined that charges were unwarranted. The special counsel found that Biden had not intentionally mishandled the classified documents and that the discovery was an honest mistake.\n\n### Comments on Biden's memory\n\nThe special counsel also made comments about Biden's memory, noting that he had struggled to recall details about the discovery of the classified documents. However, the special counsel found that Biden's memory issues were not relevant to the investigation.\n\n## Congressional\n\nIn addition to the special counsel's investigation, Congress has also launched its own investigation into the discovery of the classified documents. The investigation is being led by the House Oversight Committee, which has subpoenaed Biden's lawyers and other witnesses.\n\n# See also\n\n* Classified information in the United States\n* Presidential Records Act\n* National Archives and Records Administration\n* Department of Justice\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joe_Biden_classified_documents_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Discoveries and other developments\n##First batch of documents\n##DOJ letter to Bob Bauer\n##Second batch of documents\n##FBI search of Biden's Wilmington home\n##Other searches\n#Initial responses\n##Biden and his legal team\n##Elected officials\n###Republican elected officials\n###Democratic elected officials\n##Media analysis\n##Misinformation\n##Discovery of classified documents at Mike Pence's residence\n#Investigations\n##Special counsel\n###Decision that charges were unwarranted\n###Comments on Biden's memory\n##Congressional\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle saw Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand forces, as part of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), and 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, respectively, defend against a massive Chinese Spring Offensive. The battle is widely regarded as one of the most significant victories for the United Nations Command during the war.\n\n#Background\n\n##Military situation\n\nIn the spring of 1951, the Korean War had been ongoing for nearly a year. The United Nations Command, led by General Douglas MacArthur, had been pushing the North Korean and Chinese forces back, but the latter had regrouped and were preparing to launch a massive counterattack. The Chinese Spring Offensive, also known as the \"Fifth Phase Campaign,\" aimed to drive the United Nations forces back and capture the South Korean capital, Seoul.\n\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n\n##Preparations\n\nIn preparation for the offensive, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had amassed a massive force of over 300,000 soldiers, supported by artillery, tanks, and airpower. The PVA had also been reinforced with fresh troops, including the 63rd Army, which had been withdrawn from the front lines and retrained.\n\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n\nOn April 22, 1951, the Chinese Spring Offensive was launched, with PVA forces attacking along a 40-mile front. The initial assault was aimed at the South Korean 6th Division, which was quickly overwhelmed. As the South Korean forces retreated, the United Nations Command realized that the PVA was pushing towards the strategic Kapyong Valley, a vital transportation route that connected the 1st Marine Division with the 24th Infantry Division.\n\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n\nAs the PVA pushed forward, the South Korean 6th Division withdrew in disarray, leaving a 10-mile gap in the United Nations line. The Australian 3 RAR, which had been holding a defensive position on Hill 504, was ordered to fall back and take up a new position on the high ground overlooking the Kapyong Valley.\n\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n\n##Night battle\n\nOn the night of April 23, 1951, the Australian 3 RAR took up its new position on Hill 504, which was a vital defensive location overlooking the Kapyong Valley. As the PVA forces approached, the Australians prepared for a night battle, digging in and laying down a defensive perimeter. At around 10 pm, the PVA launched a massive assault on the Australian position, with waves of soldiers attacking the hill. The Australians held firm, using their artillery and machine guns to devastating effect.\n\n##Day battle\n\nAs the sun rose on April 24, 1951, the battle raged on, with the PVA forces launching repeated attacks on the Australian position. The Australians, supported by artillery and airpower, held their ground, inflicting heavy casualties on the PVA. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Australians managed to repel wave after wave of attacks, with the PVA suffering heavy losses.\n\n##3 RAR withdraws\n\nAs the day wore on, the Australians realized that they were in danger of being cut off and surrounded by the PVA. At around 4 pm, the 3 RAR was ordered to withdraw from Hill 504 and fall back to a new position on the high ground overlooking the Kapyong Valley. The Australians withdrew in good order, leaving behind a trail of destruction and chaos.\n\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n\n##Preparations\n\nAs the Australians withdrew from Hill 504, the Canadian 2 PPCLI took up a defensive position on Hill 677, which was a vital location overlooking the Kapyong Valley. The Canadians prepared for a last stand, digging in and laying down a defensive perimeter. The PVA, sensing victory, launched a massive assault on the Canadian position.\n\n##Night battle\n\nOn the night of April 24, 1951, the PVA launched a fierce assault on the Canadian position, with waves of soldiers attacking the hill. The Canadians held firm, using their artillery and machine guns to devastating effect. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Canadians managed to repel wave after wave of attacks, with the PVA suffering heavy losses.\n\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n\nAs the night wore on, the Canadians realized that they were in danger of being overrun. At around 2 am on April 25, 1951, the 2 PPCLI launched a final counterattack, using every available man to push the PVA back. The Canadians managed to hold their ground, but at a terrible cost. As the sun rose on April 25, 1951, the Canadians withdrew from Hill 677, having inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Summary and casualties\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong was a pivotal victory for the United Nations Command, with the Australians and Canadians inflicting heavy casualties on the PVA. The battle saw the PVA suffer over 10,000 casualties, while the United Nations forces lost around 700 men. The battle marked a turning point in the war, as the PVA never fully recovered from the losses suffered during the Chinese Spring Offensive.\n\n##Awards\n\nThe Battle of Kapyong saw numerous awards and decorations bestowed upon the Australians and Canadians. The 3 RAR was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation, while the 2 PPCLI was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation and the British Distinguished Service Order.\n\n##Subsequent operations\n\nFollowing the Battle of Kapyong, the United Nations Command launched a series of operations aimed at pushing the PVA back. The Australians and Canadians played a key role in these operations, which saw the PVA slowly pushed back across the 38th parallel.\n\n#See also\n\n* Korean War\n* Chinese Spring Offensive\n* United Nations Command\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n\n#Notes\n\n##Footnotes\n\n None\n\n##Citations\n\n None\n\n#References\n\n None\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Battle of Kapyong\" by the Australian War Memorial\n* \"The Battle of Kapyong\" by the Canadian War Museum\n* \"The Korean War\" by Max Hastings\n* \"The Forgotten War\" by Clay Blair", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Kapyong\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Military situation\n#Chinese Spring Offensive\n##Preparations\n##Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive\n##South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951\n#Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951\n##Night battle\n##Day battle\n##3 RAR withdraws\n#Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951\n##Preparations\n##Night battle\n##Final 2 PPCLI Operations\n#Aftermath\n##Summary and casualties\n##Awards\n##Subsequent operations\n#See also\n#Notes\n##Footnotes\n##Citations\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company has a long history dating back to the 19th century and has played a significant role in shaping the economic and social landscape of the North West of England.\n\n# History\n\n## Name and listings\n\nThe Peel Group was founded in 1971 by John Whittaker, who is still the company's chairman today. The company was originally called Peel Holdings, but was rebranded as The Peel Group in 2004. The company is privately owned and is not listed on any stock exchange.\n\n## Early acquisitions\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Peel made a series of strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of the Manchester Ship Canal, which would become a cornerstone of the company's business. The company also acquired a number of other assets, including the Liverpool Docks and the Port of Heysham.\n\n## Manchester Ship Canal\n\nThe Manchester Ship Canal is one of the most significant investments made by Peel.

While his name may not be widely recognized today, Cruys' influence on the island's politics and his family's enduring legacy in Ireland make him a noteworthy figure in medieval Irish history.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nBorn in the early 14th century, John Cruys was a member of the Anglo-Norman Cruys family, who had settled in Ireland following the Norman invasion of 1169. The Cruys family had established themselves as prominent landowners in County Dublin, with their primary seat at Merrion Castle. John Cruys was likely born at Merrion or another family estate, and his early life would have been marked by the typical upbringing of a member of the Anglo-Norman gentry.\n\nMerrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n--------------------------------------\n\nMerrion Castle, situated near the modern-day village of Merrion, County Dublin, was the primary seat of the Cruys family. The castle, which dates back to the 12th century, was constructed by the Normans as a fortified stronghold to secure their control over the surrounding area. The castle's strategic location, near the coast and the River Liffey, made it an important center for trade and commerce.\n\nIn addition to Merrion Castle, the Cruys family held other lands and estates throughout Ireland, including properties in Counties Meath, Louth, and Kildare. These holdings, which had been acquired through a combination of grants, purchases, and marriages, made the Cruys family one of the most influential and wealthy families in Ireland.\n\nCareer\n--------\n\nJohn Cruys' career in the governance of Ireland began in the 1340s, when he was appointed as a justice of the peace for County Dublin. This role, which involved maintaining law and order in the county, marked the beginning of Cruys' involvement in the island's administration.\n\nOver the next several decades, Cruys held various positions in the Irish government, including serving as a member of the Irish parliament and as a justice of the King's Bench. These roles allowed him to exert significant influence over the governance of Ireland and to shape the island's policies.\n\nThe Verdon inheritance\n----------------------\n\nIn the 1350s, John Cruys became embroiled in a dispute over the inheritance of the Verdon family's lands in Ireland. The Verdons, another prominent Anglo-Norman family, had held extensive estates in Ireland, including properties in Counties Meath and Louth.\n\nWhen the last male heir of the Verdon family died without an heir, a dispute arose over who should inherit the family's lands. John Cruys, who had married a member of the Verdon family, claimed the inheritance for himself, but his claim was contested by other members of the Verdon family and by the English crown.\n\nThe dispute over the Verdon inheritance was eventually resolved in Cruys' favor, with the English crown granting him the majority of the Verdon lands in Ireland. This outcome significantly increased Cruys' wealth and influence, cementing his position as one of the most powerful men in Ireland.\n\nLater career\n-------------\n\nFollowing the resolution of the Verdon inheritance dispute, John Cruys continued to play a significant role in the governance of Ireland. He remained a member of the Irish parliament and served as a justice of the King's Bench, using his positions to advocate for the interests of the Anglo-Norman community in Ireland.\n\nCruys also became involved in the administration of the English crown's lands in Ireland, serving as a steward and receiver for the crown's Irish estates. These roles allowed him to exert significant influence over the governance of Ireland and to shape the island's policies.\n\nFamily\n--------\n\nJohn Cruys was married to a member of the Verdon family, with whom he had several children. His marriage to a member of the Verdon family had helped to secure his claim to the Verdon inheritance, and his children would go on to play important roles in the governance of Ireland.\n\nCruys' family remained influential in Ireland for several generations, with his descendants continuing to hold prominent positions in the island's administration. The Cruys family's legacy in Ireland can still be seen today, with many of the family's lands and estates remaining in the possession of their descendants.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland\n* Merrion Castle\n* Verdon family\n* Irish parliament\n* King's Bench\n\nSources\n--------\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_Cruys\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Merrion Castle and other Cruys holdings\n#Career\n#The Verdon inheritance\n#Later career\n#Family\n#See also\n#Sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are known for their seafaring traditions, rich cultural heritage, and significant contributions to the history of the Indonesian archipelago. This article delves into the origins, history, culture, and traditions of the Bugis people.\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of South Sulawesi were the Toalean people, who are believed to have migrated to the region around 8000 BCE. The Toalean were hunter-gatherers and are thought to have been the ancestors of the modern-day indigenous peoples of Sulawesi. However, their exact relationship with the Bugis is unclear.\n\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n\nAround 2000 BCE, the Austronesian peoples, who originated from Taiwan, began to migrate to the Indonesian archipelago. They brought with them their languages, cultures, and technologies, which had a profound impact on the indigenous populations. The Austronesians are believed to have intermarried with the Toalean, giving rise to the modern-day Bugis people.\n\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich oral tradition that describes their origins. According to legend, the Bugis people were created by the god Batara Guru, who descended from the heavens to create the first Bugis couple, La Sattumpugi and We Banri Eri. The couple was said to have been born from the earth and were given the task of populating the land. The Bugis call their homeland Tana Ogi, which translates to \"Land of the Bugis\".\n\n#History\n\n##Early society\n\nThe early Bugis society was organized into small kingdoms, each with its own ruler and system of governance. These kingdoms were often at odds with each other, and conflicts were common. However, the Bugis people were also known for their skill in trade and commerce, and their merchants traveled extensively throughout the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n\nIn the 13th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to consolidate and expand their territories. The kingdom of Bone, which was established in the 14th century, became one of the most powerful Bugis kingdoms. Other notable kingdoms included Soppeng, Wajo, and Sidenreng.\n\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n\nIn the 16th century, the Bugis kingdoms began to face challenges from new political powers in the region. The Makassarese, who were a neighboring ethnic group, began to expand their territories and challenged the Bugis for dominance. The Bugis also faced pressure from the Dutch, who were establishing their colonial empire in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n\nDespite the challenges, the Bugis-Makassar society continued to thrive in the 16th century. The Bugis people developed a rich cultural heritage, including their language, literature, and art. The Bugis also became known for their skill in navigation and shipbuilding, and their merchants continued to trade extensively throughout the region.\n\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n\nIn the 16th century, European missionaries began to arrive in the Bugis states, seeking to convert the population to Christianity. However, the Bugis people were resistant to these efforts, and many saw Christianity as a threat to their traditional way of life.\n\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n\nThroughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Bugis kingdoms continued to vie for power and influence in the region. The Bugis people became known for their skill in diplomacy and politics, and their leaders often formed alliances with other kingdoms and European powers.\n\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n\nIn the 17th century, Islam began to spread throughout the Bugis-Makassar-Mandar region. Many Bugis people converted to Islam, which became a major factor in the region's politics and culture.\n\n##The twilight of dominance\n\nBy the 19th century, the Bugis kingdoms were in decline. The Dutch had established their colonial empire in the Indonesian archipelago, and the Bugis people were subject to Dutch rule. Many Bugis people were forced to adapt to new economic and social systems, which eroded their traditional way of life.\n\n##A new golden age\n\nIn the 20th century, the Bugis people experienced a resurgence of interest in their culture and traditions. The Indonesian government recognized the importance of preserving the country's cultural heritage, and many Bugis people began to revive their traditional practices and customs.\n\n#Culture\n\n##Language and dialects\n\nThe Bugis language is a member of the Austronesian language family and is spoken by around 3 million people in Indonesia. There are several dialects of the Bugis language, which are spoken in different regions of South Sulawesi.\n\n##Philosophy\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich philosophical tradition that emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature and society. The Bugis people believe in a complex spiritual system that includes a supreme god, ancestral spirits, and other supernatural beings.\n\n##Traditional script\n\nThe Bugis people have a traditional script known as the Lontara script, which was used to write Bugis language texts. The Lontara script is still used today in some parts of South Sulawesi.\n\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of folklore and literature. Bugis stories and poems often feature supernatural beings and emphasize the importance of living in harmony with nature and society.\n\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n\nThe Bugis people are known for their traditional dress and textiles. Bugis women are skilled weavers and produce a variety of traditional fabrics, including silk and cotton.\n\n##Culinary traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique culinary tradition that emphasizes the use of local ingredients and spices. Bugis cuisine is known for its bold flavors and spices, and features dishes such as grilled fish and meat stews.\n\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of martial arts and military culture. Bugis warriors were known for their skill in hand-to-hand combat and their use of traditional weapons, such as the kris dagger.\n\n##Traditional architecture\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique traditional architecture that reflects their cultural and environmental context. Bugis houses are typically made of wood and feature a distinctive curved roof.\n\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of maritime trade and migration. Bugis merchants traveled extensively throughout the Indonesian archipelago, and many Bugis people migrated to other parts of Indonesia and beyond.\n\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a long tradition of rice cultivation and agrarian culture. Rice is a staple crop in South Sulawesi, and many Bugis people are skilled farmers and agricultural specialists.\n\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n\nThe Bugis people have a rich tradition of festivals and celebrations. Many Bugis festivals are tied to the Islamic calendar and feature music, dance, and other cultural performances.\n\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n\nThe Bugis people have a unique musical tradition that emphasizes the use of traditional instruments, such as the suling flute and the gendang drum. Bugis music often features complex rhythms and melodies, and is often performed during festivals and celebrations.\n\n#See also\n\n* Austronesian peoples\n* Indonesian archipelago\n* South Sulawesi\n* Makassarese people\n* Dutch colonial empire\n\n#References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bugis\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins and antecedents\n##Toalean — Pre-Austronesian South Sulawesi\n##The arrival of Austronesians\n##Tana Ogi — Land of the Bugis\n#History\n##Early society\n##The growth of Bugis kingdoms\n##Emergence of new political strengths over the peninsula\n##Bugis-Makassar society in the 16th century\n##Early attempts to Christianize the Bugis states\n##Quest for prestige, influence and powers over the peninsula\n##The Islamisation of Bugis-Makassar-Mandar\n##The twilight of dominance\n##A new golden age\n#Culture\n##Language and dialects\n##Philosophy\n##Traditional script\n##Folklore and literary traditions\n##Dress, textiles and weaving traditions\n##Culinary traditions\n##Weaponry and military traditions\n##Traditional architecture\n##Maritime, mercantile and migratory traditions\n##Rice and agrarian traditions\n##Festivals, celebrations and religious traditions\n##Musical traditions and performing arts\n#See also\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She is the leader of the Brothers of Italy party and the first woman to hold the office of Prime Minister in the country's history. Meloni has been a prominent figure in Italian politics for over two decades, known for her nationalist and conservative views.\n\n# Early life\n\nGiorgia Meloni was born on January 15, 1977, in Rome, Italy. Her father, Francesco Meloni, was a tax advisor, and her mother, Anna Paratore, was a librarian. Meloni grew up in the Garbatella neighborhood of Rome, where she developed an interest in politics from an early age.\n\n## Education and early political activism\n\nMeloni attended the Aristide Gabelli high school in Rome, where she became involved in student activism. She joined the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a neo-fascist party, at the age of 15. After completing her secondary education, Meloni enrolled in the Sapienza University of Rome, where she studied political science. However, she did not complete her degree, choosing instead to focus on her political career.\n\n# Political career\n\nMeloni's entry into politics began in the late 1990s, when she joined the National Alliance (AN) party, a successor to the MSI. She quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the president of the party's youth wing, Azione Giovani, in 2004. Two years later, she was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, representing the Lazio region.\n\n## Minister of Youth\n\nIn 2008, Meloni was appointed Minister of Youth in the government of Silvio Berlusconi. At the time, she was the youngest minister in the Italian government, aged just 31. During her tenure, she implemented several initiatives aimed at promoting youth employment and education.\n\n## Leader of Brothers of Italy\n\nIn 2012, Meloni co-founded the Brothers of Italy party, along with Ignazio La Russa and Guido Crosetto. The party emerged from a split within the People of Freedom (PdL) party, which was led by Berlusconi. Meloni became the leader of the Brothers of Italy in 2014, after La Russa stepped down from the position.\n\n## 2022 Italian general election\n\nIn the 2022 Italian general election, the Brothers of Italy party, led by Meloni, emerged as the largest party in the Italian Parliament. The party won 26% of the vote, securing 119 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 66 seats in the Senate. Meloni's victory marked a significant shift to the right in Italian politics, with the Brothers of Italy and its allies winning a majority of seats in both houses of Parliament.\n\n# Prime Minister of Italy\n\nOn October 21, 2022, Meloni was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Italy, becoming the first woman to hold the office in the country's history. Her government is a coalition between the Brothers of Italy, the League, and Forza Italia.\n\n## Government formation\n\nMeloni's government is composed of 24 ministers, including several high-profile appointments. Antonio Tajani, a former President of the European Parliament, was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Giancarlo Giorgetti, a prominent League politician, was appointed Minister of Economy and Finance.\n\n## Domestic policies\n\nMeloni's government has implemented several domestic policies aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing bureaucracy. The government has also introduced measures to increase support for families and reduce the cost of living.\n\n## Constitutional reform\n\nMeloni's government has proposed several constitutional reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral system and the powers of the President of the Republic. The reforms are aimed at increasing the stability and efficiency of the Italian political system.\n\n## Foreign policy\n\nMeloni's government has taken a tough stance on several foreign policy issues, including immigration and relations with the European Union. The government has also sought to strengthen ties with other European countries, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n# Political positions\n\nMeloni is known for her nationalist and conservative views, which have been shaped by her experiences as a politician and her upbringing in a right-wing family.\n\n## Social issues\n\nMeloni is opposed to same-sex marriage and has expressed concerns about the erosion of traditional family values. She has also taken a tough stance on abortion, advocating for greater restrictions on the procedure.\n\n## Feminism\n\nMeloni has described herself as a feminist, but her views on feminism are distinct from those of many other feminists. She has argued that feminism should focus on promoting the rights and interests of women, rather than seeking to create a more equal society.\n\n## Immigration and multiculturalism\n\nMeloni is opposed to mass immigration and has argued that Italy should prioritize the integration of immigrants who are already in the country. She has also expressed concerns about the impact of multiculturalism on Italian society.\n\n## Foreign issues\n\nMeloni has taken a tough stance on several foreign policy issues, including relations with Russia and China. She has argued that Italy should prioritize its relationships with other European countries and the United States.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines\n\nMeloni has been critical of the Italian government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing that it has been too slow to react and too restrictive in its measures. She has also expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of vaccines.\n\n## Relationship with fascism\n\nMeloni has been accused of having ties to fascist groups and ideologies, which she has denied. She has argued that her party is a mainstream conservative party and that it has no connection to fascism.\n\n# Personal life\n\nMeloni is in a long-term relationship with Andrea Giambruno, a journalist and politician. The couple has one daughter, Ginevra, who was born in 2016.\n\n# Honours and recognition\n\nMeloni has received several honors and awards for her work as a politician. In 2022, she was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine.\n\n## Foreign honours\n\nMeloni has received several foreign honors, including the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.\n\n# Electoral history\n\nMeloni has contested several elections throughout her career, including parliamentary and local elections.\n\n## First-past-the-post elections\n\nMeloni has contested several first-past-the-post elections, including the 2006 and 2008 Italian general elections.\n\n## Municipal elections\n\nMeloni has contested several municipal elections, including the 2008 Rome municipal election.\n\n# See also\n\n* Brothers of Italy\n* National Alliance\n* Italian Social Movement\n* Italian general election, 2022\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This article does not include any citations or references.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n*Note: This article does not include a bibliography.\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This article does not include any external links.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Giorgia_Meloni\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n##Education and early political activism\n#Political career\n##Minister of Youth\n##Leader of Brothers of Italy\n##2022 Italian general election\n#Prime Minister of Italy\n##Government formation\n##Domestic policies\n##Constitutional reform\n##Foreign policy\n#Political positions\n##Social issues\n##Feminism\n##Immigration and multiculturalism\n##Foreign issues\n##COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines\n##Relationship with fascism\n#Personal life\n#Honours and recognition\n##Foreign honours\n#Electoral history\n##First-past-the-post elections\n##Municipal elections\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are predominantly Twelver Shia Muslims, with smaller communities of Alawites and Isma'ilis. The Shia community in Lebanon has a rich history dating back to the early Islamic period, and has played a significant role in shaping the country's politics, culture, and society.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of Shia Islam in Lebanon date back to the 7th century, when the Islamic conquest of the region took place. The Shia community in Lebanon is believed to have originated from the city of Tyre, which was a major center of Shia learning and culture during the early Islamic period. The Shia community in Tyre was influenced by the teachings of the Imam Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, who is revered by Shia Muslims as the rightful successor to the Prophet.\n\n## Early Islamic period\n\nDuring the early Islamic period, the Shia community in Lebanon was subject to persecution by the ruling Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs, who saw Shia Islam as a threat to their authority. Despite this, the Shia community in Lebanon continued to grow and thrive, with many Shia scholars and theologians making significant contributions to Islamic learning and culture.\n\n## Mamluk period\n\nDuring the Mamluk period, which lasted from the 13th to the 16th century, the Shia community in Lebanon faced significant challenges. The Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who controlled Lebanon during this period, were Sunni Muslims who saw Shia Islam as a heresy. As a result, the Shia community in Lebanon was subject to persecution, and many Shia Muslims were forced to convert to Sunni Islam.\n\n## Under Ottoman rule\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled Lebanon from the 16th to the 20th century, was more tolerant of Shia Islam than the Mamluks. However, the Shia community in Lebanon still faced significant challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, and lack of access to education and healthcare.\n\n### Relations with Safavid Iran\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Shia community in Lebanon had significant relations with Safavid Iran, which was a Shia Muslim empire that ruled much of the Middle East during this period. The Safavid rulers of Iran saw the Shia community in Lebanon as an important ally, and provided them with significant financial and military support.\n\n## French mandate period\n\nDuring the French mandate period, which lasted from the 1920s to the 1940s, the Shia community in Lebanon faced significant challenges. The French rulers of Lebanon saw the Shia community as a potential threat to their authority, and sought to undermine their power and influence.\n\n### Education\n\nDuring the French mandate period, the Shia community in Lebanon made significant progress in education. The French established a number of schools and universities in Lebanon, which provided Shia Muslims with access to education and training.\n\n### Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n\nIn 1926, the French established the Ja'fari shar'ia courts, which were a system of courts that applied Shia Islamic law to Shia Muslims in Lebanon. The Ja'fari shar'ia courts provided Shia Muslims with a degree of autonomy and self-governance, and helped to promote the development of Shia Islam in Lebanon.\n\n# Sub-groups\n\n## Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n\nThe Shia Twelvers, also known as the Metouali, are the largest sub-group of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They are Twelver Shia Muslims, who believe in the authority of the twelve imams who are descended from the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n## Alawites\n\nThe Alawites are a small sub-group of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They are a mystical and esoteric sect that originated in Syria, and believe in the divinity of the Imam Ali.\n\n## Isma'ilis\n\nThe Isma'ilis are a small sub-group of Shia Muslims in Lebanon. They are a mystical and esoteric sect that originated in Persia, and believe in the authority of the Isma'ili imams.\n\n# Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n\nThe Shia community in Lebanon is concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the country. The largest Shia cities in Lebanon are Tyre, Sidon, and Nabatieh, which are located in the south. The Shia community is also present in significant numbers in the Bekaa Valley, which is located in eastern Lebanon.\n\n# Demographics\n\nThe Shia community in Lebanon makes up around 27-30% of the country's population. The Shia community is predominantly rural, with many Shia Muslims living in small villages and towns in southern and eastern Lebanon.\n\n# Genetics\n\nStudies have shown that the Shia community in Lebanon has a unique genetic profile, which is distinct from other communities in the region. The Shia community in Lebanon has a high incidence of genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.\n\n# Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n\n## Religious figures\n\n* Imam Musa al-Sadr, a prominent Shia cleric and politician who disappeared in 1978.\n* Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, a prominent Shia cleric and politician who died in 2010.\n* Ayatollah Ali al-Amin, a prominent Shia cleric and politician who is currently the leader of the Ja'fari shar'ia courts in Lebanon.\n\n## Political figures\n\n* Nabih Berri, the current Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament and leader of the Amal Movement.\n* Hassan Nasrallah, the current leader of Hezbollah.\n* Ali Qanso, a former minister and politician who is currently the leader of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.\n\n## Academics\n\n* Dr. Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah, a prominent Shia scholar and historian who is currently the dean of the faculty of Islamic studies at the Lebanese University.\n* Dr. Ali Al-Faqih, a prominent Shia scholar and historian who is currently the head of the department of Islamic studies at the American University of Beirut.\n\n## Artists, singers and journalists\n\n* Fairouz, a prominent Lebanese singer and actress who is a Shia Muslim.\n* Majida El Roumi, a prominent Lebanese singer who is a Shia Muslim.\n* Ali Al-Amin, a prominent Lebanese journalist and writer who is a Shia Muslim.\n\n# See also\n\n* Shia Islam in Lebanon\n* History of Lebanon\n* Politics of Lebanon\n* Culture of Lebanon\n\n# References\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lebanese_Shia_Muslims\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Origins\n##Early Islamic period\n##Mamluk period\n##Under Ottoman rule\n###Relations with Safavid Iran\n##French mandate period\n###Education\n###Ja'fari shar'ia courts\n#Sub-groups\n##Shia Twelvers (Metouali)\n##Alawites\n##Isma'ilis\n#Geographic distribution within Lebanon\n#Demographics\n#Genetics\n#Notable Lebanese Shia Muslims\n##Religious figures\n##Political figures\n##Academics\n##Artists, singers and journalists\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Afghan history, known for his military campaigns, diplomatic maneuvers, and efforts to modernize the country.\n\nBackground and rise to power\n==========================\n\nDost Mohammad Khan was born in 1793 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to a prominent Pashtun family. His father, Sardar Payinda Khan, was a high-ranking official in the Durrani Empire, which had ruled Afghanistan since the mid-18th century. Dost Mohammad Khan's early life was marked by turmoil, as the Durrani Empire was weakened by internal conflicts and external pressures.\n\nIn 1801, the Durrani Empire was divided into several smaller kingdoms, and Dost Mohammad Khan's family was forced to flee Kandahar. They eventually settled in Kabul, where Dost Mohammad Khan began to build a reputation as a skilled military leader. In 1823, he seized power in Kabul and established the Barakzai dynasty, which would rule Afghanistan for the next four decades.\n\nEuropean influence in Afghanistan\n================================\n\nDuring Dost Mohammad Khan's reign, Afghanistan became increasingly entangled in the Great Game, a struggle for influence and control between European powers in Central Asia. The British Empire, in particular, sought to expand its influence in the region, driven by concerns about Russian expansionism and the security of British India.\n\nIn 1837, the British government sent a diplomatic mission to Kabul, led by Sir Alexander Burnes, to negotiate a treaty with Dost Mohammad Khan. However, the mission was unsuccessful, and tensions between the two countries escalated. The British eventually launched the First Anglo-Afghan War, which resulted in the occupation of Kabul and the installation of a puppet ruler, Shah Shuja Durrani.\n\nWar with the Sikhs\n================\n\nIn addition to the European powers, Dost Mohammad Khan also faced challenges from neighboring states, including the Sikh Empire, which had been expanding its territory in the region. In 1834, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a campaign against the Sikhs, seeking to capture the strategic city of Peshawar.\n\nThe war with the Sikhs was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Jamrud, which took place in 1837. Although Dost Mohammad Khan's forces were ultimately defeated, he was able to negotiate a treaty with the Sikhs, which secured a temporary peace.\n\nSecond reign\n============\n\nIn 1842, Dost Mohammad Khan returned to power in Kabul, following the withdrawal of British forces from Afghanistan. He quickly set about rebuilding his government and military, seeking to modernize and strengthen his country.\n\n### Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n\nOne of Dost Mohammad Khan's key objectives was to reunify the country, which had been fragmented during the civil war. In 1845, he launched a campaign against the Balkh Wilayat, a region in northern Afghanistan that had been ruled by a rival faction. Dost Mohammad Khan's forces were successful, and the Balkh Wilayat was incorporated into the kingdom.\n\n### Alliance with the British\n\nDespite the earlier conflict, Dost Mohammad Khan also sought to establish a new relationship with the British. In 1855, he signed a treaty with the British government, which established formal diplomatic relations between the two countries. The treaty also provided for British assistance in modernizing Afghanistan's military and infrastructure.\n\n### Conquest of Herat and Death\n\nIn 1862, Dost Mohammad Khan launched a final campaign against the city of Herat, which had been ruled by a rival faction. Although he was successful in capturing the city, he died in 1863, at the age of 70, before he could consolidate his gains.\n\nGallery\n=======\n\n* Image: Dost Mohammad Khan.jpg\n* Image: Map of Afghanistan in 1839.jpg\n* Image: Battle of Jamrud.jpg\n\nSee also\n=========\n\n* Barakzai dynasty\n* Durrani Empire\n* First Anglo-Afghan War\n* Great Game\n* History of Afghanistan\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nSources\n------\n\nExternal links\n=============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dost_Mohammad_Khan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background and rise to power\n#European influence in Afghanistan\n#War with the Sikhs\n#Second reign\n##Conquest of the Balkh Wilayat\n##Alliance with the British\n##Conquest of Herat and Death\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fourteenth named storm, eighth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 7 and gradually strengthened into a hurricane, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nMeteorological History\n--------------------\n\nNicole originated from a broad area of low pressure that developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 5. The system gradually organized, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring it as a potential tropical cyclone on November 6. The next day, the system developed a closed circulation, and the NHC classified it as a subtropical cyclone, naming it Nicole. Initially, Nicole's structure was disorganized, with the center of circulation exposed and a large area of thunderstorms displaced to the north. However, as the system moved northward, it began to acquire tropical characteristics, and the NHC reclassified it as a tropical cyclone on November 9.\n\nNicole continued to strengthen, and on November 10, the NHC upgraded it to a hurricane. The storm's intensification was fueled by warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment. Nicole reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on November 11, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 964 mbar (28.47 inHg). The storm's large size and powerful winds made it a significant threat to the Bahamas and the southeastern United States.\n\nPreparations\n------------\n\n### Bahamas\n\nThe Bahamian government issued a hurricane warning for the entire country on November 9, advising residents to prepare for the worst. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for the Abaco Islands, which were still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Dorian in 2019. Emergency shelters were opened, and residents were advised to stock up on food, water, and other essential supplies. The Royal Bahamas Defence Force and other emergency responders were placed on high alert, ready to respond to any emergencies.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nThe state of Florida was placed under a state of emergency on November 10, with Governor Ron DeSantis activating the state's emergency operations center. A hurricane warning was issued for the entire east coast of Florida, from the Georgia border to the Miami-Dade County line. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for several coastal counties, including Volusia, Flagler, and St. Johns. Residents were advised to seek shelter inland, and emergency shelters were opened in several locations. The Florida National Guard was deployed to assist with evacuations and other emergency response efforts.\n\n#### Neighboring states\n\nOther states in the southeastern United States, including Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, also took precautions in anticipation of Nicole's arrival. A state of emergency was declared in Georgia, and a hurricane watch was issued for the coastal counties. In South Carolina, a state of emergency was declared, and a hurricane watch was issued for the coastal counties. In North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the coastal counties.\n\nImpact\n-------\n\n### Lesser Antilles\n\nNicole brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the Lesser Antilles, particularly to the islands of Barbados, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. The storm caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In Barbados, the storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, and the government declared a state of emergency.\n\n### Greater Antilles\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Greater Antilles, particularly to the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba. In Haiti, the storm caused widespread flooding and landslides, particularly in the western part of the country. In the Dominican Republic, the storm caused power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In Cuba, the storm brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the eastern part of the country.\n\n### Bahamas\n\nNicole made landfall in the Bahamas on November 11, bringing hurricane-force winds and a storm surge to the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island. The storm caused widespread destruction, particularly in the Abaco Islands, which were still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Dorian in 2019. The storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, and the government declared a state of emergency.\n\n### United States\n\n#### Florida\n\nNicole made landfall in Florida on November 12, bringing hurricane-force winds and a storm surge to the eastern part of the state. The storm caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In Volusia County, the storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, and the government declared a state of emergency. In Flagler County, the storm caused widespread destruction, particularly in the city of Flagler Beach.\n\n#### Elsewhere\n\nNicole's outer rain bands brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to other parts of the southeastern United States, particularly to the states of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. In Georgia, the storm caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In South Carolina, the storm caused flooding in several coastal areas, and the government declared a state of emergency. In North Carolina, the storm brought tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall to the eastern part of the state.\n\n### Canada\n\nNicole's remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the Canadian Maritimes, particularly to the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The storm caused widespread power outages and damage to buildings and infrastructure. In Nova Scotia, the storm caused flooding in several coastal areas, and the government declared a state of emergency.\n\nAftermath\n----------\n\nThe aftermath of Nicole was marked by widespread destruction and displacement, particularly in the Bahamas and the southeastern United States. The storm caused over $1 billion in damages and displaced thousands of people. The governments of the affected countries and states declared states of emergency and activated emergency response efforts to assist with relief and recovery efforts.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Hurricane Dorian (2019)\n* Hurricane Irma (2017)\n* Hurricane Matthew (2016)\n* List of Category 3 hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hurricane_Nicole_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Neighboring states\n#Impact\n##Lesser Antilles\n##Greater Antilles\n##Bahamas\n##United States\n###Florida\n###Elsewhere\n##Canada\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi began playing football at a young age and quickly developed a passion for the sport. His exceptional skills and achievements have made him a global icon, with numerous accolades and records to his name.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nMessi was born to Jorge Messi, a steel factory worker, and Celia Cuccittini, a part-time cleaner. He was the third of four children, and his family lived in a small house in the La Bajada neighborhood of Rosario. Messi's early life was marked by poverty, and his family struggled to make ends meet. However, his parents encouraged his love for football, and he began playing with his older brothers and friends in the streets.\n\nYouth Career\n------------\n\n### Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n\nAt the age of eight, Messi joined the local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father. Two years later, he moved to Newell's Old Boys, one of the biggest clubs in Rosario. Messi's talent quickly became apparent, and he led his team to numerous victories in local tournaments. In 1998, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, which required expensive treatment. His family struggled to afford the treatment, but Messi's talent eventually caught the attention of FC Barcelona, who offered to pay for his treatment if he joined their youth academy.\n\n### Barcelona (2000–2004)\n\nIn 2000, Messi and his family moved to Spain, where he joined Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia. Messi quickly adapted to the new environment and formed close friendships with his teammates, including Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. Under the guidance of coach Frank Rijkaard, Messi developed his skills and played for various youth teams, including the U-15 and U-17 sides.\n\nClub Career\n------------\n\n### Barcelona (2004–2021)\n\n#### 2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n\nMessi made his professional debut for Barcelona in 2004, coming on as a substitute in a match against Espanyol. Over the next few years, he gradually established himself as a regular member of the first team, playing alongside stars like Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o. In 2006, Messi won his first La Liga title and the Champions League, scoring a crucial goal in the final against Arsenal.\n\n#### 2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\n\nIn 2008, Pep Guardiola took over as Barcelona's manager, and Messi's career reached new heights. Under Guardiola's tutelage, Messi developed into a more complete player, scoring goals and providing assists in equal measure. During this period, Barcelona won 14 trophies, including two La Liga titles, the Champions League, and the Copa del Rey. Messi won the Ballon d'Or in 2009, 2010, and 2011, cementing his status as the world's best player.\n\n#### 2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\n\nThe 2012-13 season was a record-breaking year for Messi, as he scored 91 goals in all competitions, breaking Gerd Müller's 40-year-old record. However, Barcelona's dominance began to wane, and the team's reliance on Messi became increasingly apparent. The term \"Messidependencia\" was coined to describe the team's dependence on their star player.\n\n#### 2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\n\nIn 2014, Luis Enrique took over as Barcelona's manager, and Messi formed a deadly attacking trio with Luis Suárez and Neymar, known as MSN. During this period, Barcelona won the treble, including the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. Messi won the Ballon d'Or in 2015, and the MSN trio became one of the most feared attacking units in the world.\n\n#### 2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\n\nIn 2017, Neymar left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain, and the MSN trio was disbanded. Messi continued to play for Barcelona, but the team's fortunes began to decline. In 2020, Barcelona suffered a humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and Messi's future at the club became increasingly uncertain.\n\n### Paris Saint-Germain (2021–2023)\n\nIn August 2021, Messi joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer, ending his 21-year association with Barcelona. Messi signed a four-year contract with the French club, with an option to extend for a further year. He was reunited with his former teammate Neymar, and the two formed a deadly attacking duo with Kylian Mbappé.\n\n### Inter Miami (2023–present)\n\nIn July 2023, Messi joined Inter Miami on a free transfer, signing a five-year contract with the Major League Soccer club. Messi's move to the United States marked a new chapter in his career, as he looked to conquer the American market and help grow the popularity of football in the country.\n\nInternational Career\n-------------------\n\nMessi has been a key player for the Argentina national team throughout his career, earning over 160 caps and scoring over 80 goals. He made his international debut in 2005, coming on as a substitute in a match against Hungary. Messi has played in five World Cups, including the 2014 tournament, where Argentina reached the final, only to lose to Germany. He has also played in four Copa América tournaments, winning the title in 2021.\n\nPlayer Profile\n----------------\n\n### Style of play\n\nMessi is known for his exceptional dribbling skills, speed, and vision on the pitch. He is a versatile player who can play anywhere across the front line, but his preferred position is as a left forward. Messi is renowned for his ability to beat defenders with his quick feet and agility, and his finishing is clinical and precise.\n\n### Tactical positioning\n\nMessi's tactical positioning on the pitch has evolved over the years, from a traditional left winger to a more central role as a false 9. Under Pep Guardiola, Messi played as a left forward, cutting inside and creating space for his teammates. In recent years, he has played as a more central attacker, dropping deep and creating chances for his teammates with his vision and passing range.\n\nReception\n----------\n\n### Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nMessi's rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo has been one of the most enduring and intense in football history. Both players have been accused of being selfish and egotistical, but their on-field performances have been nothing short of phenomenal. Messi and Ronaldo have won numerous accolades, including multiple Ballon d'Or awards, and their rivalry has been credited with raising the bar for footballers around the world.\n\n### Comparisons with Diego Maradona\n\nMessi has often been compared to his compatriot Diego Maradona, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Maradona's playing style and mentality have been cited as an inspiration by Messi, who has sought to emulate his idol's success on the pitch. However, Messi's critics have accused him of lacking the charisma and leadership qualities that made Maradona a legend.\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\n### Popularity\n\nMessi's popularity extends far beyond the football pitch. He has been named as one of the most popular athletes in the world, with a massive following on social media. Messi's endorsement deals and sponsorships have made him one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, and his brand has become synonymous with excellence and success.\n\n### Wealth and sponsorships\n\nMessi's net worth is estimated to be over $400 million, making him one of the richest athletes in the world. He has endorsement deals with major brands such as Adidas, Pepsi, and EA Sports, and has appeared in numerous advertising campaigns and commercials.\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nMessi is known for his charitable work, particularly in his hometown of Rosario. He has donated to various causes, including children's hospitals and schools, and has supported several charitable organizations, including UNICEF and the Leo Messi Foundation.\n\n### Public art\n\nMessi has been the subject of several public art installations, including a statue in his hometown of Rosario and a mural in Barcelona. His image has also been used in various forms of street art, including graffiti and stencil art.\n\n### Media\n\nMessi has been the subject of several documentaries and films, including \"Messi\" (2014) and \"Take the Ball, Pass the Ball\" (2018). He has also appeared in numerous television commercials and advertising campaigns.\n\n### Business ventures\n\nMessi has invested in several business ventures, including a chain of hotels and a clothing line. He has also launched his own line of perfumes and fragrances.\n\nPersonal life\n--------------\n\n### Family and relationships\n\nMessi has been in a long-term relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, whom he met in 2008. The couple has three children together and got married in 2017. Messi's family has been a constant source of support throughout his career, and he has often credited them with helping him stay grounded and focused.\n\n### Tax fraud\n\nIn 2013, Messi was accused of tax fraud by the Spanish authorities, who claimed that he had failed to pay taxes on his earnings from endorsement deals. Messi denied the allegations and claimed that he had relied on his father to handle his finances. He eventually paid a fine of €5 million and agreed to pay back the taxes owed.\n\nCareer statistics\n------------------\n\n### Club\n\n* Barcelona (2004-2021): 778 appearances, 672 goals\n* Paris Saint-Germain (2021-2023): 74 appearances, 29 goals\n* Inter Miami (2023-present): 10 appearances, 4 goals\n\n### International\n\n* Argentina (2005-present): 164 appearances, 86 goals\n\nHonours\n--------\n\n### Club\n\n* La Liga (10): 2004-05, 2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2017-18, 2018-19\n* Copa del Rey (7): 2008-09, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2020-21\n* Supercopa de España (8): 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018\n* UEFA Champions League (4): 2005-06, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2014-15\n* UEFA Super Cup (3): 2009, 2011, 2015\n* FIFA Club World Cup (3): 2009, 2011, 2015\n\n### International\n\n* Copa América (1): 2021\n* Olympic Gold Medal (1): 2008\n* FIFA U-20 World Cup (1): 2005\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* List of FIFA World Cup winning players\n* List of UEFA Champions League winning players\n* List of La Liga top scorers\n* List of Copa América winning captains\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lionel_Messi\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Youth career\n##Newell's Old Boys (1995–2000)\n##Barcelona (2000–2004)\n#Club career\n##Barcelona (2004–2021)\n###2004–2008: Rise to the first team\n###2008–2012: Success under Pep Guardiola\n###2012–2014: Record-breaking year and Messidependencia\n###2014–2017: Arrival of Luis Enrique and birth of MSN\n###2017–2021: Final years at Barcelona\n##Paris Saint-Germain (2021–2023)\n##Inter Miami (2023–present)\n#International career\n#Player profile\n##Style of play\n##Tactical positioning\n#Reception\n##Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\n##Comparisons with Diego Maradona\n#In popular culture\n##Popularity\n##Wealth and sponsorships\n##Philanthropy\n##Public art\n##Media\n##Business ventures\n#Personal life\n##Family and relationships\n##Tax fraud\n#Career statistics\n##Club\n##International\n#Honours\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were the leaders, thinkers, and politicians who drafted the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. These documents, which have become the foundation of American democracy, were the result of a long process of debate, negotiation, and compromise among the Founding Fathers.\n\n# Historical founders\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" refers specifically to the group of individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and played a leading role in the American Revolution. However, the concept of a \"founding\" generation extends beyond this narrow definition. The historical founders of the United States include not only the signers of the Declaration of Independence but also other key figures who contributed to the growth and development of the American colonies.\n\n# Origin of phrase\n\nThe term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used in the early 20th century to describe the group of individuals who played a leading role in the American Revolution. However, the concept of a \"founding\" generation has its roots in the 18th century, when American colonists began to speak of a \"founding\" generation of colonial leaders who had established the first settlements in North America.\n\n# List of Founding Fathers\n\n## Framers and signers\n\nThe following individuals were among the key framers and signers of the Declaration of Independence:\n\n* George Washington\n* John Adams\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* James Madison\n* Benjamin Franklin\n* Samuel Adams\n* Patrick Henry\n* John Hancock\n* Roger Sherman\n* Robert Livingston\n\n### Other delegates\n\nIn addition to the signers of the Declaration of Independence, there were many other delegates who played important roles in the Continental Congress. Some notable examples include:\n\n* George Mason\n* James Monroe\n* Alexander Hamilton\n* Thomas Paine\n* John Jay\n\n## Additional Founding Fathers\n\nThe following individuals are often considered to be among the Founding Fathers, although they did not sign the Declaration of Independence:\n\n* George Wythe\n* Edmund Randolph\n* James Wilson\n* Oliver Ellsworth\n* William Paterson\n\n## Women founders\n\nAlthough women did not play a direct role in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution, many women made important contributions to the American Revolution and the early years of the United States. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Abigail Adams\n* Deborah Read Franklin\n* Esther Reed\n* Mercy Otis Warren\n\n## Other patriots\n\nThere were many other individuals who played important roles in the American Revolution and the early years of the United States. Some notable examples include:\n\n* Crispus Attucks\n* Paul Revere\n* Joseph Warren\n* John Paul Jones\n\n# The colonies unite (1765–1774)\n\nThe American colonies began to unite in the mid-18th century, as they faced a series of common challenges and threats from Great Britain. The Stamp Act of 1765, which imposed a tax on printed materials, sparked widespread protests and boycotts throughout the colonies. The Boston Massacre of 1770 and the Boston Tea Party of 1773 further escalated tensions between the colonies and Great Britain.\n\n# Continental Congress (1774–1775)\n\n## First Continental Congress (1774)\n\nIn response to the Intolerable Acts, which were passed by the British Parliament in 1774, the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in September of that year. The Congress, which was attended by representatives from 12 colonies, issued a statement of grievances and called for a boycott of British goods.\n\n## Second Continental Congress (1775)\n\nThe Second Continental Congress convened in May 1775, following the outbreak of fighting at Lexington and Concord. The Congress, which was attended by representatives from all 13 colonies, established the Continental Army and appointed George Washington as its commander-in-chief.\n\n# Declaration of Independence (1776)\n\nThe Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The document, which was written by Thomas Jefferson, declared the 13 American colonies to be independent and sovereign states.\n\n# Fighting for independence\n\nThe American Revolutionary War lasted from 1775 to 1783, as the Continental Army fought against the British Army and its allies. The war was marked by several key battles, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Saratoga, and the Battle of Yorktown.\n\n## Treaty of Paris\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, which was signed in 1783, officially ended the American Revolutionary War and recognized American independence.\n\n# Constitutional Convention\n\nThe Constitutional Convention, which was held in 1787, was a gathering of delegates from the 13 states who met to draft a new constitution for the United States. The Convention, which was attended by many of the same individuals who had played leading roles in the American Revolution, resulted in the creation of the United States Constitution.\n\n## Virginia and New Jersey plans\n\nThe Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan were two competing proposals for a new constitution that were presented at the Constitutional Convention. The Virginia Plan, which was proposed by James Madison, called for a strong central government with three branches. The New Jersey Plan, which was proposed by William Paterson, called for a weaker central government with more power reserved for the states.\n\n## Connecticut Compromise\n\nThe Connecticut Compromise, which was proposed by Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth, called for a bicameral legislature with equal representation for each state in the Senate and representation based on population in the House of Representatives.\n\n## State ratification conventions\n\nThe United States Constitution was ratified by the states in 1788, following a series of state ratification conventions. The ratification process was marked by intense debate and negotiation, as opponents of the Constitution argued that it gave too much power to the federal government.\n\n## New form of government\n\nThe United States Constitution established a new form of government for the United States, with a strong central government and three branches. The Constitution also established the Bill of Rights, which guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms to American citizens.\n\n## Bill of Rights\n\nThe Bill of Rights, which was added to the Constitution in 1791, consisted of 10 amendments that guaranteed certain fundamental rights and freedoms to American citizens. The amendments included the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to a fair trial.\n\n# Ascending to the presidency\n\nGeorge Washington, who was the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolution, was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in 1789. Washington's leadership and vision helped to establish the office of the presidency and set important precedents for future presidents.\n\n# Demographics and other characteristics\n\n## Political experience\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers had extensive experience in politics and government before the American Revolution. For example, George Washington had served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, while John Adams had served in the Massachusetts General Court.\n\n## Education\n\n### American institutions\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were educated at American institutions, such as Harvard University and the College of William & Mary.\n\n### British institutions\n\nSome of the Founding Fathers, such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, were educated at British institutions, such as the University of Edinburgh and the Inns of Court.\n\n## Ethnicity\n\nThe Founding Fathers were primarily of English, Scottish, and Irish descent.\n\n## Occupations\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers were lawyers, farmers, or merchants.\n\n# Religion\n\nThe Founding Fathers were primarily Christian, although some, such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, were Deists.\n\n# Founders on currency and postage\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been honored on American currency and postage, with their images appearing on coins, bills, and stamps.\n\n# Political and cultural impact\n\n## Political rhetoric\n\nThe Founding Fathers have had a lasting impact on American politics, with their ideas and ideals continuing to shape American political discourse.\n\n## Holidays\n\nThe Founding Fathers are honored on several American holidays, including Independence Day and Presidents' Day.\n\n## Media and theater\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been portrayed in numerous films, plays, and television shows, including the musical \"1776\" and the film \"Lincoln.\"\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Founding Fathers have been honored in the names of several American sports teams, including the Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Liberty.\n\n# Religious freedom\n\nThe Founding Fathers were strong advocates for religious freedom, with many of them arguing that the government should not impose any particular religion on its citizens.\n\n# Slavery\n\nThe Founding Fathers were divided on the issue of slavery, with some, such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, owning slaves, while others, such as Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton, opposing slavery.\n\n## Reconstruction as a \"Second Founding\"\n\nSome historians have referred to the Reconstruction era, which followed the Civil War, as a \"Second Founding,\" as it marked a significant turning point in American history and the expansion of American democracy.\n\n# Scholarly analysis\n\n## Early historians\n\nEarly historians, such as George Bancroft and David Ramsay, wrote extensively about the Founding Fathers and their role in American history.\n\n## Modern historians\n\nModern historians, such as Gordon Wood and Joseph Ellis, have continued to study and write about the Founding Fathers, offering new insights and perspectives on their lives and ideas.\n\n## Noted collections\n\nSeveral notable collections of documents and artifacts related to the Founding Fathers are housed at institutions such as the Library of Congress and the National Archives.\n\n# See also\n\n* American Revolution\n* United States Constitution\n* Declaration of Independence\n* Bill of Rights\n\n# Notes\n\nNone\n\n# Citations\n\nNone\n\n# Bibliography\n\n## Journal articles\n\nNone\n\n## Online sources\n\nNone\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Books\n\n* \"The Founding Fathers\" by Richard B.

However, on February 15, 2023, she announced her resignation as leader and First Minister, citing a desire to re-energize the party and the need for a new leader to take forward the party's agenda.\n\nFollowing Sturgeon's resignation, a leadership contest was announced, with the party's national executive committee (NEC) setting out the rules and timeline for the election. The contest was open to all SNP members, with the winner to be determined by a one-member-one-vote (OMOV) system.\n\n# Issues\n\nThe leadership election was dominated by several key issues, including economics, independence, and gender recognition reform.\n\n## Economics\n\nThe SNP's economic policy has traditionally focused on promoting Scottish business and industry, as well as reducing inequality and poverty.

It is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones film series and a sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). The film stars Harrison Ford reprising his iconic role as Indiana Jones, alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Boyd Holbrook, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and Toby Jones.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe plot of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes place in 1969, during the Space Age. Indiana Jones is an older man now, and the world is changing rapidly around him. The film follows Indy as he becomes embroiled in a new adventure, racing against time to prevent a powerful artifact from falling into the wrong hands. The story explores themes of nostalgia, identity, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe cast of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny includes:\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Colonel Weber\n* Boyd Holbrook as Klaber\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Mason\n* Toby Jones as Basil Shaw\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began in 2016, when Walt Disney Pictures and Lucasfilm announced plans to produce a fifth Indiana Jones film. At the time, Steven Spielberg was set to direct, with a script by David Koepp. However, in 2018, Spielberg dropped out of the project, and James Mangold was brought on board to direct.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2020, with Mangold working on the script alongside Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth.

The film's VFX supervisor, Michael Gioulakis, worked closely with James Mangold to develop the visual style and tone of the film.\n\n### De-aging\n\nOne of the most significant visual effects challenges in the film was the de-aging of Harrison Ford. The filmmakers used advanced digital technology to create a younger version of Indy, which appears in several scenes throughout the film. The process involved creating a detailed digital model of Ford's face and body, which was then animated and integrated into the live-action footage.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was composed by John Williams, who has worked on all five Indiana Jones films. The music is a mix of action-adventure themes, nostalgic cues, and new material that reflects the changing tone and style of the film.

He began his musical studies at the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca, where he earned a degree in composition and musicology. During his early years, Țăranu was heavily influenced by the neoclassical movement, which was popular at the time. His early works, such as his String Quartet No. 1 (1956) and his Symphony No. 1 (1958), showcase his mastery of neoclassical techniques and his ability to craft elegant, balanced compositions.\n\n## Paris studies and Ars Nova\n\nIn the early 1960s, Țăranu traveled to Paris, where he studied at the École Normale de Musique. During his time in Paris, he was exposed to the avant-garde movement and the works of composers such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. This exposure had a profound impact on Țăranu's compositional style, and he began to incorporate elements of serialism and aleatory music into his works. His involvement with the Ars Nova movement, a group of Romanian composers who sought to create a new, experimental music, further solidified his position as a leading figure in Romanian musical modernism.\n\n## Postmodernism and historicism\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Țăranu's compositional style underwent a significant shift, as he began to explore elements of postmodernism and historicism. His works from this period, such as his Symphony No. 4 (1975) and his opera, \"Derby\" (1980), showcase his ability to blend disparate elements and create complex, layered compositions. Țăranu's use of quotation and allusion, as well as his incorporation of folk and popular music elements, further demonstrate his postmodern inclinations.\n\n## Old age\n\nIn his later years, Țăranu has continued to compose, albeit at a slower pace. His recent works, such as his String Quartet No. 6 (2003) and his Symphony No. 7 (2008), demonstrate a continued interest in exploring new sounds and techniques. Despite his advanced age, Țăranu remains a vital figure in Romanian musical life, and his contributions to the development of Romanian music continue to be celebrated and recognized.\n\n# Selected works\n\n* String Quartet No. 1 (1956)\n* Symphony No. 1 (1958)\n* Symphony No. 4 (1975)\n* Opera, \"Derby\" (1980)\n* String Quartet No. 6 (2003)\n* Symphony No. 7 (2008)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cornel_Țăranu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
