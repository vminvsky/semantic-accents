The association was established in 1905 and currently consists of 10 clubs competing in two divisions. The league is known for its strong country football and has produced several players who have gone on to compete at the highest levels.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association was formed in 1905, with the first game played between Elmore and Lockington. The association initially consisted of six clubs, with the league expanding to include several other clubs over the years. In the early years, the competition was dominated by the Elmore and Lockington clubs, with both teams winning multiple premierships.\n\nIn the 1920s, the league experienced significant growth, with several new clubs joining the competition. This period also saw the introduction of the O'Loan Cup, which was donated by a local businessman and has since become a prestigious award in the league.\n\nDuring World War II, the league was suspended, with many players serving overseas. The competition resumed in 1946, and the league continued to grow and expand in the post-war period.\n\nIn the 1980s, the league underwent significant changes, with the introduction of a new divisional structure and the addition of several new clubs. This period also saw a significant increase in the number of players from the league going on to compete at the highest levels, including the Victorian Football League (VFL) and the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\nFootball Clubs\n-------------\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association currently consists of 10 clubs competing in two divisions. The clubs are:\n\n* **Division 1:**\n\t+ Elmore\n\t+ Lockington\n\t+ Colbinabbin\n\t+ Heathcote\n\t+ LBU\n* **Division 2:**\n\t+ Mount Pleasant\n\t+ North Bendigo\n\t+ White Hills\n\t+ Huntly\n\t+ Leitchville Gunbower\n\nFootball Grand Finals\n--------------------\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association holds an annual grand final, with the winners of each division competing for the premiership. The grand final is typically played at a neutral venue, with the location rotating between different clubs.\n\nThe league has a strong tradition of competitive grand finals, with several matches going down to the wire in recent years. The 2019 grand final, for example, saw Elmore defeat Lockington by a single point in a thrilling contest.\n\nO'Loan Cup\n----------\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is an annual award presented to the best and fairest player in the Faithful & District Football Association. The award is named after a local businessman who donated the cup to the league in the 1920s.\n\nThe O'Loan Cup is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the league, with several players going on to compete at the highest levels after winning the award. The cup is presented at the league's annual awards night, with the winner typically receiving a trophy and a cash prize.\n\nOfficer Bearers\n----------------\n\nThe Faithful & District Football Association is governed by a committee of officer bearers, who are responsible for the administration and management of the league. The officer bearers include:\n\n* **President:** [Name]\n* **Vice President:** [Name]\n* **Secretary:** [Name]\n* **Treasurer:** [Name]\n* **Assistant Secretary:** [Name]\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*\n\nLinks\n------\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Faithful_&_District_Football_Association\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Football Clubs\n#Football Grand Finals\n#O'Loan Cup\n#Officer Bearers\n#References\n#Links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Lists_of_feature_films_with_LGBT_characters", "content": "#See also\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Lists of feature films with LGBT characters\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive list of feature films that include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) characters. The list is organized by decade and includes a brief description of each film.\n\n# 1920s-1950s\n\n## Early representations\n\nDuring the early years of cinema, LGBT characters were rarely depicted on screen. However, there were a few notable exceptions. One of the earliest films to feature a LGBT character was the 1927 German film \"Pandora's Box,\" which included a lesbian character. In the 1930s, films such as \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) and \"The Outcast\" (1934) featured gay characters, although these portrayals were often stereotypical and negative.\n\n## Censorship and the Hays Code\n\nThe Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, was a set of moral guidelines that governed the content of films produced in the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s. The code prohibited the depiction of \"sex perversion\" and \"homosexuality,\" making it difficult for films to include LGBT characters. As a result, many films that did feature LGBT characters were heavily censored or edited to remove any references to homosexuality.\n\n# 1960s-1970s\n\n## New Wave and art house cinema\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a rise in art house and New Wave cinema, which often featured more experimental and avant-garde storytelling. Films such as \"The Servant\" (1963) and \"The Killing of Sister George\" (1968) included LGBT characters and explored themes of identity and desire.\n\n## Mainstream breakthroughs\n\nIn the 1970s, mainstream films began to feature LGBT characters more prominently. Films such as \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970) and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971) were major breakthroughs in terms of representation, although they were not without controversy.\n\n# 1980s-1990s\n\n## AIDS and the gay community\n\nThe 1980s saw a rise in films that addressed the AIDS crisis and its impact on the gay community. Films such as \"An Early Frost\" (1985) and \"Longtime Companion\" (1989) were notable for their portrayal of gay characters and their experiences with HIV/AIDS.\n\n## Queer cinema\n\nThe 1990s saw a rise in queer cinema, a movement that sought to challenge traditional notions of identity and desire. Films such as \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991) and \"Desert Hearts\" (1992) were critically acclaimed and helped to establish queer cinema as a major force in independent filmmaking.\n\n# 2000s-2010s\n\n## Brokeback Mountain and beyond\n\nThe 2005 film \"Brokeback Mountain\" was a major breakthrough in terms of mainstream representation, telling the story of two gay cowboys who fall in love. The film was a critical and commercial success, and paved the way for more LGBT characters in mainstream cinema.\n\n## Contemporary representations\n\nIn recent years, there has been a surge in films that feature LGBT characters and explore themes of identity and desire.

It is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones film series and the sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). The film stars Harrison Ford reprising his role as the iconic archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones, alongside a new cast including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, and Thomas Kretschmann.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe plot of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny takes place in 1969, during the height of the Space Age. Indiana Jones is now an older man, and the world around him is changing rapidly. The story follows Jones as he becomes embroiled in a new adventure involving a mysterious ancient artifact known as the Dial of Destiny. The Dial is said to have the power to control the very fabric of time itself, and Jones must navigate treacherous rival treasure hunters, sinister government agents, and old flames to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nAs Jones embarks on his perilous quest, he is joined by his goddaughter, Helena Shaw, a brilliant and feisty young woman who is determined to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of archaeology. Together, they must use their wits, bravery, and cunning to outwit their enemies and uncover the secrets of the Dial.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw\n* Mads Mikkelsen as Jürgen Voller\n* Thomas Kretschmann as Colonel Weber\n* Boyd Holbrook as Klaber\n* Shaunette Renée Wilson as Mason\n* Olivier Richters as Hauke\n\n# Production\n\n## Development\n\nThe development of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began in 2016, when Lucasfilm announced plans to produce a fifth Indiana Jones film. Steven Spielberg was initially set to direct, but he dropped out of the project in 2020 due to creative differences. James Mangold was subsequently brought on board to direct and co-write the screenplay.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in earnest in 2020, with Mangold and his team working to develop the script and assemble a cast. Harrison Ford was confirmed to reprise his role as Indiana Jones, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge was cast as his goddaughter, Helena Shaw.\n\n## Casting\n\nThe casting process for the film was a lengthy and secretive one, with many actors rumored to be in contention for roles. Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Kretschmann were eventually cast as the film's main villains, while Boyd Holbrook and Shaunette Renée Wilson were cast in supporting roles.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began in June 2021 and wrapped in February 2022. The film was shot on location in the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Italy, with additional scenes filmed at Pinewood Studios in London.\n\n## Visual effects\n\nThe visual effects for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny were created by a team of artists and technicians led by visual effects supervisor Ben Morris. The film's effects work includes extensive use of CGI, as well as practical effects such as stunts and pyrotechnics.\n\n### De-aging\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the film's visual effects is the use of de-aging technology to make Harrison Ford appear younger in certain scenes. The technology, which was developed by Lucasfilm's visual effects division, uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze and manipulate facial features.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny was composed by John Williams, who has scored every Indiana Jones film to date. The score features a mix of classic Indiana Jones themes, as well as new and innovative music.\n\n# Themes and influences\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny draws on a wide range of themes and influences, including classic adventure films, pulp fiction, and mythology. The film's story is heavily influenced by the works of H.P. Lovecraft and other pulp authors, while its visuals and action sequences are inspired by classic adventure films such as the James Bond series and the films of Akira Kurosawa.\n\n# Release\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny began in earnest in 2022, with the release of a teaser trailer and a series of promotional posters. The campaign has focused heavily on social media, with Lucasfilm releasing a series of behind-the-scenes videos and images.\n\n## Theatrical\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is scheduled to be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. The film will be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and will be released in a wide range of formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema.\n\n## Home media\n\nThe film will be released on home media later in 2023, with a Blu-ray and DVD release expected in the fall.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is expected to be a major box office success, with many analysts predicting that it will gross over $1 billion worldwide.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe critical response to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has been positive, with many critics praising the film's action sequences, visuals, and performances.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film has been nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\n# Future\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is expected to be the final film in the Indiana Jones series, with Harrison Ford set to retire from the role of Indiana Jones. However, Lucasfilm has announced plans to develop a new Indiana Jones series for Disney+, which will follow a new generation of characters.\n\n# See also\n\n* Indiana Jones film series\n* James Mangold\n* Harrison Ford\n* Phoebe Waller-Bridge\n* Mads Mikkelsen\n* Thomas Kretschmann\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is based on information available up to March 2023 and may not reflect any changes or updates that occur after that date.\n\n# References\n\n* None\n\n# External links\n\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on IMDb\n* Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny on Lucasfilm.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Pre-production\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Visual effects\n###De-aging\n##Music\n#Themes and influences\n#Release\n##Marketing\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Future\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on June 20, 1934, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Țăranu has had a long and distinguished career, marked by a wide range of creative endeavors and a profound impact on Romanian music.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and neoclassical debut\n\nCornel Țăranu was born into a family of musicians. His father, a violinist, and his mother, a pianist, encouraged his early interest in music. Țăranu began studying piano at the age of six and later attended the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca, where he earned his degree in composition in 1958. During his student years, Țăranu was heavily influenced by neoclassicism, a movement that emphasized clarity, balance, and restraint. His early works, such as the Piano Sonata (1956) and the String Quartet (1957), reflect this aesthetic.\n\n## Paris studies and Ars Nova\n\nIn 1963, Țăranu received a scholarship to study at the Paris Conservatory, where he was exposed to the avant-garde movement. He became acquainted with the works of Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Olivier Messiaen, which significantly broadened his musical horizons. Țăranu's time in Paris also marked the beginning of his involvement with the Ars Nova movement, a group of Romanian composers who sought to modernize the country's musical scene. Along with other prominent composers, such as Dan Constantinescu and Anatol Vieru, Țăranu played a key role in shaping the movement's aesthetic and artistic direction.\n\n## Postmodernism and historicism\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Țăranu's compositional style underwent a significant transformation. He began to incorporate elements of postmodernism and historicism into his works, often referencing earlier musical periods and styles. This is evident in pieces such as the Symphony No. 2 (1975) and the Piano Concerto (1980), which exhibit a greater emphasis on lyricism and expressiveness. Țăranu's interest in historicism also led him to explore the music of earlier Romanian composers, such as George Enescu and Mihail Jora.\n\n## Old age\n\nIn his later years, Țăranu has continued to compose, albeit at a slower pace. He has also become increasingly involved in musicological research, publishing several books on Romanian music and composers. In 2004, he was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa by the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy, in recognition of his contributions to Romanian music. Today, Țăranu remains an important figure in Romanian cultural life, revered for his artistic achievements and his dedication to promoting the country's rich musical heritage.\n\n# Selected works\n\n* Piano Sonata (1956)\n* String Quartet (1957)\n* Symphony No. 1 (1962)\n* Piano Concerto (1980)\n* Symphony No. 2 (1975)\n* Cello Concerto (1990)\n* Violin Concerto (1995)\n* Opera \"The Master and Margarita\" (2000)\n\n# References\n\n(Note: As per your request, no references are included in this article)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: As per your request, no external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cornel_Țăranu\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and neoclassical debut\n##Paris studies and Ars Nova\n##Postmodernism and historicism\n##Old age\n#Selected works\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on December 23, 1968, in Burbank, California, Lira's life took a dramatic turn when he was arrested and charged with child sex trafficking in Ukraine.\n\n# Early life\n\nGonzalo Lira was born to Chilean parents in Burbank, California. His family moved to Chile when he was a child, and he spent most of his early life there. Lira's parents were both involved in the arts, with his mother being a painter and his father a writer. This exposure to the creative world likely influenced Lira's future pursuits.\n\nLira attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied English literature and creative writing. After graduating, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in film. Lira began working as a production assistant on various film sets before eventually landing a job as a screenwriter.\n\n## Move to Ukraine\n\nIn the early 2000s, Lira moved to Ukraine, where he settled in the city of Kharkiv. He became fascinated with the local culture and began to learn the Ukrainian language. Lira's fascination with Ukraine led him to start a blog, where he shared his experiences and observations about the country.\n\n# Career\n\nLira's career as a film director began in the early 2000s, when he directed several low-budget films, including \"Cenizas Eternas\" and \"Simplemente Jenny\". However, it was his YouTube channel and blog that brought him the most attention. Lira's videos and writings often focused on politics, culture, and social issues, with a particular emphasis on Ukraine and the conflict with Russia.\n\n## YouTube channel\n\nLira's YouTube channel, which he created in 2006, quickly gained a large following. He became known for his provocative and often humorous commentary on current events. Lira's videos frequently featured him discussing topics such as Ukrainian politics, Western media bias, and social issues like feminism and racism.\n\n## Blog\n\nIn addition to his YouTube channel, Lira maintained a blog where he shared his thoughts on various topics, including politics, culture, and personal anecdotes. His blog became popular among readers interested in Ukraine and Eastern European affairs.\n\n## Writing style and controversies\n\nLira's writing style was often described as provocative and humorous, but also sometimes inflammatory and divisive. He was known to push boundaries and challenge his readers' opinions, which led to both praise and criticism. Some of his most contentious topics included his views on feminism, his criticism of Western media, and his support for certain far-right ideologies.\n\n# Arrest and prosecution\n\nOn March 4, 2022, Lira was arrested in Kharkiv, Ukraine, by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) on charges of child sex trafficking. The SBU alleged that Lira had used his online presence to recruit and exploit minors for sex. Lira's arrest was met with shock and outrage from his fans and supporters, who claimed that the charges were fabricated and part of a larger effort to silence him.\n\n## Imprisonment and trial\n\nLira was held in pre-trial detention for several months before being released on bail in August 2022. His trial began in late 2022 and was widely covered in the media. Lira maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings, claiming that the charges were a setup and part of a larger conspiracy against him.\n\n# Death\n\nOn October 22, 2022, Lira was found dead in his apartment in Kharkiv. The official cause of death was reported as a heart attack, but many of his supporters and fans speculated that he may have been murdered. Lira's death was met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from his fans and fellow content creators.\n\n# Filmography\n\n* \"Cenizas Eternas\" (2001)\n* \"Simplemente Jenny\" (2003)\n\n# Publications\n\n* \"The Ukraine War: A Blog from the Front Lines\" (2014)\n\n# See also\n\n* Ukraine-Russia conflict\n* Far-right ideologies\n* Online censorship\n\n# References\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, citations and references are not included in this article)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, external links are not included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gonzalo_Lira\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n#Arrest and prosecution\n#Death\n#Filmography\n#Publications\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A will is a document that outlines how a person wants their property to be distributed after their death. In South Africa, the law governing testate succession is primarily based on the common law and statutes such as the Wills Act, 1953.\n\n# Freedom of Testation\n\nFreedom of testation is the principle that allows a person to dispose of their property as they see fit in their will. However, this freedom is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations.\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Illegal Dispositions and Those Against Public Policy\n\nA testator cannot make dispositions in their will that are illegal or against public policy. For example, a testator cannot leave their property to someone who is not capable of owning it, such as a minor or a person who is mentally incapacitated.\n\n### Subdivision of Agricultural Land\n\nThe Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, 1970, restricts the subdivision of agricultural land. A testator cannot leave their agricultural land to multiple beneficiaries in such a way that it would result in the land being subdivided in contravention of the Act.\n\n### Subdivision of Mineral Rights\n\nThe Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002, regulates the subdivision of mineral rights. A testator cannot leave their mineral rights to multiple beneficiaries in such a way that it would result in the rights being subdivided in contravention of the Act.\n\n### Fideicommissum Multiplex\n\nA fideicommissum multiplex is a type of testamentary disposition where a testator leaves their property to one person on the condition that they leave it to another person after their death. However, a testator cannot create a fideicommissum multiplex that would result in the property being tied up for an unreasonable period.\n\n### Maintenance of Surviving Spouse\n\nA testator has a duty to provide for their surviving spouse. If a testator fails to provide for their spouse in their will, the spouse may claim maintenance from the estate.\n\n### Maintenance and Education of Minor Children\n\nA testator also has a duty to provide for the maintenance and education of their minor children. If a testator fails to provide for their children in their will, the children may claim maintenance and education costs from the estate.\n\n### Pension Funds\n\nThe Pension Funds Act, 1956, regulates pension funds. A testator cannot leave their pension fund benefits to someone who is not entitled to them in terms of the Act.\n\n## Delegation\n\nA testator cannot delegate their power to make a will to someone else. However, a testator can appoint an executor to manage their estate after their death.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law also plays a role in testate succession in South Africa. A testator who is subject to customary law may make a will that is consistent with customary law.\n\n# Testamentary Capacity\n\nTestamentary capacity refers to the mental ability of a testator to make a valid will.\n\n## Mental Ability of the Testator\n\nA testator must have the mental ability to understand the nature and extent of their property, as well as the nature and effect of their will. A testator who is mentally incapacitated, such as someone who is suffering from dementia, may not have the capacity to make a valid will.\n\n## Undue Influence on the Testator\n\nA testator must not be subject to undue influence when making their will. Undue influence occurs when someone uses coercion, manipulation, or other forms of pressure to influence a testator's decisions.\n\n# Capacity to Witness a Will\n\nA witness to a will must have the capacity to understand the nature and effect of the will.\n\n# Formalities for Execution of a Will\n\nA will must be executed in accordance with certain formalities.\n\n## Requirements for a Testamentary Disposition\n\nA testamentary disposition must be in writing and must be signed by the testator.\n\n## Methods of Executing a Valid Will\n\nA valid will can be executed in one of two ways: by signing the will in the presence of two witnesses, or by signing the will and then acknowledging the signature in the presence of two witnesses.\n\n## Signing and Signature\n\nThe testator must sign the will in the presence of two witnesses. The signature must be made by the testator themselves, and not by someone else on their behalf.\n\n## Certificate\n\nA certificate is a document that is attached to the will and confirms that the will was executed in accordance with the formalities.\n\n## Witnesses\n\nTwo witnesses must be present when the testator signs the will. The witnesses must sign the will and confirm that the testator signed the will in their presence.\n\n# Condonation\n\nCondonation is a remedy that is available when a will is not executed in accordance with the formalities. If a will is not executed properly, the court may grant condonation and declare the will to be valid.\n\n# Invalid Wills\n\nA will can be invalidated in certain circumstances.\n\n## Revocation\n\nA will can be revoked by the testator at any time before their death.\n\n### Right of Revocation\n\nA testator has the right to revoke their will at any time before their death.\n\n### Manner\n\nA will can be revoked in one of several ways: by making a later will or codicil, by physically or symbolically destroying the will, by ademption, or by divorce or annulment of marriage.\n\n#### Later Will or Codicil\n\nA testator can revoke their will by making a later will or codicil.\n\n#### Physical or Symbolic Destruction\n\nA testator can revoke their will by physically or symbolically destroying the will.\n\n#### Ademption\n\nAdemption occurs when a testator leaves property in their will that they no longer own at the time of their death.\n\n#### Divorce or Annulment of Marriage\n\nA divorce or annulment of marriage can revoke a will.\n\n### Exceptions to the General Rule that a Will Can Be Revoked\n\nThere are certain exceptions to the general rule that a will can be revoked. For example, a testator cannot revoke a joint will.\n\n### Revival of a Revoked Will\n\nA revoked will can be revived in certain circumstances.\n\n## Alteration or Variation\n\nA will can be altered or varied in certain circumstances.\n\n### Amendment by Testator\n\nA testator can amend their will by making a codicil.\n\n### Rectification by Court\n\nThe court can rectify a will if it contains a clerical error or other mistake.\n\n### Alteration or Variation by the Court\n\nThe court can alter or vary a will in certain circumstances, such as when the will is unclear or ambiguous.\n\n## Incorporation by Reference\n\nA will can incorporate other documents by reference.\n\n# Obsolete and Provincial Wills\n\nObsolete and provincial wills are wills that were made before the Wills Act, 1953, came into effect.\n\n# Joint or Mutual Wills\n\nJoint or mutual wills are wills that are made by two or more people.\n\n# Probate of Wills\n\nProbate is the process of proving a will in

results in the property being accumulated in the hands of one person.\n\n## Customary Law\n\nCustomary law can affect the content of a will.\n\n## Testamentary Devices\n\nA will can use various testamentary devices, such as usufruct and substitution.\n\n### Usufruct\n\nUsufruct is a right to use and enjoy property for a period of time.\n\n### Substitution\n\nSubstitution is a provision in a will that substitutes one beneficiary for another.\n\n#### Direct Substitution\n\nDirect substitution occurs when a testator substitutes one beneficiary for another directly.\n\n#### Fideicommissary Substitution\n\nFideicommissary substitution occurs when a testator substitutes one beneficiary for another on the condition that they meet certain requirements.\n\n### Difference between Usufruct and Fideicommissum\n\nUsufruct and fideicommissum are two different types of testamentary devices.\n\n### Fideicommissum Residui\n\nFideicommissum residui is a provision in a will that leaves the residue of the estate to a beneficiary on the condition that they meet certain requirements.\n\n### Fideicommissum Purum\n\nFideicommissum purum is a provision in a will that leaves property to a beneficiary

on the condition that they meet certain requirements.\n\n## Bequests Subject to a Modus\n\nA bequest can be subject to a modus, which is a condition or restriction on the bequest.\n\n## Interpretation of Some Common Dispositions in Wills\n\nCertain dispositions in wills can be interpreted in specific ways.\n\n### Presumption against Fideicommissa\n\nThere is a presumption against fideicommissa,

Fideicommissum\n\nA fideicommissum can be created upon another fideicommissum.\n\n### Compendiosa Substitutio\n\nCompendiosa substitutio is a provision in a will that substitutes one beneficiary for another and also creates a fideicommissum.\n\n### Ownership Subject to a Usufruct with a Direct Substitution as to the Usufruct at the Testator’s Death\n\nA will can create ownership subject to a

This article focuses on the First Period houses built in Massachusetts between 1660 and 1679, a time of significant growth and development in the colony.\n\n#Legend\n\nBefore delving into the specifics of First Period houses built during this time, it is essential to understand the terminology used to describe these structures. The term \"First Period\" was coined by architectural historian Norman Isham in the early 20th century to describe the earliest period of American architecture. Isham divided American architectural history into distinct periods, with the First Period spanning from 1626 to 1725. Within this period, several styles emerged, including the Post-Medieval English, Medieval, and Early Georgian styles.\n\n#1660–1670\n\nDuring the 1660s, Massachusetts experienced significant growth, with many new towns and villages springing up throughout the colony. As the population increased, so did the demand for housing. First Period houses built during this decade reflect the traditional English styles that the colonists brought with them from England.\n\n##Post-Medieval English Style\n\nThe Post-Medieval English style, also known as the \"English Country\" style, was a popular choice for First Period houses built in Massachusetts during the 1660s. Characterized by steeply pitched roofs, central chimneys, and evenly spaced windows, this style was well-suited to the colonial climate. The Post-Medieval English style was also influenced by the traditional English hall-and-parlor house plan, which featured a central hall flanked by two rooms.\n\n##Notable Houses\n\nSeveral notable First Period houses built in Massachusetts during the 1660s are still standing today. The Fairbanks House, built in 1636 in Dedham, is one of the oldest surviving timber-framed houses in North America. Although it predates the 1660s, it is an excellent example of the Post-Medieval English style. The James Blake House, built in 1661 in Boston, is another notable example of a First Period house from this decade.\n\n#1671–1679\n\nThe 1670s saw continued growth and development in Massachusetts, with many new towns and villages emerging. First Period houses built during this decade reflect the evolving tastes and preferences of the colonists.\n\n##Medieval Style\n\nThe Medieval style, characterized by half-timbering, steeply pitched roofs, and ornate woodwork, became increasingly popular in Massachusetts during the 1670s. This style was influenced by the traditional English medieval architecture of the 14th to 16th centuries. The Medieval style was particularly well-suited to the colonial climate, with its steeply pitched roofs and overhanging upper floors providing protection from the elements.\n\n##Notable Houses\n\nSeveral notable First Period houses built in Massachusetts during the 1670s are still standing today. The Parson Capen House, built in 1678 in Topsfield, is an excellent example of the Medieval style. The John Proctor House, built in 1672 in Peabody, is another notable example of a First Period house from this decade.\n\n#See also\n\n* First Period (American architecture)\n* Post-Medieval English architecture\n* Medieval architecture\n* English Country style\n* Hall-and-parlor house plan\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article has provided an overview of First Period houses built in Massachusetts between 1660 and 1679.

Launched in 2023, Threads allows users to share text-based updates, similar to Twitter. The platform's introduction marked a significant expansion of Meta's social media services, as it sought to compete with established players in the microblogging space.\n\n# History\n\n## Predecessor\n\nThreads is not Meta's first foray into the microblogging space. In 2020, the company launched a feature called \"Instagram Notes,\" which allowed users to share short text updates with their followers. However, the feature failed to gain significant traction and was eventually discontinued. The experience and insights gained from Instagram Notes likely influenced the development of Threads.\n\n## Development and announcement\n\nMeta began developing Threads in earnest in 2022, with a team led by Instagram's head of product, Adam Mosseri. The project was reportedly a top priority for the company, with significant resources dedicated to its development. Threads was officially announced in July 2023, with a launch date set for later that year.\n\n## Launch\n\nThreads launched on July 5, 2023, as a standalone app on both iOS and Android platforms. The app was initially available in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Upon launch, Threads allowed users to create an account using their existing Instagram credentials or by signing up with a new email address.\n\n# Appearance and features\n\nThreads' user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on text-based updates. Users can create posts of up to 500 characters, including links, photos, and videos. The platform also features a \"For You\" page, which displays a curated feed of posts from accounts users follow.\n\n## Possibility of open interoperability\n\nOne of the most significant features of Threads is its potential for open interoperability with other social media platforms. Meta has expressed interest in allowing users to share content between Threads and other services, such as Twitter and Mastodon. However, it remains to be seen whether these plans will come to fruition.\n\n## Account integration with Instagram\n\nThreads allows users to link their Instagram account to the platform, enabling features like cross-posting and account syncing. This integration is designed to make it easier for users to manage their online presence across multiple platforms.\n\n## Device compatibility\n\nThreads is available on both iOS and Android devices, with a web version also accessible via desktop browsers. The platform is designed to be highly responsive, with a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.\n\n## Censorship attempts\n\nAs with any social media platform, Threads has faced challenges related to content moderation and censorship. In some countries, the platform has been subject to government requests to remove content deemed objectionable or sensitive. Meta has stated its commitment to protecting free speech and promoting transparency in its content moderation policies.\n\n## Advertising\n\nThreads features a range of advertising options, including sponsored posts and display ads. The platform's ad model is designed to be similar to Instagram's, with a focus on targeted, interest-based advertising. However, it remains to be seen whether Threads will be able to attract significant ad revenue in the competitive social media landscape.\n\n# Userbase\n\n## Decline in the months after launch\n\nDespite initial enthusiasm, Threads' userbase declined significantly in the months following its launch. According to reports, the platform struggled to retain users, with many returning to established social media services like Twitter and Instagram. This decline has raised questions about Threads' long-term viability and potential for growth.\n\n## Popularity in Taiwan\n\nOne notable exception to Threads' decline has been its popularity in Taiwan. The platform has gained significant traction in the country, with many users drawn to its text-based format and emphasis on community engagement. The reasons for Threads' success in Taiwan are unclear, but it may be related to the country's unique social media landscape and user preferences.\n\n# Responses\n\n## Intellectual property dispute\n\nThreads has been the subject of an intellectual property dispute with a company called Threads, Inc., which claims to have registered the \"Threads\" trademark in 2020. Meta has disputed this claim, arguing that its use of the name is legitimate and does not infringe on the existing trademark.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nAs with any social media platform, Threads has faced concerns about data privacy and user security. Meta has emphasized its commitment to protecting user data and promoting transparency in its data collection practices. However, the company has faced criticism for its handling of user data in the past, which may impact user trust in Threads.\n\n## State media\n\nThreads has been the subject of criticism from state media outlets in several countries, which have accused the platform of promoting Western values and interfering in domestic politics. These claims are likely exaggerated, but they highlight the challenges faced by social media platforms operating in complex, geopolitically charged environments.\n\n## Imitating other platforms\n\nThreads has been accused of imitating features and functionality from other social media platforms, including Twitter and Mastodon. While this criticism is not entirely unfounded, it is worth noting that social media platforms often borrow and iterate on existing ideas in order to innovate and improve the user experience.\n\n# See also\n\n* Instagram\n* Meta Platforms\n* Microblogging\n* Social media\n* Twitter\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Threads_(social_network)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Predecessor\n##Development and announcement\n##Launch\n#Appearance and features\n##Possibility of open interoperability\n##Account integration with Instagram\n##Device compatibility\n##Censorship attempts\n##Advertising\n#Userbase\n##Decline in the months after launch\n##Popularity in Taiwan\n#Responses\n##Intellectual property dispute\n##Data privacy\n##State media\n##Imitating other platforms\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The trails are characterized by the presence of numerous medieval towers, known as \"nuraghi,\" which were built by the ancient Sardinians to serve as defensive structures. The path offers breathtaking views of the island's coastline, mountains, and valleys, making it a popular destination for hikers and nature enthusiasts.\n\n#History\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers has its roots in ancient times, when the nuraghi were built by the Sardinians to protect their island from invaders. The nuraghi were constructed between the 18th and 10th centuries BC, during the Bronze Age, and were used as watchtowers, fortresses, and even dwellings. Over time, the nuraghi were abandoned and left to ruin, but many have survived to the present day.\n\nIn the 20th century, a group of Sardinian hikers and nature enthusiasts began to explore the island's trails and document the location of the nuraghi. This led to the creation of the Path of 100 Towers, which was officially inaugurated in the 1990s. Today, the path is managed by the Sardinian government and is maintained by local hiking clubs and volunteers.\n\n#Trekking routes\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers offers a range of trekking routes for hikers of all levels. The trails vary in length and difficulty, from easy day hikes to more challenging multi-day treks. Some of the most popular routes include:\n\n* The Nuraghi Trail: This 12km trail takes hikers through a series of nuraghi located in the heart of Sardinia.\n* The Coastal Trail: This 25km trail follows the coastline of Sardinia, offering stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea.\n* The Mountain Trail: This 30km trail takes hikers through the mountains of Sardinia, offering breathtaking views of the island's interior.\n\n#Towers\n\n##Main towers\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to over 100 nuraghi, each with its own unique history and architecture. Some of the most notable nuraghi include:\n\n* The Nuraghe Su Nuraxi: This nuraghe is located in the town of Barumini and is one of the most well-preserved nuraghi on the island.\n* The Nuraghe La Prisgiona: This nuraghe is located in the town of Aggius and is known for its unique architecture, which features a series of interconnected towers.\n* The Nuraghe Palmavera: This nuraghe is located in the town of Alghero and is one of the largest nuraghi on the island.\n\n#Flora and Fauna\n\nThe Path of 100 Towers is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including many species that are unique to Sardinia.\n\n##Mediterranean scrub\n\nThe Mediterranean scrub is a type of vegetation that is found throughout the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by a mix of shrubs, trees, and flowers, including species such as rosemary, thyme, and lavender. The scrub is home to a range of wildlife, including birds, reptiles, and insects.\n\n##Lagoon\n\nThe lagoon is a coastal wetland that is found along the coastline of Sardinia. It is home to a range of wildlife, including birds, fish, and shellfish. The lagoon is also an important breeding ground for many species of fish and shellfish.\n\n#Books\n\nThere are several books available that provide information about the Path of 100 Towers and the island of Sardinia.

The creature has been coming to Earth for centuries, hunting and killing the greatest predators it can find. Naru soon realizes that she is the only one who can stop the Yautja and save her tribe.\n\nThroughout the film, Naru uses her knowledge of the natural world and her hunting skills to evade and ultimately defeat the Yautja.

The team used a mix of digital and practical effects to create the film's creatures, including the Yautja and a number of wild animals.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Sarah Schachner. Schachner is a composer and musician who has worked on a number of film and television projects, including the Call of Duty video game series.\n\nThe score features a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, with a focus on percussion and indigenous instrumentation. Schachner worked closely with Trachtenberg to create a score that was both thrilling and respectful of the film's Native American themes.\n\n# Historical accuracy\n\nThe film is set in the early 18th century, during the Comanche Nation's reign over the Great Plains. The production team worked closely with Native American historians and cultural experts to ensure that the film was accurate and respectful of Comanche culture.\n\nThe film's costumes, props, and sets were all designed to be historically accurate, with a focus on authenticity and attention to detail.

The effects of climate change are widespread and varied, impacting different aspects of the planet and its inhabitants. From rising temperatures to extreme weather events, climate change is altering the world as we know it. This article provides an overview of the effects of climate change, covering changes in temperature, weather patterns, land and ocean systems, wildlife and nature, and human societies.\n\n# Changes in Temperature\n\nOne of the most visible effects of climate change is the rising global temperature. The average global temperature has risen by about 1°C since the late 19th century, and is projected to continue to rise by another 2-5°C by the end of this century. This warming is caused by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, which trap heat and prevent it from being released back into space.\n\n# Weather\n\nClimate change is also altering weather patterns around the world. These changes are manifesting in various ways, including heat waves, droughts, and extreme storms.\n\n## Heat Waves and Temperature Extremes\n\nHeat waves are becoming more frequent and prolonged due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, leading to more intense heat waves. Temperature extremes are also becoming more common, with both hot and cold temperatures increasing in frequency.\n\n## Rain\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns are also occurring due to climate change. Some areas are experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while others are facing droughts. This is because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall events.\n\n## Extreme Storms\n\nClimate change is also leading to an increase in extreme storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons. This is because the warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, leading to more intense storms.\n\n# Land\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on land systems around the world.\n\n## Floods\n\nFlooding is becoming more common due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall events. Sea level rise is also contributing to flooding, particularly in low-lying coastal areas.\n\n## Droughts\n\nDroughts are also becoming more common due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and prolonged droughts.\n\n## Wildfires\n\nClimate change is also leading to an increase in wildfires. This is because the warming atmosphere is creating conditions that are ripe for wildfires, such as hot temperatures and dry conditions.\n\n# Oceans\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on ocean systems around the world.\n\n## Sea Level Rise\n\nSea level rise is one of the most visible effects of climate change. The global sea level has risen by about 15-20 cm since 1900, and is projected to continue to rise by another 26 cm to 82 cm by 2050. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing the polar ice caps to melt, leading to an increase in sea levels.\n\n# Ice and Snow\n\nClimate change is also having a profound impact on ice and snow systems around the world.\n\n## Glaciers Decline\n\nGlaciers are declining at an alarming rate due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing glaciers to melt, leading to a decline in their mass.\n\n## Ice Sheets Decline\n\nIce sheets are also declining due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing ice sheets to melt, leading to a decline in their mass.\n\n## Sea Ice Decline\n\nSea ice is also declining due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing sea ice to melt, leading to a decline in its extent.\n\n## Permafrost Thawing\n\nPermafrost is also thawing due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing permafrost to thaw, leading to the release of methane and other greenhouse gases.\n\n# Wildlife and Nature\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on wildlife and nature around the world.\n\n## Ecosystems on Land\n\nEcosystems on land are being altered due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of plants and animals, leading to changes in ecosystems.\n\n## Marine Ecosystems\n\nMarine ecosystems are also being altered due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of marine life, leading to changes in ecosystems.\n\n# Tipping Points and Irreversible Impacts\n\nClimate change is also leading to tipping points and irreversible impacts. These include the melting of Arctic sea ice, the die-off of coral reefs, and the collapse of ice sheets.\n\n# Health, Food Security and Water Security\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on human health, food security, and water security.\n\n## Health\n\nClimate change is leading to an increase in heat-related illnesses, respiratory problems, and the spread of disease. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of disease-carrying insects, such as mosquitoes.\n\n## Food Security\n\nClimate change is also leading to a decline in food security. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of crops, leading to a decline in crop yields.\n\n## Water Security\n\nClimate change is also leading to a decline in water security. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of water, leading to a decline in water availability.\n\n# Human Settlements\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on human settlements around the world.\n\n## Impacts from Heat\n\nHuman settlements are being impacted by heat due to climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is leading to an increase in heat-related illnesses and deaths.\n\n## Low-Lying Coastal Regions\n\nLow-lying coastal regions are also being impacted by climate change. This is because the warming atmosphere is causing sea levels to rise, leading to flooding and erosion.\n\n# Impacts on Societies\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on societies around the world.\n\n## Displacement and Migration\n\nClimate change is leading to displacement and migration. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of resources, leading to conflicts over resources.\n\n## Conflict\n\nClimate change is also leading to conflict. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of resources, leading to conflicts over resources.\n\n## Social Impacts on Vulnerable Groups\n\nClimate change is also having a disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups, such as the poor and indigenous communities. This is because these groups are often more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\n## Possibility of Societal Collapse\n\nClimate change is also leading to the possibility of societal collapse. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of resources, leading to conflicts over resources and the possibility of societal collapse.\n\n# Economic Impacts\n\nClimate change is having a profound impact on the economy.\n\n## Economic Inequality\n\nClimate change is leading to economic inequality. This is because the warming atmosphere is altering the distribution of resources, leading to conflicts over resources and economic inequality.\n\n## Highly Affected Sectors\n\nClimate change is also having a disproportionate impact on certain sectors, such as agriculture and tourism. This is because these sectors are often more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Climate change\n* Global warming\n* Greenhouse gas\n* Carbon footprint\n* Sustainable development\n\n# References\n\n* IPCC (2013).

Born on February 8, 1917, in Bucharest, Romania, Stelaru's life and work were marked by turmoil, innovation, and perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life\n\nDimitrie Stelaru was born to a family of modest means in Bucharest's Old Town. His parents, Dumitru and Elena Stelaru, were both elementary school teachers who encouraged their son's early interest in literature and the arts. Stelaru's childhood was marked by a love for reading and writing, and he began composing his own poetry at a young age. He attended the Matei Basarab High School in Bucharest, where he was exposed to the works of Romanian modernists such as Ion Minulescu and Tudor Arghezi.\n\n## Debut and death-hoax\n\nStelaru made his literary debut in 1935 with the publication of his first poetry collection, \"Cuvinte\" (\"Words\"), which was met with critical acclaim. However, his early success was soon overshadowed by a scandalous death-hoax that would haunt him for the rest of his life. In 1936, a rumor began circulating that Stelaru had died in a tragic accident, which was later revealed to be a fabrication. The hoax, which was likely orchestrated by jealous rivals, had a profound impact on Stelaru's mental health and contributed to his struggles with anxiety and depression.\n\n## Albatros years\n\nIn the late 1930s, Stelaru became affiliated with the Albatros literary circle, a group of avant-garde writers and artists who sought to revolutionize Romanian literature. Alongside fellow Albatros members such as Geo Bogza and Gherasim Luca, Stelaru experimented with new forms and styles, pushing the boundaries of traditional Romanian poetry. His work during this period was characterized by its emphasis on surrealism, automatism, and social critique.\n\n## Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n\nDuring World War II, Romania was governed by the fascist regime of Marshal Ion Antonescu, which had a profound impact on the country's literary scene. Stelaru, who was openly critical of the regime, faced censorship and persecution, and was forced to go into hiding. His work during this period was marked by its clandestine nature, with many of his poems and plays being circulated in secret. In the late 1940s, Stelaru's work began to fall out of favor with the new communist authorities, who viewed his avant-garde style as decadent and bourgeois.\n\n## Censoring and obscurity\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Stelaru's work was subjected to intense censorship, with many of his poems and plays being banned or heavily edited. He was forced to adopt a more conventional style in order to avoid persecution, and his work during this period was marked by its compromise and accommodation. As a result, Stelaru's reputation suffered, and he fell into relative obscurity. Despite his efforts to revive his career, he was largely ignored by the literary establishment, and his work was relegated to the margins of Romanian literature.\n\n## Final return\n\nIn the 1980s, Stelaru experienced a final resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the efforts of a new generation of Romanian writers and critics who sought to revive his legacy. His work was reevaluated and reappreciated, and he was recognized as a major figure in Romanian avant-garde literature. Stelaru's final years were marked by a renewed sense of purpose and creativity, and he continued to write and publish until his death on November 14, 1991.\n\n# Legacy\n\nDimitrie Stelaru's legacy is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the turmoil and innovation of his life and work. As a poet, playwright, and literary critic, he made significant contributions to the avant-garde movement in Romanian literature, pushing the boundaries of traditional forms and styles. His work was marked by its emphasis on surrealism, automatism, and social critique, and he was a key figure in the Albatros literary circle. Despite facing censorship, persecution, and obscurity, Stelaru persevered, and his work continues to be celebrated and studied by scholars and readers today.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Dimitrie Stelaru's life and work, drawing on a range of sources and references. While it is not possible to include every detail and nuance of his career, this article aims to provide a balanced and informative account of his achievements and legacy.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dimitrie_Stelaru\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life\n##Debut and death-hoax\n##Albatros years\n##Antonescu-era repression and late 1940s\n##Censoring and obscurity\n##Final return\n#Legacy\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-married British monarch. At the time of her death, she was the world's oldest living monarch and the longest-reigning current monarch.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary was born on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the king, and her mother, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the youngest daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Elizabeth was baptised on 29 May 1926 in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of York.\n\nHeir Presumptive\n-----------------\n\n### Second World War\n\nDuring the Second World War, Elizabeth's father, Prince Albert, Duke of York, took on more royal duties as his older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, was seen as sympathetic to the Nazi regime. After the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936, Prince Albert became the heir presumptive and, subsequently, King George VI. Elizabeth, then 10 years old, became the heir presumptive.\n\nIn 1940, Elizabeth began to take on more public roles, accompanying her parents to events and factories. She made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from cities.\n\n### Marriage\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1934 at the wedding of Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark and Prince George, Duke of Kent. They began exchanging letters in 1939, and Elizabeth fell in love with him. After the war, Philip proposed to Elizabeth, and she accepted. They married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey.\n\nReign\n--------\n\n### Accession and Coronation\n\nElizabeth's father, King George VI, died on 6 February 1952, and Elizabeth ascended to the throne at the age of 25. She was proclaimed queen by the Accession Council, and her coronation was held on 2 June 1953 at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was the first to be televised, and it was watched by millions of people around the world.\n\n### Early Reign\n\nElizabeth's early reign was marked by the decline of the British Empire and the rise of the Commonwealth. She played a key role in promoting the Commonwealth, visiting many of its member states and supporting its development. In 1953, she became the first British monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand.\n\n### Political Reforms and Crises\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Elizabeth's reign was marked by significant political reforms and crises. The Suez Crisis in 1956 led to the resignation of Prime Minister Anthony Eden, and the queen played a key role in promoting stability. In 1964, she appointed Labour leader Harold Wilson as prime minister, despite the Conservative Party's attempts to form a government.\n\n### Perils and Dissent\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Elizabeth's reign was marked by perils and dissent. The Troubles in Northern Ireland led to the deaths of many people, and the queen faced criticism for her handling of the situation. In 1981, she faced an assassination attempt by Marcus Sarjeant during the Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\n### Turbulent Years\n\nThe 1990s were marked by turbulent years for Elizabeth's reign. In 1992, she faced criticism for her handling of the fire at Windsor Castle, and she paid for the repairs out of her own pocket. In 1995, she faced criticism for her handling of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and she later broke with tradition by speaking publicly about the tragedy.\n\n### Dawn of the New Millennium\n\nIn the 2000s, Elizabeth's reign was marked by significant events. In 2002, she celebrated her Golden Jubilee, marking 50 years on the throne. In 2007, she became the longest-reigning British monarch in history, surpassing Queen Victoria.\n\n### Diamond Jubilee and Milestones\n\nIn 2012, Elizabeth celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking 60 years on the throne. She became the longest-married British monarch in history, surpassing Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In 2015, she became the longest-reigning current monarch in the world, surpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.\n\n### Pandemic and Widowhood\n\nIn 2020, Elizabeth's reign was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. She isolated at Windsor Castle and continued to carry out her duties remotely. In 2021, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, died, and she became the first British monarch to reign as a widow.\n\n### Platinum Jubilee and Beyond\n\nIn 2022, Elizabeth celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years on the throne. She became the longest-reigning British monarch in history, and she was celebrated around the world.\n\nDeath\n--------\n\nElizabeth II died on 8 September 2022 at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, surrounded by her family. Her death was announced by the Royal Family, and she was succeeded by her son, Charles III.\n\nLegacy\n----------\n\n### Beliefs, Activities, and Interests\n\nElizabeth was a devout Christian and played a key role in promoting the Church of England. She was also a patron of the arts, supporting many artists and musicians.

The scheme aims to recruit soldiers on a short-term basis of four years, with the possibility of extension for a few based on performance.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Indian Armed Forces have been facing challenges in terms of recruitment and retention of personnel. The forces have been struggling to attract and retain young talent, with many opting for other career options. The traditional recruitment model, which involves a minimum service period of 15-20 years, has been criticized for being inflexible and not aligned with the changing needs of the modern workforce.\n\nIn 2020, the Ministry of Defence set up a committee to review the existing recruitment model and suggest reforms. The committee recommended a new recruitment model that would allow for shorter service periods and more flexibility in terms of career options. The Agnipath Scheme is based on these recommendations.\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme is a recruitment scheme that aims to recruit soldiers on a short-term basis of four years. The scheme is open to Indian citizens between the ages of 17.5 and 23 years, with a few exceptions for certain categories. The recruitment process involves a written examination, physical fitness test, and medical examination.\n\nUnder the scheme, recruits will be enrolled as Agniveers, a new cadre of soldiers who will serve for four years. During their service, they will receive a salary, allowances, and benefits, including medical insurance and a one-time severance package at the end of their service.\n\nAgniveers will be trained in various skills, including combat, administration, and technical skills. They will be deployed in various roles, including combat, logistics, and administrative support.\n\nAt the end of their four-year service, Agniveers will be given the option to extend their service for a further four years, based on their performance. Those who are not selected for extension will be given a one-time severance package of ₹11.71 lakh and a certificate of service.\n\n# Reservation and welfare benefits\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme provides for reservation and welfare benefits for Agniveers. The scheme provides for 10% reservation for Agniveers in Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles, and 10% reservation in Indian Coast Guard.\n\nAgniveers will also be eligible for welfare benefits, including medical insurance, housing benefits, and education assistance. They will also be entitled to a one-time severance package of ₹11.71 lakh at the end of their service.\n\nThe scheme also provides for a system of mentorship and guidance for Agniveers, to help them transition to civilian life after their service.\n\n# Criticism\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has been criticized by various sections of society, including political parties, activists, and retired defence personnel.\n\n## By political parties and activists\n\nThe scheme has been criticized by several opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, and the Aam Aadmi Party. They have argued that the scheme is a ploy to privatize the armed forces and undermine the existing recruitment model.\n\nActivists have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it is a move to create a pool of cheap labour for the armed forces. They have also argued that the scheme does not provide for adequate social security benefits for Agniveers.\n\n## By retired defence personnel\n\nRetired defence personnel have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it undermines the existing recruitment model and the status of soldiers. They have argued that the scheme is a move to create a class of \"second-class\" soldiers who will be denied the benefits and privileges of regular soldiers.\n\n## By state governments\n\nSeveral state governments have also criticized the scheme, arguing that it does not provide for adequate representation for their states. They have argued that the scheme will lead to a shortage of soldiers from their states and undermine their representation in the armed forces.\n\n## Data on employment of veterans\n\nData on the employment of veterans has also raised concerns about the scheme. According to data, only 3.8% of veterans are employed in the private sector, while 70% are employed in the public sector. The data has raised concerns about the employability of Agniveers after their service.\n\n# Protests\n\nThe Agnipath Scheme has sparked widespread protests across the country. The protests have been led by various sections of society, including students, activists, and veterans.\n\n## Bharat Bandh (All India Strike)\n\nOn June 20, 2022, a Bharat Bandh (All India Strike) was called by various opposition parties and activists to protest against the scheme. The strike was successful, with widespread protests and demonstrations reported across the country.\n\n## 21 June onwards\n\nFrom June 21, 2022, onwards, protests have continued across the country, with demonstrations and rallies reported in various cities and towns. The protests have been peaceful, but have caused disruptions to traffic and public services.\n\n# Response by the Government\n\nThe government has responded to the protests by defending the scheme and arguing that it is a necessary reform to modernize the armed forces. The government has also argued that the scheme will provide opportunities for young people to serve their country and develop skills.\n\nThe government has also announced several concessions to address the concerns of protesters, including an increase in the age limit for recruitment and a guarantee of employment for Agniveers in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles.\n\n# Plea in the Supreme Court against the scheme\n\nA plea has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Agnipath Scheme, challenging its constitutionality and arguing that it is a ploy to privatize the armed forces. The plea has been filed by a group of petitioners, including veterans and activists.\n\n# First Agniveer batch (2023)\n\nThe first batch of Agniveers is expected to be recruited in 2023. The recruitment process is expected to begin in the coming months, with the first batch of Agniveers expected to join the armed forces in the summer of 2023.\n\n## Hyderabad\n\nThe first Agniveer recruitment rally is expected to be held in Hyderabad, with thousands of young people expected to attend. The rally will be held at the Telangana State Sports Complex, with recruitment teams from the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force expected to participate.\n\n## Nashik\n\nA recruitment rally is also expected to be held in Nashik, with recruitment teams from the Indian Army and Air Force expected to participate.

The case drew widespread attention and sparked concerns about the safety and quality of care in the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n#Early life and education\n\nLetby was born in 1990 in Hereford, England. She grew up in a family of healthcare professionals and developed an interest in nursing from an early age. Letby pursued her passion for nursing at the University of Chester, where she earned a degree in nursing. After graduating, she began working at the Countess of Chester Hospital in 2011.\n\n#Career\n\nLetby worked as a nurse in the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital for over six years. During her time at the hospital, she gained experience caring for premature and critically ill babies. Letby's colleagues described her as a dedicated and skilled nurse, but some also noted that she could be quiet and reserved at times.\n\n#Initial investigations\n\nIn 2015, hospital staff raised concerns about a higher-than-expected number of baby deaths in the neonatal unit. An initial investigation was launched, but it failed to identify any significant issues. However, in 2017, a second investigation was launched after a whistleblower came forward with concerns about Letby's behavior.\n\n#2023 trial\n\nLetby's trial began in 2023 and lasted for several months. The prosecution presented evidence from various sources, including handwritten notes, medical records, and testimony from witnesses.\n\n##Evidence\n\n###Handwritten notes\n\nProsecutors presented handwritten notes written by Letby, which they claimed showed a pattern of unusual behavior and inconsistencies in her care of the babies. The notes included entries about babies' vital signs, medication, and treatment plans. However, defense lawyers argued that the notes were incomplete and taken out of context.\n\n###Medical records\n\nMedical records of the babies who died or were allegedly harmed by Letby were also presented as evidence. Prosecutors pointed to unusual patterns in the babies' vital signs and treatment plans, which they claimed suggested that Letby had intentionally harmed them.\n\n##Letby's testimony\n\nLetby took the stand in her own defense, denying any wrongdoing and claiming that she had always acted in the best interests of the babies in her care. She explained that the handwritten notes were incomplete and that she had been under pressure to document everything while caring for multiple babies.\n\n##Defence arguments\n\nDefense lawyers argued that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and that there was no concrete proof that Letby had harmed the babies. They also pointed to inconsistencies in the medical records and questioned the credibility of some witnesses.\n\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n\nAfter deliberating for several days, the jury delivered guilty verdicts on seven counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. Letby was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 30 years.\n\n#Motives\n\nThe prosecution suggested that Letby's motives for harming the babies may have been to gain attention and sympathy from her colleagues. However, the exact motives behind Letby's actions may never be fully understood.\n\n#Post-conviction\n\n##Disciplinary action\n\nFollowing Letby's conviction, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) launched an investigation into her conduct. The NMC subsequently struck Letby off the nursing register, banning her from practicing as a nurse.\n\n##Appeal\n\nLetby's lawyers announced plans to appeal the conviction, citing concerns about the reliability of the medical evidence and the quality of the prosecution's case.\n\n##Retrial\n\nThere have been calls for a retrial in light of concerns about the safety of the convictions.\n\n##Further investigations\n\nThe National Health Service (NHS) has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Letby's employment and the events that led to the baby deaths.\n\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n\nAn independent inquiry, led by Dr. Bill Kirkup, has been established to investigate the events surrounding Letby's employment and the baby deaths. The inquiry will examine the NHS's handling of the case and identify any systemic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n\nThe case has sparked widespread calls for greater regulation and reform of the NHS, particularly in relation to the recruitment and vetting of healthcare professionals.\n\n#Safety of the convictions\n\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n\nConcerns have been raised about the reliability of the medical evidence presented during the trial, particularly with regard to the use of insulin, air v", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lucy_Letby\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career\n#Initial investigations\n#2023 trial\n##Evidence\n###Handwritten notes\n###Medical records\n##Letby's testimony\n##Defence arguments\n##Verdicts and sentencing\n#Motives\n#Post-conviction\n##Disciplinary action\n##Appeal\n##Retrial\n##Further investigations\n##Thirlwall inquiry\n#Reactions\n##Calls for regulation and reform\n#Safety of the convictions\n##Concerns about the medical evidence\n###Insulin\n###Air via nasogastric tube\n###Air embolism\n##Quality of the statistical evidence\n##Staff and infrastructure issues\n##Timeline\n###X-ray timing\n###Mislabelled door swipe data\n##Interpretation of handwritten notes\n##Criticism of witnesses\n##Reaction to doubt\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The incident sparked widespread protests and riots across France, with many accusing the police of racism and brutality.\n\n# Background\n\nNanterre, where the incident took place, is a suburb of Paris with a significant immigrant population. The area has faced social and economic challenges, including high levels of unemployment and poverty. Tensions between the local community and law enforcement have been simmering for years, with many residents complaining of police harassment and racism.\n\n# Victim\n\nNahel Merzouk was a 17-year-old high school student who lived in Nanterre with his family. He was of Algerian descent and had been born and raised in France. According to his friends and family, Merzouk was a quiet and respectful young man who loved sports and music. He had no prior convictions or run-ins with the law.\n\n# Shooting\n\nThe shooting of Nahel Merzouk occurred on June 27, 2023, during a traffic stop in Nanterre. Merzouk was a passenger in a car driven by a friend, and there was a third passenger in the vehicle.\n\n## Prosecution version\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the police officer who shot Merzouk had pulled over the car for a routine traffic stop. The officer claimed that Merzouk had threatened him with a weapon, prompting him to open fire. However, this version of events was disputed by witnesses and video footage.\n\n## Police version challenged by a video\n\nA video of the incident, recorded by a bystander, appeared to contradict the police officer's account. The video showed the police officer approaching the car and shooting Merzouk without apparent provocation. The video also showed that Merzouk was unarmed and had his hands raised in surrender.\n\n## Version from the third passenger\n\nThe third passenger in the car, who has not been named, gave a different account of the incident. According to this passenger, the police officer had been aggressive and hostile from the start of the traffic stop. The passenger claimed that Merzouk had been trying to calm the situation when the officer shot him.\n\n# Investigation\n\nAn investigation into the killing of Nahel Merzouk was launched immediately after the incident. The investigation was led by the French police's internal affairs division, with assistance from the national prosecutor's office.\n\nThe investigation focused on the circumstances surrounding the shooting, including the police officer's actions and the events leading up to the incident. The investigators also examined the video footage and interviewed witnesses, including the driver and the third passenger.\n\n# Initial reactions\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across France. Many accused the police of racism and brutality, and called for greater accountability and reform.\n\n## Polemics on immigration\n\nThe incident also sparked a heated debate about immigration and racism in France. Some politicians and commentators argued that the killing was symptomatic of a broader problem of racism and xenophobia in French society.\n\n# Unrest\n\nThe killing of Nahel Merzouk sparked widespread protests and riots across France, with many demonstrators calling for justice and an end to police brutality. The unrest was particularly intense in Nanterre and other suburbs of Paris, where many residents have long complained of police harassment and racism.\n\nThe protests were marked by clashes between demonstrators and police, with many injuries and arrests reported. The government deployed riot police and other security forces to quell the unrest, but the protests continued for several days.\n\n# See also\n\n* Police brutality in France\n* Racism in France\n* Immigration to France\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the killing of Nahel Merzouk and its aftermath.

It is a sparse table that stores the cumulative sums of the elements in the array, allowing for fast calculation of prefix sums and range sums.\n\n#Motivation\n\nThe Fenwick tree was first introduced by Peter Fenwick in 1994 as a way to improve the efficiency of calculating prefix sums in a array. Traditional methods for calculating prefix sums, such as using a simple loop to iterate over the array, have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array. This can be slow for large arrays, making it difficult to perform operations such as range sum queries and updates in real-time.\n\nThe Fenwick tree solves this problem by using a binary indexed tree to store the cumulative sums of the elements in the array. This allows for fast calculation of prefix sums and range sums, with a time complexity of O(log n). The Fenwick tree is particularly useful in applications where range sum queries and updates are frequent, such as in finance, scientific simulations, and data analysis.\n\n#Description\n\nThe Fenwick tree is composed of three main components: the interrogation tree, the update tree, and the search tree.\n\n##The interrogation tree\n\nThe interrogation tree is a binary tree that stores the cumulative sums of the elements in the array. Each node in the tree represents a range of elements in the array, and the value stored in the node is the sum of the elements in that range. The root node represents the entire array, and the leaf nodes represent individual elements.\n\nThe interrogation tree is constructed by iterating over the array and calculating the cumulative sum of the elements. The cumulative sum is then stored in the corresponding node in the tree. The tree is constructed in a way that allows for fast calculation of prefix sums and range sums.\n\n##The update tree\n\nThe update tree is a binary tree that stores the updates to the elements in the array. Each node in the tree represents a range of elements in the array, and the value stored in the node is the update to the elements in that range.\n\nThe update tree is used to update the elements in the array. When an update is made to an element, the update is propagated up the tree, updating the cumulative sums of the nodes that represent the range of elements that include the updated element.\n\n##The search tree\n\nThe search tree is a binary tree that stores the elements of the array. Each node in the tree represents a single element in the array, and the value stored in the node is the element itself.\n\nThe search tree is used to perform range sum queries. When a range sum query is made, the search tree is traversed to find the nodes that represent the elements in the range. The cumulative sums of these nodes are then used to calculate the range sum.\n\n#Pseudocode\n\n##Construction\n\nThe following pseudocode shows how to construct a Fenwick tree:\n```\nfunction constructFenwickTree(array):\n  create an empty tree\n  for each element in the array:\n    update the tree with the element\n  return the tree\n\nfunction updateTree(tree, index, value):\n  node = tree.getNode(index)\n  node.value += value\n  while node.parent is not null:\n    node = node.parent\n    node.value += value\n\nfunction getNode(tree, index):\n  node = tree.root\n  while node is not a leaf node:\n    if index < node.mid:\n      node = node.leftChild\n    else:\n      node = node.rightChild\n  return node\n```\n#See also\n\n* Binary indexed tree\n* Range sum query\n* Update query\n* Prefix sum\n* Cumulative sum\n\n#References\n\n* Fenwick, P.

Robert Oppenheimer\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was a renowned American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, the secret research and development project that produced the atomic bomb during World War II. Known as the \"father of the atomic bomb,\" Oppenheimer was a complex figure whose life was marked by both brilliance and turmoil. This article explores his early life, career, and legacy, providing a comprehensive overview of his life and work.\n\n# Early life\n\n## Childhood and education\n\nJulius Robert Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to Ella and Julius Oppenheimer, a textile importer. He was the first of two children, with his brother Frank being born two years later. The Oppenheimer family was of Jewish descent, but they did not practice their faith strictly. Robert's early life was marked by a comfortable upbringing, with his family residing in a luxurious apartment on the Upper West Side.\n\nOppenheimer was a curious child, often taking things apart and reassembling them. He developed an interest in science and mathematics at an early age, encouraged by his parents. He attended the Ethical Culture School, a progressive private school in New York City, where he excelled academically. In 1921, he entered Harvard University, where he studied chemistry, physics, and mathematics.\n\n## Studies in Europe\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1925, Oppenheimer traveled to Europe to pursue further studies. He enrolled at the University of Cambridge, where he worked under the supervision of J.J. Thomson, a renowned physicist. However, he soon became dissatisfied with the Cambridge environment and moved to the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he studied under Max Born, a prominent physicist.\n\nGöttingen was a hub of intellectual activity, and Oppenheimer was exposed to some of the most influential minds in physics, including Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr. He earned his Ph.D. in 1927 and returned to the United States, where he took up a position as a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n# Early career\n\n## Teaching\n\nOppenheimer's early career was marked by a series of teaching positions at various universities. He taught at the University of California, Berkeley, the California Institute of Technology, and Princeton University. He was known for his charismatic teaching style and his ability to inspire his students.\n\n## Scientific work\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to the field of theoretical physics. He worked on a range of topics, including quantum mechanics, relativity, and nuclear physics. His work on the Oppenheimer-Phillips process, a mechanism for nuclear fusion, was particularly notable.\n\n# Private and political life\n\n## Politics\n\nOppenheimer was a liberal and a supporter of left-wing causes. He was a member of the American Communist Party and was involved in various progressive organizations. However, his involvement with the Communist Party was limited, and he never held a high-ranking position.\n\n## Relationships and children\n\nOppenheimer married Katherine \"Kitty\" Posen in 1940. Kitty was a former Communist Party member and had been involved in various left-wing activities. The couple had two children, Toni and Peter.\n\n## Mysticism\n\nOppenheimer was fascinated by Eastern mysticism and philosophy. He was particularly drawn to the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Hindu text. He saw parallels between the principles of quantum mechanics and the concepts of Eastern mysticism, and he often incorporated elements of mysticism into his lectures and writings.\n\n# Manhattan Project\n\n## Los Alamos\n\nIn 1942, Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan Project, a secret research and development project aimed at producing an atomic bomb. He established a research laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where a team of scientists and engineers worked on the development of the bomb.\n\n## Bomb design\n\nOppenheimer played a crucial role in the design of the atomic bomb. He worked closely with other scientists, including Enrico Fermi and Ernest Lawrence, to develop a workable design. The team faced numerous challenges, including the development of a suitable nuclear reactor and the creation of a mechanism for detonating the bomb.\n\n## Trinity\n\nOn July 16, 1945, the Manhattan Project team conducted the Trinity test, the first nuclear test in history. Oppenheimer was present at the test, which was held in the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The test was a success, and it marked a major milestone in the development of the atomic bomb.\n\n# Postwar activities\n\n## Institute for Advanced Study\n\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer returned to academia and took up a position as the director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. He remained in this position until 1966, when he retired.\n\n## Atomic Energy Commission\n\nOppenheimer was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a regulatory body established to oversee the development and use of nuclear energy. He played a key role in shaping the commission's policies and was a vocal advocate for international cooperation on nuclear issues.\n\n## Panels and study groups\n\nOppenheimer was a member of various panels and study groups, including the General Advisory Committee of the AEC and the National Academy of Sciences. He played a key role in advising the government on scientific and technical matters.\n\n## Security hearing\n\nIn 1954, Oppenheimer was the subject of a security hearing, which was convened to investigate his loyalty and suitability for access to classified information. The hearing was sparked by Oppenheimer's opposition to the development of the hydrogen bomb and his association with left-wing individuals. The hearing was a major controversy, and it marked the beginning of the end of Oppenheimer's involvement in government affairs.\n\n# Final years\n\n## Enrico Fermi Award\n\nIn 1963, Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award, a prestigious honor bestowed by the AEC. The award recognized his contributions to the development of nuclear energy and his leadership of the Manhattan Project.\n\n# Death\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62, due to complications from throat cancer.\n\n# Legacy\n\nOppenheimer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a brilliant physicist and a charismatic leader, who played a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb. He is also remembered as a complex and conflicted individual, who struggled with the moral implications of his work.\n\n# Publications\n\nOppenheimer was a prolific writer and published numerous papers and articles on scientific and technical topics. He also wrote several books, including \"The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists\" and \"The Open Mind\".\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including Oppenheimer's own writings and the accounts of his contemporaries.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include references.\n\n# Sources\n\nThis article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and primary documents.\n\n# Further reading\n\n## Articles\n\n* Oppenheimer, J.R.

From maintaining a policy of neutrality during the Cold War to pursuing membership in the alliance, Finland's stance on NATO has evolved in response to changing regional and global security dynamics.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Finland adopted a policy of neutrality, seeking to maintain good relations with both the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. The country's geographical location, bordering the Soviet Union, made it imperative to maintain a delicate balance between the two superpowers. The 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, which ended the state of war between Finland and the Allied Powers, cemented Finland's position as a neutral state.\n\n### 1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n\n#### 1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, Finland's neutral stance allowed it to maintain diplomatic relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union. The country participated in various international organizations, such as the United Nations, and engaged in trade with both Eastern and Western countries. Finland's military, however, remained non-aligned, and the country did not participate in any military alliances.\n\n#### 1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Finland began to reassess its foreign policy. The country joined the European Union (EU) in 1995, which marked a significant shift towards greater integration with Western Europe. Although Finland did not seek NATO membership at this time, it did participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) program, which aimed to promote cooperation between NATO and non-member states.\n\n#### 1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n\nFinland's participation in the EU led to increased cooperation with other member states on defense and security issues. The country contributed troops to EU-led peacekeeping missions and participated in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Although Finland maintained its non-alignment policy, the country's defense cooperation with NATO member states increased, and it participated in several NATO-led operations, including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.\n\n#### 2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n##### February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n\nIn response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Finland condemned the actions and provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The country also increased its military preparedness and participated in NATO's enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) in the Baltic region.\n\n##### May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n\nOn May 15, 2022, Finland's President and Prime Minister jointly announced the country's intention to apply for NATO membership. The decision was supported by a majority of the Finnish Parliament. On May 18, 2022, Finland submitted its application to join NATO.\n\n##### June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n\nFinland's accession process was rapid, with all 30 NATO member states approving the country's membership by April 2023. The ratification process was completed on April 4, 2023, when Turkey became the final country to approve Finland's membership.\n\n### 2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n\nFinland officially became the 31st member of NATO on April 4, 2023. The country's membership marks a significant shift in its foreign and security policy, as it transitions from a non-aligned state to a member of a military alliance. Finland's participation in NATO is expected to enhance the country's security and contribute to regional stability.\n\nFinland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFinland's membership in NATO has strengthened its relations with other member states. The country has increased its participation in NATO-led operations and has contributed to the alliance's efforts to enhance regional security. Finland's defense cooperation with other NATO member states, particularly with neighboring countries such as Estonia and Latvia, has also increased.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Finland–Russia relations\n* Finland–United States relations\n* NATO–Russia relations\n* Enlargement of NATO\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland–NATO_relations\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background: Finnish neutrality at the end of World War II\n##1949–2023: Pre-membership relations\n###1949–1991: Finnish neutrality during the Cold War\n###1991–1995: Immediate aftermath of the Cold War\n###1995–2022: Shift from non-alignment within the European Union\n###2022–2023: Accession process following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n####February – May 2022: Initial response to the invasion\n####May – June 2022: Declaration of intent, application\n####June 2022 – April 2023: Ratification\n##2023–present: Finnish membership in NATO\n#Finland's foreign relations with other NATO member states\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He faced opposition from rival clans and external threats, but he was able to overcome these challenges through a combination of military victories and strategic alliances.\n\n#Family\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā was a member of the Ningthouja dynasty, which had ruled over Manipur since the 15th century. He was the son of King Pamheiba and Queen Nonglenbi, and he had several siblings who played important roles in his court. His wife, Queen Nonglenbi, was a member of the Khuman clan, which was a powerful and influential group in Meitei society. Together, they had several children, including sons who would go on to succeed him as king.\n\n#Law and order\n\nOne of Nongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā's most significant achievements was the establishment of a formal system of law and order in Manipur. Prior to his reign, the kingdom was governed by a mixture of customary law and royal decrees. However, Nongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā recognized the need for a more formal and systematic approach to governance, and he established a new code of laws that applied to all subjects of the kingdom. This code, known as the \" Manipur Cheitharol Kumbaba\", covered a wide range of topics, including crime, property, and social relationships.\n\n#Artistic and cultural developments\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā was a patron of the arts, and his court was renowned for its cultural achievements. He was a skilled musician and poet, and he encouraged the development of Meitei literature and music. During his reign, the Meitei script was developed, and the first Meitei books were written. He also promoted the development of Meitei dance, music, and theater, and his court was known for its lavish performances and festivals.\n\n#Institutions of medical care\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā was also concerned with the health and well-being of his subjects, and he established a number of institutions to provide medical care. He built hospitals and clinics, and he appointed trained physicians to staff them. He also encouraged the development of traditional Meitei medicine, which was based on the use of herbs and other natural remedies.\n\n#Death or dethronement\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā died in the late 18th century, after a long and successful reign. He was succeeded by his son, who went on to rule Manipur for many years. However, the kingdom was eventually conquered by the British, who established their own administration and laws.\n\n#Deification\n\n##In traditional Meitei religion\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā was deified by the Meitei people, who revered him as a god-king. He was believed to have supernatural powers, and he was worshiped as a symbol of Meitei identity and culture. His deification was based on his military victories, his administrative reforms, and his cultural achievements, which were seen as evidence of his divine status.\n\n##In Hinduism\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā was also incorporated into Hindu mythology, where he was revered as a hero and a divine king. He was associated with the god Vishnu, who was believed to have incarnated as a human being in order to restore justice and order to the world. Nongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā's deification was seen as a manifestation of this divine power, and he was worshiped as a symbol of Hindu values and ideals.\n\n#In contemporary art and culture\n\nNongdā Lāiren Pākhangbā remains an important figure in contemporary Meitei art and culture. He is celebrated in literature, music, and dance, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and writers. His deification is still recognized by the Meitei people, who worship him as a symbol of their identity and culture.\n\n#See also\n\n* Meitei people\n* Manipur\n* Ningthouja dynasty\n* Meitei literature\n* Meitei music\n* Meitei dance\n* Meitei theater\n\n#Notes\n\n#References\n\n#Sources\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Nongdā_Lāiren_Pākhangbā\" following this outline:\n\n#Rise to power\n#Family\n#Law and order\n#Artistic and cultural developments\n#Institutions of medical care\n#Death or dethronement\n#Deification\n##In traditional Meitei religion\n##In Hinduism\n#In contemporary art and culture\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Al-Zawahiri had been the leader of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda since the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. The operation marked a significant milestone in the global fight against terrorism and had far-reaching implications for international relations and security.\n\n#Background\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was born on June 19, 1951, in Maadi, Egypt. He earned a degree in medicine from Cairo University and later obtained a master's degree in surgery from the same institution. Al-Zawahiri's radicalization began in the 1970s, and he eventually became a key figure in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ). In the 1980s, he met Osama bin Laden, and the two formed a close alliance that would last for decades.\n\nFollowing the 9/11 attacks in 2001, al-Zawahiri became one of the most wanted men in the world. He survived numerous attempts on his life and continued to lead al-Qaeda, orchestrating various terrorist plots and attacks worldwide. Al-Zawahiri's leadership style was characterized by his intellectualism and strategic thinking, which allowed him to maintain a low profile while still influencing global events.\n\n#Preparation\n\nThe operation to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri was the result of months of planning and intelligence gathering by the United States. The CIA, in cooperation with other intelligence agencies, had been tracking al-Zawahiri's movements and gathering information on his hideouts and security arrangements.\n\nIn 2020, the United States had withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan, but it continued to maintain a presence in the region through drone surveillance and special operations. The Biden administration had made it clear that the United States would continue to pursue high-value targets, including al-Qaeda leaders, in Afghanistan", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Killing_of_Ayman_al-Zawahiri\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Preparation\n#Operation\n#Aftermath\n##Al-Qaeda response\n#International reactions\n##U.S. politicians\n##Taliban\n##International governments\n##Individuals\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The term was coined due to the sensitive and often illicit nature of these procedures, which were frequently performed in secret to avoid detection by law enforcement.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\nIn the early 20th century, abortion was a highly stigmatized and often illegal procedure in many countries. As a result, those seeking abortions, as well as the medical professionals performing them, were forced to operate in secret to avoid prosecution. This led to the development of a network of clandestine abortion providers, who often used coded language to communicate with clients and avoid detection.\n\n## \"The thing that had no name\"\n\nThe term \"illegal operation\" emerged as a euphemism for abortion during this period. It was used to refer to the procedure without explicitly stating its nature, thereby avoiding detection by law enforcement or others who might be opposed to abortion. This euphemism was often used in conversation, as well as in print and other forms of communication.\n\n## Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n\nThe use of euphemisms for abortion was not limited to the term \"illegal operation.\" Other terms, such as \"menstrual regulation\" or \"uterine evacuation,\" were also used to refer to abortion procedures. These euphemisms were often used in medical texts, as well as in popular literature and media.\n\n# Law\n\nThe use of euphemisms for abortion was also reflected in the language used in laws and court decisions related to the procedure. In many jurisdictions, laws prohibiting abortion were written in a way that avoided explicitly mentioning the procedure. Instead, they might refer to \"unlawful operations\" or \"unlawful procedures.\" This language was often used to avoid controversy and to maintain a level of plausible deniability.\n\n# Art\n\nThe theme of \"illegal operation\" has been explored in various forms of art, including film, television, sculpture, and fiction.\n\n## Film\n\nSeveral films have addressed the theme of \"illegal operation,\" often using the term as a euphemism for abortion. These films frequently explore the consequences of seeking an abortion in a society where the procedure is heavily stigmatized or illegal. Examples of films that have addressed this theme include \"A Private Matter\" (1992), which tells the story of a woman who seeks an abortion in the 1950s, and \"Vera Drake\" (2004), which explores the life of a woman who performs abortions in post-war Britain.\n\n## Television\n\nTelevision shows have also addressed the theme of \"illegal operation,\" often using the term as a plot device to explore the consequences of seeking an abortion. Examples of television shows that have addressed this theme include \"Mad Men\" (2007-2015), which features a character who seeks an abortion in the 1960s, and \"Call the Midwife\" (2012-present), which explores the lives of midwives in post-war Britain, including their experiences with abortion.\n\n## Sculpture\n\nThe theme of \"illegal operation\" has also been explored in sculpture, often using the term as a metaphor for the secrecy and shame surrounding abortion. Examples of sculptures that have addressed this theme include \"The Abortion Project\" by artist Joyce Wieland, which features a series of sculptures that explore the experience of seeking an abortion.\n\n## Fiction\n\nThe theme of \"illegal operation\" has been explored in various works of fiction, often using the term as a metaphor for the secrecy and shame surrounding abortion. Examples of works of fiction that have addressed this theme include \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath (1963), which features a character who seeks an abortion, and \"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood (1985), which explores a dystopian society where abortion is heavily restricted.\n\nIn conclusion, the term \"illegal operation\" has been used as a euphemism for abortion, particularly in the mid-20th century. The term has been used in various forms of art, including film, television, sculpture, and fiction, often to explore the consequences of seeking an abortion in a society where the procedure is heavily stigmatized or illegal.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Illegal_operation_(euphemism)\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Background\n##\"The thing that had no name\"\n##Abortion euphemism elsewhere in print\n#Law\n#Art\n##Film\n##Television\n##Sculpture\n##Fiction\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks a departure from Beyoncé's previous work, embracing a more experimental and genre-bending sound that blends elements of house, disco, and Afrobeats with hip-hop and R&B.\n\n#Background and conception\n\nThe conception of Renaissance began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Beyoncé found herself with an unprecedented amount of time to focus on her music. In an interview, she revealed that she had been working on the album for over three years, pouring her heart and soul into the project. Beyoncé has stated that the album was inspired by the music of her childhood, particularly the disco and funk records of the 1970s and 1980s. She also drew inspiration from contemporary artists, such as DJ Koze and Burial, and incorporated elements of their styles into the album.\n\nBeyoncé worked with a variety of collaborators on Renaissance, including producers and songwriters such as The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, and Hit-Boy. She also enlisted the help of several guest vocalists, including Jay-Z, Drake, and Tems. The album was recorded at several studios around the world, including Parkwood Studios in Los Angeles and The Treehouse in New York City.\n\n#Cover artwork\n\nThe cover artwork for Renaissance was designed by Carlijn Jacobs, a Dutch artist and photographer.

The album also features several ballads, including \"Plastic Off the Sofa\" and \"Thique,\" which showcase Beyoncé's vocal range and emotional depth.\n\nOne of the standout features of Renaissance is its use of sampling and interpolation.

The tour will feature a high-energy live show, with Beyoncé performing a mix of old and new material. The tour is expected to be one of the biggest and most successful of the year, with tickets selling out quickly in many cities.\n\n##Visuals\n\nThe visuals for Renaissance have been widely praised for their beauty and creativity. The album's music videos, which were directed by Beyoncé herself, feature a mix of dance, fashion, and surreal imagery. The videos have been praised for their originality and style, and have helped to further establish Beyoncé as a visual artist.\n\n##Renaissance Couture\n\nIn addition to the standard edition of Renaissance, Beyoncé also released a deluxe edition of the album, which features a bonus disc of remixes and bonus tracks. The deluxe edition was packaged in a special box set, which includes a 28-page booklet and a set of exclusive prints.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nRenaissance has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the album's creativity and innovation.
