This surgery is one of the most common and effective operations performed worldwide, with millions of people undergoing the procedure every year.\n\n# Uses\n\nCataract surgery is primarily used to treat cataracts, which can cause blurry vision, glare, and decreased night vision. The surgery can significantly improve vision and quality of life for individuals with cataracts. Additionally, cataract surgery can also be used to correct other vision problems, such as presbyopia or astigmatism.\n\n# Techniques\n\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including phacoemulsification, manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technique depends on the individual's specific needs and the surgeon's preferences.\n\n## Pre-operative evaluation\n\nBefore undergoing cataract surgery, patients undergo a comprehensive pre-operative evaluation to assess their overall health and identify any potential risks or complications. This evaluation includes a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.\n\n### Contraindications\n\nWhile cataract surgery is generally safe and effective, there are certain contraindications that may prevent a person from undergoing the procedure. These include active eye infections, certain medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and previous eye trauma.\n\n### Selection of intraocular lenses\n\nIntraocular lenses (IOLs) are artificial lenses implanted in the eye to replace the natural lens. There are several types of IOLs available, including monofocal, multifocal, and toric lenses. The selection of an IOL depends on the individual's specific needs and preferences.\n\n# Operation procedures\n\nThe operation procedures for cataract surgery vary depending on the technique used.\n\n## Preparation\n\nBefore the surgery, the patient is given local anesthesia and prepared for the procedure. The eye is cleaned and draped, and an incision is made in the cornea or sclera.\n\n## Anaesthesia\n\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the eye and surrounding area, ensuring that the patient does not feel any pain during the procedure. In some cases, sedation may also be used to help the patient relax.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\n\nPhacoemulsification is a modern cataract surgery technique that uses ultrasonic waves to break up the cloudy lens. The lens is then removed through a small incision, and an IOL is implanted in its place.\n\n## Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n\nMSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the cornea and removing the cloudy lens through the incision. This technique is often used in developing countries where phacoemulsification equipment may not be available.\n\n## Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\nECCE is a technique that involves removing the cloudy lens in one piece through a larger incision. This technique is often used in cases where the lens is very hard or dense.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to ECCE during the procedure to manage a contingency such as a broken lens or excessive bleeding.\n\n## Closing the wound\n\nAfter the procedure, the wound is closed with stitches or allowed to heal on its own. The eye is then covered with a protective shield to prevent injury or infection.\n\n# Post-operative care\n\nAfter cataract surgery, patients require post-operative care to ensure a smooth and safe recovery. This includes using eye drops to reduce inflammation and prevent infection, and attending follow-up appointments with the surgeon.\n\n# Complications\n\nWhile cataract surgery is generally safe and effective, there are potential complications that can occur during or after the procedure.\n\n## During surgery\n\nComplications that can occur during surgery include excessive bleeding, broken lens, or damage to the surrounding tissue.\n\n## After surgery\n\nComplications that can occur after surgery include infection, inflammation, or dislocation of the IOL.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe risk of complications can be minimized by following the surgeon's instructions and attending follow-up appointments.\n\n# Recovery and rehabilitation\n\nThe recovery and rehabilitation process after cataract surgery typically takes several weeks. During this time, patients may experience some discomfort, blurry vision, or sensitivity to light.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally excellent, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision and quality of life.\n\n# History\n\nCataract surgery has a long history dating back to ancient times. The first recorded cataract surgery was performed by the Indian physician Sushruta in the 6th century BC.\n\n# Accessibility\n\nCataract surgery is accessible in many parts of the world, although there may be variations in the availability and quality of care.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn Europe, cataract surgery is widely available and of high quality, with many countries having well-established healthcare systems.\n\n## Asia\n\nIn Asia, cataract surgery is also widely available, although there may be variations in the quality of care depending on the country and region.\n\n## Africa\n\nIn Africa, cataract surgery is less accessible, particularly in rural areas where healthcare facilities may be limited.\n\n## Latin America\n\nIn Latin America, cataract surgery is available in many countries, although there may be variations in the quality of care depending on the country and region.\n\n# Social, economic and environmental relevance\n\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance, particularly in developing countries where access to healthcare may be limited.\n\n# Special populations\n\nCataract surgery may be more challenging in certain special populations, such as children or individuals with complex medical conditions.\n\n## Congenital cataracts\n\nCongenital cataracts are a type of cataract that occurs in children. Surgery to remove the cataract and implant an IOL is typically performed at a young age to ensure proper development of the eye.\n\n## Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n\nIn some cases, individuals may require cataract surgery on separate occasions, which can increase the risk of complications.\n\n# Other animals\n\nCataract surgery is also performed in other animals, such as dogs and cats, to improve their vision and quality of life.\n\n# See also\n\n* Cataract\n* Intraocular lens\n* Phacoemulsification\n* Extracapsular cataract extraction\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of cataract surgery, including its uses, techniques, and outcomes.\n\n# References\n\n* (List of references to be added)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* (List of further reading to be added)\n\n# External links\n\n* (List of external links to be added)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

An investigation by the HSE eventually revealed that the emails had been sent by a former employee of the company.\n\n## Hand tool vibration\n\nShepherd Building Group has also faced criticism and controversy over its handling of hand tool vibration issues. In 2015, the company was fined £100,000 by the HSE for failing to adequately manage the risks associated with hand tool vibration. The company has since taken steps to improve its management of this issue.\n\n## Domain name disputes\n\nIn 2013, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a domain name dispute with a former employee who had registered a domain name similar to the company's own website. The company claimed that the domain name was an attempt to pass off the employee's own business as being associated with the company. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation.\n\n## Employment blacklisting\n\nShepherd Building Group has also been accused of being involved in employment blacklisting practices. In 2013, it was revealed that the company had subscribed to a blacklist of construction workers who had been involved in industrial disputes or who had raised health and safety concerns. The company has since denied any wrongdoing and has stated that it no longer subscribes to the blacklist.\n\n## Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2011, Shepherd Building Group was involved in a controversy surrounding the development of the Trinity Walk shopping center in Wakefield, UK. The company had been contracted to build the center, but a dispute arose over the quality of the work and the company's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The dispute was eventually resolved through mediation.\n\n# See also\n\n* Construction industry in the United Kingdom\n* Health and Safety Executive (HSE)\n* Employment blacklisting in the UK construction industry", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The black market, also known as the \"marché noir,\" was a network of clandestine economic activities that operated outside of the official economy, providing goods and services that were scarce or heavily regulated by the authorities. This article provides an overview of the background, development, and impact of the black market in wartime France.\n\n#Background\n\n##1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n\nThe interwar period in France was marked by economic instability, inflation, and social unrest. The global economic crisis of the 1930s had a significant impact on France, leading to high levels of unemployment, poverty, and social inequality. The French economy was also characterized by a large agricultural sector, which was heavily dependent on small-scale farming and was struggling to modernize. The economic instability of the 1930s created an environment in which the black market could thrive.\n\n##Fall of France\n\nIn May 1940, the German army invaded France, leading to a rapid collapse of the French military and the surrender of the French government. The German occupation of France was marked by a strict regime of economic controls, including rationing, price controls, and the requisitioning of goods and services. The occupation authorities also imposed a new economic order, which favored German interests and led to widespread poverty and scarcity.\n\n#1940-1941\n\n##Origins\n\nThe black market in wartime France emerged in response to the economic controls and shortages imposed by the German occupation authorities. The black market was initially driven by the need for basic goods and services, such as food, clothing, and fuel.\n\n###Rationing and price controls\n\nThe German occupation authorities imposed a system of rationing and price controls, which limited the amount of goods and services that could be purchased by the French population. The rationing system was based on a complex system of coupons and permits, which were difficult to obtain and often insufficient to meet basic needs.\n\n###Diversion from official channels\n\nThe black market emerged as a way to divert goods and services from official channels, such as the rationing system, and to provide alternative sources of supply. The black market was initially driven by small-scale operators, such as farmers, traders, and artisans, who sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n###Clandestine networks\n\nThe black market was characterized by clandestine networks of suppliers, distributors, and customers, who operated outside of the official economy. These networks were often based on personal relationships, trust, and reputation, and were difficult to detect and control.\n\n###Hidden stockpiling\n\nThe black market also involved the hidden stockpiling of goods and services, which were hoarded and hidden from the authorities. This stockpiling was often done by individuals and businesses, who sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n###Grey market\n\nThe grey market, also known as the \"marché gris,\" was a type of black market that operated in the margins of the official economy. The grey market involved the sale of goods and services that were not strictly prohibited by the authorities, but were subject to restrictions and regulations.\n\n##Users of the black market\n\n###Privileged French\n\nThe black market was used by a wide range of individuals and groups, including privileged French citizens, such as those with connections to the occupation authorities or with access to scarce resources.\n\n###Occupation forces\n\nThe black market was also used by the occupation forces, who sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity. German soldiers and officials often used the black market to obtain goods and services that were not available through official channels.\n\n##Public response\n\n###Early condemnation\n\nThe black market was initially condemned by the French public, who saw it as a threat to the official economy and to the war effort. The black market was also seen as a symbol of the corruption and decadence of the occupation regime.\n\n###Participation\n\nHowever, as the occupation continued and the shortages and scarcity worsened, more and more people began to participate in the black market. The black market became a necessary part of everyday life, as people sought to obtain basic goods and services.\n\n###Housewives' demonstrations\n\nHousewives, in particular, played a key role in the black market, as they sought to feed and clothe their families. Housewives' demonstrations and protests became common, as women demanded access to scarce resources and an end to the rationing system.\n\n###Suspicions of hoarding\n\nThe black market was also marked by suspicions of hoarding and speculation, as individuals and businesses were accused of profiteering from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n###Official antisemitism\n\nThe black market was also used as a pretext for official antisemitism, as Jewish businesses and individuals were accused of profiteering from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n###Public opinion\n\nPublic opinion about the black market was complex and nuanced, reflecting the contradictions and ambiguities of the occupation regime. While some people saw the black market as a necessary evil, others condemned it as a threat to the official economy and to the war effort.\n\n###Political opposition\n\nThe black market was also a key issue in the political opposition to the occupation regime, as resistance groups and politicians sought to exploit the discontent and frustration caused by the shortages and scarcity.\n\n##Response by authorities\n\nThe occupation authorities responded to the black market with a range of measures, including repression, regulation, and propaganda. The authorities sought to control the black market through a combination of police repression and economic incentives, such as the offer of rewards for informers and the promise of better rations for those who cooperated.\n\n#Widespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\n##Agricultural black market\n\nThe agricultural black market became a key sector of the black market, as farmers sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity of food. The agricultural black market involved the sale of produce, livestock, and dairy products outside of the official market.\n\n##Grey market: direct sales\n\nThe grey market also involved direct sales between producers and consumers, bypassing the official market. This type of grey market was particularly common in the agricultural sector, where farmers sold their produce directly to consumers.\n\n##Commerce and industry\n\nThe black market also involved commerce and industry, as businesses sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity of goods and services. The black market involved the sale of goods such as textiles, leather, and metalwork.\n\n##Tacit tolerance\n\nBy 1942, the occupation authorities had begun to adopt a policy of tacit tolerance towards the black market, recognizing that it was a necessary part of the economy. The authorities sought to regulate the black market, rather than to suppress it.\n\n###No longer immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as immoral or unpatriotic, but rather as a necessary evil. The black market had become a normal part of everyday life, as people sought to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment.\n\n###Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n\nThe authorities refocused their enforcement efforts on the most egregious forms of black market activity, such as large-scale speculation and hoarding. The authorities also sought to use the black market as a way to channel goods and services into the official economy.\n\n##Metrics\n\n###Proportion of production\n\nThe black market is estimated to have accounted for around 20-30% of total production in France during the occupation.\n\n###Higher and more volatile prices\n\nThe black market was characterized by higher and more volatile prices than the official market. Prices on the black market were often 2-3 times higher than on the official market.\n\n###Geographic distribution\n\nThe black market was more prevalent in urban areas, where the shortages and scarcity were more acute. The black market was also more common in regions with a high concentration of industry and commerce.\n\n###Beneficiaries\n\nThe beneficiaries of the black market were often those with connections to the occupation authorities or with access to scarce resources. However, the black market also provided opportunities for small-scale operators and entrepreneurs to profit from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n#Patriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n\n##Enforcement for the occupiers\n\nIn 1943, the occupation authorities launched a new campaign to enforce the economic controls and to suppress the black market. The authorities sought to use the black market as a way to channel goods and services into the official economy.\n\n###Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n\nThe German authorities also sought to exploit the French economy through a policy of economic pillage. The authorities requisitioned goods and services, and imposed heavy fines and penalties on those who resisted.\n\n###Countermeasures and collaboration\n\nThe French resistance responded to the new campaign with countermeasures, such as sabotage and subversion. The resistance also sought to collaborate with the Allies, who were beginning to prepare for the invasion of France.\n\n###Milice vs the black market\n\nThe Milice, a French paramilitary organization, was particularly active in suppressing the black market. The Milice saw the black market as a threat to the authority of the occupation regime, and sought to eliminate it through repression and violence.\n\n##Fraud and Resistance\n\n###Resistance encouragement\n\nThe resistance encouraged people to engage in acts of fraud and subversion against the occupation authorities. The resistance saw the black market as a way to disrupt the official economy and to weaken the occupation regime.\n\n###Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe occupation authorities blamed the resistance for the black market, and sought to use it as a pretext for repression and violence. The authorities claimed that the resistance was responsible for the shortages and scarcity, and that it was seeking to profit from the black market.\n\n###End of the occupation\n\nThe black market played a significant role in the final months of the occupation, as the resistance and the Allies prepared for the invasion of France. The black market provided a way for people to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment, and it played a key role in the eventual defeat of the occupation regime.\n\n#After the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\n##Épuration and illicit profits\n\n###Pursuit and punishment\n\nAfter the liberation of France, the authorities pursued and punished those who had profited from the black market. The authorities sought to confiscate illicit profits and to impose heavy fines and penalties on those who had engaged in black market activity.\n\n###Confiscation of illicit profits\n\nThe authorities confiscated illicit profits, and used them to fund reconstruction and development projects. The authorities also sought to use the black market as a way to channel goods and services into the official economy.\n\n##Continued black market operations\n\n###Continued trafficking\n\nThe black market continued to operate after the liberation, as people sought to profit from the shortages and scarcity. The black market involved the sale of goods such as textiles, leather, and metalwork.\n\n###Generalized fraud\n\nThe black market was also characterized by generalized fraud, as people sought to cheat and deceive each other. The black market involved the sale of counterfeit goods, and the use of false weights and measures.\n\n###Government powerlessness\n\nThe government was powerless to stop the black market, as it was deeply ingrained in the economy. The government sought to regulate the black market, rather than to suppress it.\n\n###Towards the free market\n\nThe black market played a significant role in the transition to a free market economy in France. The black market provided a way for people to engage in private enterprise and to profit from the shortages and scarcity.\n\n#Historical memory\n\n##Historiography\n\nThe historiography of the black market in wartime France is complex and nuanced, reflecting the contradictions and ambiguities of the occupation regime. Historians have sought to understand the black market as a way to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment.\n\n##Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n\n###Early recollections\n\nThe black market has been remembered as a way to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment. The black market has been recalled as a necessary evil, a way to obtain basic goods and services.\n\n###Marcel Aymé\n\nThe French writer Marcel Aymé wrote about the black market in his novel \"La Traversée de Paris\". Aymé portrayed the black market as a way to survive and thrive in a difficult economic environment.\n\n##Major works\n\n###La Traversée de Paris\n\n\"La Traversée de Paris\" is a novel by Marcel Aymé, published in 1946.

The wildfires had significant domestic and international impacts, causing widespread evacuations, damage to infrastructure, and loss of life.\n\n# Background\n\nCanada is prone to wildfires due to its vast wilderness areas, dry climate, and lightning strikes. The country has experienced several major wildfires in recent years, including the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire and the 2017 British Columbia wildfires. However, the 2023 wildfires were particularly severe, with many experts attributing the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires to climate change.\n\n# Wildfires\n\nThe 2023 Canadian wildfires occurred in several provinces and territories, including Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.\n\n## Alberta\n\nAlberta was one of the hardest-hit provinces, with several major wildfires burning throughout the summer.\n\n### High Level Forest Area\n\nThe High Level Forest Area wildfire was one of the largest and most destructive wildfires in Alberta, burning over 100,000 hectares of land.

The crisis has its roots in the complex history of the region, including the Kosovo War and the declaration of independence by Kosovo in 2008.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Kosovo War, fought between 1998 and 1999, resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, primarily ethnic Albanians. Following the war, Kosovo was administered by the United Nations, and in 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared independence from Serbia. However, Serbia, along with several other countries, refused to recognize Kosovo's sovereignty. The north of Kosovo, where a majority of the population is ethnic Serb, has remained a point of contention.\n\nIn the years leading up to the crisis, relations between Kosovo and Serbia had been strained. Tensions were further exacerbated by the failure of EU-mediated talks aimed at normalizing relations between the two countries. The situation on the ground in north Kosovo was marked by a lack of trust between the local population and the government in Pristina, as well as limited access to basic services and infrastructure.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2022\n\n### July\n\nOn July 10, 2022, Kosovo's government, led by Prime Minister Albin Kurti, announced plans to introduce new regulations requiring drivers with Serbian-issued license plates to replace them with Kosovo-issued plates. The move was intended to bring Kosovo's laws into line with those of other European countries and to reduce tensions with Serbia. However, the decision was met with widespread opposition from the ethnic Serb population in north Kosovo, who saw it as an attempt to assert Pristina's authority over the region.\n\n### August\n\nTensions escalated in August, as Kosovo police attempted to implement the new regulations. On August 1, a group of ethnic Serb protesters blocked the main road connecting Kosovo to Serbia, sparking clashes with Kosovo police. The situation rapidly deteriorated, with reports of violence, including the use of tear gas and firearms.\n\n### September\n\nIn September, the international community stepped in to try to mediate a resolution to the crisis. The EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, traveled to the region, meeting with leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia. However, the talks failed to produce a breakthrough, and tensions remained high.\n\n### October\n\nOn October 15, Kosovo's government announced plans to establish a new municipality in north Kosovo, which would be administered by the central government. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Pristina's authority over the region, and it was met with widespread opposition from the ethnic Serb population.\n\n### November\n\nIn November, the situation on the ground in north Kosovo continued to deteriorate. There were reports of violence, including the use of explosives and firearms, and several people were injured. The international community continued to call for calm, but the situation remained volatile.\n\n### December\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the crisis in north Kosovo showed no signs of abating. The ethnic Serb population continued to protest against the government's plans, and tensions remained high. The international community continued to mediate, but a resolution to the crisis remained elusive.\n\n## 2023\n\n### January\n\nIn January 2023, the EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, returned to the region, meeting with leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia. The talks were seen as a last-ditch effort to resolve the crisis, but they ultimately failed to produce a breakthrough.\n\n### February\n\nOn February 15, Kosovo's government announced plans to establish a new police station in north Kosovo, which would be staffed by officers from the central government. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Pristina's authority over the region, and it was met with widespread opposition from the ethnic Serb population.\n\n### March\n\nIn March, the situation on the ground in north Kosovo continued to deteriorate. There were reports of violence, including the use of explosives and firearms, and several people were injured. The international community continued to call for calm, but the situation remained volatile.\n\n### April\n\nOn April 1, the EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, announced plans to launch a new round of talks aimed at resolving the crisis. The talks would bring together leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia, as well as representatives from the international community.\n\n### May\n\nIn May, the talks began, but they were marked by tension and disagreement. The Kosovo government insisted that Serbia recognize its sovereignty, while the Serbian government refused to do so. The international community continued to mediate, but a resolution to the crisis remained elusive.\n\n### June\n\nOn June 15, Kosovo's government announced plans to introduce new regulations aimed at reducing tensions with Serbia. The move was seen as a concession to the international community, but it was met with skepticism by the ethnic Serb population.\n\n### July\n\nIn July, the situation on the ground in north Kosovo continued to deteriorate. There were reports of violence, including the use of explosives and firearms, and several people were injured. The international community continued to call for calm, but the situation remained volatile.\n\n### September\n\nOn September 1, the EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, announced plans to launch a new initiative aimed at resolving the crisis. The initiative would bring together leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia, as well as representatives from the international community.\n\n### October\n\nIn October, the initiative was launched, but it was met with skepticism by the Kosovo government. The government insisted that Serbia recognize its sovereignty, while the Serbian government refused to do so. The international community continued to mediate, but a resolution to the crisis remained elusive.\n\n### November\n\nOn November 15, Kosovo's government announced plans to establish a new municipality in north Kosovo, which would be administered by the central government. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Pristina's authority over the region, and it was met with widespread opposition from the ethnic Serb population.\n\n### December\n\nAs the year drew to a close, the crisis in north Kosovo showed no signs of abating. The ethnic Serb population continued to protest against the government's plans, and tensions remained high. The international community continued to mediate, but a resolution to the crisis remained elusive.\n\n## 2024\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2024, the situation on the ground in north Kosovo continued to deteriorate. There were reports of violence, including the use of explosives and firearms, and several people were injured. The international community continued to call for calm, but the situation remained volatile.\n\n### August\n\nOn August 1, the EU's High Representative, Josep Borrell, announced plans to launch a new round of talks aimed at resolving the crisis. The talks would bring together leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia, as well as representatives from the international community.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe international community has been heavily involved in attempts to resolve the crisis in north Kosovo. The EU, in particular, has played a key role, with the High Representative, Josep Borrell, traveling to the region on numerous occasions to meet with leaders from both Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nThe US has also been involved, with the State Department calling for calm and urging both sides to engage in dialogue. Other countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, have also expressed concern about the situation and called for a peaceful resolution.\n\n# See also\n\n* Kosovo War\n* Kosovo independence\n* Serbia-Kosovo relations\n* European Union\n* International community", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The teams played each other in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe four teams that were drawn into Group B were:\n\n* England, one of the most successful teams in the history of the FIFA World Cup, with a rich football history and a strong squad.\n* Iran, a team that has been making steady progress in recent years, with a mix of experienced players and young talent.\n* United States, a team that has been a regular participant in the World Cup, with a well-organized squad and a strong team spirit.\n* Wales, a team that has been making a comeback in international football, with a talented squad and a passionate fan base.\n\n# LGBT symbol incidents\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup was marked by several incidents related to the display of LGBT symbols, particularly in Group B.\n\n## Captains' armbands\n\nOne of the most notable incidents was the decision by the captains of several teams, including England and Wales, to wear rainbow-colored armbands in support of the LGBT community. However, FIFA warned the teams that this would be considered a breach of their rules, and the captains were ultimately forced to abandon the plan.\n\n## Other Pride items\n\nDespite the ban on the armbands, several players and teams found other ways to show their support for the LGBT community. For example, the Welsh team wore rainbow-colored socks during their match against the United States, while the English team displayed a rainbow-colored banner in the stadium.\n\n# Standings\n\nThe final standings in Group B were as follows:\n\n| Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n| England | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 9 | 2 | +7 | 7 |\n| United States | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | +1 | 5 |\n| Iran | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 7 | -3 | 3 |\n| Wales | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 | -5 | 1 |\n\n# Matches\n\n## England vs Iran\n\nThe first match of the group saw England take on Iran, with the English team winning 6-2.

The battle began in August 2022 and lasted until early June 2023, making it one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\nThe city of Bakhmut, with a pre-war population of around 70,000, is a strategic location in the Donetsk Oblast, lying about 45 kilometers northeast of the regional capital, Donetsk. The city's proximity to the front lines and its position on the main road connecting Donetsk to Luhansk and the Russian border made it an important military objective for both sides. The battle for Bakhmut was part of the larger Donbas campaign, which began in April 2022, and aimed to capture the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut began in August 2022, when Russian forces, with support from the Wagner Group, started shelling the city and its surroundings. The initial goal was to weaken Ukrainian defenses and create a breach in the front lines. Ukrainian forces responded with artillery fire, and both sides engaged in a series of skirmishes and reconnaissance missions. Despite the intensity of the fighting, neither side made significant gains, and the front lines remained relatively stable.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter approached, the fighting around Bakhmut intensified, with both sides launching a series of attacks and counterattacks. Russian forces attempted to break through Ukrainian defenses, but their advances were repeatedly repelled. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, launched a series of local counterattacks, aimed at pushing the Russians back and relieving pressure on the city. The fighting was characterized by heavy artillery exchanges, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby town of Soledar, which lies about 15 kilometers northeast of Bakhmut. The fall of Soledar allowed Russian forces to partially encircle Bakhmut, cutting off one of the main supply routes to the city. Ukrainian forces responded by launching a series of counterattacks, aimed at retaking Soledar and relieving pressure on Bakhmut. Despite initial gains, Ukrainian forces were ultimately unable to retake the town.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks, aimed at outmaneuvering Russian forces and relieving pressure on Bakhmut. The counterattacks were launched from the north and northwest, with Ukrainian forces making significant gains and pushing the Russians back. The success of the counterattacks created a new threat to Russian positions, and forced them to divert troops from other parts of the front.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn 20 May 2023, Russian forces, with support from the Wagner Group, captured the city of Bakhmut. The fall of the city was the result of a prolonged and intense battle, which had lasted for over nine months. Following the capture of the city, Wagner forces began to withdraw from the area, handing control over to regular Russian troops. The withdrawal was seen as a significant development, as it marked the first time that Wagner forces had been involved in a major battle and then withdrawn.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nThe military strength and tactics employed by both sides during the battle for Bakhmut varied significantly. Ukrainian forces relied heavily on artillery and infantry, with a focus on defensive operations. Russian forces, meanwhile, employed a range of tactics, including artillery bombardments, infantry assaults, and the use of Wagner Group mercenaries. The use of Wagner forces allowed Russian commanders to deploy troops in a more flexible and adaptable manner, and to take greater risks on the battlefield.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut was seen as a significant strategic victory for Russian forces, as it gave them control of a key road junction and allowed them to threaten Ukrainian positions in the Donetsk Oblast. However, the victory came at a high cost, with both sides suffering significant casualties. The city itself was largely destroyed, and the surrounding area was heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battlefield conditions around Bakhmut were characterized by heavy destruction and contamination. The city itself was largely reduced to rubble, with many buildings destroyed or badly damaged. The surrounding area was heavily mined, with both sides laying extensive networks of landmines and booby traps. The use of artillery and other heavy weapons created a significant risk of unexploded ordnance, which posed a threat to both military personnel and civilians.\n\n##Casualties\n\n###Military casualties\n\nThe exact number of military casualties suffered during the battle for Bakhmut is unknown, but it is estimated that both sides suffered significant losses. Ukrainian forces reportedly suffered over 10,000 casualties, including killed and wounded, while Russian forces suffered an estimated 15,000-20,000 casualties.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\nThe civilian population of Bakhmut suffered heavily during the battle, with many residents forced to flee the city or take shelter in basements and other underground areas. Estimates of civilian casualties vary, but it is believed that several hundred civilians were killed or wounded during the fighting.\n\n##Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was characterized by significant attrition on both sides. The prolonged and intense fighting wore down both Ukrainian and Russian forces, with many units suffering significant losses. The use of heavy artillery and other weapons created a significant risk of friendly fire, which added to the overall level of attrition.\n\n##Result\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut by Russian forces marked a significant turning point in the Donbas campaign, but the victory came at a high cost. Both sides suffered significant casualties, and the city itself was largely destroyed. The outcome of the battle highlighted the intense and bloody nature of the conflict, and the significant challenges faced by both Ukrainian and Russian forces.\n\n#Allegations of war crimes\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by allegations of war crimes, including the use of prohibited weapons and the targeting of civilians. Ukrainian forces accused Russian troops of using phosphorus bombs and other prohibited munitions, while Russian forces accused Ukrainian troops of targeting civilians and using human shields.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donbas campaign\n* Wagner Group\n\n#Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 16, 1925, in Regent's Park, London, Lansbury has established herself as a highly accomplished and versatile performer, with numerous awards and accolades to her name. This article provides an overview of her life, career, and achievements.\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury, a timber merchant, and Moyna MacGill, an Irish actress. She was the first of two daughters, with her younger sister, Isolde, being born in 1929. The family moved to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City. Lansbury's early life was marked by a love for the performing arts, with her mother encouraging her to pursue a career in acting.\n\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n\nLansbury's breakthrough role came in 1942, when she was cast as Nancy Olivier in the film Gaslight. Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, making her one of the youngest nominees at the time. This success led to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where she went on to appear in a string of films, including National Velvet (1944) and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945).\n\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n\nDuring her time at MGM, Lansbury appeared in a range of films, including The Harvey Girls (1946), The Three Musketeers (1948), and The Red Danube (1949). While these films were not always critically acclaimed, they helped establish Lansbury as a versatile and talented young actress.\n\n#Mid career\n\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n\nIn the early 1950s, Lansbury began to appear in more substantial roles, including the critically acclaimed film The Manchurian Candidate (1962). However, she also found herself typecast in minor roles, often playing the part of the \"older woman\" or \"matronly figure.\" Despite this, Lansbury continued to work steadily in film and television, appearing in productions such as The Long, Hot Summer (1958) and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (1962).\n\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n\nLansbury's theatrical career gained momentum in the mid-1960s, with her starring role in the Broadway musical Mame (1966). Her performance as the titular character earned her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, cementing her status as a leading lady of the stage. Lansbury went on to appear in a string of successful Broadway productions, including Dear World (1969) and Prettybelle (1971).\n\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lansbury moved to Ireland, where she lived for several years. During this time, she continued to work in film and theater, appearing in productions such as Gypsy (1974) and The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1977). Lansbury's performance in Gypsy earned her a second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.\n\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n\nLansbury's theatrical career continued to thrive in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with her starring role in the Broadway musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979). Her performance as Nellie Lovett earned her a third Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Lansbury also continued to work in film, appearing in productions such as The Mirror Crack'd (1980) and The Company of Wolves (1984).\n\n#Global fame\n\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n\nLansbury's most iconic role came in 1984, when she was cast as mystery writer Jessica Fletcher in the television series Murder, She Wrote. The show became a global phenomenon, running for 12 seasons and earning Lansbury numerous awards and nominations, including 12 Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n\nAfter the conclusion of Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury continued to work in film and television, appearing in productions such as Nanny McPhee (2005) and Mary Poppins Returns (2018). She also continued to work in theater, appearing in productions such as A Little Night Music (2009) and Blithe Spirit (2014).\n\n#Personal life\n\nAngela Lansbury has been married twice, first to actor Richard Cromwell in 1945, and then to actor Peter Shaw in 1949. She has two children, Anthony Shaw and Deidre Shaw, both from her second marriage.

Born on December 14, 1946, in Marylebone, London, England, Birkin has established herself as a talented and versatile performer, known for her distinctive voice, striking features, and eclectic film choices.\n\n#Early life\n\nJane Birkin was born to David Birkin, a Royal Navy lieutenant commander, and Judy Campbell, an actress. Her maternal grandparents were also actors, and her great-aunt was the actress and comedian, Hermione Gingold. Birkin's family moved to Chelsea, London, where she spent most of her childhood. She was educated at Upper Chine School, a private school in Isle of Wight, and later attended the École Jeannine Manuel in Paris, where she developed her French language skills.\n\n#Career\n\n##Early acting credits\n\nBirkin began her acting career in the 1960s, appearing in small roles in British films and television productions. Her breakthrough came in 1966 with the film \"The Knack... and How to Get It,\" directed by Richard Lester, where she played the role of a fashion model. The film's success led to more prominent roles in films like \"Blow-Up\" (1966), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, and \"Wonderwall\" (1968), directed by Joe Massot.\n\n##Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\nIn the late 1960s, Birkin met French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she began a romantic relationship. The couple collaborated on several musical projects, including the hit single \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" (1969), which became a chart-topping success in several countries. The song's explicit lyrics and Birkin's breathy vocals caused controversy, but it remains one of the most iconic duets of all time. Birkin and Gainsbourg continued to work together on music and film projects, including the albums \"Di Doo Dah\" (1973) and \"Lolita Go Home\" (1975).\n\n##Later performances and recordings\n\nAfter her collaborations with Gainsbourg, Birkin continued to act in films and television productions, appearing in a wide range of genres, from drama to comedy. She released several solo albums, including \"Baby Alone in Babylone\" (1983) and \"Lost Song\" (1987), and worked with various musicians, such as Bryan Ferry and Tom Waits.

The incident occurred when James Meredith, a 29-year-old African American veteran, attempted to enroll at the university, which had previously been segregated. The event was a pivotal moment in the American Civil Rights Movement and marked a significant turning point in the struggle for racial equality in the United States.\n\n# Leadup\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nJames Meredith, a native of Kosciusko, Mississippi, had served in the United States Air Force and had been inspired by the Civil Rights Movement while stationed in Japan. After his discharge, he applied to the University of Mississippi, which had a long history of segregation. Despite meeting the university's admission requirements, Meredith's application was rejected, citing a lack of space and his failure to provide adequate recommendations. Meredith, with the assistance of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), filed a lawsuit against the university, arguing that the rejection was racially motivated.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nIn the months leading up to Meredith's enrollment, tensions between the federal government and the state of Mississippi escalated. President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, engaged in a series of telephone conversations with Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, urging him to comply with the court's ruling and allow Meredith to enroll. However, Barnett refused, citing the state's sovereignty and the need to maintain segregation. The Kennedy brothers eventually obtained a federal court order requiring the university to admit Meredith, but Barnett continued to resist, calling on Mississippians to protest the federal government's actions.\n\n# Events\n\n## Meredith arrives\n\nOn September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived at the University of Mississippi's Lyceum building, accompanied by federal marshals and a small group of supporters. As they attempted to enter the building, a crowd of protesters, including students, local residents, and state officials, blocked their path. The protesters, many of whom were armed, began to chant and shout, and the situation quickly escalated.\n\n## Violence on campus\n\nAs the protesters clashed with the federal marshals, violence erupted on campus. Rocks, bricks, and bottles were thrown, and several people were injured. The marshals, who were not authorized to use firearms, attempted to disperse the crowd using tear gas and batons. However, the protesters continued to resist, and the situation spiraled out of control. At one point, a group of protesters attempted to set fire to a federal marshal's car, and several buildings on campus were vandalized.\n\n## Military response\n\nAs the violence continued to escalate, President Kennedy deployed federal troops to the university to restore order. At 8:00 p.m., a convoy of military vehicles arrived on campus, and soldiers from the 2nd Infantry Division and the 101st Airborne Division began to disperse the crowd. The soldiers, who were armed with rifles and bayonets, used tear gas and batons to clear the area, and the protesters slowly began to retreat.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nIn the aftermath of the riot, two people were killed, and over 300 were injured. James Meredith, who had been forced to take cover during the violence, was eventually escorted to his dormitory, where he spent the night under the protection of federal marshals. The next day, he attended his first classes at the university, marking a significant milestone in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe Ole Miss Riot of 1962 marked a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement, as it highlighted the need for federal intervention to enforce desegregation in the South. The event also marked a significant shift in the Kennedy administration's approach to civil rights, as the president began to take a more active role in promoting racial equality. The riot also had a lasting impact on the University of Mississippi, which eventually became a symbol of progress and reconciliation in the South.\n\nIn 2006, the University of Mississippi dedicated a statue to James Meredith, commemorating his bravery and perseverance in the face of violence and intimidation. The statue, which is located near the Lyceum building, serves as a reminder of the university's complex history and its ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive account of the Ole Miss Riot of 1962, drawing on a range of historical sources and scholarly research.\n\n## Citations and references\n\n(Note: As per the requirements, no citations or references are included in this article.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ole_Miss_riot_of_1962\" following this outline:\n\n#Leadup\n##Meredith's attempts to enroll\n##Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n#Events\n##Meredith arrives\n##Violence on campus\n##Military response\n##Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##Citations and references\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The tracks include \"You All Over Me\", \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\", \"We Were Happy\", \"That's When\", \"Don't You\", and \"Bye Bye Baby\".\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was released on July 7, 2023, through Republic Records.

Perched on the highest point in the city, the hill of Montmartre, the church is a prominent landmark and a popular tourist destination. The church's striking white domes and stunning views of the city make it one of the most iconic and recognizable buildings in Paris.\n\n#History\n\n##Proposal\n\nThe idea for a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was first proposed in 1870 by Alexandre Legentil, a French Catholic priest. Legentil was inspired by a vision he had during the Franco-Prussian War, in which he saw the Sacred Heart of Jesus appearing to him and promising to protect Paris from harm. The proposal was initially met with skepticism, but it gained momentum after the war, particularly among Catholic circles.\n\n##Site\n\nThe site chosen for the church was the hill of Montmartre, which had been a sacred place for centuries. In ancient times, the hill was home to a Gallo-Roman temple dedicated to Mars, and later it became a site for Christian worship. In the 19th century, the hill was largely abandoned and had become a quarry for building materials. The site was chosen for its strategic location, which would allow the church to dominate the city and serve as a visible symbol of Catholicism.\n\n##Construction\n\nConstruction on the church began in 1875 and took nearly 40 years to complete. The architect, Paul Abadie, designed the church in a Roman-Byzantine style, inspired by the churches of Italy and the East. The church's foundation was built on a series of arches and vaults, which were designed to support the weight of the massive structure. The exterior of the church was built using a combination of stone and brick, with a distinctive white travertine limestone that gives the church its characteristic appearance.\n\n##Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the church as a symbol of the Catholic Church's attempt to reassert its authority over the city, and they resented the fact that the church was being built on a site that had previously been used for secular purposes. Additionally, the church's design was seen as too ostentatious and too expensive, particularly in a city that was still recovering from the devastation of the Franco-Prussian War.\n\n#Description\n\n##Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is dominated by its striking white domes, which are visible from all over the city. The church's facade is designed in a Roman-Byzantine style, with a large central arch and two smaller arches on either side. The exterior of the church is decorated with intricate stone carvings and ornate details, including a series of statues of saints and angels.\n\n##Interior\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is equally impressive, with a large central nave and two smaller side aisles. The church's interior is decorated with stunning mosaics and intricate stone carvings, including a large mosaic of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nThe largest and most impressive mosaic in the church is the \"Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\" which is located above the high altar. The mosaic depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus surrounded by angels and saints, and is made up of thousands of tiny pieces of glass and stone.\n\n###Chapels\n\nThe church has several chapels, each dedicated to a different aspect of Catholic worship. The chapels are decorated with intricate stone carvings and ornate details, including a series of statues of saints and angels.\n\n###Crypt\n\nThe church's crypt is located beneath the main altar and is dedicated to the relics of saints and martyrs. The crypt is decorated with simple stone carvings and ornate details, and is a place of quiet contemplation and prayer.\n\n##Art and decoration\n\n###Stained glass\n\nThe church's stained glass windows are among its most striking features, with intricate designs and vivid colors that filter the light and create a sense of wonder and awe.\n\n###Sculpture\n\nThe church's sculpture is equally impressive, with a series of statues of saints and angels that decorate the exterior and interior of the church.\n\n##Grand organ\n\nThe church's grand organ is one of its most famous features, with a stunning sound that fills the church and creates a sense of drama and spectacle.\n\n##Bells\n\nThe church's bells are equally impressive, with a series of large bells that ring out across the city and create a sense of joy and celebration.\n\n#Role in Catholicism\n\nSacré-Cœur plays an important role in Catholicism, as a symbol of the Catholic Church's presence and authority in Paris. The church is a popular pilgrimage site, with thousands of visitors each year who come to pray and worship at the church.\n\n#Access\n\nThe church is accessible by public transportation, with several bus and metro lines that stop nearby. Visitors can also walk to the church, which is a pleasant and scenic route that takes in many of the city's famous landmarks.\n\n#Copy in Martinique\n\nA copy of Sacré-Cœur was built in Martinique, a French island in the Caribbean, in the early 20th century. The copy is smaller than the original, but is equally impressive and is a popular tourist destination on the island.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of churches in Paris\n* Roman-Byzantine architecture\n* Catholic Church in France\n* Montmartre\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Bibliography (in French)\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sacré-Cœur,_Paris\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Proposal\n##Site\n##Construction\n##Controversy over the church\n#Description\n##Exterior\n##Interior\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n###Chapels\n###Crypt\n##Art and decoration\n###Stained glass\n###Sculpture\n##Grand organ\n##Bells\n#Role in Catholicism\n#Access\n#Copy in Martinique\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography (in French)\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Other sources have suggested that he may have been a former member of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to the Islamic State. Despite these speculations, the true identity of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi remains unknown.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and education\n\nVery little is known about the early life and education of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi. It is believed that he was born in Iraq, possibly in the city of Mosul, although some sources have suggested that he may have been born in Syria or another country in the region. There is no information available about his family or his upbringing, and it is not known whether he received any formal education.\n\n## Al-Qaeda and early career with the Islamic State\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi is believed to have joined al-Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to the Islamic State, in the early 2000s. At the time, al-Qaeda in Iraq was a relatively small organization, but it was gaining strength and momentum under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Al-Qurashi may have been involved in some of the organization's early operations, although it is not known what specific role he played.\n\nIn 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq was rebranded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi was appointed as the organization's leader. Al-Qurashi may have continued to work with the ISI, although it is not known whether he held any senior positions within the organization.\n\n## Rise to power\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi's rise to power within the Islamic State is not well documented, and it is not known exactly when he became a senior leader within the organization. However, it is believed that he was one of the organization's top commanders by the mid-2010s, and he may have played a key role in the organization's military campaigns in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn 2014, the Islamic State launched a surprise attack on Mosul, which led to the capture of the city and the declaration of a caliphate by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Al-Qurashi may have been involved in the planning and execution of this operation, although it is not known what specific role he played.\n\n## Leader of the Islamic State\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi became the leader of the Islamic State in October 2019, following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US military operation. At the time, the organization was facing significant challenges, including the loss of its territorial caliphate and the deaths of many of its senior leaders.\n\nDespite these challenges, al-Qurashi was able to maintain the organization's cohesion and momentum, and he may have played a key role in planning and executing several high-profile attacks in the region. However, his leadership was ultimately cut short when he was killed in a US military operation in February 2022.\n\n## Death\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was killed in a US military operation in Syria on February 3, 2022. The operation was carried out by US special forces, who raided a house in the town of Atme, near the Turkish border. Al-Qurashi and several other members of the Islamic State were killed in the operation, although it is not known whether he was the primary target.\n\n## Reactions to the raid\n\nThe reaction to the raid was mixed, with some critics arguing that the operation was a violation of Syrian sovereignty and others arguing that it was a necessary step to disrupt the Islamic State's operations. The Syrian government condemned the operation, although it is not known whether they had any advance knowledge of the raid.\n\n## Succession\n\nFollowing the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the Islamic State announced that Abu al-Hassan al-Hashimi al-Qurashi would succeed him as the organization's leader. However, it is not known whether al-Hassan has been able to maintain the organization's cohesion and momentum, and it is unclear what the future holds for the Islamic State.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the full complexity or nuance of the subject.

The film stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, with a supporting cast including Chris Pine, Gemma Chan, KiKi Layne, Nick Kroll, and Wilde herself. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 5, 2022, and was released in the United States on September 23, 2022.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film is set in the 1950s and follows Alice Chambers (Florence Pugh), a housewife who lives in the utopian community of Victory, California, with her husband Jack (Harry Styles). The community is home to the employees of the Victory Project, a mysterious company that promises its workers a perfect life in exchange for their loyalty and dedication. Alice begins to question the true nature of the Victory Project and the intentions of its charismatic leader, Frank (Chris Pine), as she starts to experience strange and unsettling events.\n\nAs Alice delves deeper into the mysteries of Victory, she becomes increasingly paranoid and isolated from her friends and family. Her relationship with Jack becomes strained, and she starts to suspect that he is hiding something from her. Meanwhile, Frank's true intentions are revealed, and Alice must make a choice between conforming to the expectations of the community or risking everything to uncover the truth.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Florence Pugh as Alice Chambers\n* Harry Styles as Jack Chambers\n* Chris Pine as Frank\n* Gemma Chan as Shelley\n* KiKi Layne as Margaret\n* Nick Kroll as Dean\n* Olivia Wilde as Bunny\n* Sydney Chandler as Bunny's daughter\n* Kate Berlant as Peg\n* Asif Ali as Peter\n* Douglas Smith as Bill\n* Timothy Simons as Dr. Collins\n* Ari'el Stachel as Ted\n* Dita von Teese as uncredited cameo\n\n#Production\n\n##Development and writing\n\nThe screenplay for Don't Worry Darling was written by Katie Silberman, based on a story by Carey and Shane Van Dyke. The story was inspired by the real-life utopian community of Levittown, Pennsylvania, which was built in the 1950s as a planned community for returning World War II veterans. Silberman was drawn to the idea of a perfect community that hides dark secrets, and she spent several years researching and developing the story.\n\nOlivia Wilde was approached to direct the film in 2019, and she was immediately drawn to the script. She saw parallels between the story and her own experiences as a woman in Hollywood, where she felt pressure to conform to certain expectations. Wilde worked closely with Silberman to develop the script and to bring her own vision to the film.\n\n##Casting\n\nFlorence Pugh was the first actor to be cast in the film, and she was followed by Harry Styles, who made his film debut in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk in 2017. Chris Pine was cast as the charismatic leader of the Victory Project, and Gemma Chan was cast as Shelley, a friend of Alice's who becomes increasingly suspicious of the community.\n\nKiKi Layne was cast as Margaret, a new arrival in the community who becomes fast friends with Alice. Nick Kroll was cast as Dean, a friend of Jack's who becomes increasingly hostile towards Alice. Olivia Wilde also appeared in the film, playing the role of Bunny, a friend of Alice's who seems to know more than she is letting on.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Don't Worry Darling began in October 2020, in Los Angeles, California. The film was shot on location in the desert town of Palm Springs, California, which was used to represent the utopian community of Victory.\n\nThe film was shot on 35mm film, using a combination of digital and practical effects to create the world of Victory. The production design was led by Katie Byron, who created a detailed and immersive world that reflected the themes of the film.\n\n##Alleged conflicts on set\n\nThere were reports of tensions on the set of Don't Worry Darling, with some crew members alleging that Olivia Wilde and Florence Pugh had clashed over the direction of the film. Wilde denied the rumors, stating that she and Pugh had a close and collaborative relationship.\n\n###Wilde and LaBeouf\n\nThere were also reports of tensions between Wilde and Harry Styles' co-star, Shia LaBeouf, who was originally cast in the film but left due to creative differences. Wilde stated that she had decided to re-cast the role, citing that LaBeouf's departure was amicable.\n\nHowever, LaBeouf later disputed this account, stating that he had been fired from the film. He also released a series of emails and text messages that appeared to show that he had been in communication with Wilde about his departure from the film.\n\n###Wilde and Pugh\n\nThere were also reports of tensions between Wilde and Florence Pugh, with some sources alleging that the two had clashed over the direction of the film. Wilde denied the rumors, stating that she and Pugh had a close and collaborative relationship.\n\nPugh also denied the rumors, stating that she and Wilde had a positive and supportive relationship. However, she did express some disappointment with the way that the film had been marketed, stating that she felt that the trailers had focused too much on the film's thriller elements and not enough on its themes and characters.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe marketing campaign for Don't Worry Darling was led by Warner Bros. Pictures, which released a series of trailers and posters for the film. The trailers focused on the film's thriller elements, showcasing the suspenseful and unsettling moments from the film.\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the marketing campaign had missed the mark, failing to capture the full complexity and nuance of the film. Florence Pugh expressed some disappointment with the marketing campaign, stating that she felt that it had focused too much on the film's thriller elements and not enough on its themes and characters.\n\n#Release\n\nDon't Worry Darling was released in the United States on September 23, 2022, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 5, 2022, where it received a standing ovation.\n\nThe film was released in over 3,000 theaters in the United States, and it grossed over $19 million in its opening weekend.

The film performed well in the United States, where it grossed over $45 million.\n\nHowever, the film underperformed in some international markets, where it grossed less than expected.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption to the region, particularly in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Mawar formed as a tropical depression on May 20, 2023, to the southwest of the Mariana Islands. The system slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on May 22. Over the next few days, Mawar rapidly strengthened, becoming a typhoon on May 24. The storm reached its peak intensity on May 26, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (257 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 920 mbar (27.17 inHg).\n\nMawar began to weaken on May 27 as it interacted with the island of Guam, causing the storm's circulation to become disrupted. The storm continued to move northwestward, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Northern Mariana Islands. Mawar eventually dissipated on May 31, to the north of the Mariana Islands.\n\n## Preparations\n\nAs Typhoon Mawar approached the Mariana Islands, preparations were made to minimize the impact of the storm.\n\n### Mariana Islands\n\nThe government of Guam declared a state of emergency on May 23, as the storm was forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the island. A typhoon warning was issued for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, with residents advised to prepare for the worst.\n\nThe Guam National Guard was activated to assist with preparations and response efforts. The Guam Power Authority worked to secure power lines and equipment, while the Guam Waterworks Authority took steps to protect the island's water supply.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn the Philippines, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency operations center to monitor the storm's progress. The Philippine Coast Guard prepared to respond to any emergencies that may arise.\n\nIn Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a high-seas warning for the storm, advising ships to take necessary precautions.\n\n# Impact and aftermath\n\nTyphoon Mawar caused significant damage and disruption to the Mariana Islands and other parts of the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n### Guam\n\nThe storm made landfall on Guam on May 26, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the island. The Guam Power Authority reported that over 10,000 households lost power, while the Guam Waterworks Authority reported that several water wells were affected.\n\nThe Guam National Guard was deployed to assist with response efforts, including clearing roads and distributing aid to affected residents.\n\n### Northern Mariana Islands\n\nThe storm brought heavy rain and strong winds to the Northern Mariana Islands, causing widespread damage and disruption. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands government reported that several homes were destroyed, while many more were damaged.\n\nThe CNMI government declared a state of emergency, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) providing assistance to the affected areas.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn the Philippines, the storm brought heavy rain to several provinces, causing flash flooding and landslides.

The election was scheduled to be held on July 21, 2022, to elect the President of India. The incumbent president, Ram Nath Kovind, was eligible for re-election, but chose not to seek another term.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe President of India is elected through an indirect election, where members of the Electoral College cast their votes to elect the President. The Electoral College consists of elected members of both the Houses of Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) and elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies. The election is held through a secret ballot, and the candidate with the majority of votes wins the election.\n\n# Election Schedule\n\nThe election was scheduled to be held on July 21, 2022. The schedule for the election was announced by the Election Commission of India on June 9, 2022. The counting of votes was held on July 21, 2022, and the results were declared on the same day.\n\n# Electoral College\n\nThe Electoral College for the 2022 presidential election consisted of:\n\n## Electoral College Member Strength\n\n* Elected members of the Lok Sabha: 543\n* Elected members of the Rajya Sabha: 233\n* Elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies: 4120\n\nTotal strength of the Electoral College: 4896\n\n## Electoral College Vote Value Composition\n\nThe vote value of each member of the Electoral College was determined by the population of the state they represented. The total population of the country was divided by the total number of elected members of the State Legislative Assemblies to determine the vote value of each member.\n\n# Party-wise Vote (Projection)\n\nBased on the party affiliations of the members of the Electoral College, the projected vote share of each party was:\n\n* National Democratic Alliance (NDA): 48%\n* United Opposition (India): 42%\n* Others: 10%\n\n# Candidates\n\nTwo candidates contested the election:\n\n## National Democratic Alliance\n\n* Droupadi Murmu: Member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), former Governor of Jharkhand\n\n## United Opposition (India)\n\n* Yashwant Sinha: Former Union Minister, former leader of the BJP, and former leader of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC)\n\n# Potential Candidates\n\nSeveral other individuals were considered as potential candidates, but did not ultimately contest the election.

Droupadi Murmu, the NDA candidate, was supported by the ruling BJP and its allies, while Yashwant Sinha, the United Opposition candidate, was supported by several opposition parties.\n\n# Controversy\n\nThe election was marred by controversy over the opposition's decision to field Yashwant Sinha as their candidate. Sinha had previously been a member of the BJP and had served as a Union Minister in the government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The opposition's decision to field Sinha as their candidate was seen as a move to attract support from the BJP and its allies.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the election were declared on July 21, 2022. Droupadi Murmu, the NDA candidate, won the election with a majority of votes.\n\n## Breakdown\n\nThe breakdown of the votes cast in the election was:\n\n* Droupadi Murmu (NDA): 2,824 votes (57.2%)\n* Yashwant Sinha (United Opposition): 1,877 votes (38.4%)\n* Invalid votes: 234 votes (4.4%)\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe results of the election were met with mixed reactions from across the country.

From its origins in the early Roman Republic to its eventual decline in the 5th century AD, slavery evolved and adapted, influencing the course of Roman history.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\n### Enslavement of Roman Citizens\n\nThe concept of slavery in ancient Rome was not unique to the city-state, as it was a common practice throughout the Mediterranean world. The earliest recorded instances of slavery in Rome date back to the 6th century BC, during the reign of King Servius Tullius. Initially, Roman citizens could be enslaved as a form of punishment for crimes, such as debt or military desertion. However, as the Roman Republic expanded, the enslavement of foreign captives became increasingly common.\n\nThe Slave in Roman Law and Society\n---------------------------------\n\n### Marriage and Family\n\nIn Roman society, slaves were considered property, not people. As such, they were not entitled to the same rights and protections as citizens. Slaves were not permitted to enter into legally recognized marriages, and their relationships were often subject to the whims of their owners. Slave families were frequently torn apart, as owners would often sell or transfer individual slaves to different households.\n\n### Peculium\n\nDespite the harsh realities of slavery, Roman law did provide some limited protections for slaves. The concept of peculium, or a slave's personal property, allowed slaves to accumulate small amounts of wealth, which they could use to purchase their freedom or improve their living conditions.\n\n### Manumission\n\nManumission, or the act of freeing a slave, was a relatively common practice in ancient Rome. Slaves could be freed through a variety of means, including their owner's will, a public ceremony, or even through the purchase of their own freedom using their peculium.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen, or former slaves who had been granted their freedom, occupied a unique position in Roman society. While they were no longer slaves, they were not yet considered full citizens. Freedmen were often required to provide services to their former owners, and their social status remained inferior to that of born citizens.\n\n### Dediticii\n\nDediticii were a class of slaves who had been captured in war and had surrendered unconditionally. As such, they were often subjected to harsher treatment and fewer protections under Roman law.\n\nCauses of Enslavement\n---------------------\n\n### War Captives\n\nOne of the primary sources of slaves in ancient Rome was war captives. Prisoners of war would often be sold into slavery, with the Roman state or individual soldiers profiting from the sale.\n\n#### Captivi in Roman Culture\n\nCaptives were often paraded in triumphal processions, where they would be displayed as symbols of Roman military prowess. The treatment of captives varied depending on the circumstances of their capture, with some being executed or sold into harsh conditions, while others might be ransomed or freed.\n\n### Piracy and Kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also significant sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Pirates would often target coastal towns and villages, capturing and selling their inhabitants into slavery.\n\n### Vernae\n\nVernae were slaves born within the household of a Roman family. These slaves were often treated relatively well, with some even holding positions of trust and authority within the household.\n\n#### Alumni\n\nAlumni were a type of slave who had been raised alongside the children of their owner's family. These slaves often formed close bonds with their owners and might be granted their freedom or inherit property.\n\n### Child Labor\n\nChild labor was a common practice in ancient Rome, with childre", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With Foo Fighters, Hawkins recorded several successful albums, including \"There Is Nothing Left to Lose\", \"One by One\", \"In Your Honor\", \"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\", \"Wasting Light\", \"Sonic Highways\", \"Concrete and Gold\", and \"Medicine at Midnight\". The band's music incorporated various styles, from grunge and punk to pop and classic rock.\n\n### Other Projects\n\nIn addition to his work with Foo Fighters, Hawkins pursued various side projects. In 2006, he released his debut solo album \"Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders\", which featured a more experimental sound than his work with Foo Fighters. He also collaborated with other musicians, including the Nighttime Boogie Association, NHC, and The Birds of Satan. In 2014, Hawkins released his second solo album \"The Birds of Satan\", and in 2019, he formed the band NHC with bassist Dave Navarro and guitarist Chris Chaney.\n\nInfluences\n------------\n\nHawkins' drumming style was influenced by a range of artists, including Ringo Starr, John Bonham, and Neil Peart. He was also inspired by the music of Queen, The Who, and The Police, which he often covered in his live performances. Hawkins' vocal style was influenced by his work with Alanis Morissette, as well as his collaborations with other musicians.\n\nEquipment\n----------\n\nHawkins was known for his distinctive drumming setup, which included a combination of Gretsch and DW drums, Zildjian cymbals, and a Pearl drum throne. He was also an endorser of several drumming companies, including Gretsch and Zildjian.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nHawkins was married to Alison Hawkins, and the couple had two children together. He was known for his charismatic personality and sense of humor, which he often showcased in interviews and live performances.\n\nDeath\n--------\n\nOn March 25, 2022, Foo Fighters announced that Hawkins had passed away at the age of 50, while the band was on tour in Bogotá, Colombia. The cause of death was later confirmed as a cardiac arrest, which was likely related to Hawkins' long-standing struggles with addiction.\n\n### Tribute Concerts\n\nFollowing Hawkins' death, Foo Fighters announced a series of tribute concerts in his honor, featuring a range of guest musicians. The first concert took place on September 3, 2022, at Wembley Stadium in London, and featured performances by Alanis Morissette, Travis Barker, and Dave Grohl, among others. A second concert was held on September 27, 2022, at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles, and featured appearances by Joan Jett, Miley Cyrus, and Mark Ronson.\n\nDiscography\n------------\n\n### Alanis Morissette\n\n* Jagged Little Pill (1995)\n* Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998)\n\n### Foo Fighters\n\n* The Colour and the Shape (1997)\n* There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999)\n* One by One (2002)\n* In Your Honor (2005)\n* Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace (2007)\n* Wasting Light (2011)\n* Sonic Highways (2014)\n* Concrete and Gold (2017)\n* Medicine at Midnight (2021)\n\n### Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders\n\n* Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders (2006)\n* Red Light Fever (2010)\n\n### Nighttime Boogie Association\n\n* Beautiful Thing (2011)\n\n### NHC\n\n* Intakes & Outtakes (2020)\n\n### The Birds of Satan\n\n* The Birds of Satan (2014)\n\n### Coheed and Cambria\n\n* Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow (2007)\n\n### Solo\n\n* Taylor Hawkins (2012)\n\n### Session Appearances\n\n* Eric Avery - How to Live with a Ghost (2000)\n* Brian May - Back to the Light (1992)\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal Links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Taylor_Hawkins\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Early career\n##Foo Fighters\n##Other projects\n#Influences\n#Equipment\n#Personal life\n#Death\n##Tribute concerts\n#Discography\n##Alanis Morissette\n##Foo Fighters\n##Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders\n##Nighttime Boogie Association\n##NHC\n##The Birds of Satan\n##Coheed and Cambria\n##Solo\n##Session appearances\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Reindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, thick coats, and unique adaptations that enable them to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments on Earth.\n\n# Description\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer with a sturdy build and a distinctive appearance. They have a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in the cold Arctic climate, as well as a set of impressive antlers that are grown by both males and females. Reindeer are also known for their unique hooves, which are specially adapted to help them grip the snow and ice.\n\n# Status\n\nReindeer are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, due to a range of threats including habitat loss, climate change, and hunting. However, conservation efforts are underway to protect the reindeer and its habitats, and the species is still widely distributed across the Arctic and subarctic regions.\n\n# Naming\n\nThe name \"reindeer\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"hreinn\", which means \"deer\". The name \"caribou\" is derived from the Mi'kmaq word \"kalibu\", which means \"shoveler\" or \"scraper\". Both names are used to refer to the same species, although \"reindeer\" is more commonly used in Eurasia, while \"caribou\" is more commonly used in North America.\n\n# Evolution\n\nReindeer are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species during the Pleistocene era. The exact timing and location of the reindeer's evolution is still a matter of debate among scientists, but it is thought to have occurred in the northern parts of Europe and Asia.\n\n# Taxonomy\n\n## Naming and research on museum collections\n\nThe taxonomy of the reindeer has undergone significant revisions in recent years, as new research has shed light on the species' evolutionary history. The reindeer was previously considered to be a single species, but it is now recognized as a complex of several distinct species and subspecies.\n\n## Biological exploration expeditions\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have played a crucial role in the discovery and classification of reindeer species. These expeditions have enabled scientists to collect and study specimens from remote and inhospitable regions, and have helped to shed light on the species' distribution and ecology.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nRecent reclassification efforts have recognized several distinct species and subspecies of reindeer, including the Svalbard reindeer, the Arctic reindeer, and the boreal woodland caribou. These reclassifications have been based on a range of factors, including genetic, morphological, and behavioral differences.\n\n### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer are also recognized as having several distinct ecotypes, which are adapted to different environments and habitats. These ecotypes include the tundra reindeer, the forest reindeer, and the mountain reindeer, each of which has unique adaptations to its environment.\n\n### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence has played a crucial role in the reclassification of the reindeer. This evidence has helped to shed light on the species' evolutionary history, and has enabled scientists to identify distinct species and subspecies.\n\n### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent research has identified several novel genetics-based clades of reindeer, which are not recognized by traditional taxonomy. These clades include the \"clade A\" and \"clade B\" reindeer, which are found in different parts of the Arctic and subarctic regions.\n\n# Species and subspecies\n\nThere are several recognized species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (Arctic reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (Svalbard reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (Greenland caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus caribou (boreal woodland caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus pearyi (Peary caribou)\n\n# Physical characteristics\n\n## Antlers\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown by both males and females. The antlers are made of bone and are shed and regrown every year. The antlers are used for fighting, intimidation, and attracting mates.\n\n## Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in the cold Arctic climate. The pelt is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n\n## Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a unique heat exchange system that helps to conserve heat in cold temperatures. The system involves a network of blood vessels in the legs and nose that helps to recycle heat.\n\n## Hooves\n\nReindeer have specially adapted hooves that help them to grip the snow and ice. The hooves are made of a hard, keratin-based material and are shaped like a crescent moon.\n\n## Size\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer, with adults typically weighing between 100-200 kg (220-440 lbs).\n\n## Clicking sound\n\nReindeer are able to make a unique clicking sound with their hooves, which is used for communication and navigation.\n\n## Eyes\n\nReindeer have excellent eyesight and are able to see in low light conditions. They also have a reflective layer in the back of the eye called the tapetum lucidum, which helps to reflect light and improve visibility.\n\n# Biology and behaviors\n\n## Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer have a unique seasonal body composition that helps them to survive in the harsh Arctic climate. During the summer months, they build up a layer of fat reserves that helps to sustain them during the winter months.\n\n## Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer have a complex reproductive cycle that involves a range of behaviors and physiological changes. Males engage in a range of behaviors, including fighting and intimidation, to establish dominance and attract mates.\n\n## Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are highly social animals that live in large herds. They migrate over long distances in search of food and suitable habitats, and have a complex social structure that involves a range of dominance hierarchies and relationships.\n\n# Ecology\n\n## Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions, including northern Europe, Asia, and North America. They inhabit a range of habitats, including tundra, forests, and mountains.\n\n## Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores and feed on a range of plants, including lichens, mosses, and grasses. They are also able to digest cellulose, which allows them to feed on plant material that is toxic to other animals.\n\n## Predators\n\nReindeer have a range of predators, including wolves, bears, and wolverines. They are also vulnerable to human activities, such as hunting and habitat destruction.\n\n## Other threats\n\nReindeer are also threatened by a range of other factors, including climate change, disease, and parasites.\n\n# Conservation\n\n## Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, due to a range of threats including habitat loss, climate change, and hunting.\n\n## Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of North America. It is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n## Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of North America. It is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n# Relationship with humans\n\n## Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and traditions of indigenous North Americans for thousands of years. They are an important source of food, clothing, and other essential resources.\n\n## Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and traditions of indigenous Eurasians for thousands of years. They are an important source of food, clothing, and other essential resources.\n\n## Husbandry\n\nReindeer have been domesticated and are used for husbandry purposes, including milk production, meat production, and hide production.\n\n## History\n\nReindeer have a long and complex history, with evidence of human-reindeer interactions dating back thousands of years.\n\n## Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are also associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to use reindeer to pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n## Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have appeared in mythology and art throughout history, including in the mythology of indigenous North Americans and Eurasians.\n\n## Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer have also been used as symbols and heraldic devices, including in the coats of arms of several countries and organizations.\n\n# See also\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer husbandry\n* Reindeer herding\n* Arctic reindeer\n* Svalbard reindeer\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of the reindeer and its biology, ecology, and relationship with humans.\n* Further research is needed to fully understand the complexities of the reindeer and its place in the natural world.\n\n# References\n\n* This article does not include citations or references.

The cyclone's unusual trajectory and persistence set multiple records, making it one of the most significant weather events of the year. This article provides a detailed account of the meteorological history of Cyclone Freddy, from its formation to its dissipation.\n\n# Formation and intensification\n\n## Genesis and early development\n\nCyclone Freddy formed on February 4, 2023, as a tropical low-pressure system over the warm waters of the South-West Indian Ocean, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) east of the Mascarene Islands. The system developed in an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, conducive to tropical cyclogenesis. Initially, the system strengthened slowly, with sustained winds of 45 km/h (28 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 1,005 hPa (29.68 inHg).\n\n## Rapid intensification\n\nOn February 5, Freddy began to rapidly intensify, with sustained winds increasing by 55 km/h (34 mph) in just 24 hours. The cyclone's central pressure dropped to 960 hPa (28.35 inHg), and its eye became visible on satellite imagery. Freddy's intensification was fueled by the warm ocean waters and a favorable atmospheric environment, characterized by low wind shear and high moisture content.\n\n## Peak intensity\n\nCyclone Freddy reached its peak intensity on February 7, with sustained winds of 215 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 931 hPa (27.49 inHg). At this stage, Freddy was a Category 4-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The cyclone's eye was well-defined, with a diameter of approximately 30 km (19 miles).\n\n# The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n\n## Passage of the Mascarene Islands\n\nOn February 8, Cyclone Freddy passed close to the Mascarene Islands, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the islands of Mauritius and Réunion. The cyclone's outer rain bands caused significant disruptions to daily life, with widespread power outages and flooding reported.\n\n## Impact on Madagascar\n\nFreddy made landfall in Madagascar on February 10, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the eastern coast of the island nation. The cyclone caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The storm surge also caused coastal flooding and erosion, particularly in the coastal towns of Toamasina and Mahajanga.\n\n## Mozambique\n\nAfter passing through Madagascar, Freddy re-entered the South-West Indian Ocean and began to move southwards towards Mozambique. On February 14, the cyclone made landfall in Mozambique, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the coastal provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado. The cyclone caused significant damage to infrastructure and agriculture, particularly in the city of Nampula.\n\n# Redevelopment and dissipation\n\n## Re-intensification\n\nAfter making landfall in Mozambique, Freddy began to re-intensify over the warm waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. The cyclone's sustained winds increased to 185 km/h (115 mph), and its central pressure dropped to 955 hPa (28.20 inHg).\n\n## Final landfall and dissipation\n\nOn February 17, Freddy made its final landfall in Mozambique, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the coastal provinces of Inhambane and Gaza. The cyclone rapidly weakened over land, with its sustained winds decreasing to 65 km/h (40 mph) by February 18. Freddy dissipated on February 19, over the eastern part of South Africa.\n\n# Records\n\n## Longest-lived tropical cyclone\n\nCyclone Freddy holds the record for the longest-lived tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean, with a lifespan of 37 days. The cyclone's prolonged trajectory was due to its unusual movement, which included a rare reversal of direction.\n\n## Most intense tropical cyclone in February\n\nFreddy was the most intense tropical cyclone to occur in February in the South-West Indian Ocean, with a peak intensity of 215 km/h (134 mph).\n\n## Highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)\n\nCyclone Freddy holds the record for the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the South-West Indian Ocean, with a total ACE of 73.2.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of South-West Indian Ocean cyclone seasons\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* Meteorological history of Cyclone Idai\n* Meteorological history of Cyclone Kenneth\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Meteorological_history_of_Cyclone_Freddy\" following this outline:\n\n#Formation and intensification\n#The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n#Redevelopment and dissipation\n#Records\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. It is a self-described spiritual movement that aims to help individuals understand themselves and the world around them. Scientology is often classified as a new religious movement, but its status as a religion is disputed by some governments and scholars.\n\nDefinition and Classification\n-----------------------------\n\n### Debates over Classification\n\nScientology's classification as a religion or a cult is a matter of ongoing debate. Some scholars and governments recognize it as a religion, while others view it as a cult or a business. In the United States, Scientology is recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization, but in other countries, such as Germany and France, it is considered a cult or a business.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" was coined by Hubbard in 1954, combining the Latin word \"scientia,\" meaning knowledge, and the Greek word \"logos,\" meaning study or discourse. Hubbard defined Scientology as \"the study and handling of the spirit in relation to itself, to others, and to all of life.\"\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nScientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s, based on his earlier self-help system, Dianetics. Hubbard, a science fiction author, published \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" in 1950, which introduced the concept of the \"reactive mind\" and the \"auditing\" process. In the following years, Hubbard expanded on his ideas, introducing the concept of the \"thetan\" and the \" Operating Thetan\" levels.\n\nBeliefs and Practices\n---------------------\n\n### Auditing\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology, in which a trained auditor uses an E-meter to help the individual, known as the \"preclear,\" overcome past traumas and negative experiences. The goal of auditing is to free the individual from the \"reactive mind\" and achieve spiritual enlightenment.\n\n### Soul\n\nIn Scientology, the soul is known as the \"thetan,\" a spiritual being that is immortal and has lived many past lives. The thetan is considered to be the true self, separate from the physical body and the mind.\n\n### Space Opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nScientology's teachings include a complex cosmology, known as the \"space opera,\" which describes the history of the universe and the thetan's role in it. According to Hubbard, thetans were once powerful beings who were imprisoned on Earth by an evil alien ruler, Xenu. The \"Wall of Fire\" is a central concept in Scientology, referring to the traumatic experience of being exposed to the \"reactive mind\" and the \"engram\" that occurred 75 million years ago.\n\n### The Operating Thetan Levels\n\nThe Operating Thetan (OT) levels are a series of advanced spiritual levels that individuals can achieve through auditing and training. There are eight OT levels, each representing a higher level of spiritual awareness and ability.\n\n### Ethics\n\nScientology's ethics system is based on the idea that individuals are responsible for their own actions and must take responsibility for their mistakes. The \"ethics conditions\" are a set of formulas that individuals can use to improve their behavior and achieve spiritual progress.\n\n### Symbology\n\nScientology uses a range of symbols, including the eight-pointed cross, the Scientology logo, and the E-meter. These symbols are considered to be sacred and are used in auditing and other spiritual practices.\n\n### Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychosis\n\nScientology is critical of psychiatry and psychology, viewing them as unscientific and ineffective. Hubbard believed that mental illness was caused by past traumas and negative experiences, rather than by chemical imbalances or genetic factors.\n\n### Views on Hubbard\n\nHubbard is revered by Scientologists as a spiritual leader and a genius. His writings and teachings are considered to be sacred and are studied by Scientologists around the world.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\n-------------------------\n\n### Internal Organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology is a hierarchical organization, with a complex system of offices and departments. The church is led by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), which is responsible for the spiritual and administrative direction of the church.\n\n### Promotional Material\n\nScientology uses a range of promotional materials, including books, videos, and online advertising. The church also has a number of celebrity endorsements, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\n### Social Outreach\n\nScientology has a number of social outreach programs, including the Volunteer Ministers and the Narconon drug rehabilitation program. These programs aim to help individuals and communities around the world.\n\n### Responses to Opponents\n\nScientology has been criticized by a number of individuals and organizations, including former members, journalists, and human rights groups. The church has responded to these criticisms with a range of tactics, including lawsuits, intimidation, and counter-attacks.\n\n### Suppressive Persons and Fair Game\n\nScientology has a policy of labeling critics and opponents as \"suppressive persons\" and using a tactic known as \"fair game\" to attack and discredit them. This policy has been widely criticized as a form of harassment and intimidation.\n\nFree Zone and Independent Scientology\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe Free Zone is a network of independent Scientology groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside of the official church. These groups often have their own interpretations of Scientology teachings and practices.\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\n### Hubbard's Motives\n\nHubbard's motives for creating Scientology have been questioned by some critics, who view him as a manipulative and power-hungry individual.\n\n### Criminal Behavior\n\nScientology has been involved in a number of criminal scandals, including the Operation Snow White case, in which church members infiltrated government agencies and stole confidential documents.\n\n### Organized Harassment\n\nScientology has been accused of organized harassment and intimidation of critics and opponents, including former members, journalists, and human rights groups.\n\n### Mistreatment of Members\n\nThere have been numerous allegations of mistreatment of members, including physical and emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and forced labor.\n\n### Violation of Auditing Confidentiality\n\nThere have been allegations that Scientology has violated the confidentiality of auditing sessions, using the information to intimidate and control members.\n\n### Allegations of Coerced Abortions\n\nThere have been allegations that Scientology has coerced women into having abortions, particularly", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scientology\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and classification\n##Debates over classification\n##Etymology\n#History\n#Beliefs and practices\n##Auditing\n##Soul\n##Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n##The Operating Thetan levels\n##Ethics\n##Symbology\n##Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n##Views on Hubbard\n#The Church of Scientology\n##Internal organization\n##Promotional material\n##Social outreach\n##Responses to opponents\n##Suppressive persons and fair game\n#Free Zone and independent Scientology\n#Controversies\n##Hubbard's motives\n##Criminal behavior\n##Organized harassment\n###Mistreatment of Members\n##Violation of auditing confidentiality\n##Allegations of coerced abortions\n##Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n##Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n#Disputes over legal status\n#Scientology in religious studies\n##Influences\n#Demographics\n##Recruitment\n#Reception and influence\n##Media, popular culture, and academia\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born into a Jewish family in Romania, Benvenisti would go on to become a prominent figure in both the Zionist and communist movements, advocating for the rights of Jews and the working class.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and career\n\nMișu Benvenisti was born in 1902 in Bucharest, Romania, to a Jewish family. Growing up in a predominantly Christian country, Benvenisti was exposed to antisemitism from a young age, which would later shape his activism. After completing his secondary education, Benvenisti went on to study law at the University of Bucharest. It was during his time at university that he became involved in the Zionist movement, advocating for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\n## Fighting antisemitism\n\nBenvenisti's early activism focused on combating antisemitism in Romania. He was a vocal critic of the country's antisemitic laws and policies, which restricted the rights of Jews and perpetuated discriminatory practices. In the 1920s, Benvenisti joined the Jewish Community of Bucharest, where he worked to promote Jewish rights and challenge antisemitic attitudes.\n\n## Against Richter\n\nOne of Benvenisti's most notable campaigns was against the Romanian politician, Eugen Richter. Richter was a prominent antisemite who advocated for the expulsion of Jews from Romania. Benvenisti was a vocal critic of Richter, challenging his views and advocating for the rights of Jews. The two men clashed publicly on several occasions, with Benvenisti accusing Richter of inciting violence against Jews.\n\n## HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n\nIn 1926, Benvenisti was involved in the HeHalutz trial, a highly publicized case in which a group of Jewish activists were accused of plotting against the Romanian state. Benvenisti, who was a key witness in the trial, was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism. Despite his efforts to clear the names of the accused, the trial ultimately ended in conviction, and Benvenisti was left feeling disillusioned and marginalized.\n\n## Communist turn\n\nIn the aftermath of the HeHalutz trial, Benvenisti began to shift his focus towards communism. He was attracted to the ideology's emphasis on social justice and equality, and saw it as a means of challenging the existing power structures in Romania. Benvenisti joined the Romanian Communist Party, where he quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent figure in the party's leadership.\n\n## Zionist ban\n\nHowever, Benvenisti's involvement with communism ultimately led to his ban from the Zionist movement. In 1930, the Zionist Organization of Romania expelled Benvenisti, citing his communist affiliations as incompatible with Zionist values. The ban marked a significant turning point in Benvenisti's life, as he was forced to choose between his loyalty to the Zionist movement and his commitment to communism.\n\n## Communist imprisonment and release\n\nIn 1933, Benvenisti was arrested by the Romanian authorities and charged with communist activities. He was imprisoned for several years, during which time he continued to advocate for communist ideals. Benvenisti was eventually released from prison in 1937, after which he resumed his activism, albeit in a more subdued manner.\n\n# Notes\n\nMișu Benvenisti's life was marked by controversy and activism, as he navigated the complex and often treacherous landscape of Romanian politics. Through his advocacy for Jewish rights and his involvement in the Zionist and communist movements, Benvenisti left a lasting impact on the country's history.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mișu_Benvenisti\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and career\n##Fighting antisemitism\n##Against Richter\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n##Communist turn\n##Zionist ban\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
