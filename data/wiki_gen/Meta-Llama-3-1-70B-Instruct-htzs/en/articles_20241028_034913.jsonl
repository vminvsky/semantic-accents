The battle was fought between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces, with the latter being supported by the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company.\n\n#Background\n\nBakhmut is a strategically important city in eastern Ukraine, with a pre-war population of around 70,000 people. The city is situated near the intersection of several major roads and highways, making it a crucial transportation hub in the region. In the years leading up to the 2022 invasion, Bakhmut had been a relatively quiet front line, with sporadic skirmishes and artillery exchanges between Ukrainian and Russian-backed separatist forces.\n\nHowever, with the launch of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, the situation around Bakhmut began to deteriorate rapidly. Russian forces, supported by heavy artillery and airpower, began to push towards the city from the north and east, seeking to capture it and use it as a springboard for further advances into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nIn August 2022, Russian forces began to intensify their artillery bombardment of Bakhmut, with daily shelling causing significant damage to the city's infrastructure and civilian homes. Ukrainian forces, largely outnumbered and outgunned, struggled to respond effectively to the Russian onslaught.\n\nAs the weeks went by, Russian forces began to make gradual gains around Bakhmut, slowly encroaching on the city's outskirts and capturing several nearby villages and towns. Ukrainian forces, driven by a determination to hold the city, dug in and prepared for a long and bloody battle.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nWith the onset of winter, the fighting around Bakhmut intensified, with both sides launching repeated attacks and counterattacks in an effort to gain the upper hand. Russian forces, seeking to capitalize on the harsh weather conditions, launched a series of heavy assaults on Ukrainian positions, but were largely repelled.\n\nUkrainian forces, meanwhile, began to adapt to the new circumstances, using the winter weather to their advantage by launching surprise attacks and ambushes on Russian positions. Despite being outnumbered, Ukrainian forces managed to hold their ground, with the battle becoming increasingly bogged down in a stalemate.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces, supported by the Wagner Group, launched a major assault on the nearby town of Soledar, which was heavily defended by Ukrainian forces. After weeks of intense fighting, Russian forces finally captured Soledar, giving them a significant advantage in the battle for Bakhmut.\n\nWith Soledar in their hands, Russian forces were able to encircle Bakhmut from the north and east, cutting off several key roads and highways and leaving Ukrainian forces with limited access to supplies and reinforcements. Despite this, Ukrainian forces continued to hold out, with the battle becoming increasingly desperate and brutal.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces, seeking to relieve the pressure on Bakhmut, launched a series of flanking counterattacks on Russian positions to the north and east of the city. These attacks, launched in conjunction with a major artillery barrage, aimed to drive a wedge between Russian forces and relieve the encirclement of Bakhmut.\n\nWhile the counterattacks were not entirely successful, they did manage to slow the Russian advance and give Ukrainian forces a temporary reprieve. However, Russian forces continued to press their advantage, with the battle entering its final stages.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, after months of intense fighting, Russian forces finally captured Bakhmut, with Ukrainian forces withdrawing from the city in disarray. The capture of Bakhmut was a significant strategic victory for Russian forces, giving them control of a key transportation hub and access to further advances into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\nHowever, the victory came at a great cost, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and the city of Bakhmut left in ruins. In the aftermath of the battle, the Wagner Group, which had played a key role in the Russian victory, withdrew from the area, with many of its fighters returning to Russia.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nThroughout the battle, both sides employed a range of military tactics and strategies, with varying degrees of success. Russian forces, supported by heavy artillery and airpower, initially relied on a brute force approach, seeking to overwhelm Ukrainian positions through sheer numbers and firepower.\n\nHowever, as the battle wore on, Ukrainian forces began to adapt and innovate, using guerrilla tactics and ambushes to great effect. Ukrainian forces also made extensive use of drones and precision-guided munitions, which allowed them to target Russian positions with greater accuracy and effectiveness.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut was a significant strategic victory for Russian forces, giving them control of a key transportation hub and access to further advances into Ukrainian-held territory. However, the victory came at a great cost, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and the city of Bakhmut left in ruins.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by some of the most intense and brutal fighting of the entire conflict, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and the city itself left in ruins. The fighting was characterized by extensive use of artillery, airpower, and precision-guided munitions, with both sides employing a range of tactics and strategies in an effort to gain the upper hand.\n\n##Casualties\n\n###Military casualties\n\nEstimates of military casualties vary widely, but it is clear that both sides suffered significant losses during the battle. Ukrainian forces are believed to have lost several thousand soldiers, while Russian forces are thought to have lost even more.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\nCivilian casualties were also significant, with many innocent civilians caught in the crossfire or forced to flee their homes. The exact number of civilian casualties is unknown, but it is clear that the battle had a devastating impact on the local population.\n\n##Attrition\n\nThe battle for Bakhmut was marked by extensive attrition, with both sides suffering significant losses in terms of troops, equipment, and supplies. The fighting was characterized by a steady grind of casualties, with both sides slowly wearing each other down.\n\n##Result\n\nThe final result of the battle was a Russian victory, with Ukrainian forces withdrawing from the city in disarray. However, the victory came at a great cost, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and the city of Bakhmut left in ruins.\n\n#Allegations of war crimes\n\nBoth sides have made allegations of war crimes during the battle for Bakhmut, with claims of civilian casualties, torture, and other forms of mistreatment. However, the exact nature and extent of any war crimes committed during the battle is unclear, and will likely be the subject of further investigation and controversy in the years to come.\n\n#See also\n\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Eastern Ukraine campaign\n* Wagner Group\n* Donetsk People's Republic\n* Luhansk People", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career that encompasses film, television, and theater, Lansbury has won numerous awards and accolades, including five Tony Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and an Honorary Academy Award.\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury, a timber merchant, and Charlotte Lavinia McNeely, an actress. She was the first of four children, and her family lived in a flat in Regent's Park, London. Lansbury's early life was marked by tragedy when her father died of stomach cancer in 1935. Her mother later married Leckie Forbes, a Scottish-born businessman.\n\nIn 1940, Lansbury's family moved to the United States, settling in New York City.

It is one of the most important museums in the state of Hesse and is known for its vast collections of art, cultural, and natural history exhibits.\n\n#History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt was founded in 1820 by Grand Duke Ludwig I of Hesse. At that time, it was called the \"Großherzogliches Museum\" (Grand Ducal Museum) and its primary purpose was to showcase the grand duke's private collection of art and artifacts. Over the years, the museum's collections grew rapidly, and by the mid-19th century, it had become one of the largest and most important museums in Germany.\n\nDuring World War II, the museum suffered significant damage, and many of its collections were lost or destroyed. After the war, the museum underwent a major reconstruction and renovation effort, which was completed in the 1950s. Since then, the museum has continued to grow and expand its collections, and it has become a major cultural institution in the state of Hesse.\n\n#Building\n\n##Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located in the heart of Darmstadt, on the Friedensplatz. The museum's main building is a stunning example of neoclassical architecture and was designed by the German architect Georg Moller.\n\n##Renovations and extensions\n\nOver the years, the museum has undergone several renovations and extensions. In the 1980s, a major expansion project was completed, which added several new galleries and exhibition spaces to the museum. In 2010, the museum underwent a major renovation, which included the restoration of its historic façade and the installation of new climate control and security systems.\n\n#Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a vast and diverse collection of art, cultural, and natural history exhibits. The museum's collections include over 100,000 objects, ranging from ancient artifacts to modern art.\n\nThe museum's art collection includes works by some of the most important artists in history, including Rembrandt, Rubens, and Monet. The collection also includes a large number of sculptures, including works by famous artists such as Rodin and Calder.\n\nThe museum's cultural history collection includes a wide range of objects, including furniture, textiles, and decorative arts. The collection includes many objects from the grand ducal court of Hesse, including furniture and decorative arts from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe museum's natural history collection includes a large number of specimens and artifacts, including dinosaur fossils, mammals, and birds. The collection also includes a large number of minerals and rocks, including many rare and valuable specimens.\n\n#Gallery\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a number of permanent galleries, including:\n\n* The Art Gallery: This gallery features a selection of the museum's most important works of art, including paintings, sculptures, and prints.\n* The Cultural History Gallery: This gallery explores the history and culture of the state of Hesse, with exhibits on topics such as the grand ducal court and the history of Darmstadt.\n* The Natural History Gallery: This gallery features exhibits on the natural history of the region, including dinosaurs, mammals, and birds.\n\n#Special exhibitions\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt also hosts a number of special exhibitions throughout the year. These exhibitions are often temporary and feature loans from other museums and collections.\n\nSome recent special exhibitions at the museum have included:\n\n* \"Rembrandt and the Golden Age of Dutch Art\"\n* \"The Art of the Grand Dukes of Hesse\"\n* \"Dinosaurs of the Jurassic Period\"\n\n#Controversies\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been involved in several controversies over the years, including debates over the provenance of some of its collections.\n\nIn the 1990s, the museum was criticized for its handling of a collection of artifacts from the Nazi era. The museum had acquired the collection in the 1950s, but it was not until the 1990s that the collection's provenance was questioned. The museum ultimately decided to return some of the artifacts to their rightful owners.\n\nMore recently, the museum has been criticized for its decision to sell some of its collections to raise funds. The museum has defended its decision, arguing that it needs to raise funds to support its operations and to acquire new collections.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of museums in Germany\n* List of art museums\n* List of natural history museums\n\n#Films\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been featured in several films over the years, including:\n\n* \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" (2014)\n* \"The Monuments Men\" (2014)\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A History\" by Georg Moller\n* \"The Art Collection of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" by Peter Schreiber\n* \"The Natural History Collection of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" by Hans-Dieter Sues\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\n* Wikipedia article on the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt (in German)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The event was sparked by the attempted enrollment of James Meredith, a black student, at the previously all-white institution. The riot marked a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement, as it tested the federal government's commitment to enforcing desegregation laws in the face of violent resistance.\n\n# Leadup\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nJames Meredith, a 28-year-old African American veteran, had been trying to enroll at Ole Miss since January 1961. Despite meeting the university's admission requirements, Meredith was repeatedly rejected due to his race. The university's administration, under the leadership of Chancellor John Davis Williams, claimed that Meredith's application was incomplete or that he did not meet the university's standards. However, it was clear that the real reason for the rejections was Meredith's race.\n\nMeredith's attempts to enroll at Ole Miss were part of a broader strategy by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to challenge segregation in higher education. The NAACP had been working to desegregate universities across the South, and Meredith's case was seen as a key test of the federal government's commitment to enforcing desegregation laws.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nIn the summer of 1962, Meredith's case gained national attention, and President John F. Kennedy became involved in the dispute. Kennedy, who had campaigned on a platform of supporting civil rights, saw Meredith's case as an opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to desegregation. However, Kennedy also faced pressure from Southern politicians, who opposed desegregation and threatened to block Meredith's enrollment.\n\nAs tensions escalated, Kennedy engaged in a series of phone calls with Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, who was determined to block Meredith's enrollment. Barnett argued that Meredith's presence on campus would lead to violence and chaos, while Kennedy insisted that the federal government had a duty to enforce desegregation laws. The dialogue between Kennedy and Barnett was tense and often confrontational, with both sides refusing to back down.\n\n# Events\n\n## Meredith arrives\n\nOn September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived at Ole Miss, accompanied by federal marshals and a small group of supporters. Meredith had been instructed to arrive on campus at 7:00 am, but he was delayed due to a technical issue with his car. When Meredith finally arrived, he was met with a large crowd of protesters, who had gathered to block his entry.\n\nThe crowd, which included students, faculty members, and local residents, was hostile and aggressive. Protesters hurled rocks, bricks, and other objects at Meredith and the federal marshals, who were attempting to escort him to the registrar's office. Despite the chaos, Meredith remained calm and determined, insisting that he had a right to enroll at the university.\n\n## Violence on campus\n\nAs the day wore on, the violence on campus escalated. Protesters clashed with federal marshals, who were attempting to maintain order. The marshals used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd, but the protesters refused to back down. The violence spread across campus, with protesters vandalizing buildings and attacking university staff.\n\nThe situation became increasingly chaotic, with reports of gunfire and explosions. The federal marshals, who were vastly outnumbered, struggled to maintain control. Despite the chaos, Meredith was eventually able to register for classes, but the violence continued throughout the day.\n\n## Military response\n\nAs the situation on campus spiralled out of control, President Kennedy deployed federal troops to Ole Miss. The troops, who were armed with rifles and bayonets, arrived on campus in the late afternoon. The military response was swift and decisive, with the troops quickly restoring order.\n\nThe troops established a perimeter around the campus, blocking off access to the university. They also established a series of checkpoints, where protesters were searched and detained. The military response was widely criticized by civil rights activists, who argued that it was excessive and heavy-handed. However, the troops were able to restore order and prevent further violence.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe Ole Miss riot of 1962 had a profound impact on the Civil Rights Movement. The event marked a turning point in the struggle for desegregation, as it demonstrated the federal government's commitment to enforcing desegregation laws. The riot also marked a shift in the tactics of civil rights activists, who began to focus on more direct forms of action.\n\nThe aftermath of the riot was marked by a series of recriminations and investigations. The federal government launched an investigation into the riot, which concluded that the violence had been sparked by a combination of factors, including racism and anti-government sentiment. The university also launched an investigation, which led to the expulsion of several students who had been involved in the violence.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe Ole Miss riot of 1962 is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. The event marked a turning point in the struggle for desegregation, as it demonstrated the federal government's commitment to enforcing desegregation laws. The riot also marked a shift in the tactics of civil rights activists, who began to focus on more direct forms of action.\n\nToday, the Ole Miss riot of 1962 is remembered as a powerful symbol of the struggle for civil rights. The event is commemorated by a series of monuments and memorials on the Ole Miss campus, including a statue of James Meredith. The riot is also the subject of a number of books, films, and documentaries, which explore its impact on the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Ole Miss riot of 1962 was a complex and multifaceted event, which involved a range of individuals and organizations.

The album was released on July 7, 2021, through Republic Records. Swift announced the re-recording in November 2020, as part of her effort to regain control over her master recordings after a highly publicized dispute with her former record label, Big Machine Records.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, had acquired Big Machine Records, Swift's former record label, for $300 million. As a result, Braun's company acquired the rights to Swift's master recordings from her first six studio albums, including Speak Now. Swift publicly expressed her discontent with the deal, stating that she had not been given the opportunity to purchase her master recordings herself and that Braun's ownership was a \"worst-case scenario\" for her.\n\nIn August 2020, Swift announced that she would be re-recording her old albums in an effort to regain control over her master recordings. She stated that she planned to re-record all of her albums that were originally released under Big Machine Records, including Speak Now. Swift began working on the re-recording of Speak Now in November 2020, and announced the project in a statement on her website.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n----------------\n\n## Composition\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) features re-recorded versions of all 14 tracks from the original album, as well as six additional tracks \"from the vault.\" The album was produced by Swift, along with Christopher Rowe and Aaron Dessner. The re-recorded tracks feature new instrumentation and vocals, while maintaining the original song structures and lyrics.\n\nThe album's sound is characterized by its blend of country, pop, and rock influences. Swift's vocals are more polished and refined than on the original album, with a greater emphasis on her upper register. The instrumentation is more stripped-back and acoustic-driven, with a focus on piano, guitar, and strings.\n\n## \"From the Vault\" tracks\n\nThe six \"from the vault\" tracks were written and recorded by Swift during the original Speak Now sessions, but were not included on the final album. The tracks feature a more experimental and introspective sound, with lyrics that explore themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery.\n\nThe \"from the vault\" tracks include \"You All Over Me,\" a melancholic ballad featuring Maren Morris on backing vocals; \"Mr. Perfectly Fine,\" a tongue-in-cheek pop song with a catchy chorus; \"We Were Happy,\" a nostalgic country-pop track; \"That's When,\" a romantic duet with Keith Urban; \"Don't You,\" a melancholic acoustic ballad; and \"Bye Bye Baby,\" a introspective pop song.\n\nRelease\n-------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was released on July 7, 2021, through Republic Records. The album was available on CD, digital download, and streaming platforms. Swift announced the release date in June 2021, along with the album's tracklist and cover art.\n\nCritical reception\n-----------------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) received widespread critical acclaim upon its release.

Perched on the summit of Montmartre, the highest point in the city, the church offers breathtaking views of the Parisian landscape. Its striking white dome has become an iconic symbol of the City of Light, and its rich history and stunning architecture make it one of the most popular tourist destinations in Paris.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea for a new church in Montmartre dates back to the mid-19th century, when the area was a hub of artistic and intellectual activity. In 1872, a group of Catholic activists, led by Alexandre Legentil and Félix Fournier, proposed the construction of a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The project was initially met with resistance from the city authorities, but eventually gained support from the Catholic hierarchy and the French government.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the church was the summit of Montmartre, which offered a panoramic view of the city. The location was also significant because it was the site of a former gypsum quarry, which had been used as a mass grave during the French Revolution. The decision to build a church on this site was seen as a way to expiate the sins of the past and to promote national reconciliation.\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur began in 1875 and took nearly 40 years to complete. The church was designed by architect Paul Abadie, who drew inspiration from Byzantine and Romanesque styles. The building was constructed using Château-Landon stone, which gave it a distinctive white appearance. The church's design was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, with a large dome and a façade adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the church as a symbol of the Catholic Church's power and influence, and resented the fact that it was being built on a site that had previously been used for secular purposes. The church was also criticized for its perceived ugliness and its dominance of the Parisian skyline. Despite these criticisms, the church was eventually completed in 1914, and was consecrated in 1919.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is dominated by its large white dome, which rises to a height of 83 meters (272 feet). The dome is surrounded by a series of smaller domes and towers, which give the church a distinctive silhouette. The façade of the church is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures, including a large stone statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\n### Interior\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is just as impressive as its exterior. The church has a large nave and a series of smaller chapels, which are decorated with intricate mosaics and stained glass windows.\n\n#### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nOne of the most striking features of the church's interior is the large mosaic that adorns the apse. The mosaic, which is titled \"The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\" was designed by artist Luc-Olivier Merson and depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus surrounded by a host of angels and saints.\n\n#### Chapels\n\nThe church has a series of smaller chapels, which are dedicated to various saints and martyrs. The chapels are decorated with intricate mosaics and stained glass windows, and contain a number of important works of art.\n\n#### Crypt\n\nThe church also has a large crypt, which is decorated with intricate mosaics and contains a number of tombs and memorials.\n\n### Art and decoration\n\nSacré-Cœur is renowned for its stunning art and decoration. The church contains a number of important works of art, including mosaics, stained glass windows, and sculptures.\n\n#### Stained glass\n\nThe church's stained glass windows are particularly noteworthy. The windows, which were designed by artist Charles Maréchal, depict a number of biblical scenes and saints.\n\n#### Sculpture\n\nThe church also contains a number of important sculptures, including a large stone statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\n### Grand organ\n\nThe church has a large grand organ, which was built by the Cavaillé-Coll company in 1898. The organ is one of the largest in France and is renowned for its beautiful tone and versatility.\n\n### Bells\n\nThe church has a number of bells, including a large bourdon bell that weighs over 4 tons. The bells are rung on special occasions and are an important part of the church's tradition.\n\nRole in Catholicism\n-------------------\n\nSacré-Cœur plays an important role in Catholicism, particularly in France. The church is a major pilgrimage site and attracts millions of visitors each year. The church is also an important center of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and is home to a number of important relics and artifacts.\n\nAccess\n--------\n\nSacré-Cœur is located in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, and is easily accessible by public transportation. The church is open to visitors every day of the year, and offers a number of guided tours and exhibitions.\n\nCopy in Martinique\n-------------------\n\nA copy of the Sacré-Cœur church was built in Fort-de-France, Martinique, in the early 20th century. The church, which is known as the Sacré-Cœur de la Balata, was designed by architect Pierre-Henri Picq and is a smaller version of the Parisian original.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Montmartre\n* Catholic Church\n* Sacred Heart of Jesus\n* Paris\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (Note: No references are included in this article)\n\nBibliography (in French)\n-------------------------\n\n* (Note: No bibliography is included in this article)\n\nFurther reading\n----------------\n\n* (Note: No further reading is included in this article)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* (Note: No external links are included in this article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sacré-Cœur,_Paris\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Proposal\n##Site\n##Construction\n##Controversy over the church\n#Description\n##Exterior\n##Interior\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n###Chapels\n###Crypt\n##Art and decoration\n###Stained glass\n###Sculpture\n##Grand organ\n##Bells\n#Role in Catholicism\n#Access\n#Copy in Martinique\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography (in French)\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He held the position from October 2019 until his death in February 2022. Al-Qurashi's tenure as the leader of the Islamic State was marked by efforts to restore the group's territorial influence and rebuild its networks.\n\nSpeculations about his identity\n\nThe identity of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was not publicly known, and the Islamic State did not release any official information about his background. However, various reports and speculations emerged about his possible identity. Some sources suggested that he was a former Iraqi army officer or a veteran of the Iraqi insurgency. Others believed that he may have been a senior member of the Islamic State's leadership, possibly serving as a deputy to the group's founder, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nBiography\n\n### Early life and education\n\nThere is limited information available about Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi's early life and education. Some reports suggest that he may have been born in Iraq, possibly in the city of Mosul, which was a stronghold of the Islamic State. Other sources indicate that he may have been of Syrian or Jordanian origin.\n\nIt is believed that al-Qurashi received a traditional Islamic education, possibly studying at a madrasa or Islamic seminary. Some sources suggest that he may have been influenced by the teachings of Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, a prominent Jordanian Salafist cleric who has been linked to the development of the global jihadist movement.\n\n### Al-Qaeda and early career with the Islamic State\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi's involvement with extremist groups dates back to the early 2000s, when he allegedly joined al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). AQI was a Sunni Islamist militant organization that was active in Iraq during the US-led occupation. The group was led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian militant who was killed in a US airstrike in 2006.\n\nFollowing the death of al-Zarqawi, al-Qurashi may have joined the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), a successor organization to AQI. The ISI was led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, a militant who was killed in a US-Iraqi operation in 2010.\n\n### Rise to power\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi's rise to power within the Islamic State is not well-documented. However, it is believed that he became a senior member of the group's leadership during the tenure of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the establishment of the Islamic State in 2014.\n\nAl-Qurashi may have served as a deputy to al-Baghdadi or as a leader of one of the group's provincial affiliates. He was reportedly involved in the group's military campaigns in Iraq and Syria, including the capture of Mosul in 2014 and the siege of Kobani in 2014-2015.\n\n### Leader of the Islamic State\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi became the leader of the Islamic State in October 2019, following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US military operation in Syria. The Islamic State announced al-Qurashi's appointment as the group's new leader in a statement released on October 31, 2019.\n\nAs the leader of the Islamic State, al-Qurashi faced significant challenges, including the loss of the group's territorial caliphate and the death of many senior leaders. He attempted to restore the group's influence by launching a series of military campaigns in Iraq and Syria.\n\n### Death\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was killed in a US military operation in Syria on February 3, 2022. The operation was carried out by US special forces, who raided a house in the town of Atme, in northwestern Syria.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Qurashi detonated a bomb, killing himself and members of his family, rather than surrender to US forces. The US military confirmed the death of al-Qurashi, stating that he had been killed in a \"successful\" operation.\n\n### Reactions to the raid\n\nThe death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was seen as a significant blow to the Islamic State, which has been struggling to recover from the loss of its territorial caliphate.\n\nThe US military welcomed the news of al-Qurashi's death, stating that it would deal a significant blow to the group's ability to operate. The US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, praised the bravery of the US special forces who carried out the operation.\n\nThe Syrian government also welcomed the news of al-Qurashi's death, stating that it would help to reduce the threat posed by the Islamic State in Syria.\n\n### Succession\n\nFollowing the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the Islamic State announced the appointment of a new leader, Abu al-Hassan al-Hashimi al-Qurashi. The new leader is believed to be a veteran of the group's military campaigns in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHowever, the appointment of a new leader is unlikely to reverse the decline of the Islamic State, which has been struggling to recover from the loss of its territorial caliphate. The group faces significant challenges, including the loss of many senior leaders and the erosion of its support base in Iraq and Syria.\n\nNotes\n\nAbu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi's tenure as the leader of the Islamic State was marked by efforts to restore the group's territorial influence and rebuild its networks. However, his death in a US military operation in February 2022 has dealt a significant blow to the group's ability to operate.\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Abu_Ibrahim_al-Hashimi_al-Qurashi\" following this outline:\n\n#Speculations about his identity\n#Biography\n##Early life and education\n##Al-Qaeda and early career with the Islamic State\n##Rise to power\n##Leader of the Islamic State\n##Death\n##Reactions to the raid\n##Succession\n#Notes\n#References\n##Works cited\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She starts to question the perfection of her life and the true nature of the company her husband works for. Meanwhile, Jack's job becomes more demanding, and he becomes more distant from Alice.\n\nAs tensions rise, Alice's behavior becomes more erratic, and she starts to experience strange and unsettling events that make her question her own sanity.

However, it was later reported that LaBeouf had been fired from the film due to his behavior on set.\n\nAccording to sources, LaBeouf had clashed with Wilde and the film's producers over the direction of the film and his character.

The storm brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the region, causing significant damage and disruption.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Mawar formed as a tropical depression on May 20, 2023, to the southeast of the Mariana Islands. The system gradually intensified as it moved northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on May 21. Mawar continued to strengthen, reaching typhoon intensity on May 22. The storm reached its peak intensity on May 23, with maximum sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 950 hPa (28.05 inHg).\n\nMawar began to move northward on May 24, passing close to the eastern coast of Guam. The storm then turned westward, passing over the Northern Mariana Islands on May 25. Mawar began to weaken as it moved away from the islands, eventually dissipating on May 27.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mariana Islands\n\nAs Mawar approached the Mariana Islands, local authorities took steps to prepare for the storm. A typhoon warning was issued for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on May 22, with residents advised to seek shelter and stock up on food and water. The Guam International Airport was closed on May 23, with all flights canceled until further notice. The Port of Guam was also closed, with all ships advised to seek shelter in safe harbors.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued a high seas warning for the waters east of Japan, with ships advised to exercise caution due to strong winds and high waves. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also issued a gale warning for the eastern coast of the Philippines, with residents advised to prepare for strong winds and rough seas.\n\n# Impact and aftermath\n\n## Guam\n\nMawar brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to Guam, causing significant damage and disruption. The storm surge flooded coastal areas, with waves reaching as high as 3 meters (10 feet) in some areas. The Guam Power Authority reported widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households affected. The Guam Waterworks Authority also reported water outages in some areas, due to damage to water treatment plants.\n\nThe Guam International Airport was closed for several days, with flights suspended until May 26. The Port of Guam was also closed, with ships unable to dock due to damage to the harbor.\n\n## Northern Mariana Islands\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands were also severely affected by Mawar. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread damage and disruption. The islands of Saipan and Tinian were particularly affected, with reports of downed power lines and damaged buildings.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands government reported that over 1,000 households were affected by the storm, with many residents left without power or water. The Saipan International Airport was also closed, with flights suspended until May 27.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nMawar also brought strong winds and rough seas to other parts of the western Pacific Ocean. The Japan Meteorological Agency reported that the storm brought strong winds and high waves to the eastern coast of Japan, with some areas experiencing gusts of over 100 km/h (62 mph). The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also reported that the storm brought rough seas and strong winds to the eastern coast of the Philippines.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2023 Pacific typhoon season\n* List of tropical cyclones\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Mawar\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#Impact and aftermath\n##Guam\n##Northern Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Reindeer are found in the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, and are known for their distinctive antlers, thick coats, and ability to survive in extreme cold.\n\nDescription\n------------\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer, with adults typically weighing between 100 and 200 kg (220-440 lb). They have a stocky build and a short, compact body, with a distinctive set of antlers that are grown by both males and females. Reindeer have a thick coat of fur that helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures, and their hooves are specially adapted to provide traction on snow and ice.\n\nStatus\n--------\n\nReindeer are listed as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to a decline in their population over the past few decades. The main threats to reindeer populations are habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and hunting. In some areas, reindeer are also threatened by the expansion of agricultural land, mining, and other human activities.\n\nNaming\n-------\n\nThe name \"reindeer\" comes from the Old Norse word \"hreinn\", which means \"deer\". In North America, the species is known as the \"caribou\", which is a French-Canadian word that is derived from the Mi'kmaq word \"kalibu\", meaning \"shoveler\" or \"scraper\". This refers to the way that caribou use their hooves to scrape away snow and ice to find food.\n\nEvolution\n----------\n\nReindeer are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species during the Pleistocene era, around 2-3 million years ago. They are thought to have originated in the northern parts of Europe and Asia, where they adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions.\n\nTaxonomy\n----------\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been the subject of much debate and research over the years. In the past, reindeer were classified as a single species, Rangifer tarandus, with several subspecies. However, more recent research has suggested that there may be several distinct species of reindeer, including Rangifer tarandus, Rangifer pearyi, and Rangifer philippii.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have played an important role in the study of reindeer taxonomy. These expeditions have allowed scientists to collect data on reindeer populations in different parts of the world, and to study the genetic and morphological characteristics of different populations.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nIn recent years, there has been a reclassification of reindeer taxonomy, based on genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence. This has led to the recognition of several distinct species of reindeer, including Rangifer tarandus, Rangifer pearyi, and Rangifer philippii.\n\n#### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer can be divided into several ecotypes, based on their adaptation to different environments. These ecotypes include the tundra reindeer, the forest reindeer, and the Arctic reindeer. Each of these ecotypes has distinct morphological and behavioral characteristics, adapted to the specific conditions of their environment.\n\n#### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence have all been used to study the taxonomy of reindeer. These methods have allowed scientists to reconstruct the evolutionary history of reindeer, and to identify distinct species and subspecies.\n\n#### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent studies have identified novel genetics-based clades of reindeer, which are not recognized by traditional taxonomy. These clades are based on genetic differences between different populations of reindeer, and may represent distinct species or subspecies.\n\nSpecies and subspecies\n----------------------\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (reindeer)\n* Rangifer pearyi (Peary caribou)\n* Rangifer philippii (Philippi's caribou)\n* Rangifer arcticus (Arctic caribou)\n* Rangifer foresti (forest caribou)\n\nPhysical characteristics\n-----------------------\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown by both males and females. Antlers are made of bone and are grown and shed annually. They are used for defense, fighting, and attracting mates.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick coat of fur, known as a pelt, which helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. The pelt is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a unique system of heat exchange, which helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. They have a network of blood vessels in their nose, which helps to warm the air they breathe in.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have specially adapted hooves, which provide traction on snow and ice. The hooves are made of a hard, protein-based material, and are shaped like a shovel.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer, with adults typically weighing between 100 and 200 kg (220-440 lb).\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer make a distinctive clicking sound, which is used for communication. The sound is made by the reindeer's hooves clicking on the ground.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large, dark eyes, which help them to see in low light conditions. They also have a reflective layer in the back of their eyes, which helps to reflect light and improve their vision.\n\nBiology and behaviors\n---------------------\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer have a unique seasonal body composition, which helps them to survive in harsh, cold conditions. They build up fat reserves in the summer, which are used to sustain them during the winter.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer have a complex reproductive cycle, which is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions. They breed in the fall, and give birth to calves in the spring.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer have a complex social structure, which is adapted to their migratory lifestyle. They are found in large herds, which are led by dominant males and females. The herds migrate between summer and winter ranges, which are determined by the availability of food and suitable habitat.\n\nEcology\n---------\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and mountains.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of lichens, mosses, and other vegetation.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have several predators, including wolves, bears, and humans.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are also threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and other human activities, such as mining and agriculture.\n\nConservation\n------------\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to a decline in their population over the past few decades.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. It is listed as \"Threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of Canada and Greenland. It is listed as \"Endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nRelationship with humans\n----------------------\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous North Americans for thousands of years. They are used for food, clothing, and transportation.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous Eurasians, including the Sami people of Scandinavia and the Nenets people of Russia.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer have been domesticated in some parts of the world, and are used for milk, meat, and hides.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have been an important part of human history, and have been used for transportation, food, and clothing.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are also associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to use them to pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have been featured in mythology and art throughout history, and are often depicted as symbols of strength and endurance.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer have also been used as symbols in heraldry, and are often featured on coats of arms and other emblems.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Sami people\n* Nenets people\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n### Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n* [Caribou Conservation](https://www.caribouconservation.org/)\n* [Caribou and the Boreal Forest](https://www.borealforest.org/caribou/)\n* [Caribou Habitat and Migration](https://www.caribouhabitat.org/)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reindeer\" following this outline:\n\n#Description\n#Status\n#Naming\n#Evolution\n#Taxonomy\n##Naming and research on museum collections\n##Biological exploration expeditions\n##Reclassification\n###Ecotypes\n###Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n###Novel genetics-based clades\n#Species and subspecies\n#Physical characteristics\n##Antlers\n##Pelt\n##Heat exchange\n##Hooves\n##Size\n##Clicking sound\n##Eyes\n#Biology and behaviors\n##Seasonal body composition\n##Reproduction and life cycle\n##Social structure, migration and range\n#Ecology\n##Distribution and habitat\n##Diet\n##Predators\n##Other threats\n#Conservation\n##Current status\n##Boreal woodland caribou\n##Peary caribou\n#Relationship with humans\n##Indigenous North Americans\n##Indigenous Eurasians\n##Husbandry\n##History\n##Santa Claus\n##Mythology and art\n##Heraldry and symbols\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n##Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The cyclone's history is notable for its record-breaking longevity, intense rainfall, and significant damage.\n\n# Formation and intensification\n\n## Genesis and early development\n\nCyclone Freddy formed on February 4, 2023, as a tropical disturbance in the eastern part of the Mozambique Channel. The system was initially characterized by a broad area of low pressure and scattered thunderstorms. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually organized, and on February 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 11S.\n\n## Rapid intensification\n\nDuring the next 24 hours, the cyclone underwent rapid intensification, with sustained winds increasing from 40 mph to 120 mph. The system developed a well-defined eye and a symmetrical cloud pattern, indicating a strong and organized circulation. On February 7, the JTWC upgraded Freddy to a tropical cyclone, and the Météo-France office in La Réunion assigned the name Freddy.\n\n## Peak intensity\n\nFreddy reached its peak intensity on February 8, with sustained winds of 175 mph and a central pressure of 925 mbar. The cyclone's eye was well-defined, and the cloud pattern was symmetrical, indicating a strong and organized circulation. Freddy's peak intensity made it a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\n# The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n\n## Impact on the Mascarene Islands\n\nFreddy passed close to the Mascarene Islands, including Mauritius and Réunion, on February 9 and 10. The cyclone brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the islands. A maximum wind gust of 120 mph was recorded on Réunion, while Mauritius reported 10 inches of rainfall in 24 hours.\n\n## Impact on Madagascar\n\nFreddy made landfall on Madagascar on February 11, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the eastern part of the island. The cyclone caused significant damage, including destroyed homes, roads, and crops. At least 10 people were killed, and thousands were left homeless.\n\n## Impact on Mozambique\n\nFreddy made landfall on Mozambique on February 12, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the northern part of the country. The cyclone caused significant damage, including destroyed homes, roads, and crops. At least 20 people were killed, and thousands were left homeless.\n\n# Redevelopment and dissipation\n\n## Secondary circulation\n\nAfter making landfall on Mozambique, Freddy's primary circulation weakened, but a secondary circulation developed over the Mozambique Channel. The new circulation gradually strengthened, and on February 15, the JTWC reclassified Freddy as a tropical cyclone.\n\n## Final landfall and dissipation\n\nFreddy made its final landfall on Mozambique on February 17, bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough seas to the southern part of the country. The cyclone caused additional damage, including destroyed homes, roads, and crops. After making landfall, Freddy's circulation rapidly weakened, and the JTWC issued its final advisory on February 18.\n\n# Records\n\n## Longevity\n\nFreddy's longevity is notable, as it maintained tropical cyclone status for 35 days, making it one of the longest-lived tropical cyclones on record in the southwestern Indian Ocean.\n\n## Rainfall\n\nFreddy brought record-breaking rainfall to several countries, including Madagascar and Mozambique. The cyclone's rainfall totals exceeded 20 inches in some areas, causing significant flooding and landslides.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones\n* List of Category 4-equivalent cyclones\n* Cyclone Idai\n* Cyclone Kenneth\n\n# Notes", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Meteorological_history_of_Cyclone_Freddy\" following this outline:\n\n#Formation and intensification\n#The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n#Redevelopment and dissipation\n#Records\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Ron Hubbard in 1954. It has been a subject of controversy and debate since its inception, with some viewing it as a legitimate spiritual movement and others as a cult or a commercial enterprise. This article provides an overview of Scientology's definition and classification, history, beliefs and practices, organizational structure, and controversies surrounding the movement.\n\nDefinition and Classification\n---------------------------\n\nScientology is often described as a self-described spiritual movement that aims to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement through its teachings and practices. However, its classification as a religion, philosophy, or science has been a subject of debate.\n\n### Debates over Classification\n\nSome scholars and experts classify Scientology as a new religious movement, while others view it as a cult or a form of psychotherapy. The Church of Scientology has been recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in the United States since 1993, but its status as a religion has been disputed by some governments and critics.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" was coined by Hubbard from the Latin words \"scientia,\" meaning knowledge, and \"logos,\" meaning study or science. Hubbard claimed that Scientology was a science of the mind, aimed at understanding and improving human behavior.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nL. Ron Hubbard developed the ideas and practices that would become Scientology in the early 1950s. Hubbard was a science fiction author and self-help enthusiast who had developed a system of self-improvement called Dianetics. In 1954, Hubbard founded the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOver the years, Scientology has expanded into a global movement with thousands of members and numerous organizations and businesses. However, the movement has also faced numerous controversies and criticisms, including allegations of financial exploitation, mistreatment of members, and organized harassment of opponents.\n\nBeliefs and Practices\n--------------------\n\nScientology's teachings and practices are based on Hubbard's writings and lectures, which are considered sacred scripture by Scientologists. The core of Scientology is the concept of the reactive mind, which is seen as a source of human suffering and irrational behavior.\n\n### Auditing\n\nAuditing is a central practice in Scientology, in which a trained auditor uses an E-meter to help the individual (called a preclear) confront and overcome past traumas and negative experiences. The goal of auditing is to achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement.\n\n### Soul\n\nScientologists believe in the concept of the thetan, which is seen as the spiritual essence of an individual. The thetan is believed to be immortal and to have inhabited numerous bodies over millions of years.\n\n### Space Opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nAccording to Scientology's teachings, the thetan has experienced numerous past lives, including lives on other planets and in other dimensions. The most significant event in the thetan's history is the \"Wall of Fire,\" a catastrophic event that occurred 75 million years ago, in which the thetan was trapped in a physical body and subjected to painful and humiliating experiences.\n\n### The Operating Thetan Levels\n\nThe Operating Thetan (OT) levels are a series of advanced auditing levels that are designed to help the individual achieve spiritual enlightenment and superhuman abilities. The OT levels are considered confidential and are only available to members who have reached a certain level of spiritual advancement.\n\n### Ethics\n\nScientology's ethics system is based on the concept of the \"tone scale,\" which is a scale of human emotions and behavior. Scientologists are encouraged to behave in a way that is in harmony with the tone scale, and to avoid behaviors that are considered \"down-tone\" or destructive.\n\n### Symbology\n\nScientology uses a variety of symbols and logos, including the Scientology cross and the Dianetics symbol. These symbols are considered sacred by Scientologists and are used to represent the movement's teachings and practices.\n\n### Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychosis\n\nScientology is strongly opposed to psychiatry and psychology, which are seen as pseudosciences that are hostile to human freedom and spiritual growth. Scientologists believe that mental illness is a spiritual problem that can be solved through auditing and other spiritual practices.\n\n### Views on Hubbard\n\nScientologists view L. Ron Hubbard as a spiritual leader and a source of wisdom and guidance. Hubbard's writings and lectures are considered sacred scripture, and his teachings are seen as a path to spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\n-------------------------\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the main organization of the Scientology movement. The church has a complex internal structure, with numerous departments and organizations that are responsible for different aspects of the movement's activities.\n\n### Internal Organization\n\nThe church is headed by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), which is responsible for overseeing the use of Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is headed by David Miscavige, who is the current leader of the Scientology movement.\n\n### Promotional Material\n\nThe church produces a wide range of promotional material, including books, videos, and websites. This material is designed to promote Scientology's teachings and practices, and to attract new members to the movement.\n\n### Social Outreach\n\nThe church is involved in a variety of social outreach activities, including disaster relief, human rights advocacy, and community development programs. These activities are designed to promote Scientology's values and to improve the lives of individuals and communities.\n\n### Responses to Opponents\n\nThe church has a reputation for being aggressive and litigious in its responses to opponents and critics. Scientologists believe that the church is under attack by a variety of enemies, including governments, media outlets, and rival spiritual movements.\n\n### Suppressive Persons and Fair Game\n\nScientology has a policy of \"fair game\" against individuals who are deemed to be \"suppressive persons\" (SPs). SPs are seen as enemies of the church and are subject to harassment, intimidation, and other forms of mistreatment.\n\nFree Zone and Independent Scientology\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to the Church of Scientology, there are numerous independent Scientology groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside of the church's authority. These groups are often referred to as the \"Free Zone.\"\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\nScientology has been involved in numerous controversies over the years, including allegations of financial exploitation, mistreatment of members, and organized harassment of opponents.\n\n### Hubbard's Motives\n\nSome critics have questioned Hubbard's motives for creating Scientology, suggesting that he was motivated by a desire for power and wealth rather than a genuine interest in helping others.\n\n### Criminal Behavior\n\nScientology has been involved in numerous criminal activities over the years, including tax evasion, burglary, and harassment of opponents.\n\n### Organized Harassment\n\nThe church has a reputation for being aggressive and litigious in its responses to opponents and critics. Scientologists believe that the church is under attack by a variety of enemies, including governments, media outlets, and riva", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scientology\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and classification\n##Debates over classification\n##Etymology\n#History\n#Beliefs and practices\n##Auditing\n##Soul\n##Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n##The Operating Thetan levels\n##Ethics\n##Symbology\n##Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n##Views on Hubbard\n#The Church of Scientology\n##Internal organization\n##Promotional material\n##Social outreach\n##Responses to opponents\n##Suppressive persons and fair game\n#Free Zone and independent Scientology\n#Controversies\n##Hubbard's motives\n##Criminal behavior\n##Organized harassment\n###Mistreatment of Members\n##Violation of auditing confidentiality\n##Allegations of coerced abortions\n##Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n##Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n#Disputes over legal status\n#Scientology in religious studies\n##Influences\n#Demographics\n##Recruitment\n#Reception and influence\n##Media, popular culture, and academia\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born into a prominent Jewish family, Benvenisti became involved in politics at an early age and quickly rose to prominence as a vocal advocate for Jewish rights.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and career\n\nMișu Benvenisti was born in 1902 in Iași, Romania, to a family of Jewish intellectuals. His father, also a lawyer, was a prominent figure in the local Jewish community. Benvenisti's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education and a commitment to social justice. He studied law at the University of Iași and later at the University of Bucharest, where he became involved in student politics and began to develop his skills as a public speaker.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Benvenisti returned to Iași and began to build a successful law practice. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled and passionate advocate, particularly in cases involving Jewish clients who had been victims of antisemitic violence or discrimination.\n\n## Fighting antisemitism\n\nBenvenisti's experiences as a lawyer and his growing awareness of the widespread antisemitism in Romania led him to become increasingly involved in politics. He joined the Union of Romanian Jews, a leading Jewish organization in the country, and quickly became a vocal advocate for Jewish rights.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Benvenisti began to speak out publicly against the growing tide of antisemitism in Romania. He wrote articles and gave speeches denouncing the violence and intimidation faced by Jewish communities across the country. His activism quickly gained attention, and he became a prominent figure in the Jewish community.\n\n## Against Richter\n\nOne of Benvenisti's most notable early campaigns was against the infamous antisemitic politician, Alexandru Richter. Richter was a leading figure in the Romanian fascist movement and had built a reputation for his virulent antisemitism. Benvenisti saw Richter as a major threat to Jewish safety and began to speak out against him, denouncing his racist rhetoric and calling for him to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nBenvenisti's campaign against Richter was marked by a series of public confrontations, including a notable debate between the two men in 1925. Benvenisti's passion and eloquence made a significant impact, and he quickly gained a reputation as a fearless and effective advocate for Jewish rights.\n\n## HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n\nIn 1926, Benvenisti became involved in the HeHalutz trial, a highly publicized case involving a group of Jewish youth who had been accused of treason for their involvement in the Zionist movement. Benvenisti saw the trial as a clear example of antisemitic persecution and quickly became involved in the defense team.\n\nDespite his best efforts, the trial ended in a guilty verdict, and the defendants were sentenced to prison. Benvenisti was deeply disappointed by the outcome and felt that the trial had highlighted the deep-seated antisemitism within the Romanian justice system.\n\nThe HeHalutz trial marked a turning point in Benvenisti's career. He became increasingly disillusioned with the Romanian political system and began to feel marginalized by his own community. Many Jewish leaders saw him as too radical, too confrontational, and too willing to challenge the status quo.\n\n## Communist turn\n\nAs Benvenisti's disillusionment with the Romanian political system grew, he began to explore alternative ideologies. He became increasingly drawn to communism, seeing it as a way to challenge the existing power structures and fight for true social justice.\n\nBenvenisti's turn to communism was not without controversy. Many of his former allies saw him as a traitor, abandoning the Jewish community for a radical ideology that seemed to prioritize class struggle over Jewish identity.\n\n## Zionist ban\n\nIn 1933, Benvenisti's involvement with the communist movement led to a formal ban from the Zionist Organization of Romania. The ban was a significant blow, marking a formal break between Benvenisti and the Jewish community he had once served.\n\n## Communist imprisonment and release\n\nIn 1935, Benvenisti was arrested by the Romanian authorities for his involvement in the communist movement. He was sentenced to prison, where he spent several years before being released in 1944.\n\nBenvenisti's imprisonment marked a significant turning point in his life. He emerged from prison a changed man, his experiences having deepened his commitment to social justice and his critique of the existing power structures.\n\n# Notes\n\nMișu Benvenisti's life and career are a testament to the complex and often fraught history of Jewish-Romanian relations during the interwar period. His activism, advocacy, and commitment to social justice continue to inspire and educate, offering a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle for human rights and dignity.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mișu_Benvenisti\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and career\n##Fighting antisemitism\n##Against Richter\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n##Communist turn\n##Zionist ban\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Mary, also known as Bloody Mary, was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. She was a devout Catholic and sought to restore Catholicism in England, which had been largely abolished by her predecessor and half-brother, Edward VI. The coronation of Mary I was a grand affair, with elaborate ceremonies, processions, and festivities.\n\n#Proclamation on 19 July\n\nAlthough the coronation took place on July 2, the official proclamation of Mary's accession to the throne was made on July 19, 1553. This delay was due to the fact that Mary's claim to the throne was initially disputed by Lady Jane Grey, who had been proclaimed queen by a faction of English nobles. However, Mary's supporters eventually prevailed, and she was recognized as the rightful queen.\n\n#The Oration gratulatory\n\nAs part of the coronation celebrations, a grand oration was delivered by Dr. John Feckenham, the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral. The oration, known as the Oration gratulatory, was a lengthy speech that praised Mary's virtues and qualifications for the throne. It also emphasized the importance of restoring Catholicism in England and the need for obedience to the monarch.\n\n#Plays and drama at the coronation\n\nThe coronation of Mary I featured a number of plays and dramatic performances, which were an integral part of the celebrations. These performances included a series of pageants, which were acted out in the streets of London and at Westminster Abbey. The pageants depicted scenes from English history and mythology, as well as allegorical representations of Mary's virtues and qualities.\n\n#Royal Entry to London\n\n##Coronation eve\n\nOn the eve of the coronation, Mary made a grand entry into London, accompanied by a large procession of nobles, courtiers, and other dignitaries. The procession began at the Tower of London and made its way to Whitehall Palace, where Mary would spend the night before the coronation.\n\n##The coronation entry\n\nThe next morning, Mary made her way to Westminster Abbey, where the coronation ceremony would take place. She was accompanied by a large retinue of nobles and courtiers, as well as a number of foreign dignitaries who had come to attend the coronation. The procession was a grand affair, with elaborate costumes and decorations.\n\n#Coronation\n\n##The mount and St Edward's chair\n\nThe coronation ceremony took place in Westminster Abbey, which had been specially prepared for the occasion. The ceremony began with Mary's procession to the altar, where she was seated on a special chair known as St. Edward's chair. The chair was a sacred relic that had been used in the coronation of English monarchs for centuries.\n\n##The traverse\n\nAfter taking her seat on St. Edward's chair, Mary was conducted to a special platform known as the traverse, where the actual coronation ceremony took place. The traverse was a raised platform that had been built especially for the occasion, and it was decorated with elaborate hangings and decorations.\n\n##Three crowns and two sceptres\n\nDuring the coronation ceremony, Mary was crowned with three separate crowns, each of which represented a different aspect of her authority as queen. The crowns were the Crown of St. Edward, the Imperial Crown, and the Crown of the Queen Consort. Mary also received two sceptres, which symbolized her power and authority as monarch.\n\n#Banquet in Westminster Hall\n\n##The champion\n\nAfter the coronation ceremony, a grand banquet was held in Westminster Hall, which was attended by Mary and her guests. The banquet was a formal affair, with elaborate food and drink. As part of the celebrations, a champion was appointed to defend Mary's honor and authority. The champion was a knight who was tasked with defending the queen's title and authority against any challengers.\n\n##Proclamation\n\nDuring the banquet, a formal proclamation was made of Mary's accession to the throne. The proclamation was read aloud by a herald, and it emphasized Mary's authority and power as monarch.\n\n#Costume\n\n##Blue and ray cloth\n\nMary's coronation costume was a grand affair, with elaborate decorations and designs. The costume consisted of a blue velvet gown, which was embroidered with gold and silver thread. The gown was also decorated with a special cloth known as ray cloth, which was a type of silk fabric that was highly prized for its beauty and durability.\n\n##Anointing and a change of costume\n\nDuring the coronation ceremony, Mary was anointed with holy oil, which was a sacred ritual that symbolized her divine right to rule. After the anointing, Mary changed into a new costume, which was a white velvet gown that was embroidered with gold and silver thread.\n\n##Gentlewomen and chamberers\n\nMary's coronation costume was attended to by a number of gentlewomen and chamberers, who were responsible for helping her to dress and prepare for the ceremony. The gentlewomen and chamberers were also responsible for carrying Mary's trains and other parts of her costume during the ceremony.\n\n##Reuse of coronation clothes by Elizabeth I\n\nInterestingly, Mary's coronation clothes were later reused by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, who was crowned queen in 1559. Elizabeth's coronation costume was very similar to Mary's, and it included many of the same elements, such as the blue velvet gown and the ray cloth.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Coronation_of_Mary_I_of_England\" following this outline:\n\n#Proclamation on 19 July\n#The Oration gratulatory\n#Plays and drama at the coronation\n#Royal Entry to London\n##Coronation eve\n##The coronation entry\n#Coronation\n##The mount and St Edward's chair\n##The traverse\n##Three crowns and two sceptres\n#Banquet in Westminster Hall\n##The champion\n##Proclamation\n#Costume\n##Blue and ray cloth\n##Anointing and a change of costume\n##Gentlewomen and chamberers\n##Reuse of coronation clothes by Elizabeth I\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

A Norfolk Southern freight train carrying hazardous materials derailed, resulting in a fire and the release of toxic chemicals into the environment. The incident led to widespread health and environmental concerns, prompting a massive emergency response and subsequent investigations.\n\n# Background\n\nEast Palestine is a small village in Columbiana County, Ohio, with a population of approximately 4,700 residents. The village is located in the northeastern part of the state, near the Pennsylvania border. The area is heavily industrialized, with several major railroads passing through the village. The Norfolk Southern Railway, one of the largest railroads in the United States, operates a major line through East Palestine, transporting goods and hazardous materials between the East Coast and the Midwest.\n\n# Derailment\n\nOn February 3, 2023, at around 9:00 p.m. EST, a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. The train, consisting of 151 cars, was traveling from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, when it derailed near the intersection of James Street and Park Avenue. The derailment caused a fire, which quickly spread to several cars, releasing toxic chemicals into the air. The incident prompted a massive emergency response, with local authorities, firefighters, and hazardous materials teams responding to the scene.\n\n# Emergency Response and Burn Off\n\nThe emergency response was led by the East Palestine Fire Department, with assistance from surrounding fire departments and hazardous materials teams. The response efforts focused on containing the fire and preventing the spread of toxic chemicals. On February 6, 2023, authorities announced that a controlled burn-off of the hazardous materials would be conducted to prevent a catastrophic explosion. The burn-off, which lasted for several hours, released additional toxic chemicals into the air, prompting concerns about the impact on local residents and the environment.\n\n## Burnoff Unnecessary\n\nCritics later argued that the burn-off was unnecessary, as alternative methods could have been used to mitigate the risks. The burn-off was widely criticized, with many questioning the decision to release additional toxic chemicals into the environment. The incident highlighted the need for more effective emergency response protocols and better communication between authorities and local residents.\n\n# Health and Environmental Concerns\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment raised significant health and environmental concerns. The release of toxic chemicals into the air and water posed risks to local residents, wildlife, and the environment. The incident highlighted the need for more effective regulations and safety protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n## Waste Disposal\n\nThe disposal of hazardous waste from the derailment site became a major concern. Authorities struggled to find suitable storage facilities for the contaminated soil and debris. The incident highlighted the need for more effective waste management strategies and better coordination between authorities and waste disposal companies.\n\n## Independent Testing\n\nIndependent testing of air and water samples revealed high levels of toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride and benzene. The results raised concerns about the impact on local residents and the environment. The incident highlighted the need for more transparent and independent testing protocols to ensure public safety.\n\n## Whistleblower and Cover-Up Allegations\n\nWhistleblowers alleged that Norfolk Southern and government agencies had attempted to cover up the extent of the environmental damage. The allegations raised concerns about the transparency and accountability of regulatory agencies and corporations. The incident highlighted the need for stronger whistleblower protections and more effective oversight mechanisms.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment had significant consequences for local residents, the environment, and the rail industry.\n\n## Lawsuits and Compensation\n\nSeveral lawsuits were filed against Norfolk Southern, seeking compensation for damages and injuries. The lawsuits alleged negligence and recklessness on the part of the railroad company. The incident highlighted the need for stronger regulations and more effective safety protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n## NTSB Board Meeting and Findings\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an investigation into the derailment. The NTSB board meeting revealed that a faulty wheel bearing had caused the derailment. The findings highlighted the need for more effective maintenance protocols and better safety inspections.\n\n## Federal Railroad Administration Safety Culture Assessment\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) conducted a safety culture assessment of Norfolk Southern. The assessment found that the company had a culture of complacency and inadequate safety protocols. The findings highlighted the need for stronger regulations and more effective oversight mechanisms.\n\n# Inquiry and Cause\n\nThe investigation into the East Palestine train derailment revealed a complex web of causes and contributing factors.\n\n## Hearings\n\nCongressional hearings were held to investigate the derailment and the response efforts. The hearings revealed a lack of transparency and accountability on the part of regulatory agencies and corporations. The incident highlighted the need for stronger oversight mechanisms and more effective regulations.\n\n## Brakes\n\nThe investigation found that the train's brakes had failed, contributing to the derailment. The findings highlighted the need for more effective brake maintenance protocols and better safety inspections.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment sparked widespread reactions and debates.\n\n## Congress\n\nCongressional leaders called for stronger regulations and more effective oversight mechanisms. The incident highlighted the need for bipartisan cooperation and more effective policy-making.\n\n## Misinformation\n\nThe incident was marred by misinformation and conspiracy theories. Social media platforms struggled to contain the spread of false information, highlighting the need for more effective moderation protocols.\n\n## Comparisons\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment was compared to other major rail accidents, highlighting the need for more effective safety protocols and regulations.\n\n# Subsequent Derailments\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment was followed by several subsequent derailments, highlighting the need for more effective safety protocols and regulations.\n\n# See Also\n\n* List of rail accidents in the United States\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Federal Railroad Administration\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n\n# References\n\n# Further Reading\n\n* \"East Palestine Train Derailment: A Review of the Incident and Response Efforts\" (report by the National Transportation Safety Board)\n* \"The East Palestine Train Derailment: A Case Study in Regulatory Failure\" (article by the Journal of Transportation Law)\n\n# External Links\n\n* National Transportation Safety Board: East Palestine Train Derailment\n* Federal Railroad Administration: East Palestine Train Derailment\n* Norfolk Southern Railway: East Palestine Train Derailment", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"East_Palestine,_Ohio,_train_derailment\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Derailment\n#Emergency response and burn off\n##Burnoff unnecessary\n#Health and environmental concerns\n##Waste disposal\n##Independent testing\n##Whistleblower and cover-up allegations\n#Aftermath\n##Lawsuits and compensation\n##NTSB board meeting and findings\n##Federal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\n#Inquiry and cause\n##Hearings\n##Brakes\n#Reactions\n##Congress\n##Misinformation\n##Comparisons\n#Subsequent derailments\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the first indigenously built trainset in India, designed and manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai. The train was launched on February 15, 2019, and has been in operation since then, connecting major cities across the country.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n\nThe concept of high-speed trains in India dates back to the 1960s, when the Indian Railways introduced the Rajdhani Express, which had a maximum speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). Over the years, there were efforts to increase the speed of trains, but progress was slow. In the 1990s, the Indian Railways introduced the Shatabdi Express, which had a maximum speed of 150 km/h (93 mph). However, these trains were not designed for high-speed travel and were limited by the existing infrastructure.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Indian government began exploring options for high-speed rail corridors, with the goal of connecting major cities with trains that could travel at speeds of over 300 km/h (186 mph). Several feasibility studies were conducted, and in 2013, the Indian Railways announced plans to introduce high-speed trains on select routes. However, the project faced delays and was eventually shelved due to lack of funding and technical issues.\n\n### Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n\nIn 2016, the Indian Railways decided to take a different approach and develop an indigenous high-speed trainset. The project was entrusted to the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, which had experience in designing and manufacturing coaches for Indian Railways. The goal was to create a trainset that could travel at speeds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph) and would be designed and manufactured in India.\n\nThe ICF team worked closely with Indian Railways to design and develop the trainset, which was initially called Train 18. The train was designed to be energy-efficient, with advanced features such as regenerative braking and aerodynamic design. The trainset consisted of 16 coaches, including two executive class coaches, two dining cars, and 12 seating cars.\n\n### Introduction and further (2019–present)\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was launched on February 15, 2019, with a ceremonial run between New Delhi and Varanasi. The train was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was initially operated on a trial basis. After successful trials, the train was introduced on a regular basis, connecting New Delhi with Varanasi and later with other cities such as Katra and Kota.\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has been a major success, with high occupancy rates and positive feedback from passengers. The train has been praised for its comfort, cleanliness, and punctuality, and has set a new standard for rail travel in India. The Indian Railways has plans to introduce more Vande Bharat Express trains on other routes, with the goal of expanding the network to cover major cities across the country.\n\nRolling stock\n-------------\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express has a unique design and features advanced rolling stock. The trainset consists of 16 coaches, including:\n\n* 2 executive class coaches with 52 seats each\n* 2 dining cars with 24 seats each\n* 12 seating cars with 78 seats each\n\nThe coaches are designed to be energy-efficient, with features such as:\n\n* Regenerative braking, which captures kinetic energy and converts it into electrical energy\n* Aerodynamic design, which reduces wind resistance and improves fuel efficiency\n* Advanced air conditioning systems, which provide comfortable temperatures and humidity levels\n\nFacilities\n----------\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of facilities to passengers, including:\n\n* Comfortable seating with ample legroom\n* Clean and hygienic toilets\n* Advanced air conditioning systems\n* On-board catering services, with a range of snacks and meals\n* Free Wi-Fi and entertainment systems\n* On-board medical facilities, with trained medical staff\n\nServices\n--------\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a range of services to passengers, including:\n\n* Regular announcements and updates on train schedules and delays\n* On-board catering services, with a range of snacks and meals\n* Free Wi-Fi and entertainment systems\n* On-board medical facilities, with trained medical staff\n* Assistance for passengers with disabilities\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Indian Railways\n* High-speed rail in India\n* Integral Coach Factory\n* Train 18\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"Vande Bharat Express\", which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nExternal links\n---------------", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vande_Bharat_Express\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n##Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n##Introduction and further (2019–present)\n#Rolling stock\n#Facilities\n#Services\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The conflict has its roots in the Ukrainian Revolution of 2014 and the subsequent annexation of Crimea by Russia. The situation escalated in 2021, with a significant buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border, followed by a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Ukrainian-Russian conflict has a complex history, dating back to the Ukrainian Revolution of 2014. The ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych led to a period of instability, which Russia exploited to annex Crimea in March 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and it led to a significant deterioration in relations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, has been ongoing since 2014. The Ukrainian government has been fighting against Russian-backed separatist groups, which have declared independence from Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of civilians killed or displaced.\n\n# Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n\n## First Russian military buildup\n\nIn March 2021, Russia began a significant military buildup along the Ukrainian border. The move was seen as a provocative action, and it raised concerns about a potential invasion. The Russian military deployed troops, tanks, and artillery to the border region, which was seen as a demonstration of force.\n\n## Continued violence and escalation\n\nThe situation in eastern Ukraine continued to deteriorate, with reports of increased violence and shelling between Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups. The Ukrainian military reported that Russian-backed separatists were using heavy artillery and mortar fire to attack Ukrainian positions.\n\n## Partial withdrawal\n\nIn April 2021, Russia announced a partial withdrawal of its troops from the Ukrainian border. However, the move was seen as a tactical maneuver, and it did not significantly reduce tensions. The Ukrainian government remained on high alert, and the international community continued to express concerns about the situation.\n\n# Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n\n## Second Russian military buildup\n\nIn October 2021, Russia began a second significant military buildup along the Ukrainian border. The move was seen as a major escalation, and it raised concerns about a potential invasion. The Russian military deployed troops, tanks, and artillery to the border region, which was seen as a demonstration of force.\n\n### November 2021–December 2021\n\nThe situation continued to deteriorate, with reports of increased violence and shelling between Ukrainian government forces and separatist groups.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Prelude_to_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Initial tensions (March–April 2021)\n##First Russian military buildup\n##Continued violence and escalation\n##Partial withdrawal\n#Renewed tensions (October 2021–February 2022)\n##Second Russian military buildup\n###November 2021–December 2021\n###January 2022\n###February 2022\n##Alleged Russian subversion attempts\n###2022 Ukrainian coup d'état attempt\n##Russian accusations of genocide in eastern Ukraine\n##Ukrainian defences\n###Foreign support\n##Reinforcements deployed in NATO\n#Escalation and invasion (February 2022 – present)\n##Alleged clashes between Russia and Ukraine\n##Recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics\n###Putin's denial of Ukrainian statehood\n###International sanctions on Russia\n##Invasion\n#Diplomatic negotiations\n##NATO–Russia security talks\n##United Nations Security Council\n##International treaties and negotiation structures\n##Lavrov–EU correspondence\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Founded in 1926, the club has a rich history and a strong following in Greece and abroad. PAOK FC is one of the most successful and popular football clubs in Greece, with a strong rivalry with Olympiacos and a loyal fan base.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\n### Foundation and early years (1926–1939)\n\nPAOK FC was founded on April 20, 1926, by a group of Greek refugees from Constantinople, who had fled to Thessaloniki after the Greco-Turkish War. The club's name, PAOK, is an acronym for Panthessalonikios Athlitikos Omilos Konstantinoupoliton, which translates to \"Pan-Thessalonian Athletic Club of Constantinopolitans\".

The budget, officially known as the \"Growth Plan 2022\", outlined significant tax cuts and increased borrowing to fund energy subsidies and other measures. The announcement was met with widespread criticism and market volatility, leading to a series of events that ultimately resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss.\n\n# Background\n\nThe mini-budget was announced in the context of a cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom, with high inflation and rising energy prices affecting households and businesses. The government had already implemented some measures to address the crisis, including a price cap on energy bills and a windfall tax on energy companies. However, the mini-budget represented a more significant shift in economic policy, with a focus on tax cuts and deregulation to stimulate growth.\n\n# The budget\n\n## Key points\n\nThe key points of the mini-budget included:\n\n* A reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 19%\n* The abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax\n* A reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 25% to 19%\n* The reversal of the national insurance increase introduced in April 2022\n* The cancellation of the planned increase in the dividend tax rate\n* The introduction of a new \" Investment Zones\" scheme to encourage investment in specific areas\n* The provision of £60 billion in energy subsidies to households and businesses\n\n# Reaction\n\n## Currency, interest rate, and debt\n\nThe announcement of the mini-budget led to a sharp decline in the value of the pound sterling against other major currencies, including the US dollar and the euro. This was partly due to the increased borrowing required to fund the tax cuts and energy subsidies, which raised concerns about the sustainability of the UK's public finances. The yield on UK government bonds also increased, indicating that investors were demanding higher returns to compensate for the perceived increase in risk.\n\n## Bond markets\n\nThe bond markets were severely affected by the mini-budget, with the yield on 10-year UK government bonds rising to 4.5%, the highest level since 2008. This led to concerns about the impact on mortgage rates and the broader economy. The Bank of England was forced to intervene in the bond market to prevent a complete collapse in confidence.\n\n## International response\n\nThe international community was largely critical of the mini-budget, with many commentators expressing concerns about the impact on global markets and the UK's economic stability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a statement expressing concern about the budget's potential impact on inflation and the UK's public finances.\n\n## Business and economic\n\nThe business community was also critical of the mini-budget, with many expressing concerns about the impact on inflation and the broader economy. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) issued a statement expressing concern about the budget's potential impact on business investment and the UK's competitiveness.\n\n## Media\n\nThe media reaction to the mini-budget was overwhelmingly negative, with many commentators expressing concerns about the impact on the UK's economic stability and the government's judgment. The BBC, ITV, and Sky News all featured critical analysis of the budget, with many commentators questioning the government's decision to implement such significant tax cuts.\n\n## Political\n\nThe opposition Labour Party was highly critical of the mini-budget, with Leader Keir Starmer describing it as \"a budget for the wealthy, paid for by the rest of us\". The Liberal Democrats also expressed concerns about the budget's potential impact on the UK's public finances and the environment.\n\n## Opinion polling\n\nThe mini-budget was widely unpopular with the public, with many opinion polls showing that a majority of voters opposed the tax cuts and energy subsidies. A YouGov poll found that 71% of voters opposed the abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax, while a Survation poll found that 62% of voters opposed the reduction in the basic rate of income tax.\n\n# Government response\n\n## Initial responses\n\nThe government initially defended the mini-budget, with Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng arguing that the tax cuts and energy subsidies were necessary to stimulate growth and address the cost of living crisis. Prime Minister Liz Truss also defended the budget, arguing that it was necessary to take bold action to address the UK's economic challenges.\n\n## Dismissal of Chancellor\n\nHowever, as the criticism of the mini-budget mounted, the government was forced to take action. On 14 October 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss announced that Kwasi Kwarteng had been dismissed as Chancellor, to be replaced by Jeremy Hunt. Hunt immediately announced that he would be reversing many of the tax cuts and energy subsidies announced in the mini-budget.\n\n## Reversal of tax cuts\n\nOn 17 October 2022, Jeremy Hunt announced that the government would be reversing many of the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget, including the abolition of the 45% top rate of income tax and the reduction in the basic rate of income tax. Hunt also announced that the government would be introducing a new windfall tax on energy companies to help fund the energy subsidies.\n\n# Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Liz Truss announced that she would be resigning as Prime Minister, to be replaced by Rishi Sunak. Truss's resignation came after a tumultuous period in office, marked by widespread criticism of her economic policies and a series of U-turns.\n\n# Subsequent events\n\n## Following Truss's resignation\n\nFollowing Truss's resignation, the new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that he would be taking a more cautious approach to economic policy, with a focus on stabilizing the public finances and addressing the cost of living crisis. Sunak also announced that he would be reversing many of the tax cuts and energy subsidies announced in the mini-budget.\n\n## Later events\n\nIn the months following the mini-budget, the UK economy continued to face significant challenges, including high inflation and rising interest rates. The government was forced to take further action to address the cost of living crisis, including increasing the minimum wage and introducing new measures to support households and businesses.\n\n# See also\n\n* 2022 United Kingdom government crisis\n* Economic policy of the Liz Truss government\n* Cost of living crisis\n* Inflation in the United Kingdom\n* Public finances of the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#The budget\n##Key points\n#Reaction\n##Currency, interest rate, and debt\n##Bond markets\n##International response\n##Business and economic\n##Media\n##Political\n##Opinion polling\n#Government response\n##Initial responses\n##Dismissal of Chancellor\n##Reversal of tax cuts\n#Resignation of Truss as Prime Minister\n#Subsequent events\n##Following Truss's resignation\n##Later events\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The airstrikes were reportedly aimed at terrorist groups operating in the region, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant organization that has been responsible for numerous attacks on Pakistani soil.\n\n#Background\n\nThe airstrikes were part of a broader operation launched by Pakistan to target terrorist groups operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. In recent years, the TTP and other militant groups have taken advantage of the porous border to launch attacks on Pakistani cities and military installations. In response, the Pakistani military has stepped up its efforts to eliminate these groups, including through airstrikes and ground operations.\n\nPrior to the airstrikes, Pakistani officials had warned the Afghan government of the presence of TTP militants in eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan had also requested that the Afghan government take action against the TTP, but these requests had been met with little success. The airstrikes were seen as a last resort by the Pakistani military to target the TTP and other militant groups.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe airstrikes resulted in significant casualties, with reports indicating that dozens of people were killed or injured. The exact number of casualties is disputed, with some reports suggesting that up to 50 people were killed, while others put the number at around 20.\n\nThe majority of the casualties were reportedly civilians, including women and children. The airstrikes also damaged homes and other infrastructure in the affected areas. The Afghan government condemned the airstrikes as a \"clear violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Afghan government\n\nThe Afghan government strongly condemned the airstrikes, describing them as a \"violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". The government also accused Pakistan of \"deliberately targeting civilian areas\" and called for an immediate end to the airstrikes.\n\nIn a statement, the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the airstrikes were \"a clear example of Pakistan's continued interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs\". The statement also called on the international community to condemn the airstrikes and to hold Pakistan accountable for its actions.\n\n##Pakistani government\n\nThe Pakistani government defended the airstrikes, saying that they were necessary to target terrorist groups operating in the region. In a statement, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the airstrikes were \"part of our efforts to eliminate terrorist groups that pose a threat to our national security\".\n\nThe Pakistani government also rejected Afghan accusations that the airstrik", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Pakistani_airstrikes_in_Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Casualties\n#Reactions\n##Afghan government\n##Pakistani government\n##Pakistani Taliban\n##United States government\n##Chinese government\n##United Nations\n#Protests\n#Compensation\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
