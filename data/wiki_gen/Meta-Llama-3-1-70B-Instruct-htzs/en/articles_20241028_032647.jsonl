In recent years, thousands of migrants and refugees have attempted to cross the sea from North Africa and the Middle East to reach Europe, often in overcrowded and poorly maintained vessels. Many of these attempts have ended in tragedy, with migrants facing risks of drowning, exposure, and exploitation by smugglers.\n\nGreece, in particular, has been a major entry point for migrants into Europe, with many attempting to reach the country's islands or mainland from neighboring Turkey. The Greek authorities have faced criticism for their handling of the migrant crisis, including allegations of pushbacks and inadequate reception conditions.\n\n#The migrant boat, the Adriana\n\nThe migrant boat involved in the disaster was a 25-meter-long vessel named the Adriana. The boat was reportedly carrying between 500 and 700 people, although the exact number of passengers is still unclear. The Adriana was said to have departed from the port city of Izmir, Turkey, several days before the accident, bound for Italy.\n\nThe boat was described as being in poor condition, with inadequate safety equipment and overcrowding. Survivors reported that the vessel was taking on water throughout the journey, and that the crew had attempted to repair leaks with makeshift patches.\n\n#Distress calls and response\n\nOn the morning of June 14, 2023, the Adriana sent out a distress call to the Greek coast guard, reporting that the vessel was taking on water and in danger of sinking. The coast guard responded by dispatching a rescue team to the location, but the boat capsized before they could arrive.\n\nSurvivors reported that the crew had attempted to call for help earlier, but that their calls had gone unanswered. It is unclear whether the delay in responding to the distress call contributed to the severity of the disaster.\n\n#Capsizing\n\nThe Adriana capsized at approximately 10:00 AM local time, about 50 kilometers off the coast of Messenia. The boat reportedly split in two, with many passengers trapped below deck. Survivors described the scene as chaotic, with people screaming and trying to escape as the vessel went down.\n\n#Victims\n\nThe exact number of victims is still unclear, but it is believed that between 300 and 400 people lost their lives in the disaster. Many of the victims were reportedly women and children, who were trapped below deck as the boat sank.\n\nSurvivors reported that many of the victims had been unable to swim, and that they had been swept underwater as the boat capsized. Others reported that they had seen people clinging to debris, only to be pulled under by the strong currents.\n\n#Search, rescue, and detention\n\nA search and rescue operation was launched immediately after the disaster, with Greek coast guard vessels and helicopters scouring the area for survivors. Many survivors were pulled from the water, often in a state of hypothermia and shock.\n\nHowever, the response to the disaster was also marked by controversy, as many survivors reported being detained by Greek authorities. Some reported being held in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, without access to medical care or basic necessities.\n\n##Protests\n\nThe detention of survivors sparked widespread outrage, with human rights groups and international leaders condemning the Greek authorities for their handling of the crisis. Protests were held in cities across Greece, with demonstrators demanding that the government provide better treatment for migrants and refugees.\n\n#Response\n\nThe Greek government faced intense criticism for its response to the disaster, with many accusing them of being slow to respond and inadequate in their provision of aid. The government defended its actions, saying that they had done everything possible to respond to the crisis.\n\nInternational leaders also responded to the disaster, with many expressing outrage and condemnation. The European Union called for an investigation into the incident, and offered support to the Greek authorities in responding to the crisis.\n\n#Judicial proceedings\n\nAn investigation into the disaster was launched immediately after the incident, with Greek authorities working to determine the cause of the capsizing and the role of the crew. Several crew members were detained, and face charges of manslaughter and negligence.\n\nHowever, the investigation has been criticized for being slow and inadequate, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability.\n\n#Investigations\n\nIn addition to the judicial investigation, several other inquiries have been launched into the disaster. The Greek parliament has established a special committee to investigate the incident, and the European Union has also launched its own inquiry.\n\nHuman rights groups have also conducted their own investigations, documenting the experiences of survivors and highlighting the need for greater accountability and reform.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation, with many calling for greater action to prevent such tragedies in the future. Human rights groups have demanded that governments take greater responsibility for protecting migrants and refugees, and that they work to address the root causes of migration.\n\nInternational leaders have also responded to the disaster, with many calling for greater cooperation and solidarity in responding to the migrant crisis.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of migrant boat accidents\n* European migrant crisis\n* Greece-Turkey border\n\n#Note\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2023 Messenia migrant boat disaster.

Jackson Women's Health Organization case, decided by the United States Supreme Court on June 24, 2022, is a landmark decision that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). The case centered on the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act, a Mississippi state law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n#Background\n\n##Common law\n\nPrior to the Roe v. Wade decision, abortion was largely regulated by state laws, which varied in their restrictions and exceptions. Many states prohibited abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother. The common law approach to abortion focused on protecting fetal life and preventing harm to women.\n\n##Constitutional right\n\nIn Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. The Court established a trimester framework, allowing states to regulate abortion during the second and third trimesters, but not during the first. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Court reaffirmed the core holding of Roe, but established a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of abortion restrictions: the \"undue burden\" standard.\n\n##Evolution of the composition of the Supreme Court\n\nThe composition of the Supreme Court has undergone significant changes since the Casey decision. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, and Stephen Breyer, who were part of the Casey majority, have retired or passed away, and have been replaced by more conservative justices, including Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. The shift in the Court's composition has led to increased scrutiny of the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n#Gestational Age Act\n\nThe Gestational Age Act, enacted by the Mississippi Legislature in 2018, banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for medical emergencies and severe fetal abnormalities. The law was challenged by Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi.\n\n##Lower courts\n\nThe district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals both ruled that the Gestational Age Act was unconstitutional, applying the undue burden standard established in Casey. The Fifth Circuit held that the law imposed a substantial obstacle to a woman's ability to choose an abortion before viability, and that it was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n#Supreme Court\n\n##Oral argument\n\nOral argument in the case took place on December 1, 2021. The justices asked questions about the constitutionality of the Gestational Age Act, the role of stare decisis, and the potential implications of overturning Roe and Casey.\n\n##Leaked draft opinion\n\nIn May 2022, a draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press. The draft opinion called for the overturning of Roe and Casey, and would have allowed states to regulate or prohibit abortion. The leak was widely condemned by the Court and sparked widespread protests and debates.\n\n###Reactions\n\nReactions to the leaked draft opinion were swift and polarized. Pro-choice advocates and many Democrats expressed outrage and concern, while pro-life advocates and many Republicans celebrated the potential overturning of Roe.\n\n###Investigation\n\nThe Supreme Court launched an investigation into the leak, which was unprecedented in the Court's history. The investigation was led by the Court's Marshal, Gail Curley, and involved interviews with justices, clerks, and other Court staff.\n\n##Opinions\n\nThe Court issued its decision on June 24, 2022.\n\n###Majority opinion\n\nThe majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, held that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, and that the authority to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The opinion overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and allowed the Gestational Age Act to take effect.\n\n###Concurrences\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch wrote concurring opinions, agreeing with the majority's conclusion but offering different rationales. Justice Thomas argued that the Due Process Clause does not protect a right to abortion, while Justice Gorsuch argued that the Court should have gone further and overturned other precedents that rely on substantive due process.\n\n###Concurrence in judgment\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion, agreeing with the majority's conclusion but arguing that the Court should have taken a more incremental approach, rather than overturning Roe and Casey entirely.\n\n###Dissent\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's decision was a radical departure from established precedent and would have devastating consequences for women's health and autonomy.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Pre-decision\n\nPrior to the decision, many states had enacted laws restricting or expanding abortion access, in anticipation of a potential overturning of Roe. The decision was expected to have significant implications for women's health, reproductive rights, and the balance of power between the states and the federal government.\n\n##Post-decision\n\n###State laws restricting abortion\n\nIn the aftermath of the decision, many states with trigger laws or other restrictions on abortion began to enforce those laws, effectively banning or severely limiting abortion access. Other states, including Texas and Oklahoma, enacted new laws restricting abortion.\n\n####EMTALA and federal preemption\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment, including abortion care, to patients in emergency situations. However, the relationship between EMTALA and state abortion laws is unclear, and the Biden administration has taken steps to clarify the scope of EMTALA and ensure that patients receive necessary care.\n\n###State laws expanding abortion access\n\nOther states, including California, New York, and Maryland, have enacted laws expanding abortion access and protecting reproductive rights. These laws include measures to protect abortion providers, expand insurance coverage for abortion, and increase funding for reproductive health services.\n\n###Congressional proposals\n\nIn the aftermath of the decision, Congress has considered several proposals to address the issue of abortion and reproductive rights. These proposals include the Women's Health Protection Act, which would codify the right to abortion and prevent states from imposing undue burdens on abortion access.\n\n###Executive action by President Biden\n\nPresident Biden has taken several executive actions to address the issue of abortion and reproductive rights, including ordering the Department of Health and Human Services to take steps to ensure access to abortion care and protect reproductive rights.\n\n###Medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other processes\n\nThe decision has also raised concerns about access to medical abortion, in vitro fertilization, and other reproductive health services. Some states have enacted laws restricting access to these services, while others have taken steps to protect and expand access.\n\n###Data privacy\n\nThe decision has also raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for states to collect and use data on individuals who seek abortion care. Some states have enacted laws protecting data privacy, while others have taken steps to collect and use data on abortion seekers.\n\n###2022 and 2024 United States election seasons\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant implications for the 2022 and 2024 United States election seasons, with many candidates and campaigns focusing on the issue of abortion and reproductive rights.\n\n###Effects on abortion rates\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant effects on abortion rates, with some studies suggesting that abortion rates may decline in states with restrictive laws, while others suggest that abortion rates may increase as individuals seek care in other states or through other means.\n\n###Effects on infant mortality\n\nThe decision is also likely to have significant effects on infant mortality rates, with some studies suggesting that restrictive abortion laws may lead to increased infant mortality rates, particularly in low-income and marginalized communities.\n\n#Reaction\n\n##Legal journalists\n\nLegal journalists and commentators have widely criticized the decision, arguing that it represents a radical departure from established precedent and will have devastating consequences for women's health and autonomy.\n\n##Political\n\n###Support\n\nMany Republicans and conservative politicians have celebrated the decision, arguing that it represents a major victory for the pro-life movement and will help to protect unborn life.\n\n###Opposition\n\nMany Democrats and liberal politicians have condemned the decision, arguing that it represents a major setback for women's rights and will have devastating consequences for women's health and autonomy.\n\n##Religious\n\nMany religious leaders and organizations have reacted to the decision, with some celebrating the ruling as a victory for life and others condemning it as a major setback for women's rights and reproductive freedom.\n\n##Civil rights\n\nMany civil rights organizations have condemned the decision, arguing that it represents a major setback for women's rights and will have devastating consequences for marginalized communities.\n\n##Health and education\n\nMany health and education organizations have reacted to the decision, with some expressing concern about the potential consequences for women's health and others calling for increased education and awareness about reproductive health and rights.\n\n##International\n\nThe decision has also received international attention, with many countries and organizations expressing concern about the potential consequences for women's rights and reproductive freedom.\n\n##News organizations\n\nMany news organizations have covered the decision extensively, with some providing in-depth analysis and others offering commentary and opinion pieces.\n\n##Public\n\nThe public has also reacted to the decision, with many individuals taking to social media to express their opinions and concerns.\n\n##Corporate and celebrity\n\nMany corporations and celebrities have also reacted to the decision, with some expressing concern about the potential consequences for women's rights and others calling for increased support and resources for reproductive health and rights.\n\n#Legacy\n\n##Cultural and political effects\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant cultural and political effects, with many arguing that it represents a major shift in the balance of power between the states and the federal government.\n\n##Medical and sociological effects\n\nThe decision is also likely to have significant medical and sociological effects, with many arguing that it will have devastating consequences for women's health and reproductive freedom.\n\n#See also\n\n* Roe v.

Hunter, based on his 2012 play of the same name. The film stars Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton, and Ty Simpkins. It premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival and received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, direction, and themes.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film tells the story of Charlie, a reclusive English teacher living in rural Idaho. Weighing over 600 pounds, Charlie is struggling to come to terms with his past and find redemption. He is haunted by the ghost of his former partner, Alan, who died due to Charlie's neglect. Charlie's life is further complicated by his strained relationship with his teenage daughter, Ellie, who is struggling with her own demons.\n\nAs Charlie navigates his complex web of relationships, he begins to confront his inner demons and seek forgiveness from those he has wronged. Through a series of intense and emotionally charged encounters, Charlie slowly begins to heal and find a sense of purpose.\n\n# Cast\n\n* Brendan Fraser as Charlie\n* Sadie Sink as Ellie\n* Hong Chau as Liz\n* Samantha Morton as Mary\n* Ty Simpkins as Thomas\n\n# Production\n\n## Writing and casting\n\nThe screenplay for The Whale was written by Samuel D.

The play premiered at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in 2012 and received critical acclaim.\n\nBrendan Fraser was cast in the lead role of Charlie after a lengthy auditioning process. Fraser had previously worked with Aronofsky on the 1998 film Pi, and the two had remained close friends over the years. Fraser's casting was seen as a major coup for the film, as he had largely stepped back from acting in recent years.\n\nThe rest of the cast, including Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton, and Ty Simpkins, was assembled over the course of several months. Sink, who is best known for her role as Max Mayfield in the Netflix series Stranger Things, was cast as Charlie's daughter Ellie after a series of auditions.\n\n## Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Whale took place in New Mexico and New York over the course of six weeks. Aronofsky worked closely with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to create a visual style that was both intimate and expansive. The film's use of close-ups and medium shots was designed to create a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, while the use of wide shots and exterior locations was intended to convey a sense of freedom and possibility.\n\nFraser's preparation for the role of Charlie involved a significant amount of weight gain, as well as extensive prosthetic work. Fraser worked closely with the film's makeup and costume designers to create a look that was both authentic and nuanced.\n\n# Release\n\nThe Whale premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2022. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Fraser's performance and Aronofsky's direction.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 9, 2022, by A24. It was released in the United Kingdom on January 6, 2023.\n\n# Reception\n\n## Box office\n\nThe Whale was a commercial success, grossing over $30 million worldwide. The film's success was seen as a major comeback for Fraser, who had largely stepped back from acting in recent years.\n\n## Critical response\n\nThe Whale received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising Fraser's performance and Aronofsky's direction. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10.\n\nRolling Stone's Peter Travers praised Fraser's performance, writing: \"Fraser's Charlie is a monumental creation, a symphony of suffering and wit and tenderness.\" The New York Times' A.O.

Born on August 25, 1949, in Oxford, England, Amis is widely regarded as one of the most influential and innovative writers of his generation. His distinctive writing style, which combines elements of satire, comedy, and philosophical inquiry, has led to the publication of numerous critically acclaimed novels, short stories, and non-fiction works.\n\nEarly Life\n------------\n\nMartin Amis was born to Kingsley Amis, a prominent novelist and poet, and Hilary Bardwell, a social worker. His father's literary reputation and social connections had a significant impact on Amis's early life and writing career. Amis spent his childhood in Oxford, where he developed a passion for reading and writing. He was educated at the independent schools of St. Christopher's and St. John's, before proceeding to Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied English.\n\nEarly Writing\n--------------\n\nAmis's early writing career began in his teenage years, when he started writing short stories and poetry. His first published work, a short story called \"The Rachel Papers,\" appeared in the Oxford literary magazine \"The Isis\" in 1968. Amis's early writing was heavily influenced by his father's literary style, as well as the works of authors such as Vladimir Nabokov and Saul Bellow.\n\nMain Career\n-------------\n\n### 1980s and 1990s\n\nAmis's breakthrough novel, \"Money,\" was published in 1984 to widespread critical acclaim. The novel, which explores the excesses of 1980s capitalism, was praised for its innovative style and biting satire. Amis's subsequent novels, including \"London Fields\" (1989) and \"Time's Arrow\" (1991), further established his reputation as a major literary talent.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Amis continued to experiment with new styles and themes, publishing novels such as \"The Information\" (1995) and \"Night Train\" (1997). His non-fiction work, including \"Experience\" (2000), a memoir about his relationship with his father, also gained critical acclaim.\n\n### 2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Amis published several novels that explored themes of politics, history, and identity. \"The Yellow Dog\" (2003) and \"House of Meetings\" (2006) were both praised for their nuanced exploration of complex themes. Amis's non-fiction work during this period included \"The Second Plane\" (2008), a collection of essays about the 9/11 attacks and their aftermath.\n\n### 2010s and 2020s\n\nAmis's more recent novels include \"The Pregnant Widow\" (2010), \"Lionel Asbo: State of England\" (2012), and \"The Zone of Interest\" (2014). His non-fiction work during this period includes \"The Moronic Inferno\" (2014), a collection of essays about American politics and culture.\n\n### Other work\n\nIn addition to his novels and non-fiction work, Amis has also written several screenplays and essays for film and television. He has taught creative writing at various universities, including the University of Manchester.\n\nUniversity of Manchester\n----------------------\n\nAmis taught creative writing at the University of Manchester from 2008 to 2011. During his time at the university, he supervised several student writers and taught courses on literary theory and creative writing.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nAmis has been married twice, first to Antonia Phillips from 1984 to 1993, and then to Isabel Fonseca in 1998. He has three daughters from his two marriages.\n\n### Death\n\nAmis's health has been a subject of concern in recent years. In 2010, he announced that he had been diagnosed with a serious illness, but has since made a recovery.\n\nViews\n-----\n\n### Writing\n\nAmis has written extensively about the nature of writing and the role of the writer in society. He has argued that writing is a form of \"moral inquiry\" and that writers have a responsibility to explore complex themes and ideas in their work.\n\n### Nuclear Proliferation\n\nAmis has written about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the need for international cooperation to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. He has argued that nuclear disarmament is a moral imperative and that writers and intellectuals have a responsibility to speak out against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n### Geopolitics\n\nAmis has written about various geopolitical issues, including the rise of China and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. He has argued that the West has a responsibility to engage with emerging powers and to promote democracy and human rights around the world.\n\n### Electoral Politics\n\nAmis has written about the limitations of electoral politics and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the role of politics in society. He has argued that politicians often fail to address the most pressing issues of our time and that writers and intellectuals have a responsibility to critique and challenge the status quo.\n\n### Islam and Islamism\n\nAmis has written about the threat posed by Islamism and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of Islamic thought and culture. He has argued that Islamism is a totalitarian ideology that poses a threat to democracy and human rights.\n\n### Euthanasia\n\nAmis has written about the ethics of euthanasia and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of end-of-life care.

His early life was marked by instability and neglect, with his parents often leaving him and his siblings in the care of various relatives and babysitters.

The shortage was caused by a combination of factors, including supply chain issues, a recall and plant shutdown, import restrictions, and market concentration. The shortage had significant effects on families with infants, leading to increased prices, substitution with alternative foods, and hospitalizations. The shortage also sparked a national conversation about the importance of breast milk and the need for improved federal response to food shortages.\n\nCauses\n--------\n\n### Supply Chain Issues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global supply chains, leading to shortages of raw materials and manufacturing capacity. The infant formula industry was particularly affected, as it relies on a complex network of suppliers and manufacturers to produce formula. The pandemic caused delays and disruptions in the supply chain, leading to a shortage of formula.\n\n### Recall and Plant Shutdown\n\nIn February 2022, Abbott Laboratories, one of the largest manufacturers of infant formula in the United States, issued a voluntary recall of its Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare formulas due to concerns about contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii. The recall led to a shutdown of Abbott's plant in Sturgis, Michigan, which produced over 40% of the formula used in the United States.\n\n#### Alleged Problems at Sturgis Plant\n\nThe Sturgis plant had a history of quality control issues, including a 2019 inspection that found \"serious violations\" of food safety regulations. The plant had also been the subject of a whistleblower complaint in 2020, which alleged that the plant was not following proper sanitation procedures. The recall and shutdown of the plant exacerbated the existing shortage of formula.\n\n### Import Restrictions\n\nThe United States has strict regulations regarding the importation of infant formula, which made it difficult to import formula from other countries to address the shortage. The regulations require imported formula to meet strict safety and nutritional standards, which can be a barrier to entry for foreign manufacturers.\n\n### Market Concentration\n\nThe infant formula market in the United States is highly concentrated, with only a few major manufacturers, including Abbott Laboratories, Mead Johnson, and Nestle. This market concentration can make it difficult for new manufacturers to enter the market and can lead to shortages if one of the major manufacturers experiences a disruption.\n\nEffects\n--------\n\n### Sale and Donation of Breast Milk\n\nThe shortage of formula led to an increase in the sale and donation of breast milk, with some mothers selling or donating their excess milk to families in need. The sale of breast milk is a growing industry, with some companies paying mothers for their milk and then reselling it to families.\n\n### Use of Alternative Foods\n\nSome families turned to alternative foods, such as cow's milk or homemade formula, to feed their infants. However, these alternatives are not nutritionally equivalent to formula and can be dangerous for infants if not prepared properly.\n\n### Hospitalizations\n\nThe shortage of formula led to an increase in hospitalizations, as some families were unable to access formula and had to seek medical attention for their infants.\n\n### Bot Usage\n\nThe shortage also led to an increase in the use of bots, which are automated programs that can quickly purchase formula online. The use of bots exacerbated the shortage, as they were able to quickly buy up available formula, leaving none for other families.\n\n### Shortage in Canada\n\nThe shortage of formula also affected Canada, where many families rely on imports from the United States. The shortage led to increased prices and substitution with alternative foods.\n\nResponses\n----------\n\n### Efforts to Prevent Price Gouging\n\nThe federal government and state governments took steps to prevent price gouging, which was a major concern during the shortage. Some states, such as California and New York, implemented price controls to prevent retailers from charging excessive prices for formula.\n\n### Efforts to Increase Supply\n\nThe federal government and manufacturers took steps to increase the supply of formula, including importing formula from other countries and ramping up production at domestic plants.\n\n### Efforts to Restore Production\n\nAbbott Laboratories took steps to restore production at its Sturgis plant, including implementing new safety protocols and hiring additional staff.\n\n### Investigations\n\nThere were several investigations into the shortage, including a Congressional investigation, an FDA investigation, an ABC News investigation, and a DOJ investigation.\n\n#### Congressional Investigation\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform launched an investigation into the shortage, which included hearings and document requests.\n\n#### FDA Investigation\n\nThe FDA launched an investigation into the Sturgis plant, which included an inspection of the plant and a review of Abbott's safety protocols.\n\n#### ABC News Investigation\n\nABC News launched an investigation into the shortage, which included an examination of Abbott's safety protocols and an interview with a whistleblower.\n\n#### DOJ Investigation\n\nThe DOJ launched an investigation into price gouging during the shortage, which included a review of retailers' pricing practices.\n\nCommentary\n----------\n\n### Breast Milk vs. Formula Debate\n\nThe shortage sparked a national conversation about the importance of breast milk and the need for improved support for breastfeeding families. Some argued that the shortage highlighted the need for increased investment in breastfeeding support, while others argued that formula is a necessary option for many families.\n\n### Criticism of Federal Response\n\nThere was criticism of the federal response to the shortage, with some arguing that the government was slow to respond and did not do enough to address the shortage.\n\n#### White House Response\n\nThe White House was criticized for its response to the shortage, with some arguing that the administration did not do enough to address the shortage.\n\n#### Formula Availability at the Southern Border\n\nThere was also criticism of the availability of formula at the southern border, where many migrant families rely on formula to feed their infants.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\n* Infant formula\n* Breast milk\n* Cronobacter sakazakii\n* Food safety\n* Supply chain management", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_United_States_infant_formula_shortage\" following this outline:\n\n#Causes\n##Supply chain issues\n##Recall and plant shutdown\n###Alleged problems at Sturgis plant\n##Import restrictions\n##Market concentration\n#Effects\n##Sale and donation of breast milk\n##Use of alternative foods\n##Hospitalizations\n##Bot usage\n##Shortage in Canada\n#Responses\n##Efforts to prevent price gouging\n##Efforts to increase supply\n##Efforts to restore production\n##Investigations\n###Congressional investigation\n###FDA investigation\n###ABC News investigation\n###DOJ investigation\n#Commentary\n##Breast milk vs. formula debate\n##Criticism of federal response\n###White House response\n###Formula availability at the Southern border\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1910, Young rose to fame with his record-breaking swim across the Catalina Channel in 1927, a feat that cemented his status as one of the greatest long-distance swimmers of his era.\n\nEarly swimming achievements\n\nYoung's affinity for swimming began at an early age, and he quickly demonstrated a natural talent for the sport. Growing up in Hamilton, Ontario, he spent countless hours swimming in the local lakes and rivers, developing the endurance and technique that would serve him well in his later competitive career. As a teenager, Young began competing in local swimming events, where he consistently impressed spectators with his speed and agility in the water.\n\nCatalina swim training\n\nIn 1926, Young set his sights on the ultimate long-distance swimming challenge: crossing the Catalina Channel, a 20.2-mile stretch of water separating Santa Catalina Island from the California mainland. To prepare for this daunting task, Young embarked on an intensive training program, honing his skills in the waters off Catalina Island. Under the guidance of experienced coaches and trainers, Young fine-tuned his technique, built up his endurance, and acclimated himself to the unique conditions of the channel.\n\nCatalina channel swim\n\nOn August 15, 1927, Young took to the waters of the Catalina Channel, determined to make history. Swimming with the tides, he faced strong currents and choppy waves, but his rigorous training and mental toughness enabled him to persevere. As he approached the mainland, a large crowd gathered to witness the finish, cheering Young on as he emerged from the water, exhausted but triumphant. His record-breaking time of 15 hours and 44 minutes would stand for many years to come.\n\nSwam with tides\n\nYoung's decision to swim with the tides proved instrumental in his success. By timing his swim to coincide with the changing tides, he was able to harness the natural currents to his advantage, conserving energy and making steady progress across the channel. This strategic approach demonstrated Young's deep understanding of the ocean's dynamics and his ability to adapt to challenging conditions.\n\nCompetition from Norman Ross\n\nYoung's achievement sparked a rivalry with Norman Ross, an Australian swimmer who had also set his sights on conquering the Catalina Channel. Ross, a formidable competitor, posed a significant challenge to Young's record, and the two swimmers engaged in a series of intense competitions, pushing each other to new heights. This rivalry drove Young to continue innovating and improving, ultimately solidifying his position as one of the world's top long-distance swimmers.\n\nPublic acclaim, with limited financial gain\n\nYoung's record-breaking swim across the Catalina Channel catapulted him to international fame, earning him widespread recognition and admiration. However, despite his newfound celebrity status, Young struggled to capitalize on his success financially. The sport of swimming was not yet lucrative, and Young's modest prize winnings and endorsement deals barely covered his expenses. Undeterred, Young continued to pursue his passion for swimming, driven by a deep love for the sport and a desire to push the boundaries of human endurance.\n\nInconsistent swimming career\n\nFollowing his triumphant Catalina Channel swim, Young's career was marked by periods of inconsistency and mixed results. While he continued to compete at the highest level, he faced stiff competition from emerging talent and struggled to replicate his earlier successes.\n\n1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1927, Young attempted to swim 21 miles across Lake Ontario, a feat that would have cemented his status as one of the greatest long-distance swimmers of all time. Although he ultimately fell short of his goal, Young's effort demonstrated his unwavering commitment to the sport and his willingness to take on new challenges.\n\n1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nA year later, Young returned to Lake Ontario, determined to conquer the 15-mile distance. This time, he succeeded, posting a respectable time and reaffirming his position as a leading long-distance swimmer.\n\nWins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n\nIn September 1928, Young entered the prestigious Montreal to Repentigney Marathon, a grueling 15-mile swim in the St. Lawrence River. With his trademark determination and endurance, Young emerged victorious, claiming the top prize and bolstering his reputation as a force to be reckoned with in the swimming world.\n\n1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nIn 1929, Young once again tackled the 15-mile Lake Ontario swim, this time posting an even faster time than in the previous year. This consistent improvement demonstrated Young's dedication to his training and his ongoing quest for excellence.\n\n1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n\nThe following year, Young returned to Lake Ontario, where he repeated his 15-mile swim with ease. This string of successes underscored Young's status as a dominant force in long-distance swimming.\n\nWins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n\nIn 1931, Young claimed victory in the Lake Ontario swim, solidifying his position as one of the world's top long-distance swimmers. This triumph marked the culmination of years of hard work and perseverance, as Young continued to push the boundaries of human endurance.\n\nLate swim career\n\nAs the years went by, Young gradually transitioned away from competitive swimming, focusing instead on coaching and mentoring the next generation of swimmers. Although he continued to participate in occasional exhibitions and charity events, Young's competitive career slowly drew to a close.\n\nSwim retirement and marriage\n\nFollowing his retirement from competitive swimming, Young married and settled into a quiet life outside the public eye. This new chapter in his life allowed him to focus on his personal relationships and pursue new interests, away from the pressures and demands of his earlier career.\n\nMarriages\n\nYoung was married twice, first to a woman named Margaret, with whom he had two children, and later to a woman named Dorothy. Both marriages brought him happiness and fulfillment, as he built a loving family and established a stable home life.\n\nLate professional life\n\nIn his later years, Young returned to the world of swimming, albeit in a different capacity. He worked as a swimming instructor and coach, sharing his expertise and experience with aspiring young swimmers. This new role allowed him to remain connected to the sport he loved, while also giving back to the community that had supported him throughout his career.\n\nHonors\n\nThroughout his career, Young received numerous accolades and honors for his achievements in the swimming world. These tributes recognized his remarkable contributions to the sport, as well as his enduring legacy as one of the greatest long-distance swimmers of all time.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of long-distance swimmers\n* Catalina Channel swim\n* Lake Ontario swim\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* George Young's profile on the International Swimming Hall of Fame website\n* Article about George Young's Catalina Channel swim on the Los Angeles Times website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"George_Young_(swimmer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early swimming achievements\n##Catalina swim training\n#Catalina channel swim\n##Swam with tides\n##Competition from Norman Ross\n##Public acclaim, with limited financial gain\n#Inconsistent swimming career\n##1927, 21-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1928, 15-Mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins Sept 1928 Montreal to Repentigney Marathon\n##1929, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##1930, 15-mile Lake Ontario swim\n##Wins 1931 Lake Ontario win\n##Late swim career\n#Swim retirement and marriage\n##Marriages\n#Late professional life\n#Honors\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The deal, which was finalized in October 2022, marked a major shift in the ownership and direction of the social media platform. This article provides an overview of the acquisition process, including the prelude, buyout offer, attempted termination, and eventual completion of the purchase.\n\n# Prelude\n## Background\nTwitter, founded in 2006, had grown into a global social media platform with over 440 million monthly active users. Despite its popularity, the company had struggled to achieve profitability and faced increasing competition from other social media platforms. In 2022, Twitter's stock price had declined significantly, making it a potential target for acquisition.\n\n## Early developments\nIn January 2022, Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, Inc., began purchasing Twitter shares, eventually acquiring a 9.2% stake in the company. Musk's investment in Twitter sparked speculation about his intentions, with some analysts suggesting that he might seek to acquire the company or push for changes in its leadership.\n\n# Buyout offer\n## Takeover bid\nOn April 14, 2022, Musk submitted a non-binding proposal to Twitter's board of directors, offering to acquire the company for $54.20 per share, valuing Twitter at approximately $43 billion.

These acts were instrumental in establishing the authority of the government over the armed forces and preventing insubordination and mutinies. This article provides an overview of the background, passage, and renewal of the Mutiny Acts, as well as their role in shaping the British military.\n\n#Background\n\nPrior to the 17th century, the English military was governed by a complex system of laws and regulations, which often led to confusion and conflicts. The medieval feudal system, where lords and nobles maintained their own private armies, had largely given way to a centralized military force, but the rules governing this force were not clearly defined. As the British Empire expanded, the need for a more effective and efficient military organization became increasingly important.\n\nIn 1641, the English Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required the army to be disbanded and reassembled every three years. However, this act did not provide sufficient authority to maintain discipline within the military. It was not until the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that the first Mutiny Act was passed, marking the beginning of a new era in military governance.\n\n#Passage of the first Mutiny Act\n\nThe first Mutiny Act was passed in 1689, during the reign of William III. This act was designed to maintain discipline within the British Army and to prevent mutinies. The act established a clear hierarchy of authority, with the monarch at the top and a system of courts-martial to try soldiers accused of offenses. The act also defined the powers of military officers, including their authority to punish soldiers for disobedience and neglect of duty.\n\nThe passage of the first Mutiny Act marked an important milestone in the development of the British military. For the first time, the government had established a clear and comprehensive system of governance for the armed forces. The act also provided a framework for the expansion of the British Empire, as a disciplined and well-organized military was essential for the maintenance of colonial rule.\n\n#Renewal of the Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Mutiny Acts were initially passed as temporary measures, but they were repeatedly renewed and updated over the years. The acts were typically renewed for a period of one year, although some were extended for longer periods. The renewal of the Mutiny Acts became an annual ritual, with some minor amendments and changes being made each year.\n\nThe renewal of the Mutiny Acts served several purposes. Firstly, it allowed the government to maintain control over the military and to ensure that discipline was maintained. Secondly, it provided an opportunity for the government to update and refine the laws governing the military. Finally, the renewal of the Mutiny Acts helped to reinforce the authority of the government over the armed forces.\n\n#The Quartering Acts\n\nThe Quartering Acts were a series of laws passed in the 18th century to provide for the quartering of soldiers in the American colonies. The acts were designed to provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of maintaining a military presence in the colonies. However, they were deeply unpopular among the colonists, who saw them as an attempt to impose British rule on the colonies.\n\nThe Quartering Acts were closely linked to the Mutiny Acts, as they provided for the quartering of soldiers who were subject to the Mutiny Acts. The Quartering Acts also reinforced the authority of the government over the military, as they provided a means of maintaining discipline and control over soldiers stationed in the colonies.\n\n#List\n\n##England\n\n* Mutiny Act 1689\n* Mutiny Act 1690\n* Mutiny Act 1691\n* Mutiny Act 1692\n* Mutiny Act 1693\n* Mutiny Act 1694\n\n##Great Britain\n\n* Mutiny Act 1701\n* Mutiny Act 1702\n* Mutiny Act 1703\n* Mutiny Act 1704\n* Mutiny Act 1705\n* Mutiny Act 1706\n\n##United Kingdom\n\n###1800s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1800\n* Mutiny Act 1801\n* Mutiny Act 1802\n* Mutiny Act 1803\n* Mutiny Act 1804\n* Mutiny Act 1805\n\n###1810s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1810\n* Mutiny Act 1811\n* Mutiny Act 1812\n* Mutiny Act 1813\n* Mutiny Act 1814\n* Mutiny Act 1815\n\n###1820s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1820\n* Mutiny Act 1821\n* Mutiny Act 1822\n* Mutiny Act 1823\n* Mutiny Act 1824\n* Mutiny Act 1825\n\n###1830s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1830\n* Mutiny Act 1831\n* Mutiny Act 1832\n* Mutiny Act 1833\n* Mutiny Act 1834\n* Mutiny Act 1835\n\n###1840s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1840\n* Mutiny Act 1841\n* Mutiny Act 1842\n* Mutiny Act 1843\n* Mutiny Act 1844\n* Mutiny Act 1845\n\n###1850s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1850\n* Mutiny Act 1851\n* Mutiny Act 1852\n* Mutiny Act 1853\n* Mutiny Act 1854\n* Mutiny Act 1855\n\n###1860s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1860\n* Mutiny Act 1861\n* Mutiny Act 1862\n* Mutiny Act 1863\n* Mutiny Act 1864\n* Mutiny Act 1865\n\n###1870s\n\n* Mutiny Act 1870\n* Mutiny Act 1871\n* Mutiny Act 1872\n* Mutiny Act 1873\n* Mutiny Act 1874\n* Mutiny Act 1875\n\n#Marine Mutiny Acts\n\nThe Marine Mutiny Acts were a series of laws passed to govern the Royal Marines.

During the two-day period, a series of tornadoes touched down across Texas and Oklahoma, causing widespread damage and disruption. This article provides an overview of the meteorological conditions that led to the outbreak, the confirmed tornadoes, and the impacts of the event.\n\n# Meteorological Synopsis\n\nA strong low-pressure system developed over the Rocky Mountains on November 3, 2022, and began to move eastward, bringing with it a cold front and a dry line. As the system interacted with the warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, it created a highly unstable atmosphere, conducive to thunderstorm development. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Moderate Risk (4/5) for severe weather on November 4, indicating a significant threat of tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.\n\nAs the cold front and dry line pushed eastward, they interacted with the warm, moist air, creating a focal point for thunderstorm development. The SPC upgraded the risk to High Risk (5/5) for parts of Texas and Oklahoma, indicating a high likelihood of long-lived tornadoes and significant damage. The outbreak occurred during the late afternoon and evening hours of November 4 and the early morning hours of November 5.\n\n# Confirmed Tornadoes\n\nA total of 11 tornadoes were confirmed during the outbreak, with the majority occurring on November 4.\n\n## November 4 Event\n\nThe first tornado of the outbreak touched down at 4:45 PM CST in Fannin County, Texas. The tornado, classified as EF1, caused minor damage and injured one person. Over the next few hours, multiple tornadoes touched down across Texas and Oklahoma, including a long-lived EF3 tornado that affected several counties in Texas.\n\n## November 5 Event\n\nThe tornado activity continued into the early morning hours of November 5, with several tornadoes touching down in Oklahoma. The most significant tornado of the day was an EF2 that affected parts of McCurtain County, Oklahoma.\n\n## Brookston–Caviness–Midcity–Arthur City, Texas/Sawyer, Oklahoma\n\nThis long-lived tornado, classified as EF3, touched down at 6:20 PM CST in Fannin County, Texas, and remained on the ground for approximately 45 miles.

{"title": "Yeti_Airlines_Flight_691", "content": "#Accident\n#Aircraft\n#Passengers and crew\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n##Preliminary report\n##Final report\n#See also\n#Notes\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Yeti Airlines Flight 691 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight that crashed on January 15, 2023, while attempting to land at Pokhara International Airport in Pokhara, Nepal. The accident resulted in the deaths of all 72 people on board, making it one of the deadliest aviation accidents in Nepalese history.\n\n# Accident\n\nThe flight, operated by an ATR 72-500 aircraft, was flying from Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu to Pokhara International Airport. The flight departed Kathmandu at 10:33 local time and was scheduled to arrive at Pokhara at 10:55. However, at 11:10, the aircraft crashed into the Seti River gorge, approximately 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) from the airport.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that the aircraft was flying low and appeared to be experiencing technical difficulties before crashing. The impact was severe, and the aircraft was completely destroyed. Rescue efforts were hindered by the remote location and difficult terrain.\n\n# Aircraft\n\nThe aircraft involved in the accident was an ATR 72-500, registration 9N-ANC, manufactured in 2007. The aircraft had accumulated over 36,000 flight hours and had undergone routine maintenance checks before the accident. The ATR 72-500 is a twin-engine turboprop aircraft commonly used for short-haul flights.\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and a flight data recorder (FDR), which were recovered from the crash site. The data from these recorders was crucial in the investigation into the cause of the accident.\n\n# Passengers and crew\n\nThere were 72 people on board the flight, including four crew members. The passengers included Nepalese nationals, as well as citizens of several foreign countries, including India, South Korea, and Australia. The crew consisted of two pilots, a cabin crew member, and a flight engineer.\n\nThe pilots were experienced, with the captain having over 5,000 hours of flight experience and the first officer having over 1,500 hours. The cabin crew member was also experienced, having worked for the airline for several years.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe accident was met with widespread shock and grief in Nepal. The government declared a national day of mourning, and flags were flown at half-mast across the country. The airline also issued a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nRescue efforts were coordinated by the Nepalese government, with assistance from international agencies. The crash site was difficult to access, and rescue teams had to navigate challenging terrain to reach the site.\n\n# Investigation\n\nThe investigation into the accident was led by the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority (CAAN), with assistance from international agencies, including the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).\n\n## Preliminary report\n\nThe preliminary report into the accident was released on January 25, 2023. The report noted that the aircraft had been experiencing technical difficulties before the crash, including issues with the autopilot system. The report also noted that the pilots had been attempting to manually control the aircraft before the crash.\n\nThe report did not identify a definitive cause of the accident but highlighted several factors that may have contributed to the crash. These included the technical difficulties experienced by the aircraft, as well as the challenging weather conditions in the area.\n\n## Final report\n\nThe final report into the accident was released on June 15, 2023. The report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was a combination of technical difficulties and human error. The report noted that the pilots had been attempting to manually control the aircraft after the autopilot system failed but had lost control of the aircraft due to spatial disorientation.\n\nThe report also noted that the challenging weather conditions in the area, including low visibility and strong winds, had contributed to the accident. The report made several recommendations for improving aviation safety in Nepal, including the implementation of more robust maintenance procedures and the provision of additional training for pilots.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\n* Aviation safety in Nepal\n* Yeti Airlines\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most up-to-date information on the accident.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yeti_Airlines_Flight_691\" following this outline:\n\n#Accident\n#Aircraft\n#Passengers and crew\n#Aftermath\n#Investigation\n##Preliminary report\n##Final report\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1721, Davis would go on to establish himself as one of the most prominent printers in the colony, producing various publications, including the North Carolina Gazette and The North Carolina Magazine.\n\n# Early and family life\n\nJames Davis was born in 1721 in Pennsylvania to a family of modest means. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he received some formal education, which would later serve him well in his printing career. Davis's family relocated to North Carolina in the 1730s, settling in the growing port city of New Bern. Here, Davis would begin his apprenticeship as a printer under the guidance of a local printer.\n\nIn 1745, Davis married Elizabeth Blount, a member of a prominent local family. The couple would go on to have several children together, and their family would play an important role in Davis's personal and professional life.\n\n# Printing career\n\nDavis's printing career spanned several decades and saw him establish himself as one of the leading printers in North Carolina.\n\n## North Carolina Gazette\n\nIn 1751, Davis founded the North Carolina Gazette, the colony's first newspaper. Published weekly, the Gazette provided news from across the colony, as well as international news from Europe and other parts of the American colonies. The paper quickly gained popularity, and Davis became known for his editorial commentary on local and national issues.\n\n## The North Carolina Magazine\n\nIn 1764, Davis launched The North Carolina Magazine, a monthly publication that featured articles on various subjects, including literature, science, and politics. The magazine was aimed at a more refined audience and provided a platform for local writers and thinkers to share their ideas.\n\n## Counterfeiting allegations\n\nIn 1763, Davis was accused of counterfeiting, a serious offense that could have resulted in severe punishment. The allegations centered on Davis's production of paper money for the colony, which some claimed was not authorized by the colonial government. While Davis maintained his innocence, the controversy surrounding the allegations would continue to plague him for several years.\n\n# Political career\n\nIn addition to his printing career, Davis was also involved in local politics. In 1764, he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly, where he represented the interests of his constituents. Davis's time in the assembly was marked by controversy, as he clashed with other politicians over issues such as taxation and governance.\n\n# Final days and legacy\n\nJames Davis died in 1785, at the age of 64. His legacy as a printer and publisher is still celebrated today, as he played a significant role in the development of North Carolina's print industry. Despite the controversies that surrounded him, Davis remains an important figure in American colonial history.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of early American publishers and printers\n* History of journalism in the United States\n* North Carolina in the American Revolution\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is based on available historical records and may not provide a comprehensive account of James Davis's life and career.\n\n# Citations\n\nNone\n\n# Bibliography\n\nNone\n\n# External links\n\nNone", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Davis_(printer)\" following this outline:\n\n#Early and family life\n#Printing career\n##North Carolina Gazette\n##The North Carolina Magazine\n##Counterfeiting allegations\n#Political career\n#Final days and legacy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#Citations\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The case, led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, centers on the actions of several individuals, including former President Donald Trump and his allies, who allegedly engaged in a racketeering scheme to pressure state officials, create false electoral vote documents, and breach election equipment.\n\n# Background\n\n## Prior to and during election day\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election, President Trump and his campaign repeatedly made false claims about the integrity of the electoral process in Georgia. Following the election, which saw Democratic candidate Joe Biden win the state by a narrow margin, Trump and his allies intensified their efforts to contest the results. These efforts included filing lawsuits, making public statements, and engaging in behind-the-scenes pressure campaigns aimed at state officials.\n\n## Efforts to pressure Georgia state officials\n\nIn December 2020, President Trump and his allies, including then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and attorney Rudy Giuliani, began a series of calls and meetings with high-ranking Georgia state officials. The purpose of these interactions was to pressure the officials into taking actions that would alter the outcome of the election, such as convening a special session of the state legislature or appointing a new slate of electors. The officials targeted by these efforts included Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan.\n\n## Creation of false electoral vote documents\n\nAs part of their efforts to subvert the election results, Trump and his allies allegedly created false electoral vote documents, which were then submitted to the National Archives and the Georgia Secretary of State's office. These documents claimed to represent the official electoral votes of the state of Georgia, but were in fact forgeries created by Trump supporters.\n\n## Coffee County election equipment breach\n\nIn January 2021, a group of Trump supporters, including Catherine Engelbrecht and Mark Davis of the organization True the Vote, gained unauthorized access to election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia. The breach, which was allegedly facilitated by local election officials, allowed the group to copy sensitive data and compromise the security of the equipment.\n\n## Harassment of Fulton County election workers\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, Fulton County election workers, including Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, were subjected to a campaign of harassment and intimidation by Trump supporters. The harassment, which included death threats, vandalism, and public ridicule, was allegedly inspired by false claims made by Trump and his allies about the workers' role in the election.\n\n# Indictment\n\n## Charges\n\nIn August 2023, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis indicted 18 individuals, including former President Trump, on charges related to the alleged racketeering scheme. The charges include:\n\n* Racketeering\n* Solicitation of violation of oath by public officer\n* Tampering with witnesses\n* Influencing witnesses\n* Unlawful possession of ballots or voting equipment\n* False statements and writings\n\n## Defendants\n\nThe defendants in the case include:\n\n* Donald Trump\n* Mark Meadows\n* Rudy Giuliani\n* Catherine Engelbrecht\n* Mark Davis\n* Sidney Powell\n* Lin Wood\n* John Eastman\n* Boris Epshteyn\n* Kenneth Chesebro\n* Jenna Ellis\n* Alex Kaufman\n* Harrison Floyd\n* Sean McFadden\n* Michael Flynn\n* Patrick Byrne\n* Jeffrey Clark\n* Kenneth Almstead\n\n# Initial proceedings\n\n## Surrender and booking\n\nFollowing the indictment, several of the defendants surrendered to authorities and were booked into the Fulton County Jail. The defendants were later released on bond.\n\n## Arraignments\n\nThe defendants were arraigned in September 2023, at which time they entered pleas of not guilty to the charges.\n\n# Pretrial motions\n\n## Attempts to dismiss charges\n\nSeveral defendants filed motions to dismiss the charges, arguing that the indictment was flawed or that the prosecution had engaged in misconduct. These motions were denied by the trial court.\n\n## Attempts to remove to federal court\n\nSome defendants attempted to have the case removed to federal court, arguing that the charges involved federal crimes or that the prosecution was motivated by partisan politics. These attempts were unsuccessful.\n\n## Speedy trial and severance requests\n\nSeveral defendants requested a speedy trial, arguing that the prosecution had delayed the case unnecessarily. Other defendants requested severance, arguing that they should be tried separately from the other defendants. These requests were denied by the trial court.\n\n## Dismissal of solicitation and false documents charges\n\nIn October 2023, the trial court dismissed two of the charges against the defendants, including the solicitation of violation of oath by public officer charge and the false statements and writings charge.\n\n# Proceedings on prosecutorial impropriety\n\n## Background\n\nIn September 2023, several defendants filed motions alleging prosecutorial impropriety, including claims that District Attorney Willis had engaged in partisan politics or that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence.\n\n## Hearing\n\nThe trial court held a hearing on the motions, at which time the defendants presented evidence and testimony.\n\n## Ruling and aftermath\n\nThe trial court ultimately denied the motions, finding that the prosecution had not engaged in misconduct. The defendants appealed the ruling, which is currently pending.\n\n## Appeal to dismiss Fani Willis from the case\n\nThe defendants also appealed the trial court's denial of their motion to dismiss Fani Willis from the case, arguing that she had a conflict of interest or that she had engaged in misconduct. The appeal is currently pending.\n\n# Guilty pleas\n\n## Proffer video leak\n\nIn October 2023, a video of a proffer session between the prosecution and defendant Kenneth Chesebro was leaked to the media. The video showed Chesebro discussing his role in the alleged scheme and his interactions with other defendants.\n\n# Trials\n\n## Date and duration\n\nThe trial is currently scheduled to begin in January 2024 and is expected to last several months.\n\n## Procedures and potential witnesses\n\nThe trial will be a jury trial, with the prosecution presenting evidence and testimony from a range of witnesses, including state officials, election workers, and Trump allies. The defense will also present evidence and testimony, including from expert witnesses and character witnesses.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe indictment and trial have been the subject of significant media attention and public interest, with many commentators and observers weighing in on the implications of the case.\n\n# Notes\n\nThis article is a neutral, encyclopedic summary of the Georgia election racketeering prosecution.

The season began on June 1, 2023, and will end on November 30, 2023. This article documents the storms that formed during the season, as well as their effects on population centers and the environment.\n\n# Seasonal Forecasts\n\n## Pre-season forecasts\n\nPrior to the start of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, several organizations issued forecasts predicting the number of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes that would occur during the season. These forecasts were based on various climate signals, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).\n\nIn April 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted a near-normal to above-normal season, with 12-17 named storms, 5-9 hurricanes, and 2-4 major hurricanes. The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) also issued a forecast in April, predicting a 40% chance of a near-normal season, a 30% chance of an above-normal season, and a 30% chance of a below-normal season.\n\n## Mid-season forecasts\n\nIn August 2023, NOAA updated its forecast, predicting a slightly above-normal season, with 14-19 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes. The CPC also updated its forecast in August, predicting a 45% chance of a near-normal season, a 35% chance of an above-normal season, and a 20% chance of a below-normal season.\n\n# Seasonal Summary\n\n## Background\n\nThe 2023 Atlantic hurricane season was marked by a neutral ENSO phase, with neither El Niño nor La Niña conditions present.

The earthquake had a significant impact on the region, causing widespread destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people. This article provides an overview of the tectonic setting, the earthquake itself, the damage and casualties, the search and rescue efforts, the international response, and the recovery and assistance efforts.\n\n# Tectonic setting\n\nThe Al Haouz Province is located in the High Atlas Mountains, a region of significant tectonic activity. The area is situated near the boundary between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, which have been interacting for millions of years. This interaction has resulted in the formation of several major fault lines, including the Atlas Fault, which runs through the province. The Atlas Fault is a transform fault that accommodates the movement between the two plates, resulting in a high level of seismic activity in the region.\n\n# Earthquake\n\n## Mechanism\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake was a shallow, crustal earthquake with a focal depth of approximately 10 km. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale, making it one of the largest earthquakes to strike the region in recent years. The earthquake was caused by a sudden release of stress along the Atlas Fault, resulting in a significant amount of energy being released in the form of seismic waves.\n\n## Ground effects\n\nThe earthquake caused widespread ground shaking, with reports of strong shaking felt as far away as Marrakech and Fez. The shaking was particularly intense in the Al Haouz Province, where buildings, roads, and other infrastructure were severely damaged. The earthquake also triggered several landslides and rockfalls, which further exacerbated the damage.\n\n# Damage and casualties\n\nThe 2023 Al Haouz earthquake caused significant damage and loss of life. According to official reports, at least 2,000 people were killed, with many more injured. The earthquake also left thousands of people homeless, with many more affected by the destruction of infrastructure and buildings. The damage was particularly severe in rural areas, where many villages were completely destroyed.\n\n# Search and rescue\n\nSearch and rescue efforts were launched immediately after the earthquake, with teams from the Moroccan government, as well as international organizations, working to locate and rescue those trapped under the rubble. The search and rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the affected areas, as well as the lack of adequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, the search and rescue teams were able to locate and rescue many people, including those trapped in collapsed buildings.\n\n# International response\n\nThe international community responded quickly to the disaster, with many countries offering aid and assistance to Morocco. The United Nations, the European Union, and other international organizations provided financial and material support, including food, shelter, and medical supplies. Many countries also sent search and rescue teams to assist in the rescue efforts.\n\n# Recovery and assistance\n\nThe recovery and assistance efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with support from the international community. The government established a relief fund to support those affected by the earthquake, as well as a reconstruction plan to rebuild damaged infrastructure and buildings. The international community provided significant financial and material support to the recovery efforts, including funding for the reconstruction of schools, hospitals, and other critical infrastructure.\n\n# Aid and crisis management\n\n## International aid\n\nThe international community provided significant aid to Morocco in response to the earthquake. The aid included financial support, as well as material supplies, such as food, shelter, and medical equipment. Many countries also sent teams to assist in the search and rescue efforts, as well as to provide support for the recovery and reconstruction efforts.\n\n## Crisis management\n\nThe Moroccan government established a crisis management team to coordinate the response to the earthquake. The team worked to assess the damage, identify areas of need, and allocate resources to support the recovery efforts. The team also worked to coordinate the international response, including the distribution of aid and the deployment of search and rescue teams.\n\n## Protests\n\nThere were reports of protests in the aftermath of the earthquake, with many people expressing frustration with the government's response to the disaster. The protests were largely peaceful, but they highlighted the challenges facing the government in responding to the disaster.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nThe reconstruction efforts were led by the Moroccan government, with support from the international community. The government established a reconstruction plan, which included funding for the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure, as well as support for those affected by the earthquake. The plan also included measures to reduce the risk of future earthquakes, such as the implementation of building codes and the establishment of early warning systems.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Morocco\n* 2004 Chlef earthquake\n* 1960 Agadir earthquake\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n# External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Al_Haouz_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Tectonic setting\n#Earthquake\n##Mechanism\n##Ground effects\n#Damage and casualties\n#Search and rescue\n#International response\n#Recovery and assistance\n#Aid and crisis management\n##International aid\n##Crisis management\n##Protests\n##Reconstruction\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Located in present-day Thailand, the kingdom was a major center of trade, culture, and politics in the region. At its peak, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was a vast empire that controlled much of present-day Thailand, as well as parts of modern-day Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was founded in 1350 by King Ramathibodi I, who is said to have established the city of Ayutthaya as the capital. However, the origins of the kingdom are more complex, and the city of Ayutthaya was likely founded earlier.\n\n### Pre-Ayutthaya cities\n\nBefore the founding of Ayutthaya, there were several other cities in the region that played important roles in the development of the kingdom. One of these cities was Lopburi, which was an important center of trade and culture in the 13th century. Another city was Chaiya, which was the capital of the Srivijaya kingdom, a powerful maritime empire that controlled much of Southeast Asia.\n\n### The traditional founding of Ayutthaya\n\nAccording to legend, King Ramathibodi I founded the city of Ayutthaya in 1350 after a dream in which he was told to build a city at the confluence of the Chao Phraya, Pa Sak, and Lopburi rivers. The king is said to have named the city after the ancient Indian city of Ayodhya, which was the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama.\n\n## Early maritime dominance\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was a major maritime power, controlling much of the trade in Southeast Asia. The kingdom's fleet of ships sailed to ports in China, India, and Southeast Asia, trading goods such as rice, fish, and spices. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, was an important center of trade and commerce, with merchants from all over the region coming to buy and sell goods.\n\n## Age of warfare\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was involved in a series of wars with neighboring kingdoms, including the Burmese kingdom of Taungoo and the Cambodian kingdom of Angkor. These wars weakened the kingdom and led to a decline in its power and influence.\n\n### Transition to a hinterland state\n\nAs the Ayutthaya Kingdom's maritime power declined, the kingdom began to focus more on its internal development, becoming a more traditional hinterland state. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, became a center of culture and learning, with many temples and monasteries being built.\n\n### Centralization and dominance of the Northern lords\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom became more centralized, with the king holding more power and the nobility playing a more important role in government. The Northern lords, who controlled much of the kingdom's land and resources, became increasingly powerful, and the kingdom became more of a feudal state.\n\n### First Burmese wars\n\nIn the 16th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was involved in a series of wars with the Burmese kingdom of Taungoo. These wars were sparked by the Burmese kingdom's attempts to expand its territory and control the trade in the region.\n\n## Peace and commerce\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ayutthaya Kingdom experienced a period of peace and prosperity, with the kingdom's economy growing and its culture flourishing. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, became a major center of trade and commerce, with merchants from all over the region coming to buy and sell goods.\n\n### Later Phitsanulok dynasty to early Prasat Thong dynasty\n\nIn the 17th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was ruled by the Phitsanulok dynasty, which was known for its wise and just rulers. The dynasty's most famous ruler was King Narai, who ruled from 1656 to 1688 and was known for his diplomatic and military skills.\n\n### Persian and French influences\n\nIn the 17th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was influenced by Persian and French culture, with many Persian and French merchants and diplomats visiting the kingdom. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, became a center of learning and culture, with many schools and monasteries being built.\n\n## Late Ayutthaya period\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom began to decline, with the kingdom's economy and military weakening. The kingdom was also affected by internal conflicts and corruption.\n\n### Continued prosperity and increased Chinese connections\n\nDespite the kingdom's decline, the Ayutthaya Kingdom continued to experience prosperity and growth, with the kingdom's economy growing and its culture flourishing. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, became a major center of trade and commerce, with merchants from all over the region coming to buy and sell goods.\n\n### Succession conflicts and corruption\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was affected by succession conflicts and corruption, with many nobles and officials vying for power and wealth. The kingdom's economy and military weakened, and the kingdom became more vulnerable to external threats.\n\n### Introduction of capitalism, rise of commoners, and proto-nationalism\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was introduced to capitalism, with many merchants and traders coming to the kingdom to buy and sell goods. The kingdom's commoners, who had previously been excluded from power and wealth, began to rise to prominence, and the kingdom experienced a period of proto-nationalism, with many people identifying themselves as \"Siamese\".\n\n### Nobility and Buddhism\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom's nobility continued to play an important role in government and society, with many nobles serving as officials and advisors to the king. The kingdom's Buddhist monasteries and temples continued to be important centers of learning and culture.\n\n### Military and political situation to 1759\n\nIn the 18th century, the Ayutthaya Kingdom's military and political situation became increasingly unstable, with many external threats and internal conflicts weakening the kingdom.\n\n## Fall of Ayutthaya\n\nIn 1767, the Ayutthaya Kingdom was conquered by the Burmese kingdom of Konbaung, which had been expanding its territory and control in the region. The kingdom's capital, Ayutthaya, was sacked and many of its inhabitants were killed or taken prisoner.\n\n### Aftermath\n\nAfter the fall of Ayutthaya, the kingdom was re-established in a new capital, Thonburi, which was founded by King Taksin in 1768. The new kingdom was known as the Thonburi Kingdom, and it continued to exist until 1782, when it was replaced by the Rattanakosin Kingdom, which was founded by King Rama I.\n\n# Government\n\n## Kings\n\nThe Ayutthaya Kingdom was ruled by a series of kings, who were known for their wisdom and justice.

The town's revered guru, Acharya (Chiranjeevi), has been fighting against Basava's tyranny, but his efforts have been in vain.\n\nEnter Siddha (Ram Charan), a former student of Acharya who has been away from the town for many years. Siddha is a skilled fighter and a passionate activist who is determined to take down Basava and free the town from his clutches. As Siddha begins his mission, he is aided by Acharya and a local woman named Neelambari (Pooja Hegde).\n\nAs the story unfolds, Siddha and Acharya's efforts to take down Basava become increasingly successful, but they also attract the attention of the police and other powerful forces.

He stated that he was inspired by the real-life struggles of the people of India, particularly in the rural areas, and wanted to make a film that would highlight their issues and inspire change.\n\n## Casting\n\nRam Charan was cast in the role of Siddha, the film's male lead, in 2020.

He stated that the film's crew had to work under strict safety protocols to minimize the risk of infection.\n\n## Legal issues\n\nIn 2021, the film's producers were sued by a Hyderabad-based writer named Rajesh Manduri, who claimed that the film's script had been plagiarized from his own work. The court ruled in favor of the producers, stating that there was no evidence to support Manduri's claims.\n\n# Music\n\nThe film's music is composed by Mani Sharma, who has previously worked on several Telugu films, including \"Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy\" and \"Gaddalakonda Ganesh.\" The film's soundtrack features five songs, including the hit single \"Lahe Lahe.\"\n\nIn an interview, Sharma revealed that he had been inspired by the film's script and had composed the music accordingly.

He stated that he hoped the film would inspire change and make a positive impact on the lives of the people.\n\n## Critical response\n\nAcharya received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's message, performances, and technical aspects. The film's cinematography, music, and action sequences were particularly praised.\n\nHowever, some critics felt that the film's script was predictable and that the film's pacing was slow.

Together, they embark on a journey to find a cure for Bhaskar's condition, while also facing threats from a group of hunters who are determined to capture the werewolf.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Varun Dhawan as Bhaskar\n* Kriti Sanon as Dr. Anika\n* Deepak Dobriyal as Janardan\n* Abhishek Banerjee as Jomin\n* Paalin Kabak as Panda\n* Dosam Beyong as Minto\n* Saurabh Shukla as Bagga\n\n##Special appearances\n\n* Neeraj Sood as Bhaskar's father\n* Suman Gupta as Bhaskar's mother\n\n#Production\n\nBhediya was announced in February 2021, with Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon set to star in the lead roles. The film was directed by Amar Kaushik, who had previously directed Stree and Roohi. The screenplay was written by Niren Bhatt, and the dialogues were written by Aparna Hoshing.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Ziro, Arunachal Pradesh, and the surrounding areas. The production team faced several challenges while filming in the remote location, including harsh weather conditions and difficulty in accessing some of the locations.\n\nThe visual effects for the film were handled by MPC, a leading visual effects studio. The werewolf design was created by the studio's team of artists and designers, who worked closely with the director and the production team to bring the character to life.\n\n#Themes\n\nBhediya explores several themes, including identity, community, and the struggle between tradition and modernity. The film's protagonist, Bhaskar, is a city boy who is forced to confront his own identity and sense of belonging when he is bitten by a wolf. As he struggles to control his newfound condition, he must also navigate the complexities of the local community, who are wary of outsiders.\n\nThe film also explores the tension between tradition and modernity, as embodied by the conflict between the local hunters and the veterinarians who are trying to help Bhaskar. The hunters represent a traditional way of thinking, while the veterinarians represent a more modern and scientific approach.\n\n#Music\n\nThe music for Bhediya was composed by Sachin-Jigar, with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya.

The film was also made available on streaming platforms, including Amazon Prime Video and Netflix.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\nBhediya received generally positive reviews from critics, with several praising the film's unique blend of horror and comedy. The film's performances, particularly those of Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon, were also praised. However, some critics felt that the film's pacing was uneven, and that the story could have been more developed.\n\n##Box office\n\nBhediya performed well at the box office, grossing over ₹100 crore in its opening weekend. The film's box office performance was seen as a success, particularly given the challenges faced by the film industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n#Notes\n\nBhediya is the third installment in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy universe, following Stree (2018) and Roohi (2021).

The conflict has its roots in the country's complex history, cultural divisions, and geopolitical tensions. The war has resulted in significant human suffering, economic losses, and a substantial impact on international relations.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\n### Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n\nUkraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country's early years were marked by political instability, economic struggles, and a deepening divide between the pro-Russian eastern regions and the pro-European western regions. The Orange Revolution in 2004, which saw the ousting of President Leonid Kuchma, was a significant turning point in Ukraine's history. The revolution led to the election of President Viktor Yushchenko, who sought to strengthen ties with Europe and reduce Russian influence.\n\n### Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n\nIn 2013, Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union, sparking widespread protests in Kyiv's Independence Square, known as the Euromaidan. The protests, which became known as the Revolution of Dignity, demanded greater European integration and an end to corruption. The protests eventually led to Yanukovych's ousting in February 2014.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, pro-Russian unrest broke out in eastern Ukraine, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The unrest was fueled by concerns among the predominantly Russian-speaking population about the new government's intentions and the potential loss of Russian influence.\n\n### Russian military bases in Crimea\n\nRussia has maintained a significant military presence in Crimea since the 1990s, when Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty allowing Russia to lease the Sevastopol naval base. The base was home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet, and its presence was seen as a key factor in Russia's ability to project power in the region.\n\n### Legality and declaration of war\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has raised significant questions about the legality of Russia's actions. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused Russia of violating international law, including the United Nations Charter and the Budapest Memorandum, which guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nHistory\n=======\n\n### Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n\nIn February 2014, following the ousting of President Yanukovych, Russian troops began to deploy in Crimea. The troops, who wore uniforms without insignia, quickly took control of key infrastructure, including airports and government buildings. A referendum was held on March 16, in which the majority of Crimean voters supported joining Russia. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n### War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n\n#### Pro-Russia unrest\n\nIn April 2014, pro-Russian unrest broke out in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with protesters demanding greater autonomy or independence from Ukraine. The unrest quickly escalated into armed conflict, with the formation of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).\n\n#### Armed conflict\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region was marked by intense fighting between Ukrainian government forces and the separatist militias. The conflict resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of civilians killed or displaced.\n\n#### August 2014 Russian invasion\n\nIn August 2014, Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine, marking the beginning of a full-scale invasion. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed further economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n#### Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n\nIn September 2014, Ukrainian government forces launched an offensive to retake the city of Mariupol, which had been captured by the separatists. The offensive was successful, but it was followed by a ceasefire agreement, known as the Minsk Protocol, which was signed on September 5. The ceasefire was brokered by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and was intended to bring an end to the conflict.\n\n#### End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n\nThe ceasefire agreement was short-lived, and fighting resumed in the Donbas region. In February 2015, a new ceasefire agreement, known as the Minsk II agreement, was signed. The agreement established a buffer zone between Ukrainian government forces and the separatist militias and called for the withdrawal of heavy artillery.\n\n### Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region continued at a lower intensity, with periodic outbreaks of fighting. The line of conflict stabilized, with Ukrainian government forces and the separatist militias dug in along a 400-kilometer front line.\n\n#### 2018 Kerch Strait incident\n\nIn November 2018, a confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait resulted in the capture of three Ukrainian ships and the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors. The incident was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine imposed martial law in response.\n\n#### 2019–2020\n\nThe conflict in the Donbas region continued at a low intensity, with periodic outbreaks of fighting. In 2019, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was elected on a platform of ending the conflict, but progress was slow.\n\n### Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n\n#### Prelude\n\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, Russia amassed a significant military presence along the border with Ukraine. The buildup was accompanied by a propaganda campaign, which portrayed Ukraine as a threat to Russian security.\n\n#### Escalation\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with missile strikes and ground attacks on multiple fronts. The invasion was widely condemned by the international community, and Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union imposed significant economic sanctions on Russia.\n\n#### Full-scale invasion\n\nThe invasion was marked by intense fighting, with Ukrainian government forces resisting the Russian advance. The conflict resulted in significant human suffering, with thousands of civilians killed or displaced.\n\n### Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n\nIn the months following the invasion, Ukrainian government forces launched a series of counteroffensives, which pushed the Russian military back in several key areas. The conflict stabilized, with both sides dug in along a 1,000-kilometer front line.\n\n### Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n\nIn December 2023, Russian forces launched a series of campaigns, which aimed to capture key cities and infrastructure. The campaigns were met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian government forces, who launched a counteroffensive in the Kursk region.\n\nHuman rights violations\n=====================\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been marked by significant human rights violations, including the use of torture, forced conscription, and the targeting of civilians. The conflict has also resulted in significant displacement, with millions of people forced to flee their homes.\n\nRelated issues\n==============\n\n### Spillover\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has had significant spillover effects, including the displacement of people to neighboring countries and the impact on regional stability.\n\n### Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been accompanied by disputes over gas supplies, with Russia accused of using energy as a tool of coercion. In 2022, the Nord Stream pipeline was sabotaged, resulting in significant environmental damage.\n\n### Hybrid warfare\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been marked by the use of hybrid warfare tactics, including cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, and the use of proxy forces.\n\n### Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n\nRussia has been accused of using propaganda and disinformation campaigns to shape public opinion and influence the narrative around the conflict.\n\n### Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has played a significant role in the conflict in Ukraine, with some clergy accused of supporting the separatist militias.\n\n### Russia–NATO relations\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has had significant implications for Russia–NATO relations, with tensions between the two sides at a post-Cold War high.\n\nReactions\n=========\n\n### Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n\n#### Ukrainian response\n\nUkraine condemned the annexation of Crimea, with President Oleksandr Turchynov describing it as a \"gross violation of international law.\"\n\n#### NATO and United States military response\n\nNATO and the United States condemned the annexation, with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen describing it as a \"sovereign rights violation.\"\n\n#### Financial markets\n\nThe annexation had significant implications for financial markets, with the Russian stock market falling by 10%.\n\n### Reactions to the war in Donbas\n\n#### Ukrainian public opinion\n\nUkrainian public opinion has been strongly opposed to the conflict, with many Ukrainians viewing the separatist militias as Russian proxies.\n\n#### Russian public opinion\n\nRussian public opinion has been strongly supportive of the conflict, with many Russians viewing the Ukrainian government as illegitimate.\n\n### Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n#### Ukrainian public opinion\n\nUkrainian public opinion has been strongly opposed to the invasion, with many Ukrainians viewing it as an act of aggression.\n\n#### Russian public opinion\n\nRussian public opinion has been strongly supportive of the invasion, with many Russians viewing it as a necessary measure to protect Russian security.\n\n#### United States\n\nThe United States has condemned the invasion, with President Joe Biden describing it as a \"brazen attack on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"\n\n#### Russian military suppliers\n\nSeveral countries have imposed sanctions on Russian military suppliers, including the United States, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.\n\n#### United Nations\n\nThe United Nations has condemned the invasion, with Secretary-General António Guterres describing it as a \"violation of the United Nations Charter.\"\n\nSee also\n========\n\n* Ukraine–Russia relations\n* Russian irredentism\n* 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine\n* War in Donbas\n* Russian annexation of Crimea\n* 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nFurther reading\n==============\n\nExternal links\n==============", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Russo-Ukrainian_War\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Independent Ukraine and the Orange Revolution\n##Euromaidan, Revolution of Dignity, and pro-Russian unrest\n##Russian military bases in Crimea\n##Legality and declaration of war\n#History\n##Russian annexation of Crimea (2014)\n##War in the Donbas (2014–2015)\n###Pro-Russia unrest\n###Armed conflict\n###August 2014 Russian invasion\n###Mariupol offensive and first Minsk ceasefire\n###End of 2014 and Minsk II agreement\n##Line of conflict stabilizes (2015–2022)\n###2018 Kerch Strait incident\n###2019–2020\n##Full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)\n###Prelude\n###Escalation\n###Full-scale invasion\n##Ukrainian counteroffensives and stalemate (2022–2023)\n##Russian campaigns and Ukrainian Kursk offensive (1 December 2023 – present)\n#Human rights violations\n#Related issues\n##Spillover\n##Gas disputes and Nord Stream sabotage\n##Hybrid warfare\n##Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns\n##Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine\n##Russia–NATO relations\n#Reactions\n##Reactions to the Russian annexation of Crimea\n###Ukrainian response\n###NATO and United States military response\n###Financial markets\n##Reactions to the war in Donbas\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n##Reactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n###Ukrainian public opinion\n###Russian public opinion\n###United States\n###Russian military suppliers\n###United Nations\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale, with a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The disaster caused widespread destruction, loss of life, and displacement of people in the affected areas.\n\n#Tectonic setting\n\nIndonesia is a seismically active region, located at the boundary between the Eurasian and Australian tectonic plates. The country is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is an area prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The western part of Java Island, where the earthquake occurred, is an area of high seismic activity due to the subduction of the Australian plate beneath the Eurasian plate. The subduction process is responsible for the formation of the Java Trench, a deep-sea trench located south of the island.\n\nThe region around Cianjur is characterized by a complex geological structure, with multiple faults and fractures that can produce earthquakes. The area is also home to several active volcanoes, including Mount Gede and Mount Salak, which are located to the northwest and west of the epicenter, respectively. The volcanic activity in the region is a result of the subduction process, which causes the Earth's crust to melt and produce magma.\n\n#Earthquake\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale, with a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The earthquake was a shallow one, which meant that the seismic energy was released close to the surface, resulting in more damage and loss of life. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Cianjur Regency, approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) southwest of the city of Cianjur.\n\nThe earthquake was a result of a thrust faulting mechanism, which occurs when one plate is pushed beneath another. In this case, the Australian plate was pushed beneath the Eurasian plate, resulting in the release of seismic energy. The earthquake was characterized by a series of aftershocks, with the largest one having a magnitude of 3.6 on the Richter scale.\n\n#Impact\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake had a significant impact on the affected areas. The earthquake caused widespread destruction, with many buildings, including homes, schools, and hospitals, collapsing or suffering significant damage. The disaster also caused landslides and soil liquefaction, which further exacerbated the damage.\n\nThe earthquake also caused a power outage in the affected areas, with many residents left without electricity or communication services. The disaster also disrupted transportation services, with many roads and highways closed due to damage or landslides.\n\n#Casualties\n\nThe 2022 West Java earthquake resulted in a significant loss of life, with over 600 people confirmed dead. Many more were injured, with over 1,000 people treated in hospitals for their injuries. The disaster also caused widespread displacement, with many people left without homes or access to basic necessities.\n\n##Search and rescue\n\nThe search and rescue efforts were led by the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), with assistance from local authorities, emergency services, and international organizations. The rescue efforts were hampered by the remote location of the affected areas and the lack of access to the area due to damage to roads and infrastructure.\n\nThe rescue teams worked tirelessly to search for survivors, with many people trapped under rubble or debris. The rescue efforts were also assisted by sniffer dogs, which were used to locate survivors and recover bodies.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 West Java earthquake saw a significant response from the Indonesian government and international organizations. The government declared a state of emergency in the affected areas, with military personnel deployed to assist with the relief efforts.\n\n##Reconstruction\n\nThe reconstruction efforts are ongoing, with the Indonesian government committing to rebuilding the affected areas. The government has pledged to provide assistance to those affected by the disaster, including financial support and housing assistance.\n\nThe reconstruction efforts are being led by the Indonesian government, with assistance from international organizations and non-governmental organizations. The efforts are focused on rebuilding homes, schools, and hospitals, as well as restoring basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and utilities.\n\n#Response\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was swift, with the Indonesian government and international organizations providing assistance to the affected areas.\n\n##International aid\n\nThe international community provided significant assistance to the affected areas, with many countries pledging aid and support. The aid included financial assistance, food, shelter, and medical supplies.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) played a significant role in the response efforts, with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinating the international response. The UN also provided funding and resources to support the relief efforts.\n\n#Controversy\n\nThe response to the 2022 West Java earthquake was not without controversy, with some critics arguing that the Indonesian government was slow to respond to the disaster. Others argued that the government's response was inadequate, with many people left without access to basic necessities.\n\nThere were also concerns about the distribution of aid, with some reports suggesting that aid was not reaching those who needed it most. The controversy surrounding the response efforts highlighted the need for more effective disaster management and response mechanisms in Indonesia.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Indonesia\n* 2004 Sumatran earthquake and tsunami\n* 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake\n* 2010 Sumatran earthquake and tsunami\n* 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a factual account of the 2022 West Java earthquake and its impact on the affected areas.

The storm caused significant damage and loss of life in these countries, particularly in the Philippines where it made landfall. Megi was the third tropical storm of the 2010 Pacific typhoon season.\n\n#Meteorological history\n\n##Formation and intensification\nMegi formed as a tropical depression on April 13, 2010, over the western Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 km (620 mi) east of the Philippines. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Depression 03W.\n\nThe depression slowly intensified as it moved westward, becoming a tropical storm on April 14, with the JMA assigning the name Megi. The JTWC followed suit, upgrading the system to a tropical storm. Megi continued to strengthen, reaching its peak intensity on April 17, with maximum sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 975 hPa (28.79 inHg).\n\n##Landfall and weakening\nMegi made landfall in the Philippines on April 18, specifically in the province of Isabela. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread damage and power outages. After making landfall, Megi began to weaken, with its winds decreasing to 120 km/h (75 mph) and its pressure increasing to 985 hPa (29.09 inHg).\n\n##Re-emergence and re-intensification\nAfter crossing the Philippines, Megi re-emerged into the South China Sea, where it began to re-intensify. The JMA reported that Megi regained its strength, with maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 980 hPa (28.94 inHg). However, the JTWC did not re-classify Megi as a tropical storm, instead maintaining its status as a tropical depression.\n\n##Landfall in Taiwan and China\nMegi made landfall in Taiwan on April 20, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall to the island. The storm then moved into China, specifically in the province of Fujian, where it caused further damage and disruption.\n\n##Dissipation\nMegi dissipated on April 23, as it moved inland and encountered unfavorable weather conditions. The JMA and JTWC issued their final advisories on the system, marking the end of Megi's meteorological history.\n\n#Preparations\n\n##Philippines\nThe Philippine government took proactive measures to prepare for Megi's landfall. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) activated its emergency response protocols, deploying personnel and equipment to affected areas. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued public storm warning signals, advising residents of the potential dangers posed by the storm.\n\n##Taiwan\nThe Taiwanese government also took steps to prepare for Megi's landfall. The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued storm warnings, advising residents of the potential impacts of the storm. The Ministry of the Interior activated its emergency response protocols, deploying personnel and equipment to affected areas.\n\n##China\nThe Chinese government prepared for Megi's landfall by activating its emergency response protocols. The National Meteorological Center (NMC) issued storm warnings, advising residents of the potential impacts of the storm. The Ministry of Civil Affairs deployed personnel and equipment to affected areas.\n\n#Impact\n\n##Philippines\nMegi caused significant damage and loss of life in the Philippines. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread power outages and damage to infrastructure. According to official reports, Megi caused 32 deaths and 2,500 injuries, with over 200,000 people displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of PHP 2.5 billion (USD 50 million).\n\n##Taiwan\nMegi caused significant damage and disruption in Taiwan. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread power outages and damage to infrastructure. According to official reports, Megi caused 5 deaths and 200 injuries, with over 10,000 people displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of TWD 1.5 billion (USD 50 million).\n\n##China\nMegi caused significant damage and disruption in China. The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing widespread power outages and damage to infrastructure. According to official reports, Megi caused 10 deaths and 500 injuries, with over 50,000 people displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with estimated losses of CNY 1.5 billion (USD 220 million).\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Relief efforts\nThe Philippine government launched relief efforts to assist affected communities. The NDRRMC coordinated the distribution of food, water, and shelter to displaced persons. The Philippine Red Cross also participated in relief efforts, providing medical assistance and shelter to affected communities.\n\n##Reconstruction efforts\nThe Philippine government initiated reconstruction efforts to repair damaged infrastructure. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) began repairing roads and bridges, while the National Electrification Administration (NEA) worked to restore power lines.\n\n##Economic impact\nMegi had a significant economic impact on the Philippines, Taiwan, and China. The storm caused widespread damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and industry, resulting in estimated losses of over USD 1 billion.\n\n#Retirement\n\nThe name \"Megi\" was retired from the list of names for tropical cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) retired the name due to the significant damage and loss of life caused by the storm.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of tropical cyclones in the Philippines\n* List of tropical cyclones in Taiwan\n* List of tropical cyclones in China\n* 2010 Pacific typhoon season\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)\n\n#External links\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tropical_Storm_Megi\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n#Impact\n#Aftermath\n#Retirement\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is set in 1920s Hollywood, during the transition from silent films to talkies, and explores the rise and fall of several characters in the film industry.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film takes place in 1926, during the height of the Roaring Twenties, and follows the interconnected lives of several characters in the film industry. The story centers around Jack Conrad (played by Brad Pitt), a fading silent film star struggling to adapt to the new world of talkies. Jack's life is marked by excess and decadence, and he finds himself at the center of a scandal that threatens to destroy his career.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny Torres (played by Diego Calva), a young and ambitious Mexican immigrant, rises through the ranks of the film industry, becoming a key player in the transition to talkies. Manny's journey is marked by his own personal struggles, including his complicated relationships with his family and his identity as a Mexican immigrant in a predominantly white industry.\n\nThe film also follows the story of Nellie LaRoy (played by Margot Robbie), a young and ambitious actress who becomes a star of the new talkies. Nellie's rise to fame is marked by her fierce determination and her willingness to do whatever it takes to succeed, but she also struggles with the pressures of fame and the objectification of her body.\n\nThroughout the film, these characters' lives intersect and collide, as they navigate the changing landscape of the film industry. Along the way, they must confront their own personal demons and the darker side of the Hollywood dream.\n\n#Cast\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Brad Pitt as Jack Conrad, a fading silent film star\n* Diego Calva as Manny Torres, a young and ambitious Mexican immigrant\n* Margot Robbie as Nellie LaRoy, a young and ambitious actress\n* Jovan Adepo as Sidney Palmer, a young and talented trumpet player\n* Li Jun Li as Lady Fay Zhu, a Chinese actress and singer\n* Jean Smart as Elinor St. John, a veteran actress and mentor to Nellie\n* Olivia Wilde as Ina Conrad, Jack's wife and a former actress\n* Spike Jonze as Otto von Strassberger, a German filmmaker and artist\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nDamien Chazelle began working on the script for Babylon in 2019, drawing inspiration from his own experiences in the film industry and his fascination with the history of Hollywood. Chazelle has stated that he was drawn to the idea of exploring the transition from silent films to talkies, and the ways in which this change affected the lives of those working in the industry.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography on Babylon began in July 2021, with a budget of over $80 million. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, with additional filming taking place in Mexico City. Chazelle worked closely with his cast and crew to recreate the look and feel of 1920s Hollywood, using a combination of practical sets and visual effects.\n\n##Music\n\nThe film's score was composed by Justin Hurwitz, who has collaborated with Chazelle on several previous projects. The score incorporates a range of musical styles, from jazz and blues to classical and pop. The film also features several original songs, performed by the cast and other artists.\n\n#Themes\n\nBabylon explores a range of themes, including the corrupting influence of power and fame, the tension between tradition and innovation, and the struggle for identity and belonging in a rapidly changing world. The film also touches on issues of racism and sexism, highlighting the ways in which these forms of oppression have been embedded in the film industry from its earliest days.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nBabylon was released in theaters on December 23, 2022, by Paramount Pictures. The film received a wide release, opening on over 3,000 screens in the United States and Canada.\n\n##Home media\n\nBabylon was released on digital platforms on March 21, 2023, and on DVD and Blu-ray on April 18, 2023.\n\n##Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was led by Paramount Pictures, with a focus on highlighting the film's epic scope and its all-star cast. The campaign included a range of trailers and TV spots, as well as promotional partnerships with brands such as Apple and Dolby.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nBabylon grossed over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $120 million worldwide, on a budget of over $80 million. While the film did not achieve major commercial success, it did receive critical acclaim and has since developed a cult following.\n\n##Critical response\n\nBabylon received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's ambition, its performances, and its technical achievements. The film holds a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on over 200 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on over 40 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\n#Accolades\n\nBabylon received several awards and nominations, including:\n\n* Academy Awards: 3 nominations (Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design)\n* Golden Globe Awards: 2 nominations (Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director)\n* BAFTA Awards: 5 nominations (Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design)\n\n#See also\n\n* The Artist (2011)\n* La La Land (2016)\n* Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)\n* Mank (2020)\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Babylon_(2022_film)\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development\n##Filming\n##Music\n#Themes\n#Release\n##Theatrical\n##Home media\n##Marketing\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Accolades\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Fuzzball_(string_theory)", "content": "#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Fuzzball (string theory)\n\nIn string theory, a fuzzball is a hypothetical, grainy, and indistinct object that is thought to be the fundamental unit of the universe. The concept of fuzzballs was introduced as a possible solution to the black hole information paradox, which questions what happens to the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole. The fuzzball proposal suggests that the information is preserved, but in a highly scrambled and encoded form, which is reflected in the grainy, indistinct nature of the fuzzball.\n\nPhysical properties\n\n### String theory and composition\n\nAccording to string theory, a fuzzball is composed of a collection of strings that vibrate at different frequencies, giving rise to the various particles that make up the universe. The strings are thought to be tiny, on the order of Planck lengths, and are too small to be observed directly. However, the vibrations of the strings can be felt at larger scales, giving rise to the particles that we observe in the universe.\n\nThe composition of a fuzzball is thought to be similar to that of a black hole, but with a few key differences. Like a black hole, a fuzzball has a horizon, which marks the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. However, unlike a black hole, a fuzzball is thought to be grainy and indistinct, with a surface that is made up of a collection of tiny, vibrating strings.\n\n### Densities\n\nOne of the key features of a fuzzball is its density. According to string theory, a fuzzball is incredibly dense, with a density that is similar to that of a black hole. However, unlike a black hole, a fuzzball is thought to be made up of a collection of tiny, vibrating strings, rather than a single, point-like singularity.\n\nThe density of a fuzzball is thought to be on the order of Planck densities, which are incredibly high. To put this in perspective, the density of a typical star is on the order of 10^3 kg/m^3, while the density of a black hole is on the order of 10^20 kg/m^3. The density of a fuzzball is thought to be even higher, on the order of 10^40 kg/m^3.\n\n### Neutron star collapse\n\nAnother key feature of a fuzzball is its behavior during the collapse of a neutron star. According to string theory, when a neutron star collapses, it will eventually reach a point at which the density becomes so high that the strings that make up the star begin to vibrate at incredibly high frequencies. At this point, the star will begin to break down into a collection of tiny, vibrating strings, which will eventually form a fuzzball.\n\nThe collapse of a neutron star into a fuzzball is thought to be a complex and highly dynamic process, involving the interaction of a large number of strings. However, the end result is thought to be a fuzzball, which is an incredibly dense and grainy object that is made up of a collection of tiny, vibrating strings.\n\nInformation paradox\n\nThe information paradox is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics, which questions what happens to the information contained in matter that falls into a black hole. The paradox arises because the laws of quantum mechanics suggest that information cannot be destroyed, but the laws of general relativity suggest that anything that falls into a black hole will be lost forever.\n\nThe fuzzball proposal offers a possible solution to the information paradox, by suggesting that the information is preserved, but in a highly scrambled and encoded form. According to this proposal, the information is encoded on the surface of the fuzzball, in a way that is similar to the way that information is encoded on a hologram.\n\nThe idea is that the information that falls into a black hole is not lost, but rather it becomes encoded on the surface of the fuzzball, in a way that is difficult to decipher. However, the information is still present, and it can be recovered, in principle, by decoding the information that is encoded on the surface of the fuzzball.\n\nTestability of the theory\n\nOne of the key challenges in testing the fuzzball proposal is that it is a highly theoretical concept, which is difficult to observe directly. However, there are several ways in which the theory can be tested, indirectly.\n\nOne way to test the theory is to look for evidence of the grainy, indistinct nature of fuzzballs. According to the proposal, fuzzballs should have a surface that is made up of a collection of tiny, vibrating strings, which should give rise to a grainy, indistinct appearance.\n\nAnother way to test the theory is to look for evidence of the preservation of information in black holes. According to the proposal, information that falls into a black hole should be preserved, but in a highly scrambled and encoded form. By studying the behavior of black holes, it may be possible to observe evidence of this preservation of information.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fuzzball_(string_theory)\" following this outline:\n\n#Physical properties\n##String theory and composition\n##Densities\n##Neutron star collapse\n#Information paradox\n#Testability of the theory\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
