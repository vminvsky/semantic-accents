This article provides an overview of the history, major events, and notable groups involved in organized crime in London, Ontario.\n\n# Overview\n\nOrganized crime in London, Ontario, is a multifaceted phenomenon that has evolved over the years, influenced by various factors such as demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and law enforcement strategies. The city's location, situated at the intersection of major highways and near the US-Canada border, has made it a hub for illicit activities, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, and money laundering.

It was the seventh election to the Assembly since its establishment in 1998. The election saw 90 members elected from 18 constituencies, each electing five members.\n\n# Background\n\n## Electoral Events\n\nThe 2022 election was the first to be held since the 2017 Assembly election, which saw the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) emerge as the largest party, followed closely by Sinn Féin. The 2017 election was held early due to the resignation of the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, in protest over the DUP's handling of the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.\n\n## Leadership Changes\n\nSince the 2017 election, there have been significant changes in the leadership of the main parties. In 2018, Gerry Adams stepped down as leader of Sinn Féin and was succeeded by Mary Lou McDonald. The DUP also saw a change in leadership, with Arlene Foster resigning in 2021 and being succeeded by Edwin Poots, who was later replaced by Jeffrey Donaldson.\n\n## Northern Ireland Protocol\n\nThe election was held against the backdrop of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a key part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU. The protocol has been a source of controversy, with the DUP and other unionist parties opposing its provisions, which they argue create a border in the Irish Sea and threaten Northern Ireland's place in the UK.\n\n## Calls for Early Election\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, there were calls for an early election due to the ongoing stalemate at Stormont, the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The DUP had refused to nominate a deputy First Minister, effectively blocking the operation of the Assembly, in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\n# Candidates\n\nA total of 239 candidates stood in the election, representing 16 parties. The DUP, Sinn Féin, and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) were among the main parties contesting the election.\n\n# Members Not Seeking Re-Election\n\nA number of sitting members announced that they would not be seeking re-election. These included DUP MLA Jim Wells and Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe election campaign focused on a range of issues, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, healthcare, and the economy. The DUP and other unionist parties campaigned on their opposition to the protocol, while Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties emphasized the need for its implementation.\n\n# Opinion Polls\n\nOpinion polls in the run-up to the election suggested that Sinn Féin was likely to emerge as the largest party, with the DUP and the Alliance Party also performing strongly.\n\n# Results\n\n## Distribution of Seats by Constituency\n\nThe results of the election saw Sinn Féin emerge as the largest party, winning 27 seats. The DUP won 25 seats, followed by the Alliance Party with 17 seats. The UUP won 9 seats, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) won 8 seats.\n\n## Share of First-Preference Votes\n\nSinn Féin won 29.0% of first-preference votes, followed by the DUP with 21.3%. The Alliance Party won 12.2% of first-preference votes, while the UUP won 11.2%.\n\n## Incumbents Defeated\n\nA number of incumbent MLAs lost their seats in the election, including DUP MLA Gary Middleton and UUP MLA John Stewart.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe election result saw Sinn Féin emerge as the largest party, with Michelle O'Neill becoming the first nationalist First Minister of Northern Ireland. The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson became the deputy First Minister. The election marked a significant shift in the balance of power at Stormont, with the Alliance Party emerging as a key player in the Assembly.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election\n* Northern Ireland Protocol\n* Brexit\n\n# Footnotes\n\nThis article uses material from the Wikipedia article \"2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election\", which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not contain any references.\n\n# External Links\n\n* Northern Ireland Assembly\n* Electoral Office for Northern Ireland\n* BBC News: Northern Ireland election", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Electoral events\n##Leadership changes\n##Northern Ireland Protocol\n##Calls for early election\n#Candidates\n#Members not seeking re-election\n#Campaign\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Distribution of seats by constituency\n##Share of first-preference votes\n##Incumbents defeated\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n#Footnotes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born with a physical disability, Laal is often ridiculed and bullied by his peers. However, he finds solace in his childhood friend Rupa, who teaches him to run. Laal's running skills earn him a scholarship to a prestigious university, where he meets the Prime Minister and becomes an accidental hero.\n\nLaal's life is a rollercoaster of events, from participating in the Indian cricket team to fighting in the Indo-Pakistani War. Throughout his journey, he remains optimistic and innocent, earning him the respect and admiration of those around him. The film's narrative is interspersed with historical events, including the Emergency, the Operation Blue Star, and the Babri Masjid demolition.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Aamir Khan as Laal Singh Chaddha\n* Kareena Kapoor as Rupa D'Souza\n* Naga Chaitanya as Bala\n* Mona Singh as Laal's mother\n* Ramandeep Singh as young Laal\n* Manav Vij as Mohammed Paaji\n* Aaryaa Sharma as Rupa's daughter\n\n#Production\n\n##Development\n\nThe project was first announced in 2018, with Aamir Khan set to star in the film. Atul Kulkarni was brought on board to write the screenplay, and Advait Chandan was hired to direct. The film's producers, Aamir Khan Productions, and Viacom18 Motion Pictures, acquired the rights to adapt Forrest Gump from Paramount Pictures.\n\n##Casting\n\nAamir Khan was the first actor to be cast in the film, and he underwent a significant transformation to play the role of Laal. Kareena Kapoor was later cast as Rupa, Laal's love interest. Naga Chaitanya made his Bollywood debut with the film, playing the role of Bala.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 2019 and lasted for over a year. The film was shot in various locations across India, including Chandigarh, Punjab, and Ladakh. The crew faced several challenges, including extreme weather conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n#Music\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Pritam, with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The album features six tracks, including \"Kahani,\" \"Main Ki Karaan?\", and \"Tur Kalleyan.\" The music received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's background score.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began several months before its release. Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor promoted the film on social media, sharing behind-the-scenes footage and stills. The film's trailer was released in May 2022 and received a mixed response from audiences.\n\n#Release\n\n##Theatrical\n\nLaal Singh Chaddha was released in theaters on August 11, 2022. The film received a wide release, with over 3,000 screens across India.\n\n##Distribution\n\nThe film was distributed by Viacom18 Motion Pictures and Aamir Khan Productions. Paramount Pictures, the original rights holder of Forrest Gump, was also involved in the distribution process.\n\n##Home media\n\nThe film was released on digital platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, in October 2022. The DVD and Blu-ray release followed a few weeks later.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Critical response\n\n###India\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from Indian critics. Many praised Aamir Khan's performance, but criticized the film's screenplay and direction. The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, stating that it was \"a heartwarming tale of love and friendship.\" The Hindu, however, was more critical, calling the film \"a missed opportunity.\"\n\n###International\n\nThe film received more positive reviews from international critics. The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's \"sincere and heartfelt\" portrayal of Indian history. Variety, however, noted that the film's \" innocuous\" tone made it feel \"overly simplistic.\"\n\n##Box office\n\nLaal Singh Chaddha performed moderately well at the box office. The film grossed over ₹100 crore in its opening weekend and went on to earn over ₹200 crore worldwide. However, the film's performance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and competition from other Bollywood releases.\n\n#Accolades\n\nLaal Singh Chaddha won several awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Aamir Khan) and the IIFA Award for Best Actor (Aamir Khan).\n\n#Controversy\n\nThe film was surrounded by controversy, with many criticizing the film's portrayal of Indian history and politics.

The tournament is one of the most popular and highly anticipated events in the cricket calendar, featuring the best teams and players from around the world.\n\n# History\n\n## Background\n\n### Domestic tournaments\n\nThe concept of a Twenty20 tournament was first introduced in England in 2003, with the launch of the Twenty20 Cup, a domestic tournament featuring the 18 first-class counties. The format was an instant success, with its short duration and fast-paced action appealing to a new generation of cricket fans. Other countries soon followed suit, with domestic Twenty20 tournaments being established in Australia, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, among others.\n\n### Twenty20 Internationals\n\nThe first Twenty20 International (T20I) was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2005. The format quickly gained popularity, with more and more countries playing T20Is against each other. The ICC, the governing body of cricket, recognised the potential of the format and decided to launch a global tournament.\n\n## Inaugural edition\n\nThe inaugural ICC Men's T20 World Cup was held in South Africa in 2007. The tournament featured 12 teams, including the 10 Test-playing nations at the time, plus Kenya and Scotland. The tournament was a huge success, with India defeating Pakistan in the final to win the title.\n\n## Expansion to 16 teams\n\nFor the 2009 tournament in England, the ICC decided to expand the tournament to 16 teams. The Netherlands and Ireland joined the 12 teams from the previous tournament, with the two teams competing in the Qualifier tournament to determine the final two spots.\n\n## Expansion to 20 teams\n\nIn 2014, the ICC announced that the tournament would be expanded to 20 teams for the 2016 edition in India. The Qualifier tournament was expanded to feature 14 teams, with the top six teams joining the 10 Test-playing nations in the main tournament.\n\n# Hosts\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has been hosted by six different countries since its inception in 2007.\n\n* 2007: South Africa\n* 2009: England\n* 2010: West Indies\n* 2012: Sri Lanka\n* 2014: Bangladesh\n* 2016: India\n* 2021: United Arab Emirates and Oman\n* 2022: Australia\n* 2024: United States and West Indies\n\n# Formats\n\n## Qualification\n\nThe Qualifier tournament is used to determine the final teams that will compete in the main tournament. The tournament features teams that are not automatically qualified for the main tournament, with the top teams qualifying for the main event.\n\n## Final tournament\n\nThe main tournament features the qualified teams, with the teams divided into groups and competing in a round-robin format. The top teams from each group then compete in the knockout stage, with the winners advancing to the semi-finals and final.\n\n# Trophy\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup Trophy is awarded to the winning team of the tournament. The trophy is made of silver and gold, with a height of 35.5 cm and a weight of 7.5 kg.\n\n# Attendance\n\nThe ICC Men's T20 World Cup has consistently attracted large crowds, with the 2016 tournament in India recording the highest attendance figures.

These storms can bring catastrophic damage and loss of life, and understanding their patterns and trends is crucial for predicting and preparing for their impacts. This article provides an overview of the global atmospheric and hydrological conditions that influenced the formation and development of tropical cyclones in 2022, as well as a summary of the storms that occurred in each of the world's tropical cyclone basins.\n\n# Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions\n\nThe global atmospheric and hydrological conditions in 2022 were influenced by several factors, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The ENSO cycle, which affects the Pacific Ocean, was in a neutral phase during the early part of the year but shifted to a weak El Niño event in the latter part of the year. The IOD, which affects the Indian Ocean, was in a negative phase during the early part of the year but shifted to a positive phase in the latter part of the year. The MJO, which affects the tropics globally, was active throughout the year, with several strong events occurring during the spring and summer months.\n\nThese conditions had significant impacts on the formation and development of tropical cyclones in 2022. The neutral ENSO phase and negative IOD phase during the early part of the year led to increased activity in the North Atlantic and North Indian Oceans. The shift to a weak El Niño event and positive IOD phase in the latter part of the year led to increased activity in the Western Pacific and South-West Indian Oceans.\n\n# Summary\n\n## North Atlantic Ocean\n\nThe 2022 North Atlantic hurricane season was above-average in terms of activity, with 19 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The season started early, with the first named storm, Alex, forming on June 2. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Ian, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.\n\n## Eastern & Central Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Eastern Pacific hurricane season was below-average in terms of activity, with 8 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane. The season started late, with the first named storm, Bonnie, forming on July 1. The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Darby, which reached Category 4 strength but did not make landfall.\n\n## Western Pacific Ocean\n\nThe 2022 Western Pacific typhoon season was above-average in terms of activity, with 25 named storms, 12 typhoons, and 5 super typhoons. The season started early, with the first named storm, Malakas, forming on January 6.

He was best known as a member of the hip hop trio Migos, alongside Quavo and Offset. Born Kirshnik Khari Ball on June 18, 1994, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Takeoff rose to prominence in the mid-2010s with Migos' debut single \"Versace\" and the subsequent release of their debut studio album \"Yung Rich Nation\".\n\n# Early life\n\nTakeoff was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to a family of modest means. He grew up in a household with his mother, Edna Marshall, and his uncle, Quavious Marshall, who later adopted the stage name Quavo. Takeoff's early life was marked by poverty and instability, with his family frequently moving between different neighborhoods in the Atlanta metropolitan area.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Takeoff found solace in music at an early age. He began rapping in his teenage years, influenced by artists such as Gucci Mane and Lil Wayne.

Cataracts are a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision, and surgery is the only effective treatment for this condition.\n\n# Uses\nCataract surgery is used to treat cataracts, which can cause blurry vision, double vision, and sensitivity to light. The surgery can improve vision and reduce the risk of falls and other accidents caused by poor vision. Additionally, cataract surgery can also be used to treat other conditions such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, and uveitis.\n\n# Techniques\nThere are several techniques used in cataract surgery, including phacoemulsification, manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), and extracapsular cataract extraction. The choice of technique depends on the size and location of the cataract, as well as the patient's overall health.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\nPhacoemulsification is the most common technique used in cataract surgery. This technique involves the use of a small probe that emits ultrasonic waves to break up the cataractous lens, which is then removed by suction. This technique is less invasive and has a faster recovery time compared to other techniques.\n\n## Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\nMSICS is a technique that involves making a small incision in the cornea to remove the cataractous lens. This technique is less common than phacoemulsification but is still used in some cases.\n\n## Extracapsular cataract extraction\nExtracapsular cataract extraction involves making a larger incision in the cornea to remove the cataractous lens. This technique is less common than phacoemulsification and MSICS but is still used in some cases.\n\n# Pre-operative evaluation\nBefore cataract surgery, the patient undergoes a pre-operative evaluation to assess their overall health and to determine the best course of treatment.\n\n## Contraindications\nThere are several contraindications for cataract surgery, including active eye infections, severe dry eye, and uncontrolled glaucoma.\n\n## Selection of intraocular lenses\nThe selection of an intraocular lens (IOL) is an important part of the pre-operative evaluation. The choice of IOL depends on the patient's lifestyle, occupation, and personal preferences.\n\n# Operation procedures\nCataract surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia and takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.\n\n## Preparation\nBefore the surgery, the patient is given a local anesthetic to numb the eye. The eye is then cleaned and draped with a sterile sheet.\n\n## Anaesthesia\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the eye during cataract surgery. The anesthesia can be administered in the form of eye drops or an injection.\n\n## Phacoemulsification\nDuring phacoemulsification, a small probe is inserted into the eye to break up the cataractous lens. The lens is then removed by suction.\n\n## Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\nDuring MSICS, a small incision is made in the cornea to remove the cataractous lens.\n\n## Extracapsular cataract extraction\nDuring extracapsular cataract extraction, a larger incision is made in the cornea to remove the cataractous lens.\n\n## Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\nIn some cases, the surgeon may need to convert to extracapsular cataract extraction to manage a contingency, such as a complication during surgery.\n\n## Closing the wound\nAfter the surgery, the wound is closed with stitches or a special type of glue.\n\n# Post-operative care\nAfter cataract surgery, the patient is given eye drops to reduce inflammation and prevent infection. The patient is also advised to rest and avoid heavy lifting or bending.\n\n# Complications\nAs with any surgery, cataract surgery carries a risk of complications.\n\n## During surgery\nComplications that can occur during surgery include bleeding, retinal detachment, and infection.\n\n## After surgery\nComplications that can occur after surgery include dry eye, infection, and inflammation.\n\n## Risk\nThe risk of complications from cataract surgery is low, but it is still important to discuss the risks and benefits with the surgeon.\n\n# Recovery and rehabilitation\nThe recovery time for cataract surgery varies depending on the technique used and the individual patient. Most patients can return to their normal activities within a few days.\n\n# Outcomes\nThe outcomes of cataract surgery are generally good, with most patients experiencing significant improvement in their vision.\n\n# History\nCataract surgery has a long history, dating back to ancient civilizations. The modern techniques used today were developed in the 20th century.\n\n# Accessibility\nCataract surgery is widely available in many parts of the world.\n\n## Europe\nIn Europe, cataract surgery is widely available and is usually performed in a hospital or clinic.\n\n## Asia\nIn Asia, cataract surgery is also widely available and is often performed in a hospital or clinic.\n\n## Africa\nIn Africa, cataract surgery is less widely available, but it is still possible to access the treatment in many countries.\n\n## Latin America\nIn Latin America, cataract surgery is widely available and is often performed in a hospital or clinic.\n\n# Social, economic and environmental relevance\nCataract surgery has significant social, economic, and environmental relevance.\n\n# Special populations\nCataract surgery can be performed on special populations, including children and older adults.\n\n## Congenital cataracts\nCongenital cataracts are a type of cataract that is present at birth. Surgery is usually performed to remove the cataract and improve vision.\n\n## Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\nSome patients may be at higher risk for complications if they undergo cataract surgery on separate occasions.\n\n# Other animals\nCataract surgery can also be performed on other animals, including dogs and cats.\n\n# See also\nSee also other articles on eye health and surgery.\n\n# Notes\n\n# References\n\n# Further reading\n\n# External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cataract_surgery\" following this outline:\n\n#Uses\n#Techniques\n#Pre-operative evaluation\n##Contraindications\n##Selection of intraocular lenses\n#Operation procedures\n##Preparation\n##Anaesthesia\n##Phacoemulsification\n##Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS)\n##Extracapsular cataract extraction\n##Converting to ECCE to manage a contingency\n##Closing the wound\n#Post-operative care\n#Complications\n##During surgery\n##After surgery\n##Risk\n#Recovery and rehabilitation\n#Outcomes\n#History\n#Accessibility\n##Europe\n##Asia\n##Africa\n##Latin America\n#Social, economic and environmental relevance\n#Special populations\n##Congenital cataracts\n##Higher risk for operations on separate occasions\n#Other animals\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The company has a long history dating back to the 19th century and has been involved in various construction projects across the country. This article provides an overview of the company's history, notable construction projects, and controversies it has been involved in.\n\n# History\n\n## Main contractor\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group was founded in 1890 by Thomas Shepherd, a Yorkshire-based builder. Initially, the company focused on small-scale construction projects in the local area. However, over the years, the company expanded its operations and became a major player in the UK construction industry. Today, the company is a leading construction services provider, offering a range of services including building, civil engineering, and facilities management.\n\n## Manufactured products\n\nIn addition to its construction services, the Shepherd Building Group also manufactures a range of building products, including roofing materials, insulation, and drylining systems. The company's manufacturing division has its roots in the 1960s, when Shepherd began producing roofing materials. Over the years, the company has expanded its product range and invested heavily in research and development to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n## Disposal of non-core businesses\n\nIn the 2000s, the Shepherd Building Group underwent a significant restructuring process, during which it disposed of several non-core businesses. The company sold off its interests in the drylining and insulation manufacturing sectors, focusing instead on its core construction and building products businesses. The restructuring process allowed the company to streamline its operations and focus on its core strengths.\n\n# Notable construction projects\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in numerous high-profile construction projects across the UK. Some of its most notable projects include:\n\n* The redevelopment of the Olympic Stadium in London, which was completed in 2012\n* The construction of the new terminal building at Manchester Airport, which was opened in 2011\n* The building of the new Wembley Stadium, which was completed in 2007\n* The redevelopment of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, which was completed in 2013\n\n# Controversies\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in several controversies over the years. Some of the most notable include:\n\n## Identity behind anonymous emails\n\nIn 2012, the company was at the center of a controversy surrounding anonymous emails sent to a local newspaper. The emails, which were critical of a rival construction company, were traced back to a Shepherd Building Group employee. The incident raised questions about the company's business practices and its treatment of competitors.\n\n## Hand tool vibration\n\nIn 2015, the company was fined £200,000 after one of its employees was diagnosed with hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The employee had been using vibrating hand tools without proper safety equipment, and the company was found to have breached health and safety regulations.\n\n## Domain name disputes\n\nThe Shepherd Building Group has been involved in several domain name disputes over the years. In one notable case, the company successfully obtained the transfer of a domain name that was being used by a rival company. The rival company had registered the domain name in bad faith, and the Shepherd Building Group was awarded the transfer after a lengthy dispute.\n\n## Employment blacklisting\n\nIn 2013, the company was named as one of several construction companies that had been involved in a blacklisting scandal. The scandal, which involved the use of a secret database to vet potential employees, was widely condemned, and the company faced criticism for its involvement.\n\n## Trinity Walk\n\nIn 2014, the company was involved in a controversy surrounding the development of a new shopping center in Wakefield. The development, known as Trinity Walk, was opposed by local residents, who claimed that it would harm the local environment. The company, which was the main contractor on the project, faced criticism for its handling of the development and its treatment of local residents.\n\n# See also\n\n* Construction industry in the United Kingdom\n* List of construction companies in the United Kingdom\n* History of construction in the United Kingdom", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Shepherd_Building_Group\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Main contractor\n##Manufactured products\n##Disposal of non core businesses\n#Notable construction projects\n#Controversies\n##Identity behind anonymous emails\n##Hand tool vibration\n##Domain name disputes\n##Employment blacklisting\n##Trinity Walk\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The black market played a significant role in the French economy and society, affecting various aspects of people's lives, from food and clothing to resistance and collaboration.\n\nBackground\n\n### 1930s: inflation, instability and unrest\n\nThe 1930s in France were marked by economic instability, inflation, and social unrest. The country faced a severe economic crisis, which led to a decline in living standards and a rise in unemployment. The Popular Front government, established in 1936, implemented various policies to address these issues, including price controls and rationing. However, these measures ultimately failed to alleviate the economic woes, creating a fertile ground for the emergence of a black market.\n\n### Fall of France\n\nIn May 1940, Germany launched a surprise attack on France, leading to a swift defeat and the establishment of the Vichy government, led by Marshal Philippe Pétain. The Vichy regime collaborated with the German occupation, enforcing strict controls on the economy, including rationing and price controls. These measures further exacerbated the economic difficulties, creating a thriving black market.\n\n1940-1941\n\n### Origins\n\n#### Rationing and price controls\n\nThe Vichy government's rationing and price controls aimed to ensure fair distribution of resources, but these measures ultimately failed to address the shortages and inflation. The strict controls created opportunities for those who could circumvent them, leading to the emergence of a black market.\n\n#### Diversion from official channels\n\nFood, clothing, and other essential goods were diverted from official channels to the black market, where they were sold at inflated prices. This diversion was often facilitated by corrupt officials, who turned a blind eye to the illicit trade.\n\n#### Clandestine networks\n\nClandestine networks of traders, smugglers, and middlemen emerged to supply the black market. These networks were often linked to organized crime groups, who exploited the situation for their own gain.\n\n#### Hidden stockpiling\n\nMerchants and traders began to hide stockpiles of goods, which were then sold on the black market. This hidden stockpiling further reduced the availability of goods in the official market, exacerbating the shortages.\n\n#### Grey market\n\nA grey market emerged, where goods were sold at prices higher than the official prices but lower than those on the black market. The grey market operated in a legal grey area, often with the tacit approval of authorities.\n\n### Users of the black market\n\n#### Privileged French\n\nThe privileged classes, including politicians, officials, and wealthy individuals, were among the primary users of the black market. They could afford to pay the inflated prices and often had the connections to access the illicit goods.\n\n#### Occupation forces\n\nThe German occupation forces also participated in the black market, often using their position to acquire goods and supplies. This participation further fueled the black market, as the occupiers were willing to pay high prices for the goods they needed.\n\n### Public response\n\n#### Early condemnation\n\nInitially, the public condemned the black market, seeing it as a morally reprehensible activity that exploited the suffering of others. However, as the shortages and inflation worsened, attitudes began to shift.\n\n#### Participation\n\nMany ordinary citizens began to participate in the black market, often out of necessity rather than choice. They saw the black market as a means to survive in a desperate situation.\n\n#### Housewives' demonstrations\n\nHousewives, in particular, played a significant role in the black market, often organizing demonstrations and protests to demand better access to essential goods. These demonstrations sometimes turned violent, highlighting the desperation and frustration of the population.\n\n#### Suspicions of hoarding\n\nThe public began to suspect that merchants and traders were hoarding goods, further exacerbating the shortages. This suspicion led to increased tensions and violence against those perceived as hoarders.\n\n#### Official antisemitism\n\nThe Vichy government's official antisemitism also played a role in the black market, as Jewish merchants and traders were often targeted and accused of hoarding and speculation.\n\n#### Public opinion\n\nAs the war dragged on, public opinion shifted further in favor of the black market. Many saw it as a necessary evil, a means to survive in a desperate situation.\n\n#### Political opposition\n\nThe black market also became a rallying point for political opposition to the Vichy government. Many saw the black market as a symbol of resistance against the occupiers and the collaborationist government.\n\n### Response by authorities\n\nThe authorities responded to the black market with a mix of repression and tolerance. While officially condemning the black market, they often turned a blind eye to its activities, recognizing the necessity of the illicit trade in a desperate situation.\n\nWidespread black market (autumn 1941 to 1943)\n\n### Agricultural black market\n\nThe agricultural black market became a major phenomenon, with farmers selling their produce directly to consumers, bypassing the official market. This direct sales system allowed farmers to earn higher prices and consumers to access fresh produce.\n\n### Grey market: direct sales\n\nThe grey market expanded, with more and more merchants and traders engaging in direct sales to consumers. This direct sales system further eroded the official market, reducing the government's control over the economy.\n\n### Commerce and industry\n\nCommerce and industry also began to operate in the grey area, with many businesses engaging in illicit activities to survive. This shift towards the grey market further blurred the lines between the official and black markets.\n\n### Tacit tolerance\n\nThe authorities' tacit tolerance of the black market became more pronounced, as they recognized the necessity of the illicit trade in a desperate situation.\n\n#### No longer immoral\n\nThe black market was no longer seen as a morally reprehensible activity, but rather as a necessary evil. This shift in perception reflected the changing attitudes of the population, who saw the black market as a means to survive.\n\n#### Nuanced and refocused enforcement\n\nThe authorities refocused their enforcement efforts, targeting the most egregious cases of black market activity while turning a blind eye to more minor infractions. This nuanced approach reflected the complexity of the situation and the need to balance repression with tolerance.\n\n### Metrics\n\n#### Proportion of production\n\nEstimates suggest that by 1942, up to 50% of agricultural production was being sold on the black market. This figure highlights the scale of the illicit trade and its impact on the official market.\n\n#### Higher and more volatile prices\n\nPrices on the black market were consistently higher and more volatile than those on the official market. This price differential reflects the risks and uncertainties associated with the illicit trade.\n\n#### Geographic distribution\n\nThe black market was most pronounced in urban areas, where the shortages and inflation were most acute. However, the illicit trade also existed in rural areas, where farmers and traders would often engage in direct sales to consumers.\n\n#### Beneficiaries\n\nThe black market benefited a wide range of individuals and groups, including farmers, traders, and consumers. However, the occupiers and collaborationist government also profited from the illicit trade, exploiting the situation for their own gain.\n\nPatriotism (spring 1943-summer 1944)\n\n### Enforcement for the occupiers\n\nThe authorities' enforcement efforts became more focused on supporting the occupiers, who were facing increasing resistance and sabotage from the French population.\n\n#### Economic pillage and the end of the German black market\n\nThe German occupation forces engaged in economic pillage, exploiting France's resources for their own war effort. This pillage marked the end of the German black market, as the occupiers no longer needed to rely on the illicit trade to acquire goods and supplies.\n\n#### Countermeasures and collaboration\n\nThe authorities implemented countermeasures to combat the growing resistance, including increased surveillance and repression. Collaborationist officials and informers played a significant role in these efforts, often using their position to denounce and betray their fellow citizens.\n\n#### Milice vs the black market\n\nThe Milice, a collaborationist paramilitary organization, was formed to combat the resistance and the black market. However, the Milice ultimately failed to eradicate the illicit trade, which continued to thrive in the shadows.\n\n### Fraud and Resistance\n\n#### Resistance encouragement\n\nThe black market became a rallying point for the resistance, who saw the illicit trade as a means to subvert the occupiers and the collaborationist government.\n\n#### Blaming the Resistance\n\nThe authorities blamed the resistance for the black market, accusing them of sabotaging the economy and supporting the illicit trade.\n\n#### End of the occupation\n\nThe Allied liberation of France in 1944 marked the end of the occupation and the beginning of a new era. However, the legacy of the black market continued to shape French society and economy in the years that followed.\n\nAfter the Liberation (1944-1949)\n\n### Épuration and illicit profits\n\n#### Pursuit and punishment\n\nThe authorities pursued and punished those who had profited from the black market, including merchants, traders, and officials. However, many of those responsible for the illicit trade escaped punishment, often using their connections and influence to avoid prosecution.\n\n#### Confiscation of illicit profits\n\nThe government confiscated the illicit profits of those who had engaged in the black market, using the proceeds to support the post-war reconstruction effort.\n\n### Continued black market operations\n\n#### Continued trafficking\n\nThe black market continued to operate in the aftermath of the war, with many of the same networks and individuals involved in the illicit trade.\n\n#### Generalized fraud\n\nFraud and corruption became widespread, as individuals and businesses sought to exploit the post-war chaos for their own gain.\n\n#### Government powerlessness\n\nThe government struggled to combat the black market, often appearing powerless in the face of the widespread corruption and fraud.\n\n#### Towards the free market\n\nThe post-war period marked a shift towards the free market, as the government gradually relaxed its controls on the economy. However, the legacy of the black market continued to shape French society and economy, often in subtle but significant ways.\n\nHistorical memory\n\n### Historiography\n\nHistorians have debated the significance of the black market in wartime France, with some viewing it as a necessary evil and others as a morally reprehensible activity.\n\n### Collective unconscious and cultural roots\n\n#### Early recollections\n\nThe black market has left a lasting impact on French collective memory, with many people recalling the shortages and inflation of the war years.\n\n#### Marcel Aymé\n\nMarcel Aymé's novel \"La Traversée de Paris\" (1947) is a classic portrayal of the black market in wartime France, capturing the spirit of resistance and subversion that characterized the illicit trade.\n\n### Major works\n\n#### La Traversée de Paris\n\n\"La Traversée de Paris\" is a novella by Marcel Aymé, published in 1947. The story follows two men who embark on a journey across Paris to deliver a suitcase of black market goods.\n\n#### Au bon beurre\n\n\"Au bon beurre\" is a film by Édouard Molinaro, released in 1981. The movie is a comedy-drama that explores the black market in a small town in occupied France.\n\n### Historical figures\n\n#### L'Étrange Monsieur Joseph\n\nL'Étrange Monsieur Joseph is a memoir by Jean Galtier-Boissière, published in 1951.

The crisis primarily affected the northern region of Kosovo, where a significant ethnic Serb population resides. The tensions centered on issues of governance, security, and ethnic relations, leading to a series of protests, clashes, and diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation.\n\n# Background\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but the move was not recognized by Serbia or some other countries. The northern part of Kosovo, which borders Serbia, has a majority ethnic Serb population and has historically been a source of tension between the two countries. In the years leading up to the crisis, there were ongoing efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia, but progress was slow.\n\nThe region is rich in natural resources, including coal, lead, and zinc, which has contributed to the economic significance of the area. However, the region's economy has struggled, with high levels of unemployment and poverty. The lack of economic opportunities and the presence of ethnic tensions have created a volatile environment in which the crisis unfolded.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2022\n\n### July\n\nThe crisis began in July 2022, when Kosovo authorities launched a crackdown on smuggling and organized crime in the north. The operation, which involved the deployment of Kosovo police and special forces, aimed to dismantle smuggling networks and assert Kosovo's authority in the region. However, the move was met with resistance from ethnic Serb communities, who saw the operation as an attempt to exert control over their territory.\n\n### August\n\nTensions escalated in August 2022, when a group of ethnic Serb protesters blocked roads and border crossings in the north. The protesters, who were demanding greater autonomy and recognition of their rights, clashed with Kosovo police, resulting in several injuries and arrests.\n\n### September\n\nIn September 2022, the Kosovo government announced plans to introduce a new license plate system, which would require vehicles in the north to display Kosovo plates. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's authority and sovereignty over the region, but it was met with fierce resistance from ethnic Serb communities, who saw the move as an attack on their identity and rights.\n\n### October\n\nThe situation deteriorated further in October 2022, when a group of ethnic Serb protesters attacked a Kosovo police station in the north. The attack, which resulted in several injuries and damage to property, was condemned by Kosovo authorities and international organizations.\n\n### November\n\nIn November 2022, the Kosovo government imposed a curfew in the north, citing concerns about public safety and security. The move was met with widespread criticism from ethnic Serb communities, who saw the curfew as an attempt to restrict their freedom of movement and assembly.\n\n### December\n\nThe year ended with a series of protests and clashes in the north, as ethnic Serb communities continued to demand greater autonomy and recognition of their rights. The situation remained volatile, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and provocation.\n\n## 2023\n\n### January\n\nThe new year began with a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. The European Union and the United States launched a joint initiative to facilitate dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, but progress was slow.\n\n### February\n\nIn February 2023, the Kosovo government announced plans to establish a new municipality in the north, which would be governed by ethnic Serb leaders. The move was seen as an attempt to address the concerns of ethnic Serb communities and promote greater autonomy and self-governance.\n\n### March\n\nHowever, the move was met with opposition from some Kosovo politicians, who saw the creation of a new municipality as a threat to Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n### April\n\nThe situation remained tense in April 2023, with a series of protests and clashes in the north. The Kosovo government accused Serbia of interfering in the region and promoting separatism, while Serbia accused Kosovo of suppressing the rights of ethnic Serb communities.\n\n### May\n\nIn May 2023, the European Union launched a new initiative to facilitate dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. The initiative, which involved the deployment of EU diplomats and experts, aimed to promote greater cooperation and understanding between the two sides.\n\n### June\n\nHowever, the initiative was met with skepticism by some Kosovo politicians, who saw the EU's involvement as an attempt to impose a solution on Kosovo.\n\n### July\n\nThe situation deteriorated further in July 2023, when a group of ethnic Serb protesters attacked a Kosovo police station in the north. The attack, which resulted in several injuries and damage to property, was condemned by Kosovo authorities and international organizations.\n\n### September\n\nIn September 2023, the Kosovo government announced plans to hold local elections in the north. The move was seen as an attempt to promote greater democracy and self-governance in the region, but it was met with opposition from some ethnic Serb communities, who saw the elections as an attempt to exert control over their territory.\n\n### October\n\nThe situation remained tense in October 2023, with a series of protests and clashes in the north. The Kosovo government accused Serbia of interfering in the region and promoting separatism, while Serbia accused Kosovo of suppressing the rights of ethnic Serb communities.\n\n### November\n\nIn November 2023, the European Union launched a new initiative to facilitate dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. The initiative, which involved the deployment of EU diplomats and experts, aimed to promote greater cooperation and understanding between the two sides.\n\n### December\n\nThe year ended with a series of protests and clashes in the north, as ethnic Serb communities continued to demand greater autonomy and recognition of their rights. The situation remained volatile, with both sides accusing each other of aggression and provocation.\n\n## 2024\n\n### February\n\nThe new year began with a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis. The United States launched a new initiative to facilitate dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, but progress was slow.\n\n### August\n\nThe situation remained tense in August 2024, with a series of protests and clashes in the north. The Kosovo government accused Serbia of interfering in the region and promoting separatism, while Serbia accused Kosovo of suppressing the rights of ethnic Serb communities.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe North Kosovo crisis has been widely condemned by international organizations and countries, including the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations. The crisis has been seen as a major threat to regional stability and security, and there have been calls for greater dialogue and cooperation between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n# See also\n\n* Kosovo-Serbia relations\n* Kosovo status process\n* Kosovo independence\n* Serbian nationalism\n* Albanian nationalism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The battle has been one of the most intense and prolonged engagements of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with both sides suffering significant casualties.\n\n#Background\n\nBakhmut, a city of approximately 70,000 inhabitants, is strategically located in the Donetsk Oblast, a region that has been contested since the outbreak of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict in 2014. The city is situated near the intersection of several key roads and highways, making it an important transportation hub. In the months leading up to the battle, Ukrainian forces had established a defensive line in the area, while Russian-backed separatists had been attempting to break through the Ukrainian defenses.\n\n#Battle\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe battle began in August 2022, with Russian forces launching a series of artillery attacks on Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut. The shelling was intense, with Ukrainian forces reporting multiple casualties and damage to infrastructure. As the Russian attacks continued, Ukrainian forces began to withdraw from their positions on the outskirts of the city, establishing a new defensive line closer to the city center.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter approached, the fighting in Bakhmut intensified, with both sides suffering significant losses. Russian forces launched a series of attacks on Ukrainian positions, but were repeatedly repelled. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, launched a series of counterattacks, attempting to push the Russians back. The fighting was intense, with both sides using artillery, tanks, and infantry to try and gain the upper hand.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces launched a major assault on the town of Soledar, a key Ukrainian stronghold near Bakhmut. After several weeks of intense fighting, Russian forces captured the town, which gave them control of a key road and allowed them to partially encircle Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, continued to defend the city, using a network of trenches and bunkers to repel Russian attacks.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, Ukrainian forces launched a series of flanking counterattacks, aiming to push the Russians back and relieve the pressure on Bakhmut. The counterattacks were successful, with Ukrainian forces capturing several key villages and towns near the city. Russian forces, meanwhile, continued to launch attacks on Ukrainian positions, but were increasingly unsuccessful.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Russian forces, led by the Wagner Group, a private military company, captured the city of Bakhmut. The capture was a significant blow to Ukrainian forces, who had been defending the city for months. However, the capture was short-lived, as Ukrainian forces launched a series of counterattacks, aiming to retake the city. In early June 2023, Russian forces, including the Wagner Group, withdrew from the city, leaving it in Ukrainian control.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nThe battle of Bakhmut has seen both sides employ a range of military tactics and strategies. Ukrainian forces have used a combination of artillery, tanks, and infantry to defend the city, while Russian forces have used a mix of artillery, airpower, and infantry to try and capture it. Both sides have also employed drones and electronic warfare to disrupt each other's communications and logistics.\n\n#Aftermath\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut by Russian forces was a significant blow to Ukrainian forces, but the city's strategic value is limited. The city is not a major population center, and its capture does not provide a significant advantage to either side.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battle of Bakhmut has seen both sides suffer significant casualties and damage to infrastructure. The city has been heavily damaged, with many buildings destroyed or damaged. The fighting has also had a significant impact on the local population, with many civilians forced to flee the city.\n\n##Casualties\n\n###Military casualties\n\nBoth sides have suffered significant military casualties in the battle of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces have reported hundreds of casualties, including many killed or wounded. Russian forces have also suffered significant losses, although the exact number of casualties is not known.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\nThe battle of Bakhmut has also seen significant civilian casualties.

Born on October 16, 1925, in Regent's Park, London, Lansbury has established herself as one of the most respected and beloved actresses of her generation. With a career that has taken her from the stage to the screen, Lansbury has captivated audiences with her versatility, range, and iconic performances.\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born to Edgar Lansbury, a timber merchant, and Moyna MacGill, an actress. She was the first of two daughters, with her younger sister Isolde being born in 1928. Lansbury's early life was marked by the influence of her mother's acting career, with the family often attending theatre performances and film screenings. In 1939, Lansbury's father passed away, and her mother moved the family to the United States to escape the onset of World War II.\n\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n\nLansbury began her acting career at the age of 16, landing a role in the 1942 film \"Gaslight\" opposite Ingrid Bergman. Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, making her one of the youngest nominees in the category at the time. This breakthrough role led to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where she went on to appear in a string of films throughout the 1940s.\n\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n\nDuring her time at MGM, Lansbury appeared in a range of films, including \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1945), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), and \"State of the Union\" (1948). Her performances were well-received, but she began to feel typecast in supporting roles. In the early 1950s, Lansbury decided to leave MGM and explore other opportunities, both on stage and screen.\n\n#Mid career\n\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n\nLansbury's departure from MGM led to a period of relative obscurity, with the actress appearing in a string of minor roles on stage and screen. However, her performance as the manipulative Mrs. Iselin in John Frankenheimer's \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962) earned her critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. This marked a turning point in Lansbury's career, as she began to be recognized for her versatility and range.\n\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n\nIn 1966, Lansbury took on the title role in the Broadway musical \"Mame,\" earning widespread critical acclaim and a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Her performance marked a new era in her career, as she transitioned from film to stage and established herself as a leading lady of the theatre. Lansbury's success in \"Mame\" led to a string of theatrical roles, including \"Dear World\" (1969) and \"Gypsy\" (1974).\n\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lansbury moved to Ireland, where she lived for several years and continued to work on stage and screen. Her performance as Mama Rose in the 1974 Broadway revival of \"Gypsy\" earned her a second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. During this period, Lansbury also appeared in a range of films, including \"Death on the Nile\" (1978) and \"The Mirror Crack'd\" (1980).\n\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n\nLansbury's success on stage continued with her performance as Mrs. Lovett in the 1979 Broadway production of \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\" Her portrayal of the eccentric and calculating Mrs. Lovett earned her a third Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. During this period, Lansbury also continued to appear in a range of films, including \"The Last Unicorn\" (1982) and \"Little Gloria... Happy at Last\" (1982).\n\n#Global fame\n\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n\nIn 1984, Lansbury took on the role of Jessica Fletcher in the CBS television series \"Murder, She Wrote.\" The show, which ran for 12 seasons, became a global phenomenon, with Lansbury's performance as the clever and resourceful mystery writer earning her widespread critical acclaim and a range of awards. During her time on the show, Lansbury became a household name, and her iconic portrayal of Jessica Fletcher cemented her status as a beloved and respected actress.\n\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n\nFollowing the conclusion of \"Murder, She Wrote,\" Lansbury continued to work on stage and screen, appearing in a range of films and television shows, including \"Nanny McPhee\" (2005), \"Mary Poppins Returns\" (2018), and \"Little Women\" (2019). In 2022, Lansbury passed away at the age of 96, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most beloved and respected actresses of her generation.\n\n#Personal life\n\nLansbury was married twice, first to Richard Cromwell from 1945 until their divorce in 1946, and then to Peter Shaw from 1949 until his death in 2003. She had two children, Anthony and Deirdre, and lived for many years in Ireland and Los Angeles.\n\n#Honours and legacy\n\nThroughout her career, Lansbury received numerous awards and honors for her performances, including three Tony Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, and an Academy Award nomination. She was also recognized for her contributions to the arts, with a Kennedy Center Honor in 2000 and a Disney Legends award in 1995. Lansbury's legacy as a beloved and respected actress continues to endure, with her iconic performances remaining a source of inspiration and delight for audiences around the world.\n\n#Publications\n\n* \"Balancing Act: A Biography of Angela Lansbury\" by Martin Gottfried (1999)\n\n#See also\n\n* List of actresses with Academy Award nominations\n* List of Tony Award winners\n* List of Golden Globe Award winners\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a general overview of Angela Lansbury's life and career.

It is one of the most important cultural institutions in the state of Hesse and a significant museum in Germany.\n\n#History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a long and rich history dating back to the 19th century. The museum was founded in 1820 by Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse as a \"Großherzogliche Sammlung\" (Grand Ducal Collection). The collection was initially housed in the Darmstadt Palace and consisted of artworks and artifacts from the grand ducal family's private collections.\n\nOver the years, the collection grew significantly, and the museum became a central institution for the preservation and promotion of Hessian cultural heritage. In 1877, the museum was moved to its current location on Friedensplatz in Darmstadt. The building was designed by the architect Alfred Messel, who also designed the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the museum underwent significant changes. During World War I, the museum's collections were relocated to safety, and the building was converted into a military hospital. After the war, the museum was reopened, and the collections were reassembled.\n\nDuring World War II, the museum suffered significant damage, and many of its collections were lost or destroyed. The building was heavily bombed, and the museum's collections were scattered throughout the city. After the war, the museum was rebuilt, and the collections were reassembled.\n\n#Building\n\n##Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located on Friedensplatz in the heart of Darmstadt. The building is situated in a prominent location, surrounded by other important cultural institutions, including the Darmstadt Palace and the Staatstheater Darmstadt.\n\n##Renovations and extensions\n\nOver the years, the museum has undergone several renovations and extensions. In the 1950s and 1960s, the museum was renovated to repair damage from World War II. In the 1970s and 1980s, the museum underwent significant expansions, including the addition of new exhibition spaces and a modern museum restaurant.\n\nIn 2006, the museum underwent a major renovation, which included the restoration of the original facade and the modernization of the exhibition spaces. The renovation was designed by the architect Volker Staab and took several years to complete.\n\n#Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a diverse collection of artworks and artifacts from the state of Hesse. The collection includes:\n\n* Artworks from the Middle Ages to the present day, including paintings, sculptures, and prints\n* Archaeological artifacts from the prehistoric period to the Middle Ages\n* Ethnographic objects from around the world\n* Historical artifacts from the state of Hesse, including furniture, textiles, and decorative arts\n* Scientific instruments and equipment from the 18th and 19th centuries\n\nThe museum's collection is particularly strong in the areas of Hessian art and cultural history. The museum has an impressive collection of artworks by Hessian artists, including paintings by the 19th-century artist Ludwig Emil Grimm.\n\n#Gallery\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has several permanent galleries, including:\n\n* The Hessian Art Gallery, which features artworks from the Middle Ages to the present day\n* The Archaeological Gallery, which features artifacts from the prehistoric period to the Middle Ages\n* The Ethnographic Gallery, which features objects from around the world\n* The Historical Gallery, which features artifacts from the state of Hesse\n\nThe museum also has several temporary exhibition spaces, which host changing exhibitions throughout the year.\n\n#Special exhibitions\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt hosts several special exhibitions throughout the year. These exhibitions are often organized in collaboration with other museums and cultural institutions.\n\nSome recent special exhibitions at the museum include:\n\n* \"Ludwig Emil Grimm: A Hessian Artist\" (2019)\n* \"The Art of the Middle Ages in Hesse\" (2018)\n* \"The Archaeology of the Rhine-Main Region\" (2017)\n* \"The Ethnographic Collection of the Hessisches Landesmuseum\" (2016)\n\n#Controversies\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been involved in several controversies over the years. One of the most significant controversies was the museum's decision to return several artifacts to their countries of origin. The museum had acquired these artifacts during the colonial period, and they were later deemed to be cultural property that should be returned to their countries of origin.\n\nThe museum has also been criticized for its handling of sensitive topics, such as the legacy of National Socialism in Hesse. The museum has been accused of not doing enough to address the state's complicity in the Holocaust.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of museums in Hesse\n* List of art museums in Germany\n* Cultural institutions in Darmstadt\n\n#Films\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\" (2019), a documentary film about the museum's history and collections\n* \"Art and Culture in Hesse\" (2018), a documentary film about the cultural institutions of Hesse, including the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\n\n#References\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements.)\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A History\" by Wolfgang Kemper (2019)\n* \"The Art of Hesse: A Collection of the Hessisches Landesmuseum\" by Ludwig Emil Grimm (2018)\n* \"The Archaeology of the Rhine-Main Region\" by Johannes Müller (2017)\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt\n* Website of the state of Hesse's cultural institutions\n* Website of the city of Darmstadt's cultural institutions", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on December 14, 1946, in Marylebone, London, England, Birkin has established herself as a talented and versatile performer, known for her distinctive voice, captivating stage presence, and commitment to social causes.\n\n#Early life\n\nJane Birkin was born to David Birkin, a Royal Navy lieutenant commander, and Judy Campbell, an actress. Her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Campbell, was a Canadian actress who had performed on the stages of London's West End. Birkin's early life was marked by frequent moves due to her father's naval career, which took the family to various locations in the United Kingdom and abroad.\n\nBirkin's interest in the performing arts was encouraged from an early age by her mother, who enrolled her in dance and drama classes. She attended the Arts Educational School in London, where she trained in acting, singing, and dancing. After completing her studies, Birkin began her career as a model, appearing in various fashion magazines and advertisements.\n\n#Career\n\n##Early acting credits\n\nBirkin's acting career began in the 1960s, with small roles in British films and television productions. Her breakthrough came in 1966 with the film \"Blow-Up,\" directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, in which she played the role of a fashion model. The film's success helped establish Birkin as a rising star in the British film industry.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Birkin appeared in a range of films, including \"The Wild Heart\" (1966), \"The Beloved\" (1971), and \"Death on the Nile\" (1978). She also worked extensively in television, with notable roles in series such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Persuaders!\"\n\n##Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg\n\nIn 1968, Birkin met French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she would have a long-term relationship and collaborate on numerous musical projects. Their partnership resulted in some of Birkin's most famous recordings, including the hit single \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" (1969). The song, which featured explicit lyrics and a provocative music video, caused a scandal in France and helped establish Birkin as a major star in the French music scene.\n\nBirkin and Gainsbourg's musical collaborations continued throughout the 1970s, with albums such as \"Di Doo Dah\" (1973) and \"Lolita Go Home\" (1975). Their partnership also extended to film, with Birkin appearing in several movies directed by Gainsbourg, including \"Slogan\" (1969) and \"Je T'aime... Moi Non Plus\" (1976).\n\n##Later performances and recordings\n\nIn the 1980s, Birkin continued to work in film and music, with notable roles in movies such as \"Evil Under the Sun\" (1982) and \"Daddy Nostalgia\" (1990). She also released several solo albums, including \"Baby Alone in Babylone\" (1983) and \"Lost Song\" (1987).\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Birkin appeared in a range of films and television productions, including \"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries\" (1998) and \"Merci Docteur Rey\" (2002). She also released several albums, including \"Fictions\" (1996) and \"Arabesque\" (2002).\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Death\n\nBirkin's long-term partner, Serge Gainsbourg, died in 1991. The couple had a daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who is also an actress and singer. Birkin has been in a relationship with French director Jacques Doillon since the 1990s.\n\n##Philanthropy\n\nBirkin is a committed philanthropist and has supported several charitable causes throughout her career. In the 1980s, she worked with the French charity organization, Amnesty International, and in the 1990s, she supported the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.\n\n##Political views and activism\n\nBirkin has been an outspoken critic of social injustice and has been involved in various political campaigns throughout her career. In the 1960s, she was a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement in the United States, and in the 1970s, she was involved in the feminist movement in France.\n\n#Awards and honours\n\nThroughout her career, Birkin has received numerous awards and honours for her contributions to film and music. In 1988, she was awarded the French Legion of Honour, and in 2001, she received the César Award for Best Actress for her role in the film \"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.\"\n\n#In popular culture\n\n##Birkin basket\n\nIn the 1980s, Birkin popularized the Birkin basket, a wicker handbag that became a fashion icon of the era. The bag, which was designed by the French fashion house, Hermès, was named after Birkin, who was often seen carrying it in public.\n\n##Birkin bag\n\nIn the 2000s, the Birkin bag, a luxury handbag designed by Hermès, became one of the most sought-after fashion accessories in the world.

The riot was sparked by the attempted enrollment of James Meredith, an African American student, at the previously all-white university. The event marked a significant turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and led to a major escalation of federal involvement in the desegregation of institutions of higher learning in the United States.\n\n# Leadup\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nJames Meredith, a 29-year-old African American veteran of the United States Air Force, had been attempting to enroll at Ole Miss since January 1961. Despite meeting all the necessary qualifications, Meredith was repeatedly denied admission due to his race. Meredith filed a lawsuit against the university, which ultimately made its way to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On September 10, 1962, the court ordered Ole Miss to admit Meredith, but the university's board of trustees refused to comply.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nIn the days leading up to the planned enrollment, tensions escalated between the federal government and the state of Mississippi. President John F. Kennedy, who had been in communication with Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, urged the governor to comply with the court order. Barnett, however, refused, citing concerns about the potential for violence and the need to protect the state's sovereignty. The dialogue between Kennedy and Barnett was tense, with Kennedy eventually threatening to use federal troops to enforce the court order if necessary.\n\n# Events\n\n## Meredith arrives\n\nOn September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived on the Ole Miss campus, accompanied by federal marshals and other law enforcement officials.

The album was released on July 7, 2023, through Republic Records. The re-recording of the album is part of Swift's effort to regain control over her master recordings after a highly publicized dispute with her former record label, Big Machine Records.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, had acquired Big Machine Records, Swift's former record label, for $300 million. As a result, Braun's company acquired the master recordings of Swift's music catalog from her first six studio albums, including Speak Now. Swift publicly expressed her disapproval of the deal, stating that she had not been given the opportunity to purchase her master recordings herself and that Braun's acquisition of her music was a \"worst-case scenario\" for her.\n\nIn August 2020, Swift announced that she would be re-recording her old albums in an effort to regain control over her master recordings. She stated that she planned to re-record all of her albums that were originally released under Big Machine Records, including Speak Now. The re-recording of Speak Now was officially announced on May 5, 2023, along with the album's tracklist and release date.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n----------------\n\n### Composition\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) features the same 14 tracks as the original album, as well as six additional \"From the Vault\" tracks that were written and recorded during the same period as the original album but were not included on the final tracklist. The album's musical style is a mix of country, pop, and rock influences, with lyrics that focus on themes of love, heartbreak, and self-empowerment.\n\nThe album's production is handled by Swift, along with producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner. The album features a more stripped-back and acoustic sound than some of Swift's other work, with a focus on showcasing her vocal and songwriting abilities.\n\n### \"From the Vault\" tracks\n\nThe six \"From the Vault\" tracks included on Speak Now (Taylor's Version) are \"You All Over Me\", \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\", \"We Were Happy\", \"That's When\", \"Don't You\", and \"I Can See You\". These tracks were written and recorded during the same period as the original album but were not included on the final tracklist.\n\nThe \"From the Vault\" tracks offer a glimpse into Swift's songwriting process during this period and provide additional insight into her creative vision for the album. The tracks are notable for their raw, emotional quality and their focus on themes of love and heartbreak.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was released on July 7, 2023, through Republic Records. The album was made available on all major streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. Physical copies of the album, including CD and vinyl editions, were also released.\n\nThe album's release was accompanied by a social media campaign, with Swift sharing behind-the-scenes glimpses of the recording process and interacting with fans on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nCritical reception\n-----------------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many critics praising Swift's vocal and songwriting abilities. The album was noted for its raw, emotional quality and its focus on themes of love and heartbreak.\n\nCommercial performance\n---------------------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and selling over 100,000 copies in its first week.

The incident happened during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had started in February 2022. The explosion killed two people and sparked a diplomatic crisis between Poland, Russia, and Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine had been ongoing for nine months prior to the incident. The conflict had resulted in significant military and civilian losses on both sides. The Ukrainian military had been using various missile systems to defend against Russian attacks, while Russia had been conducting missile strikes against Ukrainian cities and military targets.\n\nPoland, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), had been providing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the start of the conflict. The country had also been hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.\n\n#Explosion\n\nOn November 15, 2022, at around 3:40 pm local time, a missile exploded in the village of Przewodów, Poland. The village is located in the Lublin Voivodeship, near the border with Ukraine. The explosion killed two Polish citizens, Bogusław Wos and Bogdan Wos, who were working at a grain drying facility.\n\nThe explosion was initially attributed to a Russian missile strike, but subsequent investigations suggested that the missile may have been of Ukrainian origin. The incident sparked a diplomatic crisis between Poland, Russia, and Ukraine.\n\n#Investigation\n\nThe Polish government launched an investigation into the incident, with assistance from NATO and Ukrainian experts. The investigation focused on determining the origin and type of the missile, as well as the circumstances surrounding the explosion.\n\nInitial reports suggested that the missile was a Russian Kh-101 or Kh-555 missile, but subsequent investigations suggested that it may have been a Ukrainian S-300 missile. The S-300 is a surface-to-air missile system used by the Ukrainian military to defend against Russian air attacks.\n\nThe investigation also examined the possibility that the missile was launched by Ukrainian forces in response to a Russian air attack. The Ukrainian military had been using the S-300 system to defend against Russian missile strikes, and it was possible that the missile had been launched in response to a Russian attack.\n\n#Reactions\n\n##Poland\n\nThe Polish government condemned the incident and called for an immediate investigation. Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that the incident was a \"serious escalation\" of the conflict and called for calm. The Polish government also increased military presence along the border with Ukraine.\n\n##International\n\n###Russia\n\nThe Russian government denied any involvement in the incident, stating that the missile was not of Russian origin. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the incident was a \"provocation\" aimed at escalating the conflict. The Russian government also accused Ukraine of launching the missile.\n\n###Ukraine\n\nThe Ukrainian government denied any involvement in the incident, stating that the missile was not launched by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the incident was a \"tragedy\" and called for an immediate investigation. The Ukrainian government also accused Russia of launching the missile.\n\n###NATO officials and member countries\n\nNATO officials condemned the incident and called for an immediate investigation. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated that the incident was a \"serious escalation\" of the conflict and called for calm. NATO member countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, also condemned the incident and called for an investigation.\n\n###Others\n\nOther countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, also condemned the incident and called for an investigation. The European Union also condemned the incident and called for an investigation.\n\n#Related incidents\n\nThe 2022 missile explosion in Poland was not an isolated incident. There have been several other incidents involving missile strikes and explosions near the border between Poland and Ukraine.\n\nIn October 2022, a Ukrainian S-300 missile exploded in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, killing several people. The incident was attributed to a Russian air attack, and the Ukrainian military had launched the S-300 missile in response.\n\nIn November 2022, a Russian missile strike hit the Ukrainian city of Kherson, killing several people. The incident was condemned by the international community, and the Ukrainian military vowed to defend against further Russian attacks.\n\n#See also\n\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Ukrainian-Russian War\n* NATO-Russia relations\n* Poland-Ukraine relations\n* Russia-Ukraine relations\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and has been written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone.

Perched on the hill of Montmartre, the church is a prominent landmark of the city and a popular tourist destination. Its striking white domes and bell tower are visible from many parts of Paris, and its architecture is a unique blend of Romanesque and Byzantine styles.\n\n# History\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a church on the hill of Montmartre dates back to the 19th century. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, two French Catholics, Alexandre Legentil and Hubert Rohault de Fleury, made a vow to build a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus if Paris was spared from destruction. After the war, the city was indeed spared, and Legentil and Rohault de Fleury began to make plans for the church.\n\n## Site\n\nThe site chosen for the church was the hill of Montmartre, which offered a panoramic view of the city. The hill had a long history of spiritual significance, dating back to the Druids and the Romans. In the Middle Ages, it was the site of a Benedictine abbey, and later, a Jesuit seminary.\n\n## Construction\n\nConstruction of the church began in 1875 and took nearly four decades to complete. The architect, Paul Abadie, designed the church in a Romanesque-Byzantine style, inspired by the churches of the Mediterranean region. The church was built using a innovative technique called \"pneumatic caissoning,\" which allowed workers to excavate the foundations and build the structure without disrupting the surrounding neighborhood.\n\n## Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the church as a symbol of Catholicism and the monarchy, which were seen as oppressive forces in France. The church was also criticized for its location on the hill of Montmartre, which was seen as a sacred site by many Parisians. Additionally, the church's design was seen as too ornate and too expensive, and many critics felt that the money could be better spent on more practical needs.\n\n# Description\n\n## Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is striking, with its white domes and bell tower rising above the surrounding buildings. The church's facade is simple, with a large rose window and a small entrance. The domes are covered in white stone, and the bell tower is topped with a small cross.\n\n## Interior\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is equally impressive, with a large nave and two smaller side aisles. The church is decorated with intricate mosaics, sculptures, and stained glass windows.\n\n### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nOne of the most striking features of Sacré-Cœur is the large mosaic that covers the ceiling of the apse. The mosaic, titled \"The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\" depicts Jesus Christ surrounded by angels and saints. The mosaic is made up of thousands of small tiles, and is one of the largest mosaics in the world.\n\n### Chapels\n\nSacré-Cœur has several chapels, each dedicated to a different saint or aspect of Catholicism. The chapels are decorated with intricate carvings, sculptures, and stained glass windows.\n\n### Crypt\n\nThe crypt of Sacré-Cœur is a small, intimate space that is dedicated to the remains of several French saints. The crypt is decorated with simple stone carvings and a few stained glass windows.\n\n## Art and decoration\n\nSacré-Cœur is renowned for its stunning art and decoration. The church is filled with intricate mosaics, sculptures, and stained glass windows, all of which were created by some of the most talented artists of the time.\n\n### Stained glass\n\nThe stained glass windows of Sacré-Cœur are some of the most beautiful in the world. The windows depict scenes from the Bible, as well as images of saints and angels. The windows were created by several different artists, including the famous artist, Louis Comfort Tiffany.\n\n### Sculpture\n\nThe sculptures of Sacré-Cœur are equally impressive, with intricate carvings and statues of saints and angels. The sculptures were created by several different artists, including the famous sculptor, Auguste Rodin.\n\n## Grand organ\n\nSacré-Cœur has a large and impressive grand organ, which is used for concerts and services throughout the year. The organ was built by the famous organ builder, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll.\n\n## Bells\n\nThe bells of Sacré-Cœur are some of the most beautiful in the world. The bells are made of bronze and are tuned to produce a rich, resonant sound. The bells are rung throughout the day, and are an important part of the church's tradition.\n\n# Role in Catholicism\n\nSacré-Cœur plays an important role in Catholicism, both in France and around the world. The church is a popular pilgrimage site, and is visited by millions of people each year. The church is also an important center for Catholic education and outreach, with several schools and community programs.\n\n# Access\n\nSacré-Cœur is located in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, and is easily accessible by public transportation. The closest metro station is Anvers, which is a short walk from the church.\n\n# Copy in Martinique\n\nA smaller replica of Sacré-Cœur was built in the island of Martinique, in the French Caribbean. The replica is a popular tourist destination, and is an important part of the island's cultural heritage.\n\n# See also\n\n* Catholic Church in France\n* Montmartre\n* Paris\n* Romanesque architecture\n* Byzantine architecture\n* Stained glass\n* Sculpture\n* Grand organ\n* Bells\n\n# References\n\n* (no references included)\n\n# Bibliography (in French)\n\n* (no bibliography included)\n\n# Further reading\n\n* (no further reading included)\n\n# External links\n\n* (no external links included)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sacré-Cœur,_Paris\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Proposal\n##Site\n##Construction\n##Controversy over the church\n#Description\n##Exterior\n##Interior\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n###Chapels\n###Crypt\n##Art and decoration\n###Stained glass\n###Sculpture\n##Grand organ\n##Bells\n#Role in Catholicism\n#Access\n#Copy in Martinique\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography (in French)\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season marked the return of the XFL after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Background\n\nThe XFL was originally founded in 2001 by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now known as WWE, but folded after one season due to low ratings and financial losses. In 2020, the XFL was revived with a new ownership group and a revamped business model. The 2020 season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the league announced plans to return in 2023 with a new format and expanded roster.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe 2023 XFL season featured eight teams, divided into two divisions:\n\n* North Division:\n\t+ Seattle Sea Dragons\n\t+ St. Louis BattleHawks\n\t+ Vegas Vipers\n\t+ DC Defenders\n* South Division:\n\t+ Houston Roughnecks\n\t+ Orlando Guardians\n\t+ Arlington Renegades\n\t+ San Antonio Brahmas\n\n# Players\n\n## Draft\n\nThe 2023 XFL draft took place on November 15, 2022, with each team selecting 30 players. The draft was conducted via a snake draft format, with the first overall pick going to the Seattle Sea Dragons.\n\n## Compensation\n\nPlayers in the XFL are paid a weekly salary, with veterans earning $5,000 per week and rookies earning $3,000 per week. Players also receive a signing bonus and can earn additional income through sponsorship deals and bonuses.\n\n## Player movement\n\nThe XFL allows players to move between teams during the season, with teams able to sign free agents and make trades. Players can also be released by their teams and become free agents.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nThe XFL has partnered with several organizations to provide opportunities for players to develop their skills and gain exposure.\n\n### Indoor Football League\n\nThe XFL has a partnership with the Indoor Football League (IFL), which allows players to play in the IFL during the XFL's off-season.\n\n### NFL Alumni Academy\n\nThe XFL has a partnership with the NFL Alumni Academy, which provides training and development opportunities for XFL players.\n\n## Notable players\n\n* Former NFL quarterback Ben DiNucci\n* Former NFL running back Christine Michael\n* Former NFL wide receiver Keenan Reynolds\n* Former NFL defensive end Damontre Moore\n\n# Coaches\n\n## Coaching changes\n\nSeveral teams made coaching changes during the off-season, including the Seattle Sea Dragons, who hired former NFL coach Jim Haslett as their head coach.\n\n# Rule changes\n\nThe XFL has made several rule changes for the 2023 season, including the introduction of a \"tap\" rule, which allows players to tap the ball to the ground to end a play, rather than having to take a knee.\n\n# Standings\n\nThe XFL standings are divided into two divisions, with the top two teams from each division qualifying for the playoffs.\n\n# Season structure\n\n## Preseason\n\nThe XFL preseason took place in January 2023, with each team playing two exhibition games.\n\n## Regular season\n\nThe XFL regular season began on February 18, 2023, and ran for 10 weeks.\n\n## Postseason\n\nThe XFL playoffs took place in April 2023, with

The PSC also partnered with various national sports associations (NSAs) to identify and develop potential medalists.\n\nThe country's athletes trained in various locations, including the Philippines, Japan, and the United States. The PSC also hired foreign coaches to help train the athletes.\n\n# Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the Philippines' preparations for the 2021 SEA Games. Many of the country's athletes were unable to train due to lockdowns and travel restrictions.\n\nThe PSC was forced to adjust its training program, with many athletes training online or in small groups. The country also had to cancel several international competitions due to travel restrictions.\n\nDespite the challenges, the PSC remained optimistic about the country's chances at the SEA Games. The agency's chairman, William Ramirez, expressed confidence that the country's athletes would be able to compete at a high level despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\n# Medalists\n\nThe Philippines won a total of 52 gold medals, 70 silver medals, and 104 bronze medals at the 2021 SEA Games.\n\n## Gold\n\nThe Philippines won gold medals in the following events:\n\n* Athletics: 4x400m relay (men's)\n* Badminton: men's singles (Kevin Cudiamat)\n* Billiards and Snooker: 10-ball pool (Chezka Centeno)\n* Bodybuilding: men's 60kg (Michael Paderes)\n* Boxing: men's bantamweight (Ian Clark Bautista)\n* Chess: rapid chess (women's) (Janelle Mae Frayna)\n* Cycling: mountain bike (cross-country) (Shagne Paula)\n* Diving: 1m springboard (women's) (Sheila Mae Perez)\n* Esports: CrossFire (men's) (team)\n* Football: men's\n* Gymnastics: artistic gymnastics (women's) (team)\n* Handball: beach handball (men's)\n* Kickboxing: men's 63.5kg (Jean Claude Saclag)\n* Pencak silat: men's 60kg (Dines Dumaan)\n* Rowing: men's quadruple sculls\n* Tennis: men's singles (Jeson Patrombon)\n* Triathlon: men's (John Chicano)\n* Volleyball: beach volleyball (men's)\n* Weightlifting: men's 55kg (John Febuar Ceniza)\n\n## Silver\n\nThe Philippines won silver medals in the following events:\n\n* Athletics: 100m hurdles (women's) (Kathleen Faith Flores)\n* Badminton: women's singles (Nicole Albo)\n* Basketball: men's\n* Billiards and Snooker: 9-ball pool (Rubilen Amit)\n* Bodybuilding: men's 75kg (Rey Reo Labora)\n* Boxing: men's lightweight (Charly Suarez)\n* Chess: rapid chess (men's) (Darwin Laylo)\n* Cycling: road cycling (women's) (Jermyn Prado)\n* Diving: 3m springboard (men's) (Noelito Jose Flores)\n* Esports: FIFA Online 4 (men's) (team)\n* Football: women's\n* Gymnastics: rhythmic gymnastics (women's) (team)\n* Handball: beach handball (women's)\n* Kickboxing: men's 67kg (Zephania Ngaya)\n* Pencak silat: women's 55kg ( Cherry May Regalado)\n* Rowing: women's quadruple sculls\n* Tennis: women's singles (Alex Eala)\n* Triathlon: women's (Kim Mangrobang)\n* Volleyball: indoor volleyball (women's)\n\n## Bronze\n\nThe Philippines won bronze medals in the following events:\n\n* Athletics: 200m (men's) (Trenten Anthony Beram)\n* Badminton: mixed doubles (Peter Gabriel Magnaye and Thea Pomar)\n* Basketball: women's\n* Billiards and Snooker: 10-ball pool (Chezka Centeno)\n* Bodybuilding: men's 70kg (Ralph Andrew Enriquez)\n* Boxing: men's flyweight (Rogen Ladon)\n* Chess: blitz chess (men's) (Darwin Laylo)\n* Cycling: mountain bike (cross-country) (Shagne Paula)\n* Diving: 1m springboard (men's) (Noelito Jose Flores)\n* Esports: League of Legends (men's) (team)\n* Football: men's futsal\n* Gymnastics: artistic gymnastics (men's) (team)\n* Handball: beach handball (men's)\n* Kickboxing: men's 71kg (Jay Harold Gregorio)\n* Pencak silat: men's 65kg (Nuquiaz Al Janubit)\n* Rowing: men's double sculls\n* Tennis: men's doubles (Jeson Patrombon and Francis Casey Alcantara)\n* Triathlon: mixed team relay\n* Volleyball: beach volleyball (women's)\n* Weightlifting: men's 61kg (Eliel Munares)\n\n# Multiple medalists\n\nSeveral Filipino athletes won multiple medals at the 2021 SEA Games.\n\n* Kevin Cudiamat (badminton) -

The storm brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and significant damage to the region, particularly on the islands of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the meteorological history, preparations, impact, and aftermath of Typhoon Mawar.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Mawar formed as a tropical depression on May 20, 2023, over the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles (1,609 km) southwest of Guam. The system gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm on May 21 and a typhoon on May 22. Mawar's maximum sustained winds reached 160 mph (257 km/h), with gusts of up to 195 mph (314 km/h). The storm's central pressure dropped to 920 mbar (27.17 inHg), making it a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nMawar's track took it northwestward, passing close to the Mariana Islands on May 23-24. The storm's outer rain bands and strong winds began affecting the islands on May 22, with the worst conditions occurring on May 23. After passing the Mariana Islands, Mawar continued northwestward, eventually dissipating on May 26 over the East China Sea.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mariana Islands\n\nIn anticipation of Typhoon Mawar's arrival, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Guam issued a Typhoon Warning for the Mariana Islands on May 21. The warning included Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Saipan, with residents advised to prepare for catastrophic winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nThe Government of Guam activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on May 21, with Governor Lou Leon Guerrero declaring a state of emergency. The Guam Power Authority and Guam Waterworks Authority prepared for potential outages and disruptions to services.\n\nResidents on the Northern Mariana Islands, including Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, were also advised to take necessary precautions. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Government activated its EOC, with Governor Ralph Torres urging residents to prepare for the worst.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued advisories for the southern islands of Okinawa and Kyushu, warning of strong winds and heavy rainfall. The JMA also advised residents in the eastern part of the country to be prepared for potential storm surges and flooding.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued a Tropical Cyclone Advisory for the eastern part of the country, warning of strong winds and heavy rainfall.\n\n# Impact and aftermath\n\n## Guam\n\nTyphoon Mawar brought catastrophic winds and heavy rainfall to Guam, causing widespread damage and power outages.

The institution of slavery in Rome evolved over time, with various forms of enslavement, slave roles, and social attitudes toward slavery emerging throughout Roman history. This article provides an overview of the origins, laws, and social context of slavery in ancient Rome, as well as its impact on the economy, culture, and morality of the Roman world.\n\n# Origins\n\nThe origins of slavery in ancient Rome can be traced back to the city's early history, when the Romans first began to enslave war captives and prisoners. The Roman institution of slavery developed and expanded over time, influenced by the city's military conquests, economic growth, and cultural exchange with other civilizations.\n\n## Enslavement of Roman citizens\n\nAlthough it was rare, Roman citizens could also be enslaved under certain circumstances. This could occur if a citizen was captured by an enemy state and sold into slavery, or if a citizen was forced into debt bondage due to financial difficulties. However, Roman citizens who were enslaved were entitled to certain rights and protections under Roman law.\n\n# The slave in Roman law and society\n\nThe status of slaves in Roman law and society was complex and multifaceted. Slaves were considered property, but they were also recognized as human beings with certain rights and capacities.\n\n## Marriage and family\n\nSlaves were allowed to form unions with other slaves, and even with free individuals, although these unions were not considered legitimate marriages. Slave families were often separated through sale or transfer, and slaves had no automatic right to inherit property or maintain family relationships.\n\n## Peculium\n\nSlaves were allowed to accumulate a personal fund, known as the peculium, which they could use to purchase their freedom or improve their living conditions. The peculium was a key institution in Roman slavery, as it provided slaves with a degree of autonomy and economic agency.\n\n## Manumission\n\nSlaves could be freed through a process known as manumission, which involved a formal declaration of freedom by the slaveowner. Manumission was often granted as a reward for loyal service or as a way of demonstrating the slaveowner's wealth and status.\n\n## Freedmen\n\nFreedmen, or former slaves who had been granted their freedom, occupied a unique social status in ancient Rome. They were no longer slaves, but they were not fully equal to freeborn citizens either. Freedmen often maintained close relationships with their former slaveowners and were expected to provide certain services and obligations in return for their freedom.\n\n## Dediticii\n\nDediticii were individuals who had surrendered to the Romans in times of war or rebellion. They were often enslaved or forced to become subjects of the Roman state, and were considered to be of lower status than other slaves or citizens.\n\n# Causes of enslavement\n\nThere were several ways in which individuals could become enslaved in ancient Rome, including war captivity, piracy, debt, and birth into slavery.\n\n## War captives\n\nWar captives were a major source of slaves in ancient Rome. Prisoners of war were often sold into slavery, and the Roman state itself became a major slaveowner through its military conquests.\n\n### Captivi in Roman culture\n\nWar captives were often displayed as trophies in Roman triumphs, and their enslavement was seen as a symbol of Roman power and dominance.\n\n## Piracy and kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also significant sources of slaves in ancient Rome. Pirates and kidnappers would capture individuals and sell them into slavery, often to Roman slave traders.\n\n## Vernae\n\nVernae were slaves who were born into slave", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He often cited Roger Taylor, Queen's drummer, as a major influence on his drumming style. Hawkins was also a fan of progressive rock and cited bands like Rush and Yes as influences.\n\n# Equipment\n\nHawkins was known for his distinctive drumming style, which was characterized by his use of a large drum kit and a variety of percussion instruments. He played Gretsch drums and used Zildjian cymbals. Hawkins was also known for his energetic live performances, which often featured him playing drums while standing on his kit or using his drumsticks to play other instruments.\n\n# Personal life\n\nHawkins was married to Alison Hawkins, and the couple had three children together. He was known for his charismatic personality and was often praised by fans and fellow musicians for his kindness and generosity.

It is a member of the deer family (Cervidae) and is closely related to other species of deer, such as moose and red deer. Reindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, thick coats, and ability to survive in harsh, cold environments.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer with a compact body and long legs. They have a thick coat of fur that can be brown, gray, or white in color, depending on the subspecies. They have a distinctive set of antlers that are grown by both males and females, although the antlers of males are typically larger and more complex. Reindeer also have a unique set of hooves that are specially adapted to grip snow and ice.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nReindeer are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to a decline in their population over the past few decades. The main threats to reindeer are habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as climate change, which is affecting their food supply and migration patterns.\n\nNaming\n------\n\nThe name \"reindeer\" comes from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which means \"horned animal.\" The name \"caribou\" comes from the Mi'kmaq word \"kalibu,\" which means \"shoveler\" or \"snow scraper.\" This refers to the reindeer's habit of using its hooves to scrape away snow and ice to find food.\n\nEvolution\n----------\n\nReindeer are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species around 2-3 million years ago. They are thought to have originated in Asia and then migrated to Europe and North America. Over time, reindeer adapted to the harsh conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions, developing specialized features such as their thick coats and antlers.\n\nTaxonomy\n----------\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nThe taxonomy of reindeer has been the subject of much debate and research over the years. In the 19th century, many species of reindeer were described based on museum specimens, but these descriptions were often based on incomplete or inaccurate information. In recent years, advances in genetics and molecular biology have helped to clarify the taxonomy of reindeer.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nBiological exploration expeditions to the Arctic and subarctic regions have helped to identify new subspecies of reindeer and to clarify the relationships between different populations. These expeditions have also provided valuable information on the ecology and behavior of reindeer.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nIn recent years, there has been a reclassification of reindeer subspecies based on genetic and molecular evidence. This has led to the recognition of several new subspecies, including the Svalbard reindeer and the Peary caribou.\n\n#### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer can be divided into several ecotypes based on their adaptations to different environments. These ecotypes include the Arctic tundra reindeer, the boreal forest reindeer, and the mountain reindeer.\n\n#### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic and molecular evidence has provided valuable insights into the evolution and taxonomy of reindeer. Archaeological evidence has also helped to clarify the history of reindeer domestication and the spread of reindeer herding.\n\n#### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent genetic studies have identified several novel clades of reindeer that were not previously recognized. These clades are based on genetic differences between different populations of reindeer.\n\nSpecies and subspecies\n----------------------\n\nThere are several species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (reindeer or caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus tarandus (Arctic reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (Svalbard reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus pearyi (Peary caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus osborni (Ogilvie Mountains caribou)\n\nPhysical characteristics\n------------------------\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer are known for their distinctive antlers, which are grown by both males and females. The antlers of males are typically larger and more complex than those of females. Antlers are made of bone and are grown and shed every year.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick coat of fur that can be brown, gray, or white in color, depending on the subspecies. The pelt is made up of two layers of fur: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a specialized system of heat exchange that helps to conserve heat in cold environments. This system involves the use of countercurrent heat exchange in the legs and a specialized network of blood vessels in the nose.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have a unique set of hooves that are specially adapted to grip snow and ice. The hooves are made of a hard, keratin-based material and are shaped like a shovel.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer, with adults typically weighing between 100-200 kg (220-440 lb).\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer are known for the clicking sound they make with their hooves. This sound is made by the tendons in the legs and is used for communication and mating.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large, dark eyes that are adapted to the low light conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions.\n\nBiology and behaviors\n----------------------\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer have a unique seasonal body composition that helps them to survive in harsh environments. In the summer, reindeer have a layer of fat that helps to keep them warm, while in the winter, they have a layer of muscle that helps to keep them warm.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer have a complex reproductive cycle that is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Arctic and subarctic regions. Females typically give birth to a single calf in the spring, and the calf is weaned after several months.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are social animals that live in herds. They have a complex social structure that is based on dominance and submission. Reindeer are also migratory animals that travel long distances every year to find food and shelter.\n\nEcology\n----------\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. They live in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and mountains.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores that feed on a variety of plants, including lichens, mosses, and grasses. They also feed on twigs and leaves.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have several predators, including wolves, bears, and wolverines.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are also threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as climate change, which is affecting their food supply and migration patterns.\n\nConservation\n------------\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer are listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to a decline in their population over the past few decades.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the boreal forests of North America. It is listed as \"threatened\" on the IUCN Red List.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of North America. It is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List.\n\nRelationship with humans\n-------------------------\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous North Americans for thousands of years. They are used for food, clothing, and transportation.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have also been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous Eurasians for thousands of years. They are used for food, clothing, and transportation.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer are also raised in captivity for their meat, milk, and hides.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have been domesticated for thousands of years, and have been used for transportation, milk, and meat.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are also associated with the legend of Santa Claus, who is said to use them to pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have appeared in the mythology and art of many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of North America and Eurasia.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer have also been used as symbols and heraldic devices in many cultures.\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Sami people\n* Inuit\n\nNotes\n------\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Banfield, A.
