She was also a councillor for the London Borough of Greenwich from 2006 to 2010. Truss stood as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the 2001 general election in the constituency of Hemsworth, but lost to the Labour Party candidate. She was also shortlisted as a candidate for the constituency of Cheltenham in 2005, but ultimately did not secure the nomination.\n\n## Backbencher (2010–2012)\n\nTruss was elected as the MP for South West Norfolk in the 2010 general election, winning the seat with a majority of over 13,000 votes. As a backbencher, Truss was a member of the Free Enterprise Group, a group of Conservative MPs who advocated for free market policies. She also served as a member of the Justice Select Committee and the Education Select Committee.\n\n## Education under-secretary (2012–2014)\n\nIn 2012, Truss was appointed as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare. In this role, she was responsible for implementing the government's education policies, including the expansion of free schools and the introduction of the phonics test for primary school pupils.\n\n## Environment secretary (2014–2016)\n\nIn 2014, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). As Environment Secretary, Truss was responsible for implementing the government's policies on agriculture, conservation, and climate change. She also played a key role in the development of the government's strategy for leaving the European Union.\n\n## Justice secretary and lord chancellor (2016–2017)\n\nIn 2016, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, making her the first woman to hold the office. As Justice Secretary, Truss was responsible for implementing the government's policies on justice and the rule of law. She also played a key role in the development of the government's strategy for reforming the prison system.\n\n## Chief secretary to the Treasury (2017–2019)\n\nIn 2017, Truss was appointed as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, making her the second woman to hold the office. As Chief Secretary, Truss was responsible for implementing the government's policies on public spending and taxation. She also played a key role in the development of the government's strategy for Brexit.\n\n## International trade secretary (2019–2021)\n\nIn 2019, Truss was appointed as the Secretary of State for International Trade.

As Foreign Secretary, Truss was responsible for implementing the government's policies on foreign affairs and development. She also played a key role in the development of the government's strategy for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Leadership election (July–September 2022)\n\nIn July 2022, Truss announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party, following the resignation of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. Truss won the leadership election in September 2022, defeating Rishi Sunak in the final round of voting.\n\n# Premiership (2022)\n\n## Cabinet and death of Elizabeth II\n\nTruss was appointed as Prime Minister on September 6, 2022, following the resignation of Boris Johnson. She became the third female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, after Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May. Truss's first act as Prime Minister was to appoint a new cabinet, which included several prominent Conservative MPs. Truss also played a key role in the government's response to the death of Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away on September 8, 2022.\n\n## Domestic policies and mini-budget\n\nTruss's government implemented several domestic policies, including a mini-budget that aimed to stimulate economic growth. The mini-budget included several tax cuts and spending increases, which were designed to boost economic activity. However, the mini-budget was widely criticized by economists and opposition politicians, who argued that it would increase inequality and worsen the government's finances.\n\n## Government crisis and resignation\n\nTruss's government faced a major crisis in October 2022, when several Conservative MPs rebelled against the government's policies. The crisis led to the resignation of several government ministers, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng.

The fires, which started in early spring and continued throughout the summer, were fueled by hot and dry weather conditions, as well as strong winds. This article provides an overview of the background, wildfires, domestic impacts, international effects, fatalities, domestic government responses, and other reactions related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires.\n\n# Background\n\nCanada is prone to wildfires due to its vast forests and dry climate, particularly in the western provinces. The country experiences an average of 8,000 wildfires per year, with the majority occurring in the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. The 2023 Canadian wildfires were particularly severe, with many fires burning out of control for weeks or even months.\n\n# Wildfires\n\n## Alberta\n\nAlberta was one of the hardest-hit provinces, with numerous wildfires burning across the province. The High Level Forest Area was particularly affected, with multiple fires burning in the region.\n\n### High Level Forest Area\n\nThe High Level Forest Area was the site of several major wildfires, including the Chuckegg Creek Wildfire, which burned over 350,000 hectares of land.

The crisis began in 2022 and lasted for nearly two years, with multiple incidents and escalations occurring throughout the period.\n\n# Background\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but the status of the region remains disputed. The north of Kosovo, which is home to a majority of the country's ethnic Serb population, has historically been a point of contention between the two countries. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state and views the north as part of its own territory. Kosovo, on the other hand, claims sovereignty over the entire territory.\n\nIn the years leading up to the crisis, tensions between Kosovo and Serbia had been simmering. Efforts to normalize relations between the two countries had stalled, and incidents of violence and intimidation against ethnic Serbs in Kosovo had increased. The situation was further complicated by the presence of parallel institutions in the north, which were established by Serbia and maintained a degree of autonomy from the Kosovo government.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2022\n\n### July\n\nThe crisis began in July 2022, when Kosovo's government announced plans to introduce a new license plate system, which would replace existing plates issued by Serbia. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's authority over the north and was met with resistance from local Serbs. Protests erupted in the town of Mitrovica, with demonstrators blocking roads and clashing with police.\n\n### August\n\nTensions escalated in August, when Kosovo's police attempted to enforce the new license plate system in the north. Clashes broke out between police and local Serbs, resulting in several injuries and arrests. Serbia's government condemned the actions of Kosovo's police and accused them of attempting to ethnically cleanse the north.\n\n### September\n\nIn September, the situation took a turn for the worse, when a group of masked men attacked a police station in the north. The attack was blamed on Kosovo's government, which denied any involvement. Serbia's government responded by deploying troops to the border with Kosovo, citing concerns for the safety of ethnic Serbs.\n\n### October\n\nOctober saw a significant escalation of the crisis, when Kosovo's government announced plans to hold local elections in the north. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's authority over the region and was met with resistance from local Serbs. Protests erupted, and clashes broke out between police and demonstrators.\n\n### November\n\nIn November, the situation continued to deteriorate, with reports of violence and intimidation against ethnic Serbs in Kosovo. The international community called for calm and restraint, but the situation remained volatile.\n\n### December\n\nDecember saw a significant incident, when a group of Kosovo Albanian protesters attacked a Serb monastery in the north. The attack was widely condemned, and Serbia's government accused Kosovo's authorities of failing to protect the rights of ethnic Serbs.\n\n## 2023\n\n### January\n\nJanuary saw a relative calm in the north, with tensions easing slightly. However, the situation remained volatile, and incidents of violence and intimidation continued to occur.\n\n### February\n\nIn February, Kosovo's government announced plans to establish a new police unit in the north, which would be tasked with maintaining order and enforcing the law. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's authority over the region and was met with resistance from local Serbs.\n\n### March\n\nMarch saw a significant incident, when a group of Kosovo Albanian protesters clashed with Serb demonstrators in the town of Mitrovica. The incident highlighted the ongoing tensions between the two communities and the challenges facing efforts to normalize relations.\n\n### April\n\nApril saw a visit by a delegation of international officials to the north, who called for calm and restraint. The visit was seen as an attempt to ease tensions and promote dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n### May\n\nIn May, Kosovo's government announced plans to hold a referendum on the status of the north. The move was seen as an attempt to assert Kosovo's authority over the region and was met with resistance from local Serbs.\n\n### June\n\nJune saw a significant escalation of the crisis, when a group of masked men attacked a police station in the north. The attack was blamed on Kosovo's government, which denied any involvement. Serbia's government responded by deploying troops to the border with Kosovo.\n\n### July\n\nJuly saw a relative calm in the north, with tensions easing slightly. However, the situation remained volatile, and incidents of violence and intimidation continued to occur.\n\n### September\n\nIn September, the situation took a turn for the worse, when a group of Kosovo Albanian protesters clashed with Serb demonstrators in the town of Mitrovica.

The visit was seen as an attempt to ease tensions and promote dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\n### December\n\nDecember saw a relative calm in the north, with tensions easing slightly.

The attack was blamed on Kosovo's government, which denied any involvement. Serbia's government responded by deploying troops to the border with Kosovo.\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe international community has called for calm and restraint throughout the crisis, with many countries urging Kosovo and Serbia to engage in dialogue and find a peaceful resolution to their differences. The United States, the European Union, and other organizations have offered support for efforts to normalize relations between the two countries.\n\n# See also\n\n* Kosovo status process\n* Kosovo–Serbia relations\n* North Kosovo\n* Kosovo War\n* Ethnic cleansing", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"North_Kosovo_crisis_(2022–2024)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Timeline\n##2022\n###July\n###August\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2023\n###January\n###February\n###March\n###April\n###May\n###June\n###July\n###September\n###October\n###November\n###December\n##2024\n###February\n###August\n#Reactions\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, on the morning of the first matchday, FIFA announced that players would receive yellow cards if they wore the armbands. In response, the seven teams involved announced that they would not wear the armbands, citing the threat of yellow cards and the potential impact on their players.\n\n## Other Pride items\n\nDespite the ban on OneLove armbands, several teams and players found other ways to show their support for LGBT rights during the tournament. For example, the German team covered their mouths during a team photo before their match against Japan, in protest of FIFA's decision. The German football association, DFB, stated that the gesture was meant to \"denounce the lack of freedom of expression\" and \"criticize the ban on the OneLove armband\".\n\n# Standings\n\n| Pos | Team | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification |\n| 1 |  England | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 9 | 2 | +7 | 7 | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2 |  United States | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | +1 | 5 |\n| 3 |  Iran | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 7 | −3 | 3 |  |\n| 4 |  Wales | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 | −5 | 1 |\n\n# Matches\n\n## England vs Iran\n\nThe first match of Group B took place on 21 November 2022, between England and Iran.

The battle began in August 2022 and lasted for nearly a year, with both sides suffering significant losses. It was one of the bloodiest and most destructive battles of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#Background\n\nThe city of Bakhmut, with a pre-war population of around 70,000, is a strategically important location in eastern Ukraine. It is situated near the intersection of several major roads and is close to the city of Kramatorsk, a key Ukrainian military hub. Bakhmut is also home to several important industrial facilities, including a salt mine and a winery.\n\nPrior to the Russian invasion, Bakhmut was a relatively quiet city, with a strong sense of community and a growing tourism industry. However, as the conflict escalated in 2022, the city became a key target for Russian forces seeking to capture the Donetsk region.\n\n#Battle\n\nThe Battle of Bakhmut was a complex and multifaceted engagement that can be divided into several distinct phases.\n\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n\nThe battle began in August 2022, as Russian forces started shelling Bakhmut with artillery and rockets. The Ukrainian military responded with counter-battery fire, but the Russian attacks continued to intensify. As the weeks passed, Russian forces began to encroach on the city's outskirts, capturing several key villages and settlements.\n\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n\nAs winter approached, the battle escalated further. Russian forces launched a series of ground assaults against Ukrainian positions, but were repeatedly repelled. The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, began to dig in, establishing a network of trenches and fortifications around the city.\n\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n\nIn January 2023, Russian forces captured the nearby town of Soledar, which gave them control of the main road into Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military responded by launching a series of counterattacks, but were unable to retake the town. As the weeks passed, Russian forces continued to tighten their grip on Bakhmut, capturing several key villages and settlements to the north and south of the city.\n\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, the Ukrainian military launched a series of flanking counterattacks against Russian positions to the north and south of Bakhmut. The attacks were designed to relieve pressure on the city and disrupt Russian supply lines. The counterattacks were initially successful, but were eventually repelled by Russian forces.\n\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n\nOn May 20, 2023, Russian forces captured the center of Bakhmut, marking a major turning point in the battle. The Ukrainian military withdrew from the city, and Russian forces began to consolidate their gains. However, in early June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit that had played a key role in the battle, announced that it was withdrawing from Bakhmut due to heavy losses.\n\n#Military strength and tactics\n\nThe military strength and tactics employed during the Battle of Bakhmut were complex and multifaceted.\n\n* Russian forces: The Russian military employed a range of tactics during the battle, including artillery bombardments, ground assaults, and drone strikes. They also made use of mercenary groups, such as the Wagner Group, to spearhead their attacks. Russian forces were estimated to have outnumbered Ukrainian forces by a ratio of 3:1.\n* Ukrainian forces: The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, employed a range of tactics, including counter-battery fire, ambushes, and flanking counterattacks. They also made use of drones and artillery to target Russian positions.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the Battle of Bakhmut was marked by significant destruction and loss of life.\n\n##Strategic value\n\nThe capture of Bakhmut gave Russian forces control of a key strategic location in eastern Ukraine. However, the city's value was largely symbolic, as it did not provide a significant military advantage.\n\n##Battlefield conditions\n\nThe battlefield conditions during the battle were harsh, with both sides operating in freezing temperatures and muddy terrain. The city was heavily damaged, with many buildings reduced to rubble.\n\n##Casualties\n\nThe casualties during the Battle of Bakhmut were significant.\n\n###Military casualties\n\n* Russian forces: Estimated losses were in the thousands, although exact figures are unclear.\n* Ukrainian forces: Estimated losses were in the hundreds, although exact figures are unclear.\n\n###Civilian casualties\n\n* Estimated losses were in the hundr", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Bakhmut\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Early shelling and Russian encroachment (August–October 2022)\n##Early winter escalation (November–December 2022)\n##Capture of Soledar and partial encirclement (January–April 2023)\n##Ukrainian flanking counterattacks begin (May 2023)\n##Capture of Bakhmut and Wagner withdrawal (20 May–early June 2023)\n#Military strength and tactics\n#Aftermath\n##Strategic value\n##Battlefield conditions\n##Casualties\n###Military casualties\n###Civilian casualties\n##Attrition\n##Result\n#Allegations of war crimes\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on October 16, 1925, in London, England, Lansbury has established herself as one of the most versatile and accomplished actresses of her generation. With a career that encompasses film, television, and theater, Lansbury has captivated audiences with her unique blend of wit, charm, and talent.\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n\nAngela Lansbury was born in Regent's Park, London, to Edgar Lansbury, a timber merchant, and Belfast-born Moyna Macgill, a actress. She was the first of four children, including twin brothers Edgar and Bruce, and a sister, Isolde. Lansbury's early life was marked by her mother's career in theater, which exposed her to the performing arts from a young age. The family moved to the United States in 1940, settling in New York City.\n\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n\nLansbury's introduction to the film industry came at the age of 16, when she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1942. Her film debut was in the 1944 film \"Gaslight,\" opposite Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer. Lansbury's portrayal of Nancy Oliver, a cockney maid, earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. This early success marked the beginning of a long and fruitful association with MGM.\n\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n\nThroughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lansbury appeared in a string of films for MGM, including \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1945), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), and \"State of the Union\" (1948). Her performances showcased her range and versatility, solidifying her position as a rising star in Hollywood.\n\n#Mid career\n\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Lansbury's career experienced a slight downturn, with fewer leading roles and more minor appearances. One notable exception was her portrayal of Eleanor Iselin in the 1962 film \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" opposite Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey. Her performance earned her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n\nLansbury's career resurgence began in the late 1960s, when she took on the title role in the Broadway musical \"Mame.\" Her performance as the eccentric and charismatic Mame Dennis earned her widespread critical acclaim and a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. This success marked a turning point in Lansbury's career, as she transitioned from film to theater and established herself as a leading lady of the stage.\n\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n\nIn the 1970s, Lansbury continued to work in theater, appearing in productions such as \"Gypsy\" (1974) and \"The King and I\" (1977). She also began to explore her Irish heritage, purchasing a home in County Cork and becoming involved in local charitable organizations.\n\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n\nIn 1979, Lansbury starred as Mrs. Lovett in the Broadway musical \"Sweeney Todd,\" opposite Len Cariou. Her performance earned her a second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Throughout the early 1980s, Lansbury continued to appear in films, including \"The Mirror Crack'd\" (1980) and \"The Company of Wolves\" (1984).\n\n#Global fame\n\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n\nLansbury's most iconic role came in 1984, when she began starring as Jessica Fletcher in the CBS television series \"Murder, She Wrote.\" The show, which followed the adventures of a mystery novelist and amateur sleuth, became a global phenomenon, airing for 12 seasons and earning Lansbury numerous awards and nominations, including 12 Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.\n\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n\nIn the 2000s, Lansbury continued to work in film and television, appearing in productions such as \"Nanny McPhee\" (2005) and \"Little Women\" (2017). She also remained active in theater, starring in productions such as \"Blithe Spirit\" (2009) and \"A Little Night Music\" (2009).\n\n#Personal life\n\nLansbury has been married twice, first to actor Richard Cromwell from 1945 until their divorce in 1946, and then to actor Peter Shaw from 1949 until his death in 2003. She has two children, Anthony and Deirdre, and several grandchildren.\n\n#Honours and legacy\n\nThroughout her career, Lansbury has been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including six Tony Awards, three Academy Award nominations, and 12 Emmy nominations. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1994 and was elevated to Dame Commander (DBE) in 2014. Lansbury's legacy as a pioneering actress and advocate for the arts continues to inspire new generations of performers and audiences alike.\n\n#Publications\n\nLansbury has written two autobiographies, \"Sheltered Daughters\" (1983) and \"Balancing Act\" (1999), which offer a unique glimpse into her life and career.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of British actresses\n* List of American actresses\n* List of Tony Award winners\n* List of Emmy Award winners\n\n#Notes\n\nThis article is a comprehensive overview of Angela Lansbury's life and career, drawing on a range of sources and biographical information.\n\n#References\n\n(Citations and references will be included in the actual Wikipedia article, but are not included here as per the requirements.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Angela_Lansbury\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and career beginnings\n##Childhood: 1925–1942\n##Career breakthrough: 1942–1945\n##Later MGM films: 1945–1951\n#Mid career\n##The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles: 1952–1965\n##Mame and theatrical stardom: 1966–1969\n##Ireland and Gypsy: 1970–1978\n##Sweeney Todd and continued cinematic work: 1979–1984\n#Global fame\n##Murder, She Wrote: 1984–2003\n##Final years: 2003–2022\n#Personal life\n#Honours and legacy\n#Publications\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Citations\n##General and cited sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is one of the oldest and largest museums in the state of Hesse, with a collection of over 700,000 objects. The museum's diverse collections range from prehistoric artifacts to contemporary art, and its exhibitions and programs aim to engage audiences in the cultural and natural heritage of the region.\n\n#History\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt was founded in 1820 by Grand Duke Louis I of Hesse, who recognized the importance of preserving and showcasing the cultural and natural heritage of the region. Initially, the museum was housed in the grand ducal palace in Darmstadt, but as the collections grew, it became necessary to find a larger and more suitable location. In 1902, the museum moved to its current building, which was designed by the architect Alfred Messel.\n\nOver the years, the museum has undergone several transformations, with new departments and collections being added. During World War II, the museum suffered significant damage, and many of its collections were lost or destroyed. After the war, the museum underwent a major reconstruction effort, and many of its collections were rebuilt through donations and purchases.\n\n#Building\n\n##Location\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt is located in the heart of Darmstadt, on the Friedensplatz. The museum's building is a prominent example of late 19th-century museum architecture, with a mix of Art Nouveau and historicist styles. The building's facade is decorated with sculptures and reliefs, which reflect the museum's diverse collections.\n\n##Renovations and extensions\n\nIn recent years, the museum has undergone several renovations and extensions. In 2008, the museum completed a major renovation of its building, which included the restoration of the original facade and the installation of modern climate control and security systems. In 2015, the museum opened a new wing, designed by the architect Volker Staab, which provides additional exhibition space and improved facilities for visitors.\n\n#Collections\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a diverse range of collections, which reflect the cultural and natural heritage of the region. The museum's collections include:\n\n* Prehistoric artifacts, including tools, ceramics, and jewelry\n* Ancient Greek and Roman art and artifacts\n* Medieval and Renaissance art and artifacts, including sculptures, paintings, and textiles\n* Baroque and Rococo art and artifacts, including furniture, ceramics, and glass\n* 19th- and 20th-century art, including paintings, sculptures, and installations\n* Natural history collections, including fossils, minerals, and taxidermied animals\n* Ethnographic collections, including artifacts from Africa, Asia, and the Americas\n\n#Gallery\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has a number of permanent galleries, which showcase the museum's diverse collections. Some of the galleries include:\n\n* The Prehistoric Gallery, which features artifacts from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age\n* The Ancient Gallery, which features art and artifacts from ancient Greece and Rome\n* The Medieval and Renaissance Gallery, which features art and artifacts from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance\n* The Baroque and Rococo Gallery, which features art and artifacts from the 17th and 18th centuries\n* The 19th- and 20th-Century Gallery, which features art from the modern period\n* The Natural History Gallery, which features fossils, minerals, and taxidermied animals\n* The Ethnographic Gallery, which features artifacts from Africa, Asia, and the Americas\n\n#Special exhibitions\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt also hosts a number of special exhibitions throughout the year, which showcase the museum's collections and engage audiences in the cultural and natural heritage of the region. Recent special exhibitions have included:\n\n* \"The Art of the Renaissance in Hesse\"\n* \"The Natural History of the Odenwald\"\n* \"The Art of the 20th Century in Hesse\"\n* \"The Cultural Heritage of Africa in Hesse\"\n\n#Controversies\n\nThe Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt has been involved in several controversies over the years, including debates over the ownership and repatriation of cultural artifacts. In 2013, the museum returned a number of artifacts to their countries of origin, including a collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts that were looted during the colonial period.\n\n#See also\n\n* List of museums in Germany\n* List of art museums in Germany\n* List of natural history museums in Germany\n* List of ethnographic museums in Germany\n\n#Films\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A History\" (2010)\n* \"The Art of the Renaissance in Hesse\" (2012)\n* \"The Natural History of the Odenwald\" (2015)\n\n#References\n\nThis article does not include citations or references.\n\n#Further reading\n\n* \"The Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt: A Guide to the Collections\" (2018)\n* \"The Art of the 20th Century in Hesse\" (2019)\n* \"The Cultural Heritage of Africa in Hesse\" (2020)\n\n#External links\n\n* Official website of the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n#Building\n##Location\n##Renovations and extensions\n#Collections\n#Gallery\n#Special exhibitions\n#Controversies\n#See also\n#Films\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is known for his exceptional leadership, strategic genius, and innovative tactics, which earned him numerous victories and accolades throughout his illustrious career.\n\n# Early Life\n\n## Origins\n\nAlexander Suvorov was born on November 24, 1730, in Moscow, Russia, to a family of minor nobility. His father, Vasily Ivanovich Suvorov, was a military officer who had served in the Russian army during the Great Northern War.\n\n## Childhood\n\nSuvorov's childhood was marked by a strong interest in military affairs, which was encouraged by his father. He was educated at home, where he developed a passion for reading and writing. Suvorov's early life was also influenced by his mother, Avdotya Fedorovna Suvorova, who instilled in him a strong sense of morality and compassion.\n\n# Early Career\n\n## First Military Experience\n\nSuvorov's military career began in 1748, when he enlisted in the Russian army as a private. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant in 1754. Suvorov's early military experience was marked by service in the Seven Years' War, where he fought against Prussian forces.\n\n## 1761\n\nIn 1761, Suvorov was appointed as the commander of the Astrakhan Regiment, which was stationed in the Caucasus region. This marked the beginning of his rise to prominence as a military commander.\n\n## Freemasonry, Berlin\n\nIn 1762, Suvorov became a member of the Freemasons, a secret society that emphasized the values of brotherhood, morality, and intellectual pursuits. He also visited Berlin, where he met with prominent intellectuals and military leaders, including Frederick the Great.\n\n# Wars against Poland-Lithuania\n\n## Dissolution of the Bar Confederation (1768-1772)\n\n### Outbreak of War and Setbacks\n\nIn 1768, Suvorov was appointed as the commander of Russian forces in Poland, where he was tasked with suppressing the Bar Confederation, a Polish uprising against Russian rule. The war began with a series of setbacks for Russian forces, including the defeat of Suvorov's troops at the Battle of Lancut.\n\n### Retaliatory Strike\n\nHowever, Suvorov quickly regrouped and launched a retaliatory strike against Polish forces, which resulted in a series of victories for Russian troops. The war ultimately ended with the dissolution of the Bar Confederation and the partitioning of Poland between Russia, Prussia, and Austria.\n\n## Battles against Polish Uprising (1794)\n\n### Turning Victories\n\nIn 1794, Suvorov was once again appointed as the commander of Russian forces in Poland, where he was tasked with suppressing a new Polish uprising. The war began with a series of turning victories for Russian forces, including the Battle of Krupczyce and the Battle of Terespol.\n\n### Triumph and Tragedy in Praga\n\nThe war culminated in the Battle of Praga, where Russian forces defeated Polish troops and captured the city of Warsaw. However, the victory was marred by tragedy, as Russian troops massacred thousands of Polish civilians in the city.\n\n### Culmination, Impact of Campaign\n\nThe war ultimately ended with the defeat of Polish forces and the partitioning of Poland between Russia, Prussia, and Austria. Suvorov's victories in Poland cemented his reputation as a brilliant military commander and earned him widespread acclaim throughout Europe.\n\n# Wars with the Ottoman Empire\n\n## 1st War against the Ottomans\n\n### Developments\n\nIn 1768, Suvorov was appointed as the commander of Russian forces in the Caucasus region, where he was tasked with fighting against Ottoman forces. The war began with a series of developments, including the capture of the city of Azov and the defeat of Ottoman forces at the Battle of Kagul.\n\n## 2nd War against the Ottomans\n\n### Beginning\n\nIn 1787, Suvorov was once again appointed as the commander of Russian forces in the Caucasus region, where he was tasked with fighting against Ottoman forces.

The riot was sparked by the attempted enrollment of James Meredith, an African American student, at the previously all-white institution. The event marked a significant milestone in the American Civil Rights Movement and highlighted the deep-seated racial tensions in the United States during the 1960s.\n\n# Leadup\n\n## Meredith's attempts to enroll\n\nIn January 1961, James Meredith, a 28-year-old African American veteran, applied to the University of Mississippi, citing his right to attend the institution under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. Meredith's application was initially rejected, but he persisted, filing a lawsuit against the university in May 1961. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in Meredith's favor on September 10, 1962.\n\n## Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n\nIn the months leading up to Meredith's enrollment, tensions in Mississippi escalated. Governor Ross Barnett, a staunch segregationist, vowed to block Meredith's admission, while President John F. Kennedy attempted to reason with Barnett through a series of phone calls. Kennedy urged Barnett to respect the law and allow Meredith to enroll, but Barnett refused, citing concerns about public safety and the potential for violence.\n\nAs the standoff between Kennedy and Barnett continued, the situation on the Ole Miss campus grew increasingly volatile. Students and faculty members alike were divided on the issue of integration, with many expressing opposition to Meredith's enrollment. In the days leading up to September 30, the campus was filled with the sound of protesters chanting slogans and waving Confederate flags.\n\n# Events\n\n## Meredith arrives\n\nOn September 30, 1962, James Meredith arrived at the Ole Miss campus, accompanied by a small group of federal marshals. The group was met by a crowd of angry students, who had gathered to protest Meredith's enrollment. As the marshals attempted to escort Meredith to the university's administration building, the crowd surged forward, blocking their path.\n\n## Violence on campus\n\nThe situation quickly spiraled out of control as protesters began throwing rocks and bottles at the federal marshals. The marshals responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, but the protesters continued to advance. Meredith was eventually forced to take cover in a nearby dormitory, where he was protected by a group of federal agents.\n\nAs the violence escalated, the Ole Miss campus descended into chaos. Buildings were set on fire, and cars were overturned. The sounds of gunfire and breaking glass filled the air, and the smell of tear gas hung heavy over the campus.\n\n## Military response\n\nAs the situation on campus continued to deteriorate, President Kennedy deployed a group of U.S. Army troops to Oxford, Mississippi. The troops, who arrived on the evening of September 30, were tasked with restoring order and ensuring Meredith's safety.\n\nThe military response was swift and decisive. The troops moved quickly to disperse the crowd, using bayonets and tear gas to restore order. The violence eventually subsided, and Meredith was escorted safely to his dormitory.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two people dead and over 300 injured. The event marked a turning point in the American Civil Rights Movement, highlighting the need for federal intervention to protect the rights of African Americans.\n\nIn the aftermath of the riot, James Meredith continued to face harassment and intimidation from his fellow students. Despite these challenges, Meredith persevered, earning a degree in political science from Ole Miss in 1963.\n\n# Legacy\n\nThe Ole Miss riot of 1962 had a profound impact on American society, highlighting the deep-seated racial tensions that existed in the United States during the 1960s. The event marked a significant milestone in the American Civil Rights Movement, demonstrating the need for federal intervention to protect the rights of African Americans.\n\nToday, the University of Mississippi is a thriving institution, with a diverse student body and a strong commitment to social justice. James Meredith, who went on to earn a law degree from Columbia University, continues to be an important figure in American civil rights history.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Notes\n\nThis article is based on historical records and accounts of the Ole Miss riot of 1962.\n\n## Citations and references\n\n(Note: Citations and references are not included in this version of the article, as per the requirements specified.)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ole_Miss_riot_of_1962\" following this outline:\n\n#Leadup\n##Meredith's attempts to enroll\n##Kennedy dialogue and escalating tensions\n#Events\n##Meredith arrives\n##Violence on campus\n##Military response\n##Aftermath\n#Legacy\n#Notes and references\n##Notes\n##Citations and references\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The album marks Swift's decision to re-record her older albums following the highly publicized dispute over the ownership of her master recordings. Speak Now (Taylor's Version) features re-recorded versions of the original tracks, as well as six additional \"From the Vault\" tracks, which were written and recorded during the original album's creation but did not make the final cut.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Scooter Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, had acquired Big Machine Records, Swift's former record label, for $300 million. As a result, Braun's company acquired the rights to Swift's master recordings from her 2006 debut album to 2017's reputation. Swift publicly expressed her disapproval of the deal, stating that she had not been given the opportunity to purchase her master recordings herself and that Braun's ownership of her music was a \"worst-case scenario\" for her.\n\nIn August 2020, Swift announced that she would be re-recording her older albums in an effort to regain control over her master recordings. Speak Now (Taylor's Version) is the second re-recorded album Swift has released, following Fearless (Taylor's Version), which was released in April 2021.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n----------------\n\n### Composition\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) features re-recorded versions of the original album's 14 tracks, as well as six additional \"From the Vault\" tracks. The album's production is notable for its use of a more stripped-back, acoustic sound, with Swift's vocals and guitar work taking center stage. The album's sound is often described as country-pop, with influences from folk, rock, and pop music.\n\nThe album's lyrics are characterized by their introspective and personal nature, with Swift addressing themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery. Many of the album's tracks are based on Swift's own experiences and relationships, with some songs featuring direct references to her personal life.\n\n### \"From the Vault\" tracks\n\nThe six \"From the Vault\" tracks featured on Speak Now (Taylor's Version) were written and recorded during the original album's creation but did not make the final cut. These tracks offer a glimpse into Swift's creative process and provide insight into the album's original vision. The \"From the Vault\" tracks feature a similar sound and style to the original album, with Swift's vocals and guitar work taking center stage.\n\nRelease\n--------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) was released on July 7, 2023, through Republic Records. The album was announced in May 2023, with Swift releasing a series of teasers and promotional materials in the lead-up to the album's release. The album was made available on various streaming platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music.\n\nCritical reception\n-----------------\n\nSpeak Now (Taylor's Version) received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, with many reviewers praising Swift's vocals, songwriting, and production.

Perched on a hill in the heart of the city, the church is one of the most iconic landmarks in Paris and a popular tourist destination.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe idea of building a church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was first proposed in 1870 by Alexandre Legentil, a French Catholic priest. The proposal was initially met with skepticism, but it gained momentum after the Franco-Prussian War, which led to a renewed interest in Catholicism and the Sacred Heart devotion.\n\n### Site\n\nThe site chosen for the church was a hill in the 9th and 18th arrondissements of Paris, which offered a panoramic view of the city. The hill was previously occupied by a quarry and a gypsum mine, and it was also the site of the 1871 Paris Commune, a radical socialist government that ruled the city for several months.\n\n### Construction\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur began in 1875 and took nearly 40 years to complete. The church was designed by the French architect Paul Abadie, who was inspired by the Byzantine style of architecture. The construction process was slow and laborious, with many interruptions due to funding issues and the lack of a clear plan.\n\n### Controversy over the church\n\nThe construction of Sacré-Cœur was not without controversy. Many Parisians saw the church as a symbol of the Catholic Church's power and influence, and they opposed its construction. The church was also criticized for its location, which was seen as a provocation to the secular and republican values of the French state.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\n### Exterior\n\nThe exterior of Sacré-Cœur is characterized by its white domes and towers, which are inspired by the Byzantine style of architecture. The church is built from travertine limestone, which gives it a distinctive white color. The exterior is decorated with intricate carvings and mosaics, which depict scenes from the Bible and the history of the church.\n\n### Interior\n\nThe interior of Sacré-Cœur is just as impressive as its exterior. The church is decorated with intricate mosaics, stained glass windows, and sculptures, which create a sense of beauty and wonder. The interior is dominated by the large dome, which rises to a height of over 80 meters.\n\n#### The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n\nOne of the most striking features of the interior is the large mosaic that covers the ceiling of the apse. The mosaic, which is titled \"The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus,\" depicts the Sacred Heart of Jesus surrounded by angels, saints, and other biblical figures. The mosaic is made up of thousands of small pieces of glass and stone, which were carefully arranged to create a sense of depth and color.\n\n#### Chapels\n\nThe church has several chapels, each of which is dedicated to a different saint or aspect of Catholicism. The chapels are decorated with intricate carvings, mosaics, and stained glass windows, which create a sense of beauty and tranquility.\n\n#### Crypt\n\nThe crypt of Sacré-Cœur is located beneath the church and contains the tombs of several notable Catholics, including the French writer and philosopher, Joris-Karl Huysmans. The crypt is also home to a beautiful chapel, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\n### Art and decoration\n\nSacré-Cœur is renowned for its beautiful art and decoration, which includes intricate mosaics, stained glass windows, and sculptures. The church is home to many works of art, including paintings, tapestries, and carvings, which create a sense of beauty and wonder.\n\n#### Stained glass\n\nThe stained glass windows of Sacré-Cœur are some of the most beautiful in the world. The windows are made up of thousands of small pieces of glass, which were carefully arranged to create a sense of color and light. The windows depict scenes from the Bible and the history of the church.\n\n#### Sculpture\n\nThe church is home to many beautiful sculptures, including the famous \"Christ in Majesty\" sculpture, which is located above the main altar. The sculpture depicts Christ seated on a throne, surrounded by angels and saints.\n\n### Grand organ\n\nThe grand organ of Sacré-Cœur is one of the largest and most beautiful in the world. The organ has over 8,000 pipes and is capable of producing a wide range of sounds and tones. The organ is used in many of the church's services and concerts.\n\n### Bells\n\nThe bells of Sacré-Cœur are some of the most beautiful in the world. The church has 10 bells, each of which is named after a different saint or aspect of Catholicism. The bells are rung every day, and they can be heard throughout the city.\n\nRole in Catholicism\n----------------\n\nSacré-Cœur is a major pilgrimage site for Catholics from around the world. The church is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which is a devotion that is central to Catholicism. The church is also home to many relics and artifacts, including the remains of several saints.\n\nAccess\n------\n\nThe church is open every day, and it is free to visit. However, there is a fee to climb to the top of the dome, which offers a panoramic view of the city. The church is accessible by public transportation, and it is within walking distance of many of Paris's major landmarks.\n\nCopy in Martinique\n-----------------\n\nA copy of Sacré-Cœur was built in Fort-de-France, Martinique, in the early 20th century. The church, which is also dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, is a popular tourist destination and a major pilgrimage site for Catholics in the Caribbean.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Catholic Church\n* Sacred Heart\n* Paris\n* France\n* Architecture\n* Art\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* (insert references)\n\nBibliography (in French)\n-------------------------\n\n* (insert bibliography)\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\n* (insert further reading)\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\n* (insert external links)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sacré-Cœur,_Paris\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Proposal\n##Site\n##Construction\n##Controversy over the church\n#Description\n##Exterior\n##Interior\n###The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus mosaic\n###Chapels\n###Crypt\n##Art and decoration\n###Stained glass\n###Sculpture\n##Grand organ\n##Bells\n#Role in Catholicism\n#Access\n#Copy in Martinique\n#See also\n#References\n#Bibliography (in French)\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film stars Florence Pugh and Harry Styles as a young couple living in a utopian community in the 1950s, where the women are expected to be submissive and the men are employed by a mysterious organization.\n\n#Plot\n\nThe film is set in the 1950s in the utopian community of Victory, California, where a group of families live in a seemingly idyllic neighborhood. The community is run by a mysterious organization called Victory, where the men work and the women are expected to take care of the home and family. The story follows Alice Chambers (Florence Pugh), a housewife who lives with her husband Jack (Harry Styles), a successful employee of Victory. Alice's life seems perfect, but she begins to question the sinister forces at play in their community. As Alice delves deeper into the truth, she becomes increasingly unhinged, leading to a series of events that threaten to upend the entire community.\n\n#Cast\n\n* Florence Pugh as Alice Chambers\n* Harry Styles as Jack Chambers\n* Chris Pine as Frank\n* Gemma Chan as Shelley\n* Nick Kroll as Bill\n* Douglas Smith as Jeff\n* KiKi Layne as Margaret\n* Sydney Chandler as Bunny\n* Kate Berlant as Peg\n* Asif Ali as Peter\n* Olivia Wilde as Bunny (uncredited)\n\n#Production\n\n##Development and writing\n\nDon't Worry Darling was first announced in July 2019, with Olivia Wilde set to direct and Florence Pugh attached to star. The screenplay was written by Katie Silberman, who previously worked with Wilde on the film Booksmart. The story was inspired by the 1950s utopian communities and the Stepford Wives, as well as Wilde's own experiences with the pressures of modern society.\n\n##Casting\n\nIn August 2019, Harry Styles was cast opposite Pugh, marking his second film role after Dunkirk. Chris Pine was added to the cast in October 2019, followed by Gemma Chan, Nick Kroll, and KiKi Layne in November. Wilde also cast several up-and-coming actors, including Sydney Chandler and Asif Ali.\n\n##Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in October 2020 and wrapped in February 2021. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, California, with a budget of $20 million. Wilde worked closely with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to create a dreamlike atmosphere, using a combination of practical and CGI effects.\n\n##Alleged conflicts on set\n\n###Wilde and LaBeouf\n\nIn August 2020, Shia LaBeouf was cast as the male lead, but he dropped out of the project a month later due to scheduling conflicts. However, sources close to the production claimed that LaBeouf was fired by Wilde after he clashed with the director and Pugh on set. LaBeouf denied these claims, stating that he left the project amicably.\n\n###Wilde and Pugh\n\nThere were also reports of tension between Wilde and Pugh on set, with sources claiming that the two had creative differences. However, both Wilde and Pugh denied these rumors, stating that they had a close and collaborative working relationship.\n\n#Marketing\n\nThe first trailer for Don't Worry Darling was released in May 2022, generating significant buzz on social media. The trailer featured a haunting score and a series of surreal images, showcasing the film's unique blend of psychological thriller and social commentary. The marketing campaign also included a series of promotional posters and TV spots, highlighting the film's themes of feminism and rebellion.\n\n#Release\n\nDon't Worry Darling was released in the United States on September 23, 2022, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was also screened at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n#Reception\n\n##Box office\n\nDon't Worry Darling grossed over $87 million worldwide, with a domestic total of $45 million. The film performed well in its opening weekend, debuting at number one at the box office.\n\n##Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Pugh's performance and Wilde's direction. The film holds a 78% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 52 reviews.\n\n##Accolades\n\nDon't Worry Darling received several awards and nominations, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress for Pugh.\n\n#Notes\n\nDon't Worry Darling is Olivia Wilde's second feature film as a director, following her 2019 film Booksmart. The film's title is a reference to the 1950s phrase \"don't worry, darling,\" which was often used to placate women and dismiss their concerns.\n\n#References\n\n#External links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Don't_Worry_Darling\" following this outline:\n\n#Plot\n#Cast\n#Production\n##Development and writing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Alleged conflicts on set\n###Wilde and LaBeouf\n###Wilde and Pugh\n#Marketing\n#Release\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n##Accolades\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The season marks the return of the XFL after a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league has undergone significant changes, including new ownership, teams, and rules.\n\n# Background\n\nThe XFL was originally founded in 2001 by WWE owner Vince McMahon but folded after one season. In 2018, McMahon revived the league, and the 2020 season was played before being cut short due to the pandemic. In 2022, the league was sold to a new ownership group, led by Dany Garcia, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, and Gerry Cardinale. The new ownership group has made significant changes to the league, including the addition of new teams and a revamped business model.\n\n# Teams\n\nThe 2023 XFL season features eight teams, divided into two divisions. The teams are:\n\n* Arlington Renegades\n* Houston Roughnecks\n* Orlando Guardians\n* San Antonio Brahmas\n* Seattle Sea Dragons\n* St. Louis Battlehawks\n* Vegas Vipers\n* DC Defenders\n\n# Players\n\n## Draft\n\nThe XFL held a draft in November 2022 to fill out the rosters of the eight teams. The draft consisted of 20 rounds, with each team selecting one player per round. The draft was conducted via a snake-style format, with the order of the teams rotating each round.\n\n## Compensation\n\nPlayers in the XFL are paid a weekly salary of $5,000, with the potential to earn more through bonuses and incentives. The league also provides players with medical insurance, housing, and meal allowances.\n\n## Player movement\n\nThe XFL allows teams to make roster moves during the season, including signing free agents and making trades. Teams are also allowed to place players on injured reserve and sign replacement players.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nThe XFL has partnered with several organizations to provide opportunities for players to develop their skills and advance their careers.\n\n### Indoor Football League\n\nThe XFL has a partnership with the Indoor Football League (IFL), which allows players to be assigned to IFL teams during the XFL offseason. This partnership provides players with the opportunity to continue playing and developing their skills during the XFL offseason.\n\n### NFL Alumni Academy\n\nThe XFL has also partnered with the NFL Alumni Academy, which provides players with training and development opportunities during the XFL offseason. The NFL Alumni Academy is a program designed to help players transition to the NFL.\n\n## Notable players\n\n* PJ Walker, quarterback for the Houston Roughnecks, who played in the NFL for the Carolina Panthers\n* Martavis Bryant, wide receiver for the Vegas Vipers, who played in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders\n* Antonio Callaway, wide receiver for the Seattle Sea Dragons, who played in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns\n\n# Coaches\n\n## Coaching changes\n\nThere were several coaching changes during the 2023 XFL season.

The storm brought severe weather conditions to several islands in the region, including Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Mawar was a significant weather event that caused widespread damage and disruption to daily life in the affected areas.\n\n# Meteorological history\n\nTyphoon Mawar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first identified by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on May 20, 2023. The system was located approximately 500 miles (800 km) southeast of Guam at the time. Over the next few days, the disturbance gradually intensified, fueled by warm ocean waters and low wind shear.\n\nOn May 22, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit later that day. The depression continued to strengthen, and on May 23, the JMA classified it as a tropical storm, assigning the name Mawar.\n\nMawar rapidly intensified over the next 24 hours, becoming a typhoon on May 24. The storm's maximum sustained winds increased to 120 miles per hour (195 km/h), with gusts reaching up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h). Mawar's eye became well-defined, and the storm's overall structure improved significantly.\n\nAs Mawar approached the Mariana Islands, it began to slow down, allowing it to maintain its strength for an extended period. The storm passed close to Guam on May 25, bringing severe weather conditions to the island. Mawar then turned northwestward, moving towards the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n# Preparations\n\n## Mariana Islands\n\nIn anticipation of Mawar's arrival, the Governor of Guam declared a state of emergency on May 23. The Guam National Guard was activated, and evacuation centers were set up across the island. Residents were advised to stock up on food, water, and other essential supplies.\n\nIn the Northern Mariana Islands, the government issued a typhoon warning on May 24, urging residents to seek shelter immediately. Schools and government offices were closed, and all commercial flights were canceled.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn Japan, the JMA issued a high-seas warning for the waters surrounding the country, advising ships to take necessary precautions. The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau also issued a marine warning, warning of strong winds and rough seas.\n\n# Impact and aftermath\n\n## Guam\n\nTyphoon Mawar brought severe weather conditions to Guam, including sustained winds of up to 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) and heavy rainfall. The storm caused widespread power outages, with over 10,000 households left without electricity.\n\nThe Guam Memorial Hospital reported several injuries, including a few cases of storm-related trauma. The hospital's emergency room was filled to capacity, with many patients seeking treatment for cuts, bruises, and other minor injuries.\n\nThe island's infrastructure suffered significant damage, with several roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. The Guam International Airport was closed, and all flights were canceled.\n\n## Northern Mariana Islands\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands were also severely affected by Mawar, with the storm bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands reported widespread power outages, with over 5,000 households left without electricity.\n\nThe islands' infrastructure suffered significant damage, with several roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. The Saipan International Airport was closed, and all flights were canceled.\n\n## Elsewhere\n\nIn Japan, the strong winds and rough seas caused by Mawar resulted in several injuries and over 100 people being rescued from the sea. The country's transportation network was severely disrupted, with many flights and trains canceled.\n\nIn Taiwan, the strong winds and heavy rainfall caused by Mawar resulted in several injuries and over 10,000 households left without power. The country's transportation network was severely disrupted, with many flights and trains canceled.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of typhoons in Guam\n* List of typhoons in the Northern Mariana Islands\n* 2023 Pacific typhoon season\n\n# References\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*\n\n# External links\n\n*Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as per the requirements*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Typhoon_Mawar\" following this outline:\n\n#Meteorological history\n#Preparations\n##Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#Impact and aftermath\n##Guam\n##Northern Mariana Islands\n##Elsewhere\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The election was held to elect the President of India, who serves as the head of state and the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces. The presidential election is an indirect election, where the president is elected by the members of the Electoral College consisting of elected members of both houses of parliament and the legislative assemblies of the states.\n\n# Electoral System\n\nThe Indian presidential election follows a single transferable vote system, where each member of the Electoral College casts a secret ballot. The election is conducted by the Election Commission of India, an autonomous and impartial constitutional body. The commission ensures the integrity and fairness of the electoral process.\n\nIn the single transferable vote system, each elector ranks the candidates in order of preference. The first preference votes are counted first, and if no candidate has a majority, the second preference votes are counted, and so on. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the remaining candidates. This process continues until a candidate reaches the required majority.\n\n# Election Schedule\n\nThe Election Commission of India announced the schedule for the presidential election on June 9, 2022. The notification for the election was issued on June 15, 2022, and the last date for filing nominations was June 29, 2022.

The vote value of a member of parliament is 708, while the vote value of a member of a state legislative assembly varies depending on the population of the state. The total vote value of the Electoral College is 1,098,903.\n\n# Party-wise Vote (Projection)\n\nBased on the party affiliations of the members of the Electoral College, the projected vote share of the major parties is:\n\n* National Democratic Alliance (NDA): 53.4%\n* United Opposition (India): 44.6%\n* Others: 2%\n\n# Candidates\n\n## National Democratic Alliance\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) nominated Droupadi Murmu, the Governor of Jharkhand, as its candidate for the presidential election.\n\n## United Opposition (India)\n\nThe United Opposition (India) nominated Yashwant Sinha, a former Union Minister, as its candidate for the presidential election.\n\n# Potential Candidates\n\nSeveral other potential candidates were speculated to be in the running for the presidential election, including:\n\n* Draupadi Murmu (NDA)\n* Yashwant Sinha (United Opposition)\n* Sharad Pawar (NCP)\n* Farooq Abdullah (NC)\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the presidential election was marked by a low-key affair, with both candidates focusing on canvassing support from the members of the Electoral College. The NDA candidate, Droupadi Murmu, campaigned extensively across the country, meeting with members of parliament and state legislative assemblies. The United Opposition candidate, Yashwant Sinha, also campaigned actively, highlighting his experience and credentials as a former Union Minister.\n\n# Controversy\n\nThe presidential election was marred by controversy, with several opposition parties alleging that the NDA candidate, Droupadi Murmu, was a \"weak\" candidate. The opposition parties also questioned her experience and credentials, claiming that she was not suitable for the high office of the President.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the presidential election were announced on July 21, 2022. Droupadi Murmu, the NDA candidate, won the election with a majority of the votes. The results were as follows:\n\n## Breakdown\n\n* Droupadi Murmu (NDA): 1,078,839 votes (68.6%)\n* Yashwant Sinha (United Opposition): 354,775 votes (28.4%)\n* Others: 34,289 votes (2.2%)\n\n# Reactions\n\nThe results of the presidential election were widely welcomed, with both the NDA and the United Opposition congratulating the winner, Droupadi Murmu.

From the earliest days of the Roman Republic to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, millions of people were enslaved, with estimates suggesting that slaves made up around 15-20% of the Roman Empire's population.\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\nThe origins of slavery in ancient Rome date back to the 8th century BC, when the city was still in its early stages of development. During this period, the Romans engaged in wars with neighboring cities and tribes, capturing prisoners who were then sold into slavery. As the Roman Republic expanded, so did the practice of slavery, with the number of slaves increasing significantly during the Punic Wars.\n\nEnslavement of Roman citizens\n-----------------------------\n\nAlthough rare, Roman citizens could be enslaved under certain circumstances. For example, if a citizen was unable to pay their debts, they could be forced into debt slavery, a practice known as \"nexum.\" Additionally, if a citizen was convicted of a crime, they could be sentenced to slavery as a form of punishment.\n\nThe slave in Roman law and society\n---------------------------------\n\nIn Roman law, slaves were considered property, with their owners holding complete control over their lives. Slaves were denied the rights and privileges granted to Roman citizens, including the right to vote, own property, and enter into contracts.\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nSlaves were not allowed to form legally recognized marriages or families. However, many slaves did form long-term relationships and had children, who were also born into slavery.\n\n### Peculium\n\nSlaves were often given a small amount of money, known as \"peculium,\" which they could use to purchase their freedom or improve their living conditions.\n\n### Manumission\n\nSlaves could be freed through a process known as \"manumission,\" which involved a formal declaration of freedom by their owner. Freed slaves, known as \"liberti,\" were granted Roman citizenship but still owed their former owners a certain degree of loyalty and respect.\n\n### Freedmen\n\nFreedmen played an important role in Roman society, often becoming successful businessmen, politicians, or artists. However, they were still stigmatized by their former status as slaves and were often excluded from certain social and cultural institutions.\n\n### Dediticii\n\n\"Dediticii\" were slaves who had been captured in war and were considered to be of inferior status to other slaves. They were often forced to work in harsh conditions and were denied the opportunity to purchase their freedom.\n\nCauses of enslavement\n---------------------\n\nThere were several ways in which people became enslaved in ancient Rome.\n\n### War captives\n\nWar captives were the most common source of slaves in ancient Rome. Prisoners of war were often sold into slavery, with the Roman army receiving a significant portion of the profits.\n\n#### Captivi in Roman culture\n\nCaptivi were often depicted in Roman art and literature as symbols of Roman power and dominance.\n\n### Piracy and kidnapping\n\nPiracy and kidnapping were also common ways in which people were enslaved. Pirates would often capture people and sell them into slavery, while kidnappers would target vulnerable individuals, such as children and women.\n\n### Vernae\n\n\"Vernae\" were slaves who were born into slavery, often the children of slave parents.\n\n#### Alumni\n\n\"Alumni\" were slaves who were raised by their owners from childhood. They were often given more privileges and responsibilities than other slaves.\n\n### Child labor\n\nChild labor was common in ancient Rome, with children as young as six or seven years old being forced to work in various industries.\n\n#### Child abandonment\n\nChild abandonme", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Enslavement of Roman citizens\n#The slave in Roman law and society\n##Marriage and family\n##Peculium\n##Manumission\n##Freedmen\n##Dediticii\n#Causes of enslavement\n##War captives\n###Captivi in Roman culture\n##Piracy and kidnapping\n##Vernae\n###Alumni\n##Child labor\n###Child abandonment\n###Infant exposure\n###Parental sale\n##Debt slavery\n##Self-sales\n#The slave economy\n##The slave trade\n###Auctions and sales\n###Slave-traders\n###Taxes and tariffs\n##Types of work\n###Household slaves\n###Urban crafts and services\n###Agriculture\n###Hard labor\n###Public and imperial slaves\n###Business managers and agents\n###Gladiators, entertainers, and prostitutes\n##Serfdom\n#Demography\n##Race and ethnicity\n#Quality of life\n##Healthcare\n###Physicians\n##Cicero and Tiro\n##Names\n##Clothing\n#Resistance and control\n##Rebellions\n###First Servile War (135–132 BC)\n###Second Servile War (104–100 BC)\n###Third Servile War (73–71 BC)\n###Later uprisings\n##Fugitive slave-catching\n###The fugitive in Roman culture\n##Punishments\n###Chaining\n###Tattooing and branding\n###Collaring\n###Crucifixion\n##Suicide\n#Slavery and Roman religion\n##Slaves in classical Roman religion\n###Saturnalia\n###The Festival of Handmaids\n##Temple slaves\n##Mithraic cult\n##Early Christian church\n#Commemoration\n#Slavery and Roman morality\n##Stoic philosophy\n##Epicurean philosophy\n##Early Christian attitudes toward slavery\n##Sexual ethics and attitudes\n#In Latin and Imperial Greek literature\n##Roman comedy\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They are well adapted to the harsh, cold climate of these areas and are an important part of the ecosystem and the cultures of indigenous peoples.\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nReindeer are medium-sized deer, typically brown or gray in color, with a distinctive set of antlers and a thick coat of fur. They are herbivores, feeding on a variety of plants, including grasses, leaves, and lichens. Reindeer are also known for their impressive migrations, which can be hundreds of miles long.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nReindeer are listed as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, as well as hunting and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect reindeer habitats and reduce human impact on their populations.\n\nNaming\n------\n\nThe term \"reindeer\" is often used to refer to the species as a whole, while \"caribou\" is used specifically to refer to the North American subspecies. The name \"reindeer\" is derived from the Old Norse word \"hreinn,\" which referred to the species. The name \"caribou\" comes from the French-Canadian word \"caribou,\" which is derived from the Mi'kmaq word \"kalibu,\" meaning \"shoveler\" or \"digger.\"\n\nEvolution\n----------\n\nReindeer evolved from a common ancestor with other deer species during the Pleistocene era. Fossil records indicate that reindeer were present in the Arctic region as far back as 2 million years ago. Over time, reindeer adapted to the harsh Arctic climate, developing specialized physical characteristics, such as their thick coats and antlers.\n\nTaxonomy\n----------\n\n### Naming and research on museum collections\n\nReindeer were first described by the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carolus Linnaeus in 1758. Since then, numerous studies have been conducted on museum collections and in the field to better understand the taxonomy of reindeer. Research has identified several subspecies, which are often distinguished by their physical characteristics and geographic range.\n\n### Biological exploration expeditions\n\nBiological exploration expeditions have played a crucial role in the discovery and description of new reindeer subspecies. These expeditions have taken scientists to remote and inhospitable regions, where they have been able to study reindeer in their natural habitats.\n\n### Reclassification\n\nRecent studies have led to the reclassification of some reindeer subspecies. For example, the Svalbard reindeer, previously considered a separate species, is now considered a subspecies of the North Atlantic reindeer.\n\n#### Ecotypes\n\nReindeer can be divided into several ecotypes, which are adapted to different environments and habitats. For example, the Arctic reindeer is well adapted to the harsh, cold climate of the Arctic tundra, while the boreal woodland caribou is adapted to the forests and woodlands of northern North America.\n\n#### Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n\nGenetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence have all been used to study the evolution and taxonomy of reindeer. These studies have provided valuable insights into the history and diversity of reindeer populations.\n\n#### Novel genetics-based clades\n\nRecent studies have identified new genetics-based clades within the reindeer species. These clades are based on genetic differences between populations and provide a new framework for understanding the taxonomy of reindeer.\n\nSpecies and subspecies\n----------------------\n\nThere are several recognized species and subspecies of reindeer, including:\n\n* Rangifer tarandus (North Atlantic reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus caribou (North American caribou)\n* Rangifer tarandus sibiricus (Siberian reindeer)\n* Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus (Svalbard reindeer)\n\nPhysical characteristics\n----------------------\n\nReindeer are characterized by several distinctive physical features, including:\n\n### Antlers\n\nReindeer are known for their impressive antlers, which are grown by both males and females. Antlers are used for defense, intimidation, and attracting mates.\n\n### Pelt\n\nReindeer have a thick, insulating coat of fur, which helps to keep them warm in cold temperatures. The pelt is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer.\n\n### Heat exchange\n\nReindeer have a specialized heat exchange system, which helps to conserve heat in cold temperatures. This system involves a network of blood vessels in the nose and mouth, which helps to warm the air before it reaches the lungs.\n\n### Hooves\n\nReindeer have specialized hooves, which are adapted to the snow and ice of the Arctic environment. The hooves are made of a hard, keratin-based material and are shaped like a crescent moon.\n\n### Size\n\nReindeer vary in size, depending on the subspecies. The largest reindeer, the Svalbard reindeer, can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb), while the smallest, the Peary caribou, weighs around 100 kg (220 lb).\n\n### Clicking sound\n\nReindeer make a distinctive clicking sound, which is used for communication. The sound is made by the hooves clicking on the ground.\n\n### Eyes\n\nReindeer have large, expressive eyes, which are adapted to the low light levels of the Arctic environment. The eyes are also highly sensitive to movement, which helps the reindeer to detect predators.\n\nBiology and behaviors\n----------------------\n\nReindeer are well adapted to the harsh, cold climate of the Arctic environment. They have several specialized biological features, which help them to survive in this environment.\n\n### Seasonal body composition\n\nReindeer have a seasonal body composition, which helps them to conserve energy during the winter months. During the summer, the reindeer eat as much as possible to build up their fat reserves, which are then used to sustain them during the winter.\n\n### Reproduction and life cycle\n\nReindeer have a relatively short reproductive cycle, with a gestation period of around 230 days. The females give birth to a single calf, which is born with a thick coat of fur and can walk within the first hour of birth.\n\n### Social structure, migration and range\n\nReindeer are social animals, which live in large herds. The herds are typically led by a dominant female, which helps to guide the group during their migrations. Reindeer migrate to different areas depending on the season, with some populations traveling hundreds of miles each year.\n\nEcology\n--------\n\nReindeer play a crucial role in the ecosystem of the Arctic environment. They are an important food source for many predators, including wolves, bears, and owls.\n\n### Distribution and habitat\n\nReindeer are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. They live in a variety of habitats, including tundra, forests, and mountains.\n\n### Diet\n\nReindeer are herbivores, which feed on a variety of plants, including grasses, leaves, and lichens. They also eat mosses, fungi, and other vegetation.\n\n### Predators\n\nReindeer have several predators, including wolves, bears, and owls. They also compete with other herbivores, such as musk oxen and arctic hares, for food and resources.\n\n### Other threats\n\nReindeer are threatened by several other factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and hunting. Climate change is altering the distribution and abundance of reindeer food sources, while habitat loss is reducing the available habitat for reindeer.\n\nConservation\n------------\n\nReindeer are listed as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, as well as hunting and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect reindeer habitats and reduce human impact on their populations.\n\n### Current status\n\nReindeer populations are declining in many areas, due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect reindeer habitats and reduce human impact on their populations.\n\n### Boreal woodland caribou\n\nThe boreal woodland caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the forests and woodlands of northern North America. This subspecies is listed as \"Threatened\" under the US Endangered Species Act, due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and climate change.\n\n### Peary caribou\n\nThe Peary caribou is a subspecies of reindeer that is found in the Arctic tundra of northern Canada and Alaska. This subspecies is listed as \"Endangered\" under the US Endangered Species Act, due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and climate change.\n\nRelationship with humans\n----------------------\n\nReindeer have a long history of interaction with humans, dating back thousands of years. They are an important part of the culture and economy of many indigenous communities.\n\n### Indigenous North Americans\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous North Americans for thousands of years. They are hunted for their meat, hides, and antlers, and are also used for transportation and clothing.\n\n### Indigenous Eurasians\n\nReindeer have been an important part of the culture and economy of indigenous Eurasians for thousands of years. They are hunted for their meat, hides, and antlers, and are also used for transportation and clothing.\n\n### Husbandry\n\nReindeer husbandry is a traditional practice in many indigenous communities, where reindeer are raised for their meat, hides, and antlers. This practice is an important part of the culture and economy of many communities.\n\n### History\n\nReindeer have a long history of interaction with humans, dating back thousands of years. They were first domesticated in Siberia around 3000 BCE, and were later introduced to other parts of the world.\n\n### Santa Claus\n\nReindeer are often associated with Santa Claus, who is said to use them to pull his sleigh on Christmas Eve. This tradition is thought to have originated in 19th-century America, where reindeer were seen as a symbol of Christmas.\n\n### Mythology and art\n\nReindeer have appeared in the mythology and art of many cultures, including the indigenous peoples of North America and Eurasia. They are often depicted as powerful and majestic creatures, with a deep connection to the natural world.\n\n### Heraldry and symbols\n\nReindeer have been used as symbols and emblems in heraldry and other forms of symbolism. They are often seen as a symbol of strength, endurance, and adaptability.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Caribou\n* Reindeer herding\n* Sami people\n* Inuit\n* Arctic\n* Subarctic\n* Tundra\n* Forest\n* Mountain\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\nExternal links\n---------------\n\nCaribou-specific links (North America)\n------------------------------------\n\n* Caribou Conservation Breeding Program\n* Boreal Woodland Caribou Conservation Plan\n* Peary Caribou Conservation Plan", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Reindeer\" following this outline:\n\n#Description\n#Status\n#Naming\n#Evolution\n#Taxonomy\n##Naming and research on museum collections\n##Biological exploration expeditions\n##Reclassification\n###Ecotypes\n###Genetic, molecular, and archaeological evidence\n###Novel genetics-based clades\n#Species and subspecies\n#Physical characteristics\n##Antlers\n##Pelt\n##Heat exchange\n##Hooves\n##Size\n##Clicking sound\n##Eyes\n#Biology and behaviors\n##Seasonal body composition\n##Reproduction and life cycle\n##Social structure, migration and range\n#Ecology\n##Distribution and habitat\n##Diet\n##Predators\n##Other threats\n#Conservation\n##Current status\n##Boreal woodland caribou\n##Peary caribou\n#Relationship with humans\n##Indigenous North Americans\n##Indigenous Eurasians\n##Husbandry\n##History\n##Santa Claus\n##Mythology and art\n##Heraldry and symbols\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n##Caribou-specific links (North America)\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The system's prolonged existence and repeated intensifications made it one of the most significant cyclones of the 2022-23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.\n\n# Formation and Intensification\n\n## Genesis and Early Development\n\nCyclone Freddy originated from a tropical disturbance that formed on February 4, 2023, approximately 1,000 km (620 miles) north of the Mascarene Islands. The system gradually organized, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on February 5. The Mauritius Meteorological Service (MMS) declared the system a tropical depression on February 6.\n\n## Rapid Intensification\n\nFreddy rapidly intensified into a tropical storm on February 7, with sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The storm continued to strengthen, reaching cyclone status on February 8, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Freddy's intensification was fueled by favorable environmental conditions, including low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.\n\n## Peak Intensity\n\nOn February 10, Freddy reached its initial peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h (135 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 935 hPa (27.61 inHg). The cyclone's eye was well-defined, with a diameter of approximately 20 km (12 miles).\n\n# The Mascarene Islands, Madagascar, and Mozambique\n\n## Impact on the Mascarene Islands\n\nFreddy passed close to the Mascarene Islands, particularly Mauritius and Réunion, on February 10-11.

Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. It is a self-described spiritual movement that aims to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement through its techniques and principles. However, the movement has been the subject of controversy and criticism, with many questioning its legitimacy as a religion and its treatment of its members.\n\nDefinition and Classification\n-----------------------------\n\nScientology is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been difficult to define and classify. While its adherents describe it as a spiritual movement, critics have labeled it as a cult, a business, or a form of psychotherapy.\n\n### Debates over Classification\n\nThe classification of Scientology as a religion has been a subject of debate among scholars, governments, and the general public. While some countries, such as the United States, have recognized Scientology as a tax-exempt religion, others, such as Germany and France, have refused to do so, viewing it as a cult or a business.\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"Scientology\" was coined by Hubbard in 1952, combining the Latin words \"scientia\" (knowledge) and \"logos\" (study). Hubbard described Scientology as a \"science of knowledge\" that aimed to help individuals understand themselves and the world around them.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nScientology has its roots in Hubbard's earlier work in the field of science fiction and his development of the self-help system known as Dianetics. In the 1940s and 1950s, Hubbard wrote several science fiction novels and short stories, including the influential novel \"Fear,\" which explored themes of psychology, philosophy, and spirituality.\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard published his book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,\" which introduced his concept of the \"reactive mind\" and the \"auditing\" process. The book was a commercial success, and Hubbard soon established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation to promote his ideas.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hubbard began to develop the principles and practices of Scientology, which he described as an extension of Dianetics. In 1954, he established the first Church of Scientology in Los Angeles, and the movement quickly gained popularity in the United States and other countries.\n\nBeliefs and Practices\n--------------------\n\nScientology is based on a complex set of beliefs and practices that aim to help individuals achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement.\n\n### Auditing\n\nAt the core of Scientology is the practice of auditing, which involves a one-on-one session between a trained auditor and a preclear (PC). The auditor uses a device called an E-meter to measure the PC's spiritual state and help them overcome past traumas and negative experiences.\n\n### Soul\n\nIn Scientology, the soul is known as the \"thetan,\" which is believed to be an immortal spiritual being that has lived many past lives. The thetan is seen as the true self, and the goal of Scientology is to help the individual rediscover their true nature and achieve spiritual freedom.\n\n### Space Opera and the Wall of Fire\n\nScientology's teachings include a complex and elaborate cosmology, which describes the origins of the universe and the nature of the thetan. According to Hubbard, 75 million years ago, an evil galactic overlord named Xenu brought billions of aliens to Earth, stacked them around volcanoes, and blew them up with hydrogen bombs. The thetans were then trapped on Earth and forced to watch a 3D movie that implanted false memories and ideas into their minds. This event is known as the \"Wall of Fire,\" and it is seen as the source of all human suffering and negativity.\n\n### The Operating Thetan levels\n\nScientologists believe that by progressing through a series of levels, known as the Operating Thetan (OT) levels, they can achieve spiritual enlightenment and superhuman abilities. The OT levels involve a series of confidential teachings and auditing procedures that are only revealed to those who have reached a certain level of spiritual advancement.\n\n### Ethics\n\nScientology has a strict code of ethics, which emphasizes the importance of honesty, integrity, and responsibility. Scientologists are expected to adhere to a set of moral principles, known as the \"Scientology Code of Honor,\" which includes the promise to \"never desert a comrade in need, or refuse to help a fellow man in danger.\"\n\n### Symbology\n\nScientology uses a unique set of symbols and logos, which are meant to represent the movement's spiritual principles and values. The most iconic symbol of Scientology is the eight-pointed cross, which is seen as a representation of the eight dynamics of life.\n\n### Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychosis\n\nScientology is highly critical of psychiatry and psychology, which it views as pseudosciences that seek to control and manipulate individuals. Hubbard believed that psychiatry and psychology were responsible for many social ills, including crime, violence, and mental illness.\n\n### Views on Hubbard\n\nScientologists view Hubbard as a spiritual leader and a visionary, who has helped millions of people achieve spiritual enlightenment and self-improvement. Hubbard's writings and teachings are seen as sacred scripture, and his legacy continues to shape the movement's beliefs and practices.\n\nThe Church of Scientology\n-------------------------\n\nThe Church of Scientology is the main organization that promotes and practices Scientology. The church has a complex internal structure, with a network of local organizations, missions, and groups around the world.\n\n### Internal Organization\n\nThe Church of Scientology is headed by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), which is responsible for overseeing the movement's spiritual and administrative affairs. The RTC is led by a board of directors, which includes high-ranking Scientologists who have achieved advanced spiritual levels.\n\n### Promotional Material\n\nThe Church of Scientology produces a wide range of promotional materials, including books, videos, and online content. These materials are designed to introduce people to Scientology and its principles, and to encourage them to join the movement.\n\n### Social Outreach\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a number of social outreach programs, which aim to help people in need and promote social justice. These programs include the Volunteer Ministers, who provide disaster relief and community service, and the Criminon program, which helps prisoners and ex-offenders.\n\n### Responses to Opponents\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for being highly litigious and aggressive in its responses to critics and opponents. The church has been involved in numerous lawsuits and public controversies over the years, including high-profile cases against former members and journalists.\n\n### Suppressive Persons and Fair Game\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a policy of labeling critics and opponents as \"suppressive persons,\" who are seen as a threat to the movement's spiritual and social goals. Suppressive persons are subject to a policy known as \"fair game,\" which allows Scientologists to use any means necessary to discredit and harass them.\n\nFree Zone and Independent Scientology\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn recent years, a number of former Scientologists have established their own independent Scientology groups, which are not affiliated with the Church of Scientology. These groups, known as the \"Free Zone,\" offer alternative versions of Scientology's teachings and practices.\n\nControversies\n-------------\n\nScientology has been the subject of numerous controversies over the years, including allegations of financial exploitation, emotional abuse, and human rights violations.\n\n### Hubbard's Motives\n\nMany critics have questioned Hubbard's motives for creating Scientology, suggesting that he was driven by a desire for wealth, power, and fame.\n\n### Criminal Behavior\n\nThe Church of Scientology has been involved in numerous criminal activities over the years, including tax evasion, espionage, and harassment of critics.\n\n### Organized Harassment\n\nThe Church of Scientology has a reputation for using organized harassment and intimidation tactics against its critics and opponents. This has included the use of private investigators, lawsuits, and public smear campaigns.\n\n### Mistreatment of Members\n\nThere have been numerous allegations of mistreatment of members within the Church of Scientology, including physical and emotional abuse, financial exploitation, and forced labor.\n\n### Violation of Auditin", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scientology\" following this outline:\n\n#Definition and classification\n##Debates over classification\n##Etymology\n#History\n#Beliefs and practices\n##Auditing\n##Soul\n##Space opera and the Wall of Fire\n##The Operating Thetan levels\n##Ethics\n##Symbology\n##Psychiatry, psychology, psychosis\n##Views on Hubbard\n#The Church of Scientology\n##Internal organization\n##Promotional material\n##Social outreach\n##Responses to opponents\n##Suppressive persons and fair game\n#Free Zone and independent Scientology\n#Controversies\n##Hubbard's motives\n##Criminal behavior\n##Organized harassment\n###Mistreatment of Members\n##Violation of auditing confidentiality\n##Allegations of coerced abortions\n##Allegation of human trafficking and other crimes against women\n##Scientology, litigation, and the Internet\n#Disputes over legal status\n#Scientology in religious studies\n##Influences\n#Demographics\n##Recruitment\n#Reception and influence\n##Media, popular culture, and academia\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a prominent figure in the fight against antisemitism in Romania during the interwar period and a key player in the country's Zionist movement. Benvenisti's life and career were marked by his tireless advocacy for Jewish rights, his struggles against anti-Jewish persecution, and his later involvement with the Romanian Communist Party.\n\n# Biography\n\n## Early life and career\n\nMișu Benvenisti was born in 1902 in Fălticeni, a small town in northeastern Romania. His family was part of the local Jewish community, which had a long history of settlement in the region. Benvenisti's early life was marked by a strong sense of Jewish identity and a commitment to social justice. He pursued his education in law, graduating from the University of Iași in 1924.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Benvenisti began his career as a lawyer in Iași, quickly gaining a reputation as a skilled and dedicated advocate. He became involved in local politics, joining the Romanian Zionist movement and working to promote Jewish rights and interests. Benvenisti's activism and advocacy soon earned him recognition and respect within the Jewish community, and he became a leading figure in the fight against antisemitism in Romania.\n\n## Fighting antisemitism\n\nDuring the interwar period, Romania experienced a significant rise in antisemitic sentiment and violence. Benvenisti was at the forefront of efforts to combat this trend, using his skills as a lawyer to defend Jewish victims of persecution and his platform as a politician to speak out against anti-Jewish discrimination.\n\nBenvenisti's work in this area was marked by his tireless advocacy and his willingness to take on difficult cases. He was a vocal critic of anti-Jewish laws and policies, and he worked to raise awareness about the impact of antisemitism on the Jewish community. Benvenisti's efforts helped to bring attention to the issue and to mobilize support for Jewish rights, both within Romania and internationally.\n\n## Against Richter\n\nOne of Benvenisti's most notable cases was his defense of a group of Jewish students who were accused of assault by a Romanian nationalist named Nicolae Richter. The case was widely publicized, and it became a rallying cry for the Zionist movement and the fight against antisemitism.\n\nBenvenisti's defense of the students was marked by his skillful use of the law and his passionate advocacy. He argued that the charges against the students were baseless and motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice. The case ultimately ended in acquittal, but it had a lasting impact on the Jewish community and on Benvenisti's own career.\n\n## HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n\nIn 1936, Benvenisti became involved in the HeHalutz trial, a highly publicized case involving a group of Jewish youth who were accused of creating a paramilitary organization. The trial was widely seen as a test of the Romanian government's commitment to Jewish rights, and it became a major rallying cry for the Zionist movement.\n\nBenvenisti's involvement in the trial was marked by his passionate advocacy on behalf of the defendants. He argued that the charges against them were baseless and motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice. The trial ultimately ended in conviction, but it had a lasting impact on the Jewish community and on Benvenisti's own career.\n\nThe trial marked a turning point in Benvenisti's relationship with the Romanian government. He became increasingly marginalized and isolated, and he faced growing opposition from anti-Jewish elements within the government and society.\n\n## Communist turn\n\nIn the late 1930s, Benvenisti began to move towards the Romanian Communist Party. He was attracted by the party's commitment to social justice and its opposition to fascism and antisemitism. Benvenisti's turn towards communism was marked by his growing disillusionment with the Zionist movement and his increasing sense of isolation within the Jewish community.\n\nBenvenisti's involvement with the Communist Party was marked by his enthusiasm and his commitment. He became a vocal advocate for the party's policies and a defender of its ideology. Benvenisti's turn towards communism was seen as a betrayal by some within the Jewish community, but it was also seen as a pragmatic move by others.\n\n## Zionist ban\n\nIn 1940, the Romanian government banned the Zionist movement, citing its alleged links to communism and its supposed threat to national security. The ban was a major blow to the Jewish community, and it marked a significant turning point in Benvenisti's career.\n\nBenvenisti was a vocal critic of the ban, and he argued that it was motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice. He continued to advocate for Jewish rights, but he did so in increasingly difficult circumstances.\n\n## Communist imprisonment and release\n\nIn 1942, Benvenisti was arrested by the Romanian authorities and imprisoned on charges of communist activity. He was held in prison for several years, during which time he was subjected to harsh treatment and interrogation.\n\nBenvenisti was released from prison in 1944, after the Romanian government was overthrown and the country switched sides in the war. He emerged from prison a broken man, but he continued to advocate for Jewish rights and social justice.\n\n# Notes\n\nMișu Benvenisti's life and career were marked by his tireless advocacy for Jewish rights, his struggles against anti-Jewish persecution, and his later involvement with the Romanian Communist Party. His legacy is complex and multifaceted, and it continues to be felt within the Jewish community and beyond.\n\n# References", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mișu_Benvenisti\" following this outline:\n\n#Biography\n##Early life and career\n##Fighting antisemitism\n##Against Richter\n##HeHalutz trial and marginalization\n##Communist turn\n##Zionist ban\n##Communist imprisonment and release\n#Notes\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The derailment involved a Norfolk Southern Railway freight train carrying hazardous materials, resulting in a large fire, environmental concerns, and a significant impact on the local community.\n\n#Background\n\nEast Palestine is a small town in Columbiana County, Ohio, with a population of approximately 4,700 people. The town is located near the Pennsylvania border, about 20 miles southeast of Youngstown. The Norfolk Southern Railway runs through the town, and the derailment occurred on a section of track near the intersection of Main Street and Park Avenue.\n\n#Derailment\n\nOn February 3, 2023, at approximately 8:54 p.m. local time, a Norfolk Southern Railway freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. The train, which consisted of 151 cars, was traveling from Illinois to Pennsylvania when it derailed. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation. The derailment resulted in a large fire, with several cars carrying hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether.\n\n#Emergency Response and Burn Off\n\nEmergency responders were quickly dispatched to the scene, and a large response effort was undertaken. The fire was allowed to burn for several days, with responders working to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading. On February 6, 2023, a controlled burn of the remaining hazardous materials was conducted. The burn off, also known as a \"vent and burn,\" was intended to safely dispose of the remaining hazardous materials.\n\n##Burnoff Unnecessary\n\nSome experts have questioned the necessity of the burn off, suggesting that it may have been unnecessary and potentially harmful to the environment and public health. The burn off released large quantities of toxic chemicals into the air, including dioxins and furans, which are known to be carcinogenic.\n\n#Health and Environmental Concerns\n\nThe derailment and subsequent burn off have raised significant concerns about the impact on public health and the environment. Residents in the surrounding area have reported symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and respiratory problems. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been monitoring air and water quality in the area, and some contaminants have been detected.\n\n##Waste Disposal\n\nThe derailment has also raised concerns about waste disposal. The hazardous materials involved in the derailment require special handling and disposal. The EPA has been working with Norfolk Southern to ensure that the waste is disposed of properly.\n\n##Independent Testing\n\nSome residents have called for independent testing of the air and water quality in the area. The Ohio EPA has been conducting its own testing, but some residents have expressed concerns that the testing may not be comprehensive enough.\n\n##Whistleblower and Cover-up Allegations\n\nA whistleblower has come forward alleging that Norfolk Southern had been aware of potential safety issues with the train's brakes before the derailment. The whistleblower also alleged that the company had attempted to cover up the issue. Norfolk Southern has denied the allegations.\n\n#Aftermath\n\nThe derailment has had a significant impact on the local community. Residents have been displaced, and businesses have been affected. The incident has also raised concerns about the safety of the rail industry and the need for improved regulations.\n\n##Lawsuits and Compensation\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed against Norfolk Southern, seeking compensation for damages and injuries. The company has also established a fund to provide compensation to affected residents.\n\n##NTSB Board Meeting and Findings\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) held a board meeting to discuss the derailment. The NTSB found that the probable cause of the derailment was a broken wheel bearing, which had been undetected by the train's safety systems.\n\n##Federal Railroad Administration Safety Culture Assessment\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) conducted a safety culture assessment of Norfolk Southern. The assessment found that the company had a reactive safety culture, which prioritized on-time performance over safety.\n\n#Inquiry and Cause\n\nThe cause of the derailment is still under investigation. The NTSB has been leading the investigation, with assistance from the FRA and other agencies.\n\n##Hearings\n\nSeveral hearings have been held to investigate the derailment. The hearings have focused on the safety of the rail industry and the need for improved regulations.\n\n##Brakes\n\nThe investigation has also focused on the train's brakes, which were found to be faulty. The NTSB has recommended that the FRA require more frequent brake inspections.\n\n#Reactions\n\nThe derailment has sparked a range of reactions, from concerns about public safety to calls for improved regulations.\n\n##Congress\n\nSeveral members of Congress have called for improved regulations and increased funding for rail safety.\n\n##Misinformation\n\nThere have been reports of misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the derailment. Some have falsely claimed that the derailment was intentional or that it was caused by a cyberattack.\n\n##Comparisons\n\nThe derailment has been compared to other major rail accidents, including the 2013 Lac-Megantic oil train derailment in Canada.\n\n#Subsequent Derailments\n\nThere have been several subsequent derailments in the United States, including a derailment in North Carolina and another in West Virginia.\n\n#See Also\n\n* List of rail accidents in the United States\n* Norfolk Southern Railway\n* Federal Railroad Administration\n* National Transportation Safety Board\n\n#References\n\n*Note: This article does not include citations or references, as per the requirements.*\n\n#Further Reading\n\n* \"East Palestine train derailment: What we know so far\" by CNN\n* \"Ohio train derailment: A timeline of events\" by The New York Times\n* \"The East Palestine train derailment: A disaster waiting to happen\" by The Washington Post\n\n#External Links\n\n* Norfolk Southern Railway website\n* Federal Railroad Administration website\n* National Transportation Safety Board website\n* Ohio Environmental Protection Agency website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"East_Palestine,_Ohio,_train_derailment\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Derailment\n#Emergency response and burn off\n##Burnoff unnecessary\n#Health and environmental concerns\n##Waste disposal\n##Independent testing\n##Whistleblower and cover-up allegations\n#Aftermath\n##Lawsuits and compensation\n##NTSB board meeting and findings\n##Federal Railroad Administration safety culture assessment\n#Inquiry and cause\n##Hearings\n##Brakes\n#Reactions\n##Congress\n##Misinformation\n##Comparisons\n#Subsequent derailments\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the fastest train in India, with a maximum speed of 180 km/h (112 mph). The train was designed and manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, and its introduction marks a significant milestone in India's efforts to modernize its rail network.\n\n#History\n\n##Efforts to increase speed (1960–2016)\n\nIndia's rail network has been in operation since the 19th century, and for many years, the focus was on expanding the network and increasing capacity. However, as the network grew, so did concerns about speed and efficiency. In the 1960s, Indian Railways began exploring ways to increase the speed of its trains, with the introduction of the Rajdhani Express in 1968, which had a maximum speed of 120 km/h (75 mph). Over the years, Indian Railways continued to experiment with new technologies and train designs to increase speed, including the introduction of the Shatabdi Express in 1988, which had a maximum speed of 150 km/h (93 mph).\n\n##Making an indigenous trainset (2016–19)\n\nIn 2016, Indian Railways decided to take a new approach to increasing speed by designing and manufacturing an indigenous trainset. The project, codenamed \"Train 18,\" was undertaken by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai, with the aim of creating a high-speed train that could reach speeds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The project was led by Sudhanshu Mani, a senior railway official, who worked closely with a team of engineers and designers to develop the trainset. The design and manufacturing process took nearly three years, with the first prototype being rolled out in October 2018.\n\n##Introduction and further (2019–present)\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express was officially launched on February 15, 2019, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The train was introduced on the Delhi-Varanasi route, with a journey time of just under eight hours, compared to the previous journey time of around 12 hours. The train has since been introduced on several other routes, including Delhi-Katra and Mumbai-Ahmedabad. Indian Railways plans to introduce more Vande Bharat Express trains in the coming years, with the aim of increasing the frequency and reach of the service.\n\n#Rolling stock\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express consists of 16 coaches, including two executive class coaches, 14 chair car coaches, and two driving cars. The coaches are designed to be lightweight and aerodynamic, with a focus on reducing drag and increasing speed. The train is powered by a 5,600 horsepower electric traction system, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The train has a number of advanced features, including automatic doors, LED lighting, and advanced braking systems.\n\nThe coaches are also equipped with a number of passenger amenities, including comfortable seating, air conditioning, and on-board entertainment systems. The executive class coaches have additional amenities, including reclining seats, adjustable headrests, and complimentary meal service.\n\n#Facilities\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express offers a number of facilities to passengers, including:\n\n* Air conditioning and comfortable seating\n* On-board entertainment systems, including TVs and Wi-Fi\n* Complimentary meal service in executive class\n* Automatic doors and advanced braking systems\n* LED lighting and advanced climate control systems\n\nThe train also has a number of safety features, including:\n\n* Advanced braking systems, including regenerative braking\n* Automatic fire detection and suppression systems\n* CCTV cameras and emergency response systems\n\n#Services\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express operates on several routes, including:\n\n* Delhi-Varanasi: The train was introduced on this route in February 2019, with a journey time of just under eight hours.\n* Delhi-Katra: The train was introduced on this route in October 2019, with a journey time of around six hours.\n* Mumbai-Ahmedabad: The train was introduced on this route in December 2019, with a journey time of around five hours.\n\nIndian Railways plans to introduce more Vande Bharat Express trains in the coming years, with the aim of increasing the frequency and reach of the service.\n\n#See also\n\n* Indian Railways\n* Integral Coach Factory\n* Shatabdi Express\n* Rajdhani Express\n\n#Notes\n\nThe Vande Bharat Express is a significant milestone in India's efforts to modernize its rail network.
